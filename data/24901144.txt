I think the Clojure syntax is way more reasonable, although I appreciate the maturity of tools used with Java.<p>Two things were important to make it &quot;click&quot; for me:<p>1) I realized that &quot;Lisp has many parentheses&quot; actually has it backwards. A Lisp code has about as many parentheses as an equivalent Java code; there is almost a 1:1 relation. It just has less of... unnecessary things. Which results in more &quot;parentheses per square meter&quot;, but from this perspective that is a good thing!<p>2) Some people complain that dense code is more difficult to read. But you don&#x27;t have to turn everything into one-liners! You can format it into just as many lines as the Java code would have, except the lines will be much shorter now, and therefore easier to read. In Java, you don&#x27;t have much freedom with formatting, because a typical statement takes more that half of the screen width, so you are stuck with one long column. Lisp with shorter statements gives you more freedom. You can abuse it to write hard-to-read code. You can also use it to design beautiful code that is easy to read. Also, there is a huge difference in legibility of a code that fits in one screen (so you can see it whole at once) and one that does not; and the Lisp functions are shorter on average.')
