Item(by='AnthonyMouse', descendants=None, kids=[25093178], score=None, time=1605365927, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25090004, text='&gt; You know Apple’s market capitalization is a little over $2 <i>trillion</i> dollars, right?<p>That&#x27;s the issue. Shareholders <i>always</i> want to see growth, but when you&#x27;re that big, how do you do that? There isn&#x27;t much uncaptured customer base left while they&#x27;re charging premium prices, but offering lower-priced macOS&#x2F;iOS devices would cannibalize the margins on existing sales. Solution: Increase the margins on existing sales without changing prices so that profitability increases at the same sales volume.<p>&gt; No matter what AMD does in the short term, they&#x27;re not going to beat the performance per watt of the M1<p>Zen 3 mobile APUs aren&#x27;t out yet, but multiply the performance of the Zen 2-based Ryzen 7 4800U by the 20% gain from Zen 3 and the multi-threaded performance (i.e. the thing power efficiency is relevant to) is already there, and that&#x27;s with Zen 3 on 7nm while Apple is using 5nm.<p>&gt; it&#x27;s also ARM’s architecture vs. x86-64.<p>The architecture is basically irrelevant. ARM architecture devices were traditionally designed to prioritize low power consumption over performance whereas x86-64 devices the opposite, but that isn&#x27;t a characteristic of the ISA, it&#x27;s just the design considerations of the target market.<p>And that distinction is disappearing now that everything is moving toward high core counts where the name of the game is performance per watt, because that&#x27;s how you get more performance into the same power envelope. Epyc 7702 has a 200W TDP but that&#x27;s what allows it to have 64 cores; it&#x27;s only ~3W&#x2F;core.<p>&gt; Apple has scaled A series production for more than a decade and nobody has caught them yet in iPhone&#x2F;iPad performance.<p>Qualcomm never caught Intel&#x2F;AMD either.')
