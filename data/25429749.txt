Right now its processing some of my personal data for fun little personal report, in particular chat data. Since its information I have access to already, I don&#x27;t mind running the program locally. \nWhat I would like to be able to do is run an analysis for anyone and return the little report that I get for myself. Without having access to their data or storing it in the first place. I know with for example oauth scopes, you can grant access, which sort of fits the criteria. But I&#x27;m thinking more exported data from an application, that doesn&#x27;t have delegated access functionality<p>How I envisioned a solution would be some trusted third party takes my analysis script, returns the report and that is it. I never see the underlying data and recieve only one time token to access it.<p>I know it will never be hundred percent leak proof, and there is still a level of user trust, I realise that, but just thinking conceptually, is there any existing service out there, that does such a thing or attempts to offer something similar? Or what would an alternative approach look like?')
