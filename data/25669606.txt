It was a bit of a compromise for me in terms of game performance (I&#x27;d have preferred 144hz over 4K really but less than 4K at this size would be poor). For the first time ever I feel like I always have enough screen space.<p>The big advantage over an ultrawide for me is that I have a lot of vertical space, which is great for code. It&#x27;s basically 4x 1080p displays in a 2x2 grid.')
