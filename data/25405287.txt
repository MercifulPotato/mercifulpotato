I do not know how many of you use Discord here, let alone how many of you are interested in Forth, but if you are interested, feel free to join.<p>They seem to have a channel dedicated to loads of Forth resources that help you learn the language, to dispel any misconceptions, and stuff like that. It is both low-level and high-level stuff, and quite interesting, IMO.<p>If you are into embedded development or even systems programming, you should definitely check it out. :)<p>I heard the owner of the server is planning to make a modern library[1] for the language to make it more appealing to newcomers.<p>[1] I have no idea what it involves. It could even be a web framework for all I know, heh.')
