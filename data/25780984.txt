Cash is often more anonymous than a publicly distributed ledger especially when the recipient and sender addresses are known.  I of course do not support terrorism or funding terrorism, but I do support educating people so they don&#x27;t take a risk they shouldn&#x27;t have in the first place.  Better to donate those funds to a local charity in your community that will provide constructive use for your immediate area.')
