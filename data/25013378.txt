At least at a store, it&#x27;s hard to figure out what hardware is going where, but with a service like amazon, the stuff you buy, the route it takes, is all very well documented. With a military-type budget it wouldn&#x27;t be very hard to replace that device in transit with another, similar device that is full of backdoors and malware.<p>It&#x27;s hard to audit devices. At least with networks the communication aspect is an actual physical phenomenon which can be measured and analyzed.
