I can&#x27;t speak into your future but I do recollect sharing some of your frustrations as a sysadmin of 20 years. k8s felt to me like whack a mole. I was old school. I created relationships with the right people in our datacenters. My team shipped and deployed our own bare metal servers. Ansible was great for deploying VMs. Then came along k8s.<p>I was happy with our freebsd servers doing zfs and nfs. I was a fan of nginx as a proxy server on linux. I got redis. Mongo came and went. It wasn&#x27;t rocket science to put failover services on different hardware and in different datacenters.<p>I would rather have a collection of small parts making up a complex solution than the complexity of k8s.<p>I have gotten a lot of mileage out of freebsd jails and lxc on ubuntu down through the years. I am a fan of containers. I agree with you that people use k8s for deployments which really don&#x27;t need it. Unfortunately this is the world of IT; new toys and, &quot;na, na, I know something you don&#x27;t&quot;.<p>I moved to education as I decided I didn&#x27;t want to be responsible for an IT infrastructure anymore. My new job is equally difficult but does not require the same out of hours headspace as looking after a global network.')
