EPIC can afford such a low rate because they are flush with cash from Fortnite and Unreal Engine dominates the professional game engine market. EPIC are trying to buy their way into the market, if it works then steam and other game stores will have to lower their rates.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s not absurd. People still made apps when the market was a lot smaller. People make apps for android. If revenue is greater than cost, then apps will get made. And a cut like that would remove a lot of competition, so the actual drop in pay wouldn&#x27;t be as extreme.<p>We weren&#x27;t talking about market. We were talking about the revenue split.<p>It was never 90% rate. Apple has had the 30% rate since 2011. Npbody had a problem with the 30% rate back then. Why is it suddenly such an issue?<p>&gt; But okay, what if I said 75% instead? If you get 3x the market share while getting paid 25% of gross revenue, you actually make more money than if you were paid 70% on 1x market share. So there would absolutely be viable apps for some developers. But at the same time, if Apple took a 75% cut that would be unreasonable.<p>If people were happy with the arrangement then it is fine. So yes. However nobody would release anything to the app store back in 2011 if it was that high (70% to apple).<p>&gt; They wouldn&#x27;t if Apple was really committed. The app already exists, removing it would mean less money.<p>If everyone did it all at the same time as a protest. Apple would have to respond and everyone certainly would.<p>&gt; Even with a better rate, Android&#x27;s app payment market is smaller. It wouldn&#x27;t do enough to make the apps there significantly better, and the number of people willing to switch off iphone for the marginal difference wouldn&#x27;t do anything.<p>So you are saying paying the 30% on the App store is worth it as you get a larger <i>paying</i> market. Which is what makes the 30% reasonable because it is worth it.')
