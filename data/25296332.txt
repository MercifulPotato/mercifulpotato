The justice department alleges that Facebook went out of its way to hide jobs from Americans bc there is a power imbalance that favors the employer of an immigrant worker. This wasn&#x27;t about hiring better talent, but about hiring talent that you can underpay while still retaining. As a side effect, qualified Americans were harmed.<p>These allegations may or may not be true but I fail to see how your framing addresses the complaint.<p>I agree that forcing higher pay for visa holders helps to align incentives.')
