Generally you want budget your CPUs cores to render a bunch of images at the same time instead of one (or a few) images really fast. The more threads&#x2F;buckets&#x2F;blocks&#x2F;threads you have with V-Ray the more overhead you are paying for. If you know what you are doing you should be able to saturate your NAS speed and&#x2F;or Network bandwidth.<p>The other thing to consider is the evermotion dataset might contain a lot of V-Ray Materials and Layers that might be CPU only. At one point Chaosgroup had a list of all the difference between CPU&#x2F;GPU, but it appears they either solved all of them and&#x2F;or took the page down.')
