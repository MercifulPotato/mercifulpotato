In my opinion, as a practical matter, near absolute freedom speech is good policy because speech is a buffer between wanting to get your way and doing violence to get your way. An increasingly large swath of American society believes that not only is our democracy corrupt, but they can&#x27;t say anything about it. What&#x27;s left? It&#x27;s not at all obvious to me that taking away someone&#x27;s ability to effect change through their speech will reduce the likelihood of people coming to harm through violent conflict.<p>Now, free speech _can_ also be used to spread lies and incite violence, and maybe banning Trump before he had a chance to spread unsubstantiated claims about election fraud would have prevented this recent chaos, but it seems to me that doing it afterwards will increase the chances of violent conflict, at least in the near term. Moreover, the possibility that he might have eventually conceded or placated his supporters is now nil. So, as a consequentialist, I&#x27;m dubious of the notion that banning him can be justified on ethical grounds.')
