And it&#x27;s not necessarily a good thing to be <i>too</i> ivory tower. In fact one of the reasons universities want to work with us (other than the fact we provide internships and jobs for their students) is that we help them to work on things that people actually care about.<p>Not that fundamental research is a bad thing but there&#x27;s often a happy medium between near-term product development and totally blue sky research.')
