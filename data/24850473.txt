If you have something to say that has to span 2 or 3 tweets, or if you have a follow-up to your original tweet that&#x27;s fine... But if you&#x27;re writing 5+ tweets in a thread for anything other than live commentary, I really wish you&#x27;d just tweet a link to a blog post instead.<p>The tweetstorm UX is terrible for readers, and leaves authors open to a single tweet being quoted &#x2F; embedded out of context.')
