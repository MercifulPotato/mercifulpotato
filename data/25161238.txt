It&#x27;s certainly superfast in singlecore, but it&#x27;s telling that multicore is benchmarked vs. mobile processors (and not vs. the normal Ryzens&#x2F;Intels which you can expect in a corded setup nowadays!).<p>As for the linked microbenchmarks: I guess with 12MB of cache, there&#x27;s plenty of memory to place the kernel and some other stuff. I wonder, how this plays out here.')
