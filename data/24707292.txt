What I meant by no practical implication was that if I&#x27;m an atheist and then I learn that there is in fact a God, but he&#x27;s either too busy, limited, or otherwise uninterested in my life, then I can shrug off that information with no negative consequences. It doesn&#x27;t matter to me if there&#x27;s no God or if there&#x27;s an uninvolved God, except as an academic question (ie no practical implication).<p>But if I&#x27;m an atheist and I learn that there&#x27;s a God that cares about me or my behavior then I will likely have to change my lifestyle. Maybe I&#x27;ll have to start praying, or giving charity, or stop stealing, or start dancing around a fire now and then so that the rain comes, or marry in a certain way, etc.<p>It&#x27;s no surprise to me that the popular versions of God-belief out there describe a God that&#x27;s very involved in Earthly affairs. Because otherwise, what&#x27;s the point?')
