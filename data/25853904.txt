Your assuming that intelligent&#x2F;thinking&#x2F;conscious creatures would necessarily function on timelines that make sense to us. If that were true, then what you&#x27;re saying makes sense - there are real bounds on how fast you can move chemical energy from A to B, for example.<p>But I see nothing preventing intelligent life from operating on massively longer timescales. This requires, of course, that you believe that intelligence (and maybe consciousness too) is substrate and timescale independent, which may or may not be a big ask depending on where you stand on these issues.')
