Item(by='nokcha', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605541565, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25110803, text='&gt;I would say the intent is much narrower than the actual text<p>Justice Scalia rejected the notion of giving much importance to the intent of drafters.  His objective was to interpret the text according to its original public meaning.<p>As Scalia noted in <i>Heller</i>, the Second Amendment &quot;codified a pre-existing right&quot;; it didn&#x27;t grant a new right.  And although &quot;self-defense had little to do with the rightâ€™s codification&quot;, &quot;it was the central component of the right itself&quot;.<p>&gt;People in the armed forces don&#x27;t own the weapons they use now.<p>That&#x27;s exactly the system that the framers wanted to avoid.  The citizen militia (with their own privately owned arms) was envisioned as an <i>alternative</i> to a standing army in times of peace.<p>&gt;Today, the National Guard is basically the &quot;Militia.&quot;<p>The National Guard is the organized part of the militia.  The unorganized militia has much broader membership.  \n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.law.cornell.edu&#x2F;uscode&#x2F;text&#x2F;10&#x2F;246" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.law.cornell.edu&#x2F;uscode&#x2F;text&#x2F;10&#x2F;246</a><p>&gt;there&#x27;s nothing unconstitutional about laws requiring trigger locks or other safety measures for their storage.<p>The trigger-lock requirement wasn&#x27;t limited to storage.  It didn&#x27;t have an exception to allow removing the trigger lock to use to the gun in self-defense or for carrying holstered on one&#x27;s person.  That&#x27;s why it was ruled unconstitutional.')
