Item(by='mixedCase', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609607658, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25612640, text='&gt; but infrastructure code is somewhere you really want to be able to drop into the full expressive power of a programming language.<p>Please expand on what this expressive power you <i>need</i> is. I see things like Pulumi and I can only think of IaC codebases that end up being turing tarpits in the hands of developers that don&#x27;t get what the whole point of the declarative model is, putting a bunch of untestable arbitrary IO and high cyclomatic complexity in the middle of determining what is going to be deployed.<p>And this is definitely not an argument against having better languages than HCL, Dhall would certainly be a step up that doesn&#x27;t give the developer an arsenal of footguns to move fast and wreak havoc on the underlying foundations of a business. But I want to know what needs you have that you feel are worth the risk of putting a bull in the china shop.')
