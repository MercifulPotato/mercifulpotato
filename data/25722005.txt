Direct incitement to imminent violence isn&#x27;t protected, but that&#x27;s a very narrow exemption; even statements like &quot;we need to get violent here&quot; aren&#x27;t going to be over the line. (One of the canonical free speech cases is Watts v. United States, where the defendant&#x27;s statement that he&#x27;d try to shoot then-president Johnson if he were drafted was ruled to be protected speech.)')
