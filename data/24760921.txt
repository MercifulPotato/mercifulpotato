It&#x27;s cool to have fancy, new ways of doing things, but if something works and the new way isn&#x27;t significantly better or easier than traditional ways and ends up being out of reach or significantly different than traditional wqys for little to no gain then, yeah, it&#x27;s not likely to be widely adopted.<p>That all being said, it wouldn&#x27;t surprise me if some day, some enterprising deep learning fan does come up with some new interesting or more efficient thing that sparks a new line of research and innovation.<p>It&#x27;s the way with a lot of things, the early adopters and enthusiasts pave the way for the others.<p>I tend to regard a lot of machine learning, deep learning, ai kind of stuff as overblown, buzz wordy, euphemisms for fancy algorithms with internal memory and data analysis and manipulation capabilities.<p>But, that doesn&#x27;t mean there aren&#x27;t still innovative things that can be done with it.<p>Likely, someone will come along at some point with something easily accessible made with deep learning that revolutionizes procedural generation and helps in creating more realistic random environments. We&#x27;re not there yet though, hence the general disregard for it.')
