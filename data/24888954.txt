I&#x27;m fascinated by all this open source that&#x27;s out there but if you told me that a developer had to know every single open source desktop out there in order to contribute to one of them then I can&#x27;t really get behind that. It&#x27;s very hard to keep track of what everyone&#x27;s doing all the time.<p>But in any case I don&#x27;t understand what is contentious about that. Some pieces are shared between GNOME and XFCE, but a lot of pieces are different and applications have always needed to choose. If they weren&#x27;t trying to be different they wouldn&#x27;t have made a separate desktop environment with their own separate libxfce libraries and components. (To GNOME&#x27;s credit, they have gotten rid of most of the &quot;libgnome&quot; things since then, but now an application that wants to speak to certain GNOME-specific pieces is usually expected to use their private dbus protocols, things that XFCE would never implement anyway)')
