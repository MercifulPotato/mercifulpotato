They have <i>many</i> examples of people (ab)using Airbnb to operate as slumlords; a type of exploitation which is outlawed.

In many cases it is rich people using the platform to avoid regulations which prohibit exploitative renting to poor people.<p>And the corporation which enables this actively hinders investigations.
