Work friends have extreme pressure to be around you. They get paid to be around and collaborate with you. You can&#x27;t easily determine the extent of a relationship standing on its own merit if someone is literally being paid to collaborate with you. With that said some of my best friends came from former jobs as well, but if we&#x27;re talking about emotionally vulnerable people they especially need relationships outside of work. Imagine all of your relationships being tied to work and inevitably you get fired (as most people will experience in their life). That would be devastating without support outside of work. What if it turns out your friendships only lasted because of the financial incentives to be around each other and common in-office conversations?<p>tl;dr; relationships outside of work are important and that&#x27;s not sad to me because it doesn&#x27;t prevent anyone from also having friends inside of work.')
