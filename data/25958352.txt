They also have business accounts, though will only accept business with similar values.<p>For our personal and business banking in UK and NL, we chose:<p>* UK personal banking - Nationwide for primary current account, Tridos UK as secondary. Left HSBC because service was terrible and they kept on declining our card txns.<p>* UK business banking - Tried Tide but moved to Starling on discovering Tide didn&#x27;t support joint account holders. With Starling also have a EUR account. It works seamlessly with the only disadvantage that transfers from the Starling EUR account to NL banks are overnight.<p>* NL personal banking - Triodos NL, after years with ABN Amro. Triodos is friendly, sustainability focus.<p>* NL business banking - Knab, which has been good so far. Wanted to use Triodos NL but there is a two month backlog approving new business customers.')
