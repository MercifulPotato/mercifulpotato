That lifestyle became broadly available to the middle classes after WWII. It&#x27;s hard to blame people for wanting that.<p>People still like living in suburbs. They still like owning cars. They still vote against new transit projects for a lot of reasons, but the biggest reason is that they don&#x27;t want to pay taxes to support a system they would not use themselves.<p>So I just don&#x27;t buy the idea that the National City Lines conspiracy caused our current automotive culture. I think we would have ended up with the same car culture anyway, because huge numbers of people wanted to live in the suburbs.')
