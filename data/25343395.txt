I couldn&#x27;t find how many cities in which Uber uses corrected GPS, except a 2018 Verge article that says &quot;15, launching soon globally&quot;. Either way, seems like the answer is Google has the data to do it. And Google can bring it to every (non-China) Android phone.<p>But yeah, Google&#x27;s post is very light on technical details. It&#x27;d be interesting to see if their approaches were similar.<p>Edit: also of note, Uber used server-side correction (at least in 2018), while Google downloads 3D tiles to the device.')
