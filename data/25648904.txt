A little more for paid interests below DKK 50000 yearly and a little less for paid interests above DKK 50000.<p>A typical home can sell for DKK 4M. With a 20 year 0% interest and 80% of the 4M mortgaged (the maximum allowed), the &quot;contribution fee&quot; would be set at 0,75%.<p>That would amount to interests (0%) and &quot;contribution fee&quot; (0.75%) yearly around DKK 24000 (1st year) of which 25% = DKK 6000 will be deductible.<p>To put that into perspective:<p>A. An average &quot;medium level&quot; worker will have an average income of DKK 466,660&#x2F;year[1] and pay DKK 159,212 in taxes, leaving a post-taxes income of DKK 307,448.<p>B. An unemployed will receive DKK 225,894&#x2F;year and pay DKK 58,952 in taxes, leaving a post-taxes income of DKK 166.942<p>So in reality the mortgage tax deduction does not amount to much. With those low interest rates it is around DKK 6000 or DKK 500&#x2F;month for a typical family.<p>Compare DKK 6000&#x2F;year or DKK 500&#x2F;month to:\n- a pair of Levi&#x27;s: DKK 660\n- a 4G&#x2F;5G plan with 50GB&#x2F;month: DKK 160&#x2F;month\n- iPhone 12: DKK 7000<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dst.dk&#x2F;en&#x2F;Statistik&#x2F;emner&#x2F;arbejde-indkomst-og-formue&#x2F;indkomster" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dst.dk&#x2F;en&#x2F;Statistik&#x2F;emner&#x2F;arbejde-indkomst-og-fo...</a>')
