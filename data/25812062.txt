Either treat them like children and just explain on a loop, or you demand that they follow the basic process of adult reasoning and learning. The last option is abandonment, teacher&#x2F;instructor burnout is a real thing.<p>And &quot;I don&#x27;t understand&quot; should not be acceptable. Let them write out what they did and what exactly they don&#x27;t understand.<p>For example:<p>To find out more about main, I searched for &quot;Java main&quot;, and got the following: &quot;All Java programs must have an entry point, which is always the main() method. Whenever the program is called, it automatically executes the main() method first. &quot; Yet when I look at this code here, line ref&#x2F; code snippet,  I don&#x27;t understand why it doesn&#x27;t have a main....<p>I don&#x27;t have any natural talent for programming nor math, and cried for 2 weeks straight when I was going through my first programming book, my brain literally hurt.\nI just ground that book.<p>Taking a book and typing out all the exercises, muscle memory.
