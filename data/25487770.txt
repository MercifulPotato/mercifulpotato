It&#x27;s right there, at the top: the first thing you read.<p>D looks fine. It suffers from the curse that we cannot have 1000 languages be popular simultaneously. Popularity is a game of musical chairs. People who don&#x27;t get chairs when the music stops are not always the clumsy ones who lack athleticism and reflexes. Sometimes, in that crucial moment, the nimble one is just far from the closet chair relative to the klutz whose butt is inches from the seat.<p>In popular culture, popularity wanes fairly quickly. Yesterday&#x27;s idol is quickly forgotten. Like Billy Joel&#x27;s line in &quot;The Entertainer&quot;:  <i>&quot;But I know the game, you&#x27;ll forget my name &#x2F; I won&#x27;t be here in another year &#x2F; If I don&#x27;t stay on the charts.&quot;</i><p>In computing, we can&#x27;t swap tools quite that fast. So for fairly long periods of time, popularity begets more popularity. Something is popular today because it rose to popularity some years ago. (Some things have longer cycles, some shorter.) Anyway, that alone creates a barrier to entry, similar to a monopolistic barrier. No matter how good something is that you create, it just doesn&#x27;t have ... the popularity to make it popular.')
