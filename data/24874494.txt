VRChat has made it possible for users to create their own avatars and worlds (like Mozilla Hubs), including scripting and shaders. I&#x27;m absolutely _floored_ by the creativity and talent I&#x27;ve seen in abundance there. It reminds me of the early internet, where people are creating things for the only purpose of connecting with others. Similarly I feel lucky to experience this period in VR because I don&#x27;t think it can last this way forever. It&#x27;s also as addictive as we were led to believe in science fiction! Numerous people I&#x27;ve met there have clocked _thousands_ of hours in VR, so I&#x27;m fully sold that social VR is going to be a major part of the future<p>*If you read this and decide to try it yourself, heads up: you have to do some searching to find the gems – the demographic skews quite young and male so you may find jumping into a random world is chaotic to say the least! It&#x27;s also far from a polished experience. I like to spend time in quieter spaces like the sign-language practise world (it&#x27;s amazing to be able to practise any time with real people!) and drawing worlds<p>A world I came across recently that you might enjoy is &quot;ShaderFes 2019&quot; – it&#x27;s a shader museum! [0][1]<p>I&#x27;m less convinced more serious social VR will do so well initially as I suspect the surrealism and unconstrained creative-weirdness that VRChat makes possible goes a long way to diffuse the uncanny valley and awkwardness inherent with the current state of the technology<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;Em4JYyKu2d8?t=479" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;Em4JYyKu2d8?t=479</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vrchat.com&#x2F;home&#x2F;launch?worldId=wrld_f5a298f6-83e6-45ee-be58-4fafbbd38139" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vrchat.com&#x2F;home&#x2F;launch?worldId=wrld_f5a298f6-83e...</a>')
