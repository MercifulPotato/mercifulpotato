Every car is different. Volunteers have so many trainings to take, it&#x27;s unreasonable to ask them to take a whole training for EVERY MODEL CAR on the road.  There should be a simple, standard, HV and pyro cutoff control, standard on ALL cars, that can be actuated without a hydraulic shear. Put it in the wheel well or behind a gascap-like door.<p>Imagine you are a civilian or first responder and want to help people out of a car and you don&#x27;t have a hydraulic shear or hundreds of hours of model-specific training? This is an everyday usecase.')
