Is that based on calculation based on the energy density of fuel vs batteries alone? Because there&#x27;s a lot of efficiencies to be gained if you make a battery electric plane from scratch. And are you considering only a fully fuelled plane? Because many routes will only use a small fraction of the potential fuel capacity.<p>Look at the Maxwell X-57 for instance. If you don&#x27;t have fuel in the wings, and you can use small electric take-off propellers on the wings, you can make the wing much thinner, which reduces drag.<p>You can potentially fly higher with electric planes, since you no longer have to think about air densitys impact on engine efficiency.<p>The main challenge with electric airplanes is not really the batteries. You could probably make viable short-haul planes with todays technology. The problem is you&#x27;re basically starting from scratch, as a plane optimised for electric engines is most likely vastly different from a 737 airframe. It&#x27;ll take decades to design and optimize radically new airframes.<p>We might never see planes crossing the pacific ocean with batteries only, but that doesn&#x27;t mean electric planes aren&#x27;t viable. By some calculations you can do 500-1000km routes with todays battery tech already, and there&#x27;s a shitload of those. Maybe you&#x27;ll have to fly 2-3 smaller planes rather than one huge one to cover the same route, but that can be a good thing. You could use smaller and more local airports. Electric planes are <i>much</i> more quiet after all. Operating costs with electric planes are way lower, so it might not be more expensive either.<p>With a 3x+ capacity you can start talking about covering most of the routes within a continent. So what if you can&#x27;t do transcontinental? I think we can make enough biofuel to cover that if most other flights are electric (and&#x2F;or hydrogen)')
