I noticed that I could deliberately make my face beet red (as a ginger, the effect was quite drastic).  It was hilarious to my peers, but I was always the wild one, so it was a spectator activity for them.  One day, I clenched too hard, or too long, passed out, and fell to the ground.  I got up quick as I could, brushed it off... but never did it again.<p>So in a sense, yeah, I&#x27;d bet that kids have been doing this &quot;forever.&quot;  OTOH, what&#x27;s missing from my story is the peer pressure (albeit their amusement encouraging me) and the network effect.  Social media can transmit memetic disease faster than we&#x27;ve ever seen.  Is social media to blame for this behavior?  Hell no.  Does social media aggravate the situation?  Without question.')
