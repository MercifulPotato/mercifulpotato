Item(by='an_opabinia', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607016419, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25291027, text='&gt; Clearbanc, a financial services company, uses multiple Stripe products<p>If Clearbanc tried to use a Stripe product today, it obviously uses the words &quot;investor&quot; and &quot;Fund me&quot; on its landing pages, &quot;democratize access to capital,&quot; - so it sounds like crowdfunding, even though I know Clearbanc&#x27;s business isn&#x27;t. Your contractor compliance team would say no, but a Stripe W2, who is equipped for this kind of nuance, would say yes.<p>However: &quot;We provide the capital to grow and, in return, are paid a percentage of revenue until we are paid back plus a small 6% - 12% fee... no dilution, no board seats&quot; is clearly describing a loan. Here&#x27;s a link (1) to an SEC filing where in plain language a Clearbanc loan recipient describes receiving a &quot;loan&quot; from Clearbanc. So it&#x27;s clearly a &quot;lending instruments&quot; and credit service, in violation of your AUP, no doubt about it, you even use the word lending instrument to provide the flexibility to account for this sort of stuff. And here, a contractor would <i>not</i> be able to figure out what I just did -  they&#x27;d say, &quot;oh their landing page is not using the word loan, which is a keyword in my script&quot; - but a W2 would!<p>I get it, you want to have it both ways, I get that reality is just, &quot;It is case by case, and in reality, we decide for (1) totally random reasons, like whether or not you are reviewed by a contractor or an educated W2, and (2) the cut of your jib.&quot; Maybe you guys permit loans in Stripe Connect.<p>Maybe these Clearbanc guys really did invoke some kind of magic, by not using the word loan but instead using the word advance and fees, even though their own Fast Company article says loan and the recipients (correctly) account for and legally define the money they received from Clearbanc as a loan. I don&#x27;t know. It&#x27;s actually really surprising and I&#x27;m trying to cut to the core of the AUP question and why it generates so many problems for you guys.<p>Is your real takeaway: &quot;Oh, I can&#x27;t say specific companies.&quot; I believe this is wrong! I think you should not be afraid to say Clearbanc, and then find out they make loans, and you should be able to just say, &quot;No to AngelList and no to TransferWise.&quot; It&#x27;s not that big of a deal that Clearbanc makes loans, which is against your AUP, you can work with whomever you want! Which is really what I&#x27;m getting at, which is to facilitate a conversation, something between educated people who aren&#x27;t trying to gotcha each other, that is what we&#x27;re having, about what the potential of the platform is - not a situation where, oh man, what do I put into this &quot;What do you want to build with Stripe Treasury&quot; box on the invite form? Because if I put in the wrong keywords, I am shut out from something really useful to me, not because I am doing something weird and want to skirt compliance, but because it is free.<p>(1) <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sec.gov&#x2F;Archives&#x2F;edgar&#x2F;data&#x2F;0001700895&#x2F;000114420419022405&#x2F;tv520143_partii.htm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sec.gov&#x2F;Archives&#x2F;edgar&#x2F;data&#x2F;0001700895&#x2F;000114420...</a> &quot;During 2018, the Company entered into several loan agreements with Clearbanc in the amount of $670,443, bearing interest ranging from 9.25% to 15%.
