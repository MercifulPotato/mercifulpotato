Most people intuitively grasp supply and demand and other basics.<p>What mainstream economics has tried to convince us is that hard work is meaningless and infinite money can be printed. Scarcity is a myth. I don&#x27;t need complex graphs to explain away why printing shitloads of money causes inflation and warps incentives.
