However, I&#x27;m not so enthusiastic about he culture.  In a lot of cases, it ends up being &quot;obsessives, fight!&quot; with the weapon of rules-lawyering, which is just exhausting for anyone who isn&#x27;t an obsessive.<p>The end-result is often OK, but often jumbled and confusing, and it often feels like getting taught a subject by someone who&#x27;s just a year or two ahead of you.  You definitely feel you can learn something, but the person teaching you doesn&#x27;t necessarily have very good command of the material themselves.<p>It&#x27;s position in society is also weird.  It has authority, but that authority can be abused.  I once ran into a Wikipedian who had been busy for several years promoting a religious philosophy in a little neglected corner of Wikipedia, by gluing together little disconnected fragments to make a build up the wiki page for it.  It was definitely badly done original research, but he successfully tapped the authority of Wikipedia.')
