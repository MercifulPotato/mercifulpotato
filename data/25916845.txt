It seems you’re saying basically all species are equal, not in all being created, but in all being alike. If I’m close to target, and if the basic salamander could talk ontology, I posit they would disagree with you… not by saying “salamanders are dull, humans are exciting”, but by saying “we are both created we know not from where, and go to we know not where – but you humans show evidence of caring about this, unlike us salamanders.” The very existence of a salamander – let alone seeing it form and grow – says very clearly a few points, especially that humans are amazed by these things (look at the comments!) wherease salamanders are not amazed but merely (although still gloriously) amazing. In which case an argument that humans aren’t special (and therefore have a greater burden of responsibility and joy) seems to fall wide of the mark.')
