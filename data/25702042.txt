Intended to run hundreds of &quot;channels&quot; of music, each of which could support thousands of independent sessions (think cloud gaming but for audio&#x2F;music).<p>Uses Pion WebRTC, Gstreamer, JACK, SuperCollider and a simple Golang API for converting http requests to OSC toggles to manipulate audio running on a cloud server in realtime over the internet.<p>Questions – is this crazy? Would game makers ever be interested in adopting a third party SDK for their music needs? What if that music had to be streamed over the wire (not baked into their console&#x2F;mobile client builds)? Is the prospect of game player input influencing the sounds&#x2F;music they&#x27;re listening to compelling, or not really?')
