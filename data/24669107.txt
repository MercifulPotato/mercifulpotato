I also borrowed one from my trainer to see how I liked it (it is expensive and he was actually planning to sell it to get the latest iteration). The battery life and utility for offline use are fantastic. But, it was also really damn heavy. Noticeably heavy (maybe the latest incarnations aren&#x27;t so heavy?). As someone who always wears a watch, but usually ones with few complications and relatively small (compared to many men&#x27;s watches) it was uncomfortable.<p>That was my biggest take away and the main reason (besides the fact I don&#x27;t do any long backpacking trips anymore so the offline mapping and really long battery life were less critical) I selected the Apple Watch. A watch, to me, shouldn&#x27;t make you notice it&#x27;s presence whenever you move your arm. Plus they&#x27;re even more expensive than the Apple Watch.')
