Malone in The Valley of Heart&#x27;s Delight (2002)<p>&gt; When will it end? I knowingly predicted Silicon Valley&#x27;s imminent demise in 1980, 1985, 1989, and 1994.

The rest of the media world obviously has not--regularly indulging in yet another paroxysm of features about how the Valley is losing its crown to Austin, Orange County, Bangalore, even Boise.<p>&gt; Perhaps.  All I know is just months after the last time I predicted the Valley&#x27;s end, I found myself regularly having lunch in a Chinese restuartant in Campbell with two young entrepreneurs... The company they were building was called Ebay.')
