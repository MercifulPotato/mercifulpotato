There’s a cap at 85k&#x2F;year, and most applications get rejected. This is just going to result in the available 85k&#x2F;year slots being awarded to the intended pool of high-skilled industry specialists, rather than those people being swamped out by a mass of applications from companies that see this as an opportunity to hire cheap labor.
