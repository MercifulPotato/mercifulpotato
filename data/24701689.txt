If you want to argue that the python developers are less prone to typing things than the java devs, then say that. Don&#x27;t claim wrong things about the type systems. They&#x27;re functionally equivalent.<p>The type checkers have all the same information, however much the users choose to give them. There are actually a few ways in which python&#x27;s type system is fundamentally more capable than java&#x27;s (literal types, protocols).<p>Literally all a static type system is is an assertion (and tooling to assert) that types must validate before you can run the code. That&#x27;s it. If you provide a presubmit check that types must validate before you run the code, congratulations, your code is statically typed.<p>Put simply: enabling mypy + no-any gives you all the same static guarantees (and arguably more) that java does, so in what way <i>isn&#x27;t</i> it statically typed?')
