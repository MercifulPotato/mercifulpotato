By magic?  By willpower?  By an internal combustion engine?<p>It needs some way of changing its course.  Molecules don&#x27;t <i>have</i> such a mechanism, except for bouncing off of other molecules.<p>And, how does the molecule know where the other molecules are?  It&#x27;s psychic?  Lidar?  Radar?  How?  What&#x27;s it&#x27;s energy source for emitting whatever it has to emit to be able to gather the information that it needs?<p>The analogy is, if we take a superficial knowledge of physics, and don&#x27;t actually think about the details, we can construct a wonderful-sounding-but-not-actually-possible scenario.  That&#x27;s perhaps an accurate analogy for what Wolfram is really proposing.')
