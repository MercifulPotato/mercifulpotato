I&#x27;m from a country that used to be socialist and when people hear that &quot;Self management and the basics of marxism&quot; used to be a mandatory school subject, they&#x27;re usually disgusted and call it brainwashing.\nI absolutely agree that it&#x27;s very useful to learn about the inner workings of the system you live in, as it gives you perspective.
