What&#x27;s now much less useful is to maintain some number of bombers with live weapons airborne at all times to guard against a possible sneak attack on airfields.<p>Missiles don&#x27;t turn around either, but I wonder if any of them have the ability to be disarmed or self-destructed. Might be a useful ability in some situations, but also a vulnerability that an enemy might exploit. I expect people like us would never know for sure if such a thing existed anyways.')
