The OSI says [2] <i>The Open Source Definition was then created during the launch of the OSI in Feb. 1998 by revising the DFSG and removing Debian-specific references</i>.<p>This seems to indicate that the OSI&#x27;s precise definition was pretty much there from the beginning, unless they didn&#x27;t really coin the term <i>open source</i> and it was floating around beforehand. I&#x27;ve heard from others that <i>open source</i> was in use before the OSI definition, so perhaps that&#x27;s the case.<p>As I mention in my response though, I don&#x27;t think the term&#x27;s early history much matters.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Open_source#Origins" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Open_source#Origins</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20021001164015&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.opensource.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;history.php" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20021001164015&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.openso...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;opensource.org&#x2F;history" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;opensource.org&#x2F;history</a>')
