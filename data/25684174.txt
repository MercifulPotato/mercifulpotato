The trick seems to be that generating this tether should decrease the value of tether, however since everyone thinks its a stablecoin that is backed by usd 1:1, its value remains the same. The worst is that the purchased bitcoin increases in value, so technically they could sell that bitcoin for usd, then use that usd to temporarily back their printed tether...<p>(This is my understanding of the situation and from the reading the explanations of other people, but please take this with a grain of salt, im not sure if everything is true)')
