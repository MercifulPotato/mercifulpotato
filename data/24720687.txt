You still need a client to explore that data, right? The browser is not going to know how to make sense of the relationships between your data points. How is the end user going to consume the information, a web app? As the dominance of companies like Facebook, Google and Twitter have shown, the average user doesn&#x27;t care about de-centralization. They care about a good user experience.<p>Let&#x27;s take the recipe scenario presented in the article. What&#x27;s to stop Google from ingesting all of this semantic data, and then using their army of software devs to integrate the results into Google&#x27;s search results? Google has invested in natural language processing that can allow their web crawlers to make semantic sense of written text. I&#x27;m sure they would love it if a swath of volunteers did this for them instead.<p>Sure, some small, indie shop could use the data too. But Google can integrate with their translation engine, their home speakers and Android. They&#x27;ll make the experience nice enough that your aunt looking for a scone recipe won&#x27;t want to leave their ecosystem, even if a more free, de-centralized alternative is available.')
