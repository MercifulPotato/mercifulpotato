Their sealed machines have heat throttling issues, graphics card failures, they’re not repairable (iMacs are THE WORST for this), keyboard issues, and that’s all ahead of the Intel chipset issues.<p>Until the m1 chips, I could say I don’t care at all about their hardware. Their software is buggy, but it’s irreplaceable and the most important thing for me. There’s nothing else out there like it.<p>It wasn’t always like this though... the rolling yearly releases changed much.')
