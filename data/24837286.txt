It&#x27;s not like roads or tracks are a natural feature.<p>The problem arise when we &quot;go after cars&quot; without an alternative anywhere in sight. I&#x27;m pretty dubious of my government&#x27;s (ireland) likelihood of achieving netherlands-like transport. I&#x27;m all for trying. But, the place to start is not by reducing rural car ownership. The reality is that electric cars will probably arrive before rural public transport... at least here.<p>In practice, there a lot of implicit and explicit anti-driving laws. Many&#x2F;most of these take the form of economic &quot;incentives.&quot; Most affect rural people more. Rural locals don&#x27;t have much public transport. A lot of these policies are classist too. Changing vehicle standards affect old cars more, making driving unaffordable to poorer people. Same for petrol taxes. Implicit &quot;policies&quot; like allowing a broken insurance system also results in a lot of class discrimination.<p>In practice, in ireland, saying &quot;you shouldn&#x27;t own a car&quot; is like saying you should move to dublin or &quot;you shouldn&#x27;t go anywhere.&quot; In cities it means &quot;take the bus or cycle,&quot; but not everyone lives in a city.<p>Meanwhile, I didn&#x27;t think it&#x27;s fair that to have policies which essentially mean &quot;poor people shouldn&#x27;t drive,&quot; which many policies with a rural blindspot are.<p>I would be totally fine with severe anti-car policies in the city or anywhere alternatives exist.')
