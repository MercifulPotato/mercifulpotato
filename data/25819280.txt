Item(by='permille42', descendants=None, kids=[25819339], score=None, time=1610955963, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25811976, text='I do have multiple blogs and multiple Twitters, both under my real name and additional aliases. I unfortunately am not able to centralize these identities. Even this HackersNews login is a throwaway experiment of mine.<p>I have never been able to express myself freely without being downvoted and&#x2F;or attacked to all hell and back. This particular identity is me just being who I am and not giving a damn if I am rejected. I&#x27;m just so very tired of filtering my thoughts and ideas.<p>The person I truly am is radical and flamboyant. The world does not want that person typically. Thank you for your appreciation of my comments here; I will continue this identity for what it is worth until it is downvoted to oblivion.<p>I will share a bit on this since it is relevant to the topic of my thoughts and whether they are allowed in society.<p>When I was very young I kept a detailed diary. I did so because I believe any who strive for greatness must do so, as an obligation to those who study their lives when they are finally acknowledged for what they have contributed to humanity. ( whether while alive or after death )<p>What I wrote even as a child was equal in length to the bible. I was writing my diary in DOS on 286 computers, before any online blog existed. I published the entirety of my diary on the internet publicly. It was online for many years. It is still in fact accessible on archive.org if enterprising souls dig enough.<p>Eventually my sister discovered that my diary was online and bitched about it. She said that I have no right to publicly share the details of my life for all to see. She involved my parents, and they together came to me and demanded I remove it from the internet.<p>I have always considered that to be an attack on my freedom and evidence of exactly how much people are ashamed of who they are and present a fake front of themselves. I believe that we as humans should always strive to be the best people we can, and be unafraid of being known in detail, because being known as one is is the ultimate way to face oneself and confront your flaws immediately.<p>In the years that have passed since then I went through many rounds of using various online communication mechanisms. Every single one I&#x27;ve ever used from I&#x27;ve been rejected from and&#x2F;or banned from. This includes the long period of time where I never cussed because I believed it to be wrong. After so many iterations of this I&#x27;ve accepted that my ideas are unwanted in the world.<p>I still attempt to communicate the truth as I see it and share ideas openly in an attempt to improve the world, but so much of it falls on deaf ears and is met with anger that I barely bother any more.<p>I&#x27;ve been fired from so many of the jobs I&#x27;ve held, simply because I refuse to keep my ideas to myself. Good or bad it doesn&#x27;t matter; no one wants to be shown up by a person 2 or 3 levels below them.<p>I&#x27;ve been fired for &quot;doing my job too well&quot; and &quot;being too smart&quot;. I&#x27;ve had multiple employers say I am the most talented engineer they have ever met in the process of terminating my employment. I&#x27;m not even surprised any more. It is simply inevitable at any position I hold, whether it be a level 1 software engineer or CTO. I&#x27;ve done both.<p>I&#x27;ve been in national news, and it is impossible to control the media. They make up whatever they find sensational and publish lies, and you can&#x27;t really do much of anything about it unless you are independently wealthy to be able to sue them and cover all costs till you win.<p>I&#x27;ve written my own fiction novel as well. Perhaps I will publish it when I am feeling particularly generous to the world...<p>I&#x27;ve written so much code in so many languages it is very easy to just stop caring about the entirety of it and throw in the towel, because even the most beautiful code is thrown by the wayside the majority of the time.<p>If and when I see something worth commenting on, I give it a go.')
