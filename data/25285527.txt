For example you can&#x27;t &quot;cash out&quot; and convert your ETH into USD from MetaMask. So all that&#x27;s needed for the government is to enforce the law on these custodial wallets.<p>It&#x27;s not so different from how they deal with Tor. Even though the onion network gives the false sense of security, government agents mostly have taken over the entrance and exit nodes of the Tor network, and most criminals get caught this way. Using the &quot;cash out&quot; analogy, the entrance and exit Tor nodes are equivalent to the custodial wallets.')
