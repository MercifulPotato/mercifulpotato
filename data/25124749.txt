My dad had a PhD in English. My CS education was much less relevant to me than the History side. Love liberal arts. ;)<p>It&#x27;s bullshit in the sense that if you&#x27;re going to be a PhD, you generally want to move to industry, enter a career path where the rigor of the PhD process pays off or tenure track academia. If the academic prospects are so poor that you get a raise managing a Starbucks rather than being a contract visiting professor for 18-36 month stints, that&#x27;s bullshit in my book.')
