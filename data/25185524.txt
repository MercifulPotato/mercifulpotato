Moreover, the Android Messages section is for all the crap I get from nearby outlets advertising their &quot;best deals&quot;, or scam artists targeting the vulnerable. I cannot honestly see myself or my peers switching out from Whatsapp to this, especially not when Whatsapp has become a verb in most of the old world. As I&#x27;ve said before, Whatsapp is trusted so much that autocratic regimes such as the KSA, Russia, UAE and Venezuela used it to discuss OPEC production limits. People in all of these countries trust Whatsapp far more than Android, in spite of them being known to be owned by Facebook, and in spite of said people being very wary of using Facebook for messaging (most Arab Spring countries for instance).')
