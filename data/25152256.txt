I certainly don&#x27;t treat every aspect of my life &quot;the best I can&quot;, but rather my time is precious and I try to be smart about my time. Where is it best allocated? Folding laundry to my best ability? I could certainly research it and become an expert, but is this good use of my time? Is this how I want to be known as? Is this this how I want to define myself?<p>Time is precious. Know where to spend it.')
