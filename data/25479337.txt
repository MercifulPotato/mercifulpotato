I think the best approach is to try to figure out everything that might go wrong, address those things, and then go ahead and try to make things better, instead of just giving up and accepting the problems we have. That&#x27;s how civilization advances.<p>This particular problem is heavy on game theory, which is a pretty well-developed field at this point. So I think there are grounds to believe we might be able to predict consequences with some accuracy.')
