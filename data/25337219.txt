They have just under 1000 operational and are about half-way to phase 1.  Which will only be able to provide broadband for a limited number of users at latitudes for Canada and some northern US states.  (That is why they are doing beta programs, they don&#x27;t have the capacity for more.)<p>Money to launch more satellites will give the company the ability to get broadband for more people in more of the rural USA much more quickly.  It also helps Starlink through a chicken and egg problem where they can&#x27;t make money unless they have satellites up, and they can&#x27;t put satellites up unless they get money.')
