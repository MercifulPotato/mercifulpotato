My brain is regularly fried by healthcare here, it ends up being a simple high level equation.<p>My out of pocket max per year is around $6000 USD, and my salary is double what I was (under)paid in Toronto, and taxes are a bit lower here (CA).<p>So the take home pay is mid-5-figures more, and worst-case scenario healthcare is mid-4-figures, so it balances out very favourably for my situation (anyone in tech with a full-time job, basically).<p>(Of course, those who aren&#x27;t well-paid in tech have a much worse situation and I can&#x27;t imagine how difficult that must be.)')
