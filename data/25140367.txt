I can&#x27;t play some games without putting them at very low quality, although the specs of my machine are well within the recommended range. My computer randomly restarts if I am not at low settings. I have suspected overheating, but I have done what I can to fix it bar getting liquid cooling and I still have the issue. Very odd stuff. If anyone has suggestions, please let me know.')
