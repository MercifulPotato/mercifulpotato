I had to reset AirPods to make it work.<p>And don&#x27;t get me started on the completly stupid difference between ctrl+c and cmd+c. One (the standard for everything except macos) is used in terminal and the other in every other app.<p>For me macbook would be great for one thing: installing Linux on it, if it only had the ctrl key in the correct place (that is at the left corner of the keyboard not next to Fn).')
