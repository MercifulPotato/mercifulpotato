In this particular case, if you think about it again, I guess you will do it in a completely different way. They have already ghosted you once, so it would be naive to trust them not to ghost you again. And it turned out exactly the case. My personal approach is to save their name and number, particularly the mobile number in my address book, clearly marking as them as not trustworthy and sometimes even block their number so that I don&#x27;t talk to them anymore.')
