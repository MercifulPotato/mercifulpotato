This is basic.<p>2) let&#x27;s say 50% fringe, at most.<p>3) 25% fringe. Most of the relevant science buys into this, and not just b&#x2F;c it sounds nice.<p>4) Reasonable conclusion, if the stated theory was true. 25% fringe.<p>5) This is a multiplication of uncertain conclusions, so let&#x27;s go with 75% fringe.<p>6) A conclusion of 5), which would be detectable. At most as much fringe points as 5), since it can be falsified.<p>There&#x27;s always wikipedia to grasp basics, and then there&#x27;s Ethan Siegwl with Starts with a Bang, and if you&#x27;re still interested there&#x27;s a lot more including astronomy and physics papers. astronomy.stackexchange.com, physics.stackexchange.com and even your local university.<p>Edit: Since this has been downvoted, I&#x27;m genuinely interested in the reasons and especially the facts you obviously have which I don&#x27;t. Please let me know where I was wrong!')
