And I am clearly stating that it should not affect the decision-making of other people here either.<p>Also I am going to underline that what you did was relevant 16 years ago; which you did not state in your initial message about the usefullness of Excel.<p>Which is kinda funny, if I didnâ€™t ask you would have otherwise omitted a lot of otherwise relevant information which makes your opinion even less important.<p>It only makes me question why do you take this whole thread so personally? Probably because by now your skills are way less relevant than back in 2005.')
