Mostly dull jobs unless you&#x27;re in some lucky team, less flexibility (at least pre covid, now everyone is remote anyway), more politics, similar cash compensation but very valuable stocks (which is how you make money).\nPlus throwing away two months of my life to prepare for a dumb interview.<p>Instead I&#x27;m looking into kissing my IC&#x27;s career goodbye, start a small tech business and try to grow that one.')
