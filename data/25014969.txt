How about the drugs given to stroke patients?<p>I have to be honest, I will be pissed if Asparin ends up being an effective treatment, happy that it works but pissed that so many suffered needlessly.<p>Also the article mentions hydroxy chloroquine. Now that the US election campaigns and associated propaganda is winding down, can we finally get some clarification on the Hydroxy chloroquine arguments?<p>It is my understanding that as a treatment it is ineffective but taken before being infected it has some benifits by helping zinc get into our cells, once there the zinc helps prevent virii from infecting healthy cells.')
