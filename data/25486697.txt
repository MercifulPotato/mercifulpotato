Apple isn&#x27;t selling their chips. ARM from others have been optimized for micro controllers, phones, servers and super computers. Not for high performance desktop system of game consoles.<p>If you wanted a high performance alternative to x86 in the past, you would have to go with PowerPC, which Playstation famously did with Playstation 3. Except that was a disaster because the architecture was too novel.<p>That experience made Sony, very afraid of doing anything unconventional hardware wise.<p>But I supposed Apple may have opened the flood gates and my prediction would be that next generation Playstation will be ARM based.')
