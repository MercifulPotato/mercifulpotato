I would volunteer for challenge trials if given the opportunity. I got the swine flu vaccine in 2010ish.<p>I would take basically any covid vaccine in a heartbeat. Personally, I see it as a moral obligation, since it is a necessary step to end the pandemic, and avoid impacting those that cannot take any of the vaccines.<p>Historically, vaccine side effect profiles are at most as bad as just getting the disease itself. There are early examples of contaminated vaccines (polio with SV40 in the 50s), but we’ve learned a lot about vaccine production since then.<p>I don’t expect to have the chance until ~July or later.')
