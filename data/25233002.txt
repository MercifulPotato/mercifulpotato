If I have the same ingredients and the same production technique and conditions, then the only difference is that one was made in a specific location, and one was not. So what if mine tastes slightly different? No cheeses produced in the same region and in the same way taste exactly the same.<p>As for your &quot;another blue cheese&quot; comment - if someone makes a blue cheese using different bacteria, techniques or conditions then it isn&#x27;t a roquefort so shouldn&#x27;t be able to be labeled as such. But that difference is due to the place of origin - if I made a generic cows milk blue cheese in the south of france I could claim it&#x27;s a roquefort just because of the origin.')
