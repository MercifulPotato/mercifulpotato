Academic courses (MOOCs included) require students not to publish progress&#x2F;code publicly during a course\n2. You worked on a personal project, which you don&#x27;t want to make public because you believe you have other plans with it. But you still want to be able to show it to selected people (such as a prospective employer)<p>But having a version controlled repository is really helpful in both these scenarios. It&#x27;s also important for one other thing, specific people (professors, potential employer etc.) to know of what your approach to assignments&#x2F;learnings from the course was. At the moment, there is no way of showing someone the depth of learning&#x2F;work you did during a course&#x2F;project unless you mail them the zipped repo.<p>I believe, link-based sharing for private repositories with view-only access would be incredibly useful. This would allow prospective employers&#x2F;academic faculty to access this link (lets say from a CV) while still maintaining Honor Code compliance or personal interests. Adding someone as a collaborator to a private project just to show them your code does not make sense. It might help students&#x2F;developers to choose who has access to their private repositories.<p>Let me know what you think!')
