Item(by='phkahler', descendants=None, kids=[25221255], score=None, time=1606405684, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25218187, text='&gt;&gt; I think in 50 years we will find out that various state security services have been interfering with IC fabrication tech.<p>That would not surprise me at all. I was hired on contract once to help a system (not ICs) that was having issues and my work was directly obstructed (a coworker said sabotaged) by the guy (foreign) who designed one subsystem. At the time I though maybe it was his ego not liking that his boss brought me in to help and I was succeeding. When it became clear from multiple incidents that he was subtly sabotaging me I started to wonder this very thing. I showed evidence to our boss who said &quot;my hands are tied&quot; because of the corporate structure at the time. My work did make it into production and I moved on for other reasons.')
