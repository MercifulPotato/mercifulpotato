Despite its limitations, and Oracle license fees (but back then you were paying for Sun servers anyway), it worked surprisingly well and was a reasonable model for many database-driven web applications. Some of these systems were used for mission-critical global operations handling enormous amounts of money and complex business. It had a lot of advantages versus other web app stacks at the time (commonly a mountain of Perl).<p>Oracle was happy to sell database licenses but made zero effort to develop this way of using the database as a first-class capability. They were astonished that it even worked as well as it did, they did not expect people to take it that far.<p>For some types of applications, something along these lines is likely still a very ergonomic way of writing web apps, if the tooling was polished for this use case.')
