Who knows what you may find.<p>One thing I might try is looking at different religions and seeing what they have in common and what&#x27;s different, what you like and don&#x27;t like. You can select one of them, or none of them. You could also mix and match aspects from these religions for your own faith&#x2F;moral outlook. For example, many faiths share some common principles that manifest in reality such as charity, treating others with kindness, supporting one another in a community, etc. So you could find actions&#x2F;attributes of a religion to be helpful, or the community aspect of a faith-based congregation. You may not need to fervently believe in a higher power&#x2F;being to benefit from these. Many faiths welcome skeptics and encourage questions and discussions for learning. Of course you may encounter pushy or dismissive zealots in any of them.')
