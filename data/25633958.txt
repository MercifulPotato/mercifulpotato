In the middle ages quarantine typically meant keeping a ship at port and preventing from landing - and that&#x27;s a very doable thing. You literally just prevent them from dropping their gang plank, and they have supplies and everything they need on board.<p>The same does not apply to lockdowns. People need groceries, many people have limited cooking capabilities, and homes are not self sufficient - you need maintenance people, regular supplies, so on. And, those people who live in apartments and other small domiciles are not going to stay cooped up forever on end - they are going to go get food and visit people and no amount of threats is going to prevent that.<p>And that&#x27;s the issue. Lockdowns always have a maximum timetable that they&#x27;re effective for and then they suddenly become less effective - and you don&#x27;t get to reset that timer all that easily. Masks help but they are a partial solution - they have a relatively low effectiveness rate that is fine individually but in mass don&#x27;t hold up.<p>Many governments - and I&#x27;ll pick on California specifically - keep locking down tighter and tigher. Curfews, dining restrictions, gathering restrictions and more that have been going on for more than  6 months now. Do you really think getting more restrictive will be helpful at all?')
