Item(by='bird_monster', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610312481, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25716234, text='&gt; There is no value to our customers in us stringing together a pile of someone else&#x27;s products<p>Maybe not your business, but there are many businesses in which this is exactly what happens. Any managed-service is just combining other people&#x27;s work into a &quot;product&quot; that gets sold to customers. And that&#x27;s great! AWS has a staggering amount of products, and lots of business don&#x27;t even want to have to care about AWS.<p>&gt; Who out there is using 20+ AWS&#x2F;Azure&#x2F;GCP products to back a single business app and is having a fantastic time of it?<p>Several times. I think cloud products are just tools to get you further along in your business. Most of the tools I use are distributed systems tools, because I don&#x27;t want to have to own them, and container runtimes&#x2F;datastores. Every single thing I&#x27;ve ever deployed across AWS&#x2F;Azure is used as a generic interface that could be replaced relatively easily if necessary, and I&#x27;ve used Terraform to manage my infrastructure creation&#x2F;deployment process, so that I can swap resources in and out without having to change tech.<p>If, for some reason, Azure Event Hub stopped providing what we needed it for, we could certainly deploy a customized Kafka implementation and have the rest of our code not really know or care, but from when we set out to build our products, that has always been a &quot;If we need to&quot; problem, and we&#x27;ve never needed to.')
