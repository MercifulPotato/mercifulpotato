A catholic church having a budget line for &quot;cult expenses&quot; (that&#x27;s a case of wine and a box of communion wafers) wouldn&#x27;t raise eyebrows within the congregation.<p>That said, is there a temple without cult? After all a temple is a building to worship a deity. That sounds like a poor translation.')
