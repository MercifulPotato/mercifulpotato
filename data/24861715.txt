Included in the 24,172 deaths were 13,831 (57%) laboratory-confirmed COVID-19–associated deaths and 5,048 (21%) probable COVID-19–associated deaths, leaving 5,293 (22%) excess deaths that were not identified as either laboratory-confirmed or probable COVID-19–associated deaths (Figure).</i>&quot;<p>During those roughly 2 months, there were 32,107 deaths; in a normal year there would be about 32,107 - 24,172 = 7,935 deaths. Normally, that would be ~100 deaths&#x2F;day; during that time there were ~500 deaths&#x2F;day. (&quot;New York&quot; deaths peaked at about 800&#x2F;day, although I&#x27;m not sure if that was NYC or the state.)<p>Edit: Dang it. I&#x27;ll leave this here anyway.')
