That&#x27;s the number of calories you burn by lying on couch.<p>* Count your calories for food and exercise.<p>* Make sure you&#x27;re on 10-30% calorie deficit, aim for 1-1.5% total body weight loss &#x2F; week.<p>To make maintaining the diet easier, immediately cut out all products with added sugars. The sugar crashes and cravings will ease in a week or so. After that you&#x27;ll notice you don&#x27;t need to eat nearly as often, and as you decrease portion size you&#x27;ll find your stomach shrinks and you&#x27;ll feel full even with much smaller portions. Leave cheat days to once every two months or so.<p>Make sure the food is high in protein (about 1.5 grams &#x2F; pound of body mass). The problem is, if you&#x27;re not paying extra for 100% whey isolate supplement, you&#x27;re probably getting too much sugar with the supplement so getting enough protein means you&#x27;ll need to add some cardio (which in turn benefits from the protein and improves overall health). Make sure you always consume at least 20% of daily calories from fat to not hurt A&#x2F;D&#x2F;E&#x2F;K vitamin intake. If you&#x27;re obese, the calories from fat should be closer to 35% due to weakened insulin response of the body.<p>For the carbs you need and take, make sure it&#x27;s always from products that have low glycemic index (rye bread, whole wheat pasta (Rummo is fantastic) etc). If you need to consume something that&#x27;s sweet, eat it as part of a larger meal to reduce likelyhood of taking seconds etc., and to prevent blood sugar spikes that lead to blood sugar crashes that lead to binge eating.<p>If you&#x27;re doing cardio, remember to increase distance only 10% &#x2F; week to avoid over training which will slow the diet down. Stick to the 10% rule even if you think you can do more. It&#x27;s as important as counting every calorie.<p>Also, if you&#x27;re doing weights, consuming creatine etc. your body weight might increase despite fat loss, so to track body composition change the scale won&#x27;t do. Body fat calipers are cheap and easy to use: there&#x27;s sites that use e.g. Jackson-Pollock 7 to calculate body fat percentage <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.free-online-calculator-use.com&#x2F;skin-fold-test.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.free-online-calculator-use.com&#x2F;skin-fold-test.ht...</a><p>Monthly progress photos also help, although if your body fat is very high the change won&#x27;t be visible at first, but the speed of change is exponential.')
