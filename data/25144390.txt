That apologists keep talking about batteries but ignore the real problem smacks of a PR campaign.<p>* We actually don&#x27;t know if the slowdown was only for bad batteries - that&#x27;s <i>Apple&#x27;s</i> version, but it could be that they applied the throttling generally. I&#x27;m unaware of any third party who has verified this.')
