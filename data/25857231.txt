I know some indie artists who get way less than a subscription&#x27;s worth of money each month, while having a bunch of &quot;superfans&quot; who mostly listen to their their music.<p>Basically the money we pay is not going to the bands we listen to. It&#x27;s being used to appease some larger pop artist so they won&#x27;t leave the platform. Or to finance the platform itself.<p>This Lack of transparency from streaming services is a much bigger problem than the amount of money paid per stream.<p>Sure one can argue that Spotify is free to do whatever they want with the money, but it&#x27;s still not a fair deal for small artists.')
