Suppose I find (which I do) that:<p>* Julia is a joy to use and fits my use case and&#x2F;or personal development style really well;<p>* Other tools have not been such a natural match to my needs;<p>* Julia has its fair share of limitations, and someone else with different priorities would quite reasonably not find it an appropriate tool;<p>* Julia is not widely known, and other people may benefit from discovering something about Julia, just as I did.<p>How should I share my enthusiasm (and, with luck, bring Julia to someone who would enjoy it) without promulgating preachy blindsighted hype? Do I have to wait for a big language release?<p>The parent comment hints at a knife&#x27;s edge that must be walked when telling people about Julia. Anything like &quot;I use Julia for X&quot; or &quot;in Julia you can do Y this way&quot; is--understandably!--met with &quot;okay, but why Julia at all; why not a more mainstream tool like Python?&quot; But if you elaborate with &quot;I use Julia for X because I find that in this case Julia &gt; Python for reason Z,&quot; you risk being labeled an anti-Python zealot.<p>So, serious question to the parent comment author or others who feel similarly: what are some ways in which you would find it non-offputting for the Julia community to share its enthusiasm or experience with a broader audience?')
