I consider myself fairly moderate which is why I include examples of extreme views from the left (anti-vaccination theories, GMO conspiracies, 9&#x2F;11 “truthers”) in my analysis, as well. I’m not a fan of misinformation no matter what the source is and do my best to try to “lead” people away from it.<p>That being said, what do we do in this situation (which is a common one I see in these kinds of debates)?:<p>- Group A claims X.<p>- Person N asks Group A to provide evidence for their claim X.<p>- Group A cannot provide said evidence, or the evidence provided is unreliable&#x2F;cannot be validated.<p>- Person N asks for additional evidence that the claim X made by Group A is true.<p>- Group A insists they are right and refuses to provide any additional evidence for claim X.<p>- Person N chooses to not believe Group A’s claim X due to a lack of evidence.<p>What’s the next step? Assuming good faith on the sides of both parties, how do you reach some sort of agreement or conclusion?<p>And what do we do when claim X made by Group A is one that leads to violence or other societal harms (such as an increase in death and suffering due to the spread of disease in the case of anti-vaccination theories)?<p>I don’t have a good answer, here. I desperately want to have rational and productive conversations with people with whom I disagree. But how do you avoid a deadlock situation like the above?')
