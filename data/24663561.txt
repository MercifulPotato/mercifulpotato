Especially if the load balancer is CPU constrained. Make sure TLS sessions or tickets are honored (tickets prefered over sessions so servers don&#x27;t need to maintain a session database)<p>In my personal opinion, I&#x27;d rather not have the load balancer terminate TLS, but you lose a lot of features that way, and that might not be an option.')
