Item(by='pmoriarty', descendants=None, kids=[25318115], score=None, time=1607199752, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25316126, text='I&#x27;d add Heidegger&#x27;s <i>Being and Time</i> to that list, and Nietzsche&#x27;s <i>Thus Spoke Zarathustra</i> or <i>The Gay Science</i> to that list.<p>These are are probably the most significant works of Continental philosophy, and should definitely take precedence of Foucault, who&#x27;s really the only representative of Continental philosophy (with the exception of maybe Hegel) on your list.<p>It should also be made clear that plato.standford.edu is a highly biased site that mostly depicts philosophy from an Analytic perspective, where Continental thought is barely represented (or misrepresented).<p>NOTE:  As I tried to make clear in a later post in this thread, I&#x27;m <i>not</i> recommending Heidegger or Nietzsche for a beginner.  I just think their works belong on the list of the person I replied to more than do a lot of the other people he lists (many of whom, by the way, also aren&#x27;t good for beginners to start with).')
