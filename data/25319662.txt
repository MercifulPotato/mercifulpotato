So most of the time it should be possible to make DNS user-configurable (hidden in some &quot;advanced settings&quot; area). Of course, it might lead to some more support calls eventually and requires a little more money (as in paid work) to implement, but you&#x27;d be playing nice and have a balanced compromise of default-hardcoded-DNS with an option to appease power users and&#x2F;or orgs+corps, and you&#x27;d also avoid angry-me calling your support hotline and ranting at your people :P')
