Slide stock, Kodak Portra, beautiful B&amp;W by Ilford... I should store it in a freezer but that would make holding costs high, and there&#x27;s a going market for good and bad film at any condition (there&#x27;s CVS-brand film on ebay)...<p>These rolls have the capacity to produce beautiful imagery in my incapable hands, and I know them to have great value -- my 120 format Portras smoke anything in your digital quiver when it comes to displaying beautiful people in outdoor-sized frames.<p>I can pretty much sell a handful of Ilfords in 2-3 weeks and buy my wife a nice steak dinner. Is it money?')
