I take a windy road to work and had never had traction control activate. When it kicked in, it pulsed the right front brake and slowed the car quickly, likely unnerving the guy tailgating me. This happened several times, both going to and from work. The road was perfectly dry, no snow or rain. Same turns at the same speed as always.<p>The clues are was that my rear tires had worn and I replaced them a few days before. And, I drive a Tesla Model 3. It&#x27;s a rear-wheel drive version and the front tires still had good tread so I didn&#x27;t replace them.<p>Why the right front tire?<p>What I finally brained out, which you may have quickly realized, is that the diameters of the worn front and new rear tires were then slightly different. The front had a lower diameter than the rear and therefore turned at a slightly faster rate when driving.<p>When I took a hard bank, the outside wheels also turned faster than the inside as they do in any turn. That increased the delta in spin rate the most between the outside worn front tire and the inside new rear tire. The traction control determined that the right front must be slipping and pulsed the brake on it.<p>I replaced the front tires and everything went back to normal.')
