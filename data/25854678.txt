Learn to do the bare minimum first, which for Vim is modes and how to exit. Then, after you find yourself doing something slowly a few times over, search how to speed it up (e.g. yank &amp; paste, different buffers, macros). This is also a good counter argument for &quot;the learning curve is too steep&quot;.')
