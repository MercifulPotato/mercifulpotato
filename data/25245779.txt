Beyond that, there is an argument here for having transparent practices. There is nothing preventing youtube from saying the truth about what they do.<p>Indeed.<p>About the criticism, it really sounds like that to me in the video. It implies in the way it is written, and I don&#x27;t wanna go over details of the script, but pay attention to moments when he mentions &quot;like a good democracy&quot; and so on.<p>The current status of world dominance&#x2F;power is an evolution of previous iterations (be it good or bad).

It is just one more player amongst many, and just a continuation of something that is going on since the Romans.')
