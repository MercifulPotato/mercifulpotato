The common employees don&#x27;t get a vote. Their managers are not elected. They don&#x27;t get a say in policy. The managers in turn form a strict hierarchy, much like in feudal times, with a top-down structure. A junior manager cannot say no to a senior manager. Nobody can say no to the CEO.<p>In this picture HR is essentially <i>the inquisition</i>. The inquisition was most certainly not the friend of the common man!<p>If you buck the system, if you step out of your place, if you&#x27;re a commoner upsetting a lord, then you will be treated much like your ancestors would have been treated long ago: You will be put to the question. The inquisition will spare no pain to determine exactly why you stepped out of line and upset the natural order of things.')
