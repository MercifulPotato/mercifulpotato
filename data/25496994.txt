Item(by='atomicnumber3', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608571090, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25496888, text='A stock option is a contract that entitles the holder of the option to either buy or sell stock at a price specified at the time of the contracts creation (this is the “strike price”). The price can be anything. The value of the option is, very roughly speaking, the difference between the current price (“spot price”) and the strike price. The action of using your contract to actually do the buying or selling of shares is called “exercising” the option, and it “uses up” the contract. Each contract is for 100 shares (a “round lot”). When exercising your option and then buying or selling the shares immediately at the strike price would make you money, the option is said to be “in the money”. If not, the option is “out of the money”.<p>The parent comment is noting that their options are out of the money, so they’re worthless. No point in exercising.<p>Options are highly complicated financial instrument though, so this is a very rough explanation. This is not financial advice.')
