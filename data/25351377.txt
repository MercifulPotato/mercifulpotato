I am frequently in situations where I&#x27;m out in public and something warrants saying, where one or both of us are wearing airpods. Transparency mode would be worth so much more if other people were able to see that I can hear them, and vice versa. There have been so many improvements to apple devices which are obvious to anyone with an eye for what&#x27;s missing but for which we&#x27;ve had to wait 5-10 years before they materialize, if ever. I am resigned to this being something I can look forward to in 2030.')
