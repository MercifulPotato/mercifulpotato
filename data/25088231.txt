Another problematic situation can be if the mistake involves actual illegal acts. In those cases, discretion (omitting the apology or keeping it to an absolute minimum) may indeed be the better part of valor.<p>But even in those situations, I see absolutely no upside in publicly denying your mistake at length, if in fact you&#x27;ve made one.')
