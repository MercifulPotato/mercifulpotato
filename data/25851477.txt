This article cites the origin of the memo as the ACLU defending white nationalists&#x27; rights to protest in 2017. This is a hard issue. They&#x27;re not saying free speech isn&#x27;t absolute, they&#x27;re saying they have finite resources and a number of civil rights they&#x27;re trying to protect- and they&#x27;re clearly outlining, explicitly, the right of hate groups to say their bullshit even when it runs directly opposed the ACLU&#x27;s values.<p>I think the actual leaked memo is a phenomenal read and very well balanced. : <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;online.wsj.com&#x2F;public&#x2F;resources&#x2F;documents&#x2F;20180621ACLU.pdf?mod=article_inline" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;online.wsj.com&#x2F;public&#x2F;resources&#x2F;documents&#x2F;20180621AC...</a><p>Excellent quotes from that memo:<p>&gt; “although the democratic standardsin which the ACLU believes and for which it fights run directly counter to thephilosophy of the Klan and other ultra-right groups, the vitality of the democratic institutions the ACLU defends lies in their equal application to all.”<p>&gt;We also recognize that not defending fundamental liberties can come at considerable cost. If the ACLU avoids the defense of controversial speakers, and defends only those with whom it agrees,both the freedom of speech and the ACLU itself may suffer.The organization may lose credibility with allies, supporters, and other communities, requiring the expenditure of resources to mitigate those harms. Thus, there are often costs both from defending a given speaker and not defending that speaker.Because we are committed to the principle that free speech protects everyone, the speaker’s viewpoint should not be the decisive factor in our decision to defend speech rights.<p>Considerations in prioritizing cases:<p>&gt; Whether the speaker seeks to engage in or promote violence<p>&gt; Whether the speakers seek to carryweapons<p>&gt; The impact of the proposed speechand the impact of its suppression<p>&gt; The extent to which we are able tomake clear that even as we defend aspeaker’s right to say what they want, we reserve our right to condemn the views themselves')
