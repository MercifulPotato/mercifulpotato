Item(by='wombatmobile', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605571832, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25117362, text='I just started hosting with AirBNB and experienced a bug with the platform.  It offered the wrong price ($100 instead of $278) and the guest accepted before I could intervene because the platform defaulted to AutoAccept.<p>When I reported the problem, the support rep claimed it happened that way because I had &quot;Smart Pricing&quot; on.  It was set ON by default.  But AirBNB&#x27;s own documentation says the Custom Price I set for the dates in question (Xmas week) override all other pricing.<p>Even if &quot;Smart Pricing&quot; had applied, it shouldn&#x27;t have offered the lowest price for the highest demand week of the year, because AirBNB&#x27;s own calendar shows the demand peaking high for the week, not low.<p>Now I&#x27;ve been 3 days trying to get a response from tech support.<p>They deny responsibility, and promise to escalate it to a supervisor, then close the case without responding to my detailed evidence.<p>What can I do?  Does anyone know how to escalate to an AirBNB IT person?  I would have thought AirBNB would like to know its platform has a serious bug.')
