As others have said and you already know, the first couple of years of a kid is the toughest for parents. It gets better from there and I know I&#x27;ll get more free time back pretty much as soon as she starts school, and I&#x27;ll have more and more free time as she grows older gradually. By the time she&#x27;s in high school I&#x27;ll probably have just as much free time as before having kids.')
