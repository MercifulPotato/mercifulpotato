Item(by='reificator', descendants=None, kids=[24683750], score=None, time=1601793184, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24675038, text='&gt; <i>The template given was nothing like that, at all.</i><p>That&#x27;s fair, I waded in to discuss a related pet issue and it&#x27;s probably not fair to have posted the way I did.<p>&gt; <i>Regardless, I firmly believe that this attitude is keeping many people out of the tech business, let alone open source. Society shows that niceties are wanted and work, especially by women, a demographic under-represented in most parts of tech. I also find that not showing niceties is a display of dominance and self-importance, again, something that isn&#x27;t going to bring more people into tech.</i><p>Let&#x27;s start with the part where I said &quot;though I don&#x27;t usually respond so.&quot;  It irritates me, but I tolerate it because my goal is to help people.<p>As for not having space for stories&#x2F;niceties driving away women, I don&#x27;t walk into the emergency room and think &quot;man, this is a sausage fest&quot;.  Usually there are vastly more women working there than men.  Yet from discussions I&#x27;ve had with people who work in that area this is a common frustration there as well.<p>&quot;You&#x27;re bleeding, I don&#x27;t need to hear about how depressed you&#x27;ve been since your grades are poor, fast forward to the part where you slipped while drunk and fell onto a broken beer bottle so I know what kind of treatment to administer.&quot;  That&#x27;s a made up example but is actually less ridiculous than the actual examples I&#x27;ve heard.<p>I&#x27;m not saying to leave out relevant details, but when you&#x27;re bleeding or have broken bones or your left side is going numb, just tell the doctor the facts, as concisely and as clearly as you can.<p>If you want to tell stories, go to your primary doctor when you&#x27;re not facing an emergency.  Or, and this is not dismissive so please don&#x27;t interpret it as such, go to a therapist, or a councilor.<p>A bug report on an issue tracker is obviously not life threatening in the vast vast majority of cases, but it&#x27;s the same idea.  It&#x27;s where you go when things are broken, so tell me what&#x27;s broken and the relevant context.<p>If you want to give thanks or talk about what you like or how you get value from the project or whatever, there are other venues for that and I encourage you to use them. Or put it at the end of the issue thread after the problem is at least identified.  I&#x27;ve never been upset at someone for clearly expressing the problem and then saying thanks when I fix or acknowledge it.<p>EDIT:<p>&gt; <i>I also find that not showing niceties is a display of dominance and self-importance, again, something that isn&#x27;t going to bring more people into tech.</i><p>It takes some serious mental gymnastics to turn a focus on helping people as quickly as possible into &quot;a display of dominance and self-importance&quot;.  I&#x27;m specifically asking people to not kiss my ass about &quot;how much this project helped them during a dark time in their life&quot; or whatever so I can get to the root of the problem they&#x27;re encountering and resolve it.<p>It&#x27;s incredibly bad faith to claim that trying to be efficient with my volunteered time so I can help as many people as possible is an attempt to dominate the people I&#x27;m helping.  Frankly this sentence makes me question your motives here.  Had I taken this sentence in earlier I wouldn&#x27;t have responded to your post at all.')
