Trulicity recently because of high blood glucose; also acts as an appetite suppressant for some people.<p>Most truck drivers in the US take a physical and get a two year medical card. Diabetics that demonstrate blood glucose control get one year.<p>At my last physical my blood glucose was way out of control (my bad), and they gave me a three month card and &quot;come back way better than this in three months.&quot;<p>I then ate mostly meat, cheese, plain greek yogurt, and protein bars (17g carbs) and protein shakes (5g). Pre-sliced apples and frozen vegetables. Minimal cheating, confessed in my diary. Most of my shopping is Walmart, because you can park a truck up in there.<p>In regular consultation with a nutritionist in my doctor&#x27;s office (I send her my weekly carb and blood glucose diary), I generally eat anywhere from 40 to 80 grams of carbs, according to labels, or Wolfram Alpha when needed. Occasionally low hundreds.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wolframalpha.com&#x2F;input&#x2F;?i=nutrition" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wolframalpha.com&#x2F;input&#x2F;?i=nutrition</a><p>Not quite keto, but low and mostly disciplined. Minimal exercise.<p>My glucose readings went from high 300s (like I said, out of control) to 90s and low hundreds. My nutritionist saw a few low 80s in my diary and warned me that 80 is moving into &quot;low blood glucose.&quot;<p>Aaannd ... I&#x27;ve lost 30 pounds; 220 to 190, at 5&#x27;11&quot;. That was an absolute and unanticipated side effect.<p>The other main diabetic measure is A1C, which requires a blood draw. Last recent physical was 14, double what&#x27;s reasonable. It&#x27;s a 3 month average, so it won&#x27;t be where I want it to be after 3 months, but I expect enough improvement to regain my one year medical card.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Glycated_hemoglobin" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Glycated_hemoglobin</a><p>All this (and the &quot;minimal exercise&quot; comment) to say &quot;low carbs good, added sugar and processed grain really bad.&quot;<p>As a trucker, almost everything I eat comes in a package, and is cooked in my microwave or eaten directly out of my little refrigerator. I read the labels, and put it back if there&#x27;s added sugar, or enough carbs that that one meal would dominate my carb budget. I eat oatmeal (with water, not milk, my preference) almost every morning, steel cut and out of the round cardboard container, <i>not</i> flavored floor sweepings in envelopes.<p>Read the labels. And if you&#x27;re diabetic, stick your fingers every day, <i>even if you don&#x27;t use insulin</i>. If you don&#x27;t read your blood glucose regularly, you could be lying to yourself.<p>Anecdote of one.')
