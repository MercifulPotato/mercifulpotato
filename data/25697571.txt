I like to think I am as well. I guess reading your initial comment, I assumed that you were saying the overwhelmingly peaceful protests associated with George Floyd were the same as those who peacefully participated in the protests but not in the violent insurrection; but I just can’t think of the peaceful maga protesters in the same light as those peacefully protesting for fairer policing. I agree with you that it’s very nuanced, but I make a distinction because of the visuals and results of the assault on the Capitol by the extremes of their group. Furthermore, one side worships Trump and his actions while the other just fundamentally wants fairer and better police.\nI know my post came out as aggressive, that was not right. For that I apologize and believe you were not equivocating.\n(Trying to convey nuance on mobile is hard, sorry for word soup)')
