Here is what a reset stylesheet like normalize.css does: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;DEVtCXp.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;DEVtCXp.png</a> .

This is just my personal boilerplate CSS that I find myself writing on multiple text-based websites I create for fun.<p><i>&gt; I think if you want to really add value, create a version that also works for responsive web sites.</i><p>Did you find any specific problems with this CSS with respect to responsiveness? I believe the minimal stylesheet changes that this CSS introduces should work well for any web page design, regardless of whether it is responsive or not.<p>On a general note, advising me on how I should spend my leisure time, while may be well-intentioned, is still a little unsolicited, don&#x27;t you think? :-)<p><i>&gt; In any case, making it easy for others to use with the cdn links is a good step and your documentation is very clean - good work on that. But again, this is exceptionally basic stuff. Not sure why itâ€™s on the front page of HN.</i><p>Thank you. This is very basic stuff indeed. I am by no means a frontend developer or a fullstack developer and I know there are plenty of other classless stylesheets that work better, in general. This is just a small stylesheet that works well for me. If it works well for others like me who develop text-based websites, that&#x27;s a bonus.')
