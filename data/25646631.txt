Came up with it because happy hours during Covid had no side conversations, spontaneous chats, etc. and figured that&#x27;s the whole point. It&#x27;s somewhat do-able with Zoom&#x27;s breakout rooms, but if you have a company of 60 people and what people to be able to chat in random groups of 3 for 5 minutes for an hour, the person manually creating all these breakout rooms would go insane.<p>I&#x27;d like to continue running the tech&#x2F;product side, but looking for a CEO&#x2F;co-founder to run the biz dev, strategy, marketing etc.<p>I&#x27;m Brian, a 30 y&#x2F;o Canadian living in NYC (but totally happy to work with someone remotely, ofc). I&#x27;ve co-founded and ran the engineering teams of two other tech startups, and currently doing misc tech consulting and freelancing.')
