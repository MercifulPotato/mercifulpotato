Item(by='mistermann', descendants=None, kids=[25131317], score=None, time=1605652729, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25130349, text='To some degree I think, but I think burden of proof is kind of shared int his situation.<p>The general topic of the thread is ~government agencies &quot;being bad&quot;, with several people complaining that ~&quot;people don&#x27;t care&quot; about privacy.<p>I submitted for consideration the notion that governments engage in &quot;conspiracy theories&quot;, and covering them up.  Evidence can be provided for this - there is plenty on record.<p>A point of contention then arose:<p>&gt;&gt; How is this story related to QAnon or a conspiracy theory? I feel like this is a true example of &quot;begging the question&quot;, you just sort of assumed that part was true.<p>&gt;&gt; Who in the US is &quot;taking care of&quot; stories? If you&#x27;re going to make bold claims like this, include some details.<p>And then:<p>&gt; I wonder: does your mind desire evidence when it encounters the inverse of my ideas?<p>So what would be an inverse of my idea.  By my reckoning, a valid example would be where someone asserts that a story should be ignored <i>because it is attributed to QAnon</i>, or even better, when someone disputes that claim, and then the channel goes silent.<p>I don&#x27;t mind &quot;losing an argument&quot; on a technicality, the elephants in the room being discussed (or, explicit mentions of them &quot;not being seen&quot;) is more than enough for me.  To me, this is kind of the logical equivalent of asking conspiracy theorists where the evidence is that substantiates their characterization of the state of reality.  One would think, at some point at least one person might realize and acknowledge that indeed, there are some things that occur (or do not occur) in reality that we do not know all the details of...that some portions of reality <i>are unknown</i>.  One would think.')
