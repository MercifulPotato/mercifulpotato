At the core of this product there is our own port of AOSP running in an x86_64 container instead of on an ARM SOC. We have <i>tons</i> of cool work to be done on this platform: custom services, optimizing resource usage, tweaking UI&#x27;s, etc.<p>We are looking for someone who is strong at graphics and multimedia, is comfortable with both C++ and Java, and most important of all: who has loads of experience hacking their way around all levels of AOSP. We are located in The Netherlands, although with the current COVID situation I guess there is no hurry to move. Being in .eu time zone is a pro.<p>If you are interested, please drop mail me at hn@zevv.nl and I&#x27;ll be glad to answer any questions and provide more details.<p>Official version:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.activevideo.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;senior-c-android-system-software-engineer" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.activevideo.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;senior-c-android-system-...</a>)')
