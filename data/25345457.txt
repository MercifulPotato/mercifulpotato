They only took the advantageous positions after it&#x27;d been reduced to ruble.<p>The Germans also helped evacuate as much of the stuff inside as possible, moving it to the Vatican, where the monks trusted the Germans wouldn&#x27;t steal the stuff. To further trust amongst the locals and monks, a monk accompanied every truck to the Vatican. As a result most of the library was saved.<p>Monte Cassino is one of the (many) examples of Allied war crimes and one of the (very) few examples of German honor in WWII.')
