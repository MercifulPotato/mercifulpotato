But it should adhere to the maximum possible device accessibly standards (to ensure me and my US buisness clients don’t get snared up with legal landlines) and it should also be light on system resources(only using the original web safe fonts and colors) but still look modern and good. I was thinking about copying off a government accessibility program webpage.  Maybe I will not even use JavaScript and do all html page rendering server side for maximum accessibility. Ideally I would like the homepage to have that golden amp symbol on Google and instant page load. Ideally I would like to even support the system light&#x2F;dark theme. I want the best of both worlds, accessibility and looking good on both legacy devices like old phones in India and also the state of the art 4k-8k monitors. Is such a thing possible? Is there such a golden layout? What would you recommend? I am a notice html&#x2F;css site builder (and a pretty good copier), and I’m a pretty good Java programmer. I plan to do all dynamic page generation using Java servlets since I’m most familiar with Java. What general advice do you have for a web dev doing this for survival in uncertain economic times?')
