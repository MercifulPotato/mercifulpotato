A service is a service, whether it&#x27;s running Lambda, Spring Boot, or whatever the hottest new framework is... Nothing prevents you from documenting a service. Nothing prevents you from creating basic alarms (it&#x27;s literally easier for me to create these alarms because of CDK than it is to alarm on the standard service framework I use).<p>We get it, you don&#x27;t like serverless.
