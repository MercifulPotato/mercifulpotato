I&#x27;m playing with iCE40HX8K at the moment (Olimex iCE40HX8K-EVB board). I was able to configure a RV32I based SoC with APB3, UART, Timer, RAM and SDRAM controller that fits in 2500 LUTs. I&#x27;m using SpinalHDL, which appeared to be a very convenient object oriented way of defining your hardware. SpinalHDL is a Scala based HDL language (Chisel from HiFive is another one, also Scala based) that compiles to a very long Verilog file which you then feed to IceStorm toolchain (Yosys) to synthesize bitstream for FPGA. It also allows to incorporate RV32I binary which deploys right into BRAM of your FPGA after startup. I think iCE40 is a very good FPGA to start learning open source design tools.')
