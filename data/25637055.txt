A lot of the reasons why the judiciaries appointed by him didn&#x27;t go along with his blatant attempts to undermine the election has to do with their values and believes.<p>I&#x27;m not trying to say Americans are somehow better people than others but want to point out the important role unwritten rules and social norms have in our governance. Quite a few countries have tried to establish their government along the same lines as the US, UK, etc. but failed even though their structure is similar to ours and I think a lot of it has to do with what sorts of values people have and hold onto.  In fact, the UK has even more unwritten rules than the US -- they lack a constitution but still functions well as a democracy. Pre-WWII Japan copied their government from the UK and it ended up more or less a military state.')
