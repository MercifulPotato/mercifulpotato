The people there, they are the kinds of people that follow crazy conspiracies and do mass shootings, tens thousands of them. They&#x27;ve been antagonized and fueled this antigovernment narrative, some of them for almost 30 years by the shock jock grifters.<p>They got their storm, the pitchfork moment and relatively little violence happened, it lasted just an afternoon, then they left, not returning the next day and now people are being arrested in a way that doesn&#x27;t martyr them as revolutionaries or put them into any kind of overarching constructive narrative.<p>They weren&#x27;t lined up against the wall and taken care of like revolutionaries but instead individually arrested like common criminals. There was no clear &quot;deep state&quot; repression or large arrests to stoke the conspiracies of prison camps etc.<p>The storm happened. It was a dud.\nAfterwards the conspiracy social media accounts were denouncing the Republican party. Almost like the Republicans were able to shake off this toxic part of their coalition in the exchange.<p>This is an extremely favorable outcome for the establishment. They even got to shut down a bunch of the biggest troublemakers in the process. So really I don&#x27;t know what to think. Brilliant execution or dumb luck, maybe a bit of both...')
