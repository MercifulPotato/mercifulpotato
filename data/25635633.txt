Such a rig travels about 500 miles per day, has a fuel economy of about 6 mpg and burns an extra 15 gallons for the refrigeration, all in all, about 100 gallons per day. At about 35000 kcal&#x2F;gallon, that&#x27;s about 3.5 million kcal to travel for one day. So you need to move around for more than 11 days to get just to a 1:1 ratio.')
