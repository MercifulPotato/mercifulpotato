Plain reference counting with move semantic optimizations, offers a shared heap. It offers deterministic performance for hard realtime systems. Reference cycles cause memory leaks, beware.\n--gc:orc. Same as -gc:arc but adds a cycle collector based on &quot;trial deletion&quot;. Unfortunately that makes its performance profile hard to reason about so it is less useful for hard realtime systems.\n--gc:none. No memory management strategy nor garbage collector. Allocated memory is simply never freed. You should use --gc:arc instead.<p>Nim offers alloc, dealloc, allocShared, deallocShared')
