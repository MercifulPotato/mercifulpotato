Item(by='the8472', descendants=None, kids=[25348770, 25372187], score=None, time=1607445507, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25343415, text='&gt;  would in reality consist of a 1 hour drive to the port, followed by 1 hour check-in and a 1 hour boat ride to the off-shore launch facilities. Next you&#x27;d have at least 1 hour of boarding procedures (limited elevator space, pressure suit fitting, seating) followed by fuelling (maybe another hour?). So after about 5 hours or so you are finally clear for launch<p>I see that the TSA mindflayers have not been kind to you. Many of those steps do not have to be performed sequentially. For example check-in and suit-up could be performed on the ferry. And if you&#x27;re already throwing stupendous amounts of money at travel then you also don&#x27;t have to pick a <i>slow</i> ferry, consider jet hydrofoils. And you don&#x27;t even have to start at some port far from a city. If the city has a major river it could take up passengers in the middle of the city, travel down the river and on towards the launch platform.\nAnd if we&#x27;re talking about strapping hundreds of people onto rockets then the safety margins on everything would have to be improved far enough that the dry-loading probably is not needed anymore either.<p>As far as logistics go it seems hard but possible. But you may be right that regulatory conditions could prove prohibitive since not everyone will just go along with musk&#x27;s plans.')
