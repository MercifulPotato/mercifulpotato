Item(by='davismwfl', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610416731, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25734419, text='I&#x27;d argue that in Point 1 of the AUP you linked to gives them all the out they need: &quot;...adversely affects Hurricane&#x27;s legal interests.&quot; and then the two sub bullets, #6 &amp; #7 both give them lots of grey area to terminate hosting.  Not to mention they state you will enforce an at least equally strict and enforceable agreement with any of the users utilizing your system.<p>To be fair, I think most reasonable people would say sub points #6 and #7 seem pretty fair, at least on the face of it they do to me.  But what one person considers a threat another considers banter and hence we have scenarios where people can easy run afoul of some morality judgement by an employee or exec at the company.  It doesn&#x27;t have to be as blatant as a death threat it could be some banter via an innuendo and suddenly they ban your account.  Sure, you can sue, argue your point, but either way your business would be offline.  Just the first part I quoted, all they have to say is your content or users affect their legal interests in some way and again subjective and your done.')
