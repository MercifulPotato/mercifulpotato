What does gender have to do with population density? I chose population density, because it was the only value that I could think of that closely correlated with culture and that was not a protected status (ie, not race, religion, sex, etc). If it&#x27;s done algorithmically, it doesn&#x27;t seem like a bad measure.<p>Anyhow, the &quot;who gets to choose&quot; thing is tough. Right now legislators get to choose, but the judges said that they are failing at that, so IIRC, now an academic from a state university got to make some map adjustment. Ideally, I&#x27;d have a committee of academics provide vetted map recommendations that elected officials choose from, and that a judge signs off on.')
