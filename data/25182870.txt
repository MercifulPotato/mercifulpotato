Harvey Weinstein is a convicted rapist that has been sentenced to 23 years in prison. As far as I understand it, that&#x27;s not a political talking point on account of it being a quickly-verifiable fact. Is the distinction between &quot;alleged&quot; and &quot;convicted&quot; a political one?<p>Again, not trying to start an argument or troll, but how would someone talk about this topic in a way that&#x27;s &quot;apolitical&quot;?')
