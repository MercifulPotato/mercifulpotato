Item(by='senko', descendants=None, kids=[25222323, 25222023, 25220986], score=None, time=1606404914, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25220381, text='People buying that (kind of) car don&#x27;t care, and I doubt there&#x27;s so many of them that it would significantly skew the numbers (GLE class is not even in the list - assuming GLC and GLE are similar enough for this particular list, even GLC are modest numbers <i>and</i> they&#x27;re plug-in hybrid, which is better than a mild hybrid).<p>However I do agree with you that many of the cars - essentially the entire milid-hybrid (MHEV) segment, IMO - is there just to get the numbers (electric motor kicks in just enough to lower the max CO2 in special cases). Locally (Croatia, HR), virtually all new cars have at least a MHEV option and some have no non-e option at all. They&#x27;re really pushing it hard.<p>Even though MHEV could be considered &quot;lipstick on a pig&quot;, it still has two useful effects:<p>- If it does lower CO2 emission in worst cases (start, overtake, etc), it still means it lowers the overall CO2 at least somewhat - every little bit helps.<p>- It normalizes electric vehicles. There are a people here who have extremely negative (subjective) opinions on them, and I&#x27;m talking general public, not petrolheads. Once you get a Slav to understand his (it&#x27;s always his) beloved Golf running on batteries is not an abomination, the floodgates are open<p>Due to high gas prices, main impediment to switching to fully electric cars is not cost but infrastructure. In Croatia there&#x27;s very little of it and it&#x27;s often vandalized or gas-powered cars are parked in charging spots, etc. Thus a pleasant road-trip to the country or the coast turns into a logistical nightmare.<p>Similarly, for plug-hybrids, a lot of people that would have the means to buy such a car usually live in apartment buildings, often without dedicated parking spots so you have to hunt for a space around the block and you can&#x27;t just plug in your car overnight.')
