However, the difference is between components lasting thousands of rounds vs tens of thousands of rounds - meaningful, but we&#x27;re not talking &quot;two shots then the barrel melts.&quot;<p>As far as range goes, that has far less to do with whether or not the components in question were homemade, and more to do with physics - namely, barrel length, the caliber of bullet you&#x27;re firing, and how much powder is being used. Longer barrel = more complete burn of the powder = higher projectile velocity. The aerodynamics of projectiles is rather complex, but you can rule of thumb it as &quot;heavier projectiles are more accurate, lighter projectiles go farther, faster.&quot; This is a long way of saying, as long as the barrel meets a certain threshold of quality (which, homemade firearms have met), it&#x27;s not going to matter unless you&#x27;re shooting out past 200 yards. Furthermore, barrels are (in the US anyway) cheap, plentiful, and entirely unregulated.')
