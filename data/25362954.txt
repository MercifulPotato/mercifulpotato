It wasn&#x27;t veganism. It was a variant of vegetarianism.<p>As an example, chicken are animal welfare unfriendly, whereas they&#x27;re environment friendly. As are insects; a very cheap and reliable resource of protein. The interests of an animal welfare activist are not always aligned with the interests of an environmentalist activist (I don&#x27;t even like the term &#x27;activist&#x27; TBH, as it implies the others do nothing).<p>I also have a litter picker, and re: &quot;the likes of you&quot;: no, I don&#x27;t consciously throw litter away on the street. I even keep plastic with me to recycle at home.<p>I don&#x27;t follow any dogma, except I try to reduce my impact.<p>&gt; That&#x27;s what needs to change in the world. You. How much meat do you eat? Cut that amount in half.<p>You preach to the converted. I barely eat meat as it is, I often eat vegan, too. But what I am not going to care about is the examples I mentioned (another one is insect protein as insects don&#x27;t have a CNS) throughout this thread, as their impact on animal welfare is very minimal. Just having one person eating one time a week no meat is going to have more impact.<p>You said vegans eat less avocado than non-vegans. I&#x27;m confident statistical analysis on that will prove otherwise.<p>&gt; Animal slaughter for anything is wrong. Animals have long-been put as second class and that&#x27;s what needs to change. Why?, why not. And your a prime example of someone who&#x27;s first class who clearly shows; you don&#x27;t really care.<p>I actually do care but I try to be realistic and practical. My approach is long-term. Most people eat meat, and they&#x27;re not going to change that. They like the taste, they like the structure. If lab meat is a 1:1 copy of that, and it can be priced competitively, there&#x27;s no more need for the bio industry. Its going to be a massive blow for animal suffering, world-wide. More impact than all of the people who are vegan <i>combined</i>.<p>&gt; Why are we still using animals, that&#x27;s a question which no one can ever seem to answer.<p>That&#x27;s akin to the question why we still use fossil fuels. Because it has its advantages. For example, as you put:<p>&gt; Being all-out honest I don&#x27;t even like vegan products, they taste crap.<p>I actually like a lot of the vegetarian and vegan products, but they&#x27;re generally not priced competitively, and the taste isn&#x27;t 1:1 (though there&#x27;s been <i>a lot</i> of improvement last 20 years -- 10 of which I was a full-time vegetarian, and 2 of which I was a full-time vegan).')
