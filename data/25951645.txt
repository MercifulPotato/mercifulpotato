I can&#x27;t see this ending well.<p>This, so much - imagine you believe &quot;they&quot; stole the election, &quot;they&quot; got your favorite social media shut down (parler&#x2F;gab&#x2F;whatever), &quot;they&quot; blocked the buying of options, &quot;they&quot; then liquidated your position as the price predictably fail and you got margin called, you complained but &quot;they&quot; got your feedback deleted. Ouch.<p>I can&#x27;t see this ending well at all. The executive will have to be extremely careful with what they will enact.
