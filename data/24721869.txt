This effectively turns Privacy Badger for the majority of users into another block list.</i><p>Yes. Privacy Badger was not just an anti-tracker. It&#x27;s also something of an ad blocker. Since ad sites tend to track, it learns to block them.<p>Checking &quot;cnn.com&quot; right now, Privacy Badger is blocking 36 sites. These include &quot;static.ads-twitter.com&quot;, &quot;c.amazon-adsystem.com&quot;, &quot;www.googletagmanager.com&quot;, &quot;ad.doubleclick.net&quot;, and &quot;amplify.outbrain.com&quot;. Blocking those knocks out most of the ads from the big players. Two of those are Google&#x27;s, and they probably don&#x27;t like being blocked by a large number of users.<p>Taking that away to prevent a theoretical approach to tracking seems like a sell-out by EFF.')
