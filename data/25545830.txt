Intel and AMD are incrementally modifying their discreet processor architectures to provide competitive hybrid architectures together with some SoC aspects as AnandTech describes in detail [2].<p>The Wired article also describes Qualcomm as a competitor coming from the ARM big.LITTLE side of the equation while leaving out other competitors like Samsung and (the defunct?) Huawei&#x2F;HiSilicon. Nvidia, the current leader in discreet GPU silicon and former competitor in the smartphone&#x2F;tablet-class silicon market, has announced the acquisition of ARM [3], which adds an interesting plot twist to the competitive landscape.<p>The hybrid core architectures require new schedulers in the OS kernel. Transitioning to new&#x2F;alternative Instruction Set Architectures, like x64 to ARM64, also requires a translation layer like Apple&#x27;s Rosetta 2 to help the software transition. Microsoft Windows currently lags being Apple on both of these fronts.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Apple_M1#Architecture" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Apple_M1#Architecture</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.anandtech.com&#x2F;show&#x2F;15877&#x2F;intel-hybrid-cpu-lakefield-all-you-need-to-know" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.anandtech.com&#x2F;show&#x2F;15877&#x2F;intel-hybrid-cpu-lakefi...</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Arm_Ltd.#Changes_of_ownership" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Arm_Ltd.#Changes_of_ownership</a>')
