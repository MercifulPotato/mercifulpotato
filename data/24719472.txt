Say the reason is that it saves both of us time. It takes longer to read code than to write it. So while it may take me thirty minutes to solve the challenge, it could take your team hours to read it and understand it, so let&#x27;s get the easy part out of the way first.<p>Don&#x27;t ask to be compensated. Don&#x27;t push back. If that&#x27;s their process then that&#x27;s their process. But you can make suggestions in the interest of saving them time. They&#x27;ll appreciate that.')
