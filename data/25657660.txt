Item(by='drcongo', descendants=None, kids=[25657997], score=None, time=1609940911, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25657323, text='I had Threema installed but not set up so your comment prompted me to set it up and I don&#x27;t think they could have come up with a more confusing setup if they&#x27;d tried.<p>First screen asked me to wiggle my finger on the screen without offering any explanation. Second screen gave me a random string and told me that&#x27;s my ID. Third screen asked me to add a password for Threema Safe, whatever that is. I then couldn&#x27;t leave that screen at all because the on-screen keyboard covered over the next button, and the one big green button that was visible did nothing. Eventually I accidentally swiped and got to another screen that asked me what Threema Safe I wanted to use, like I have any idea what a Threema Safe is. After that it asked me to put in a username, even though I already have a Threema ID from several screens ago. Then it asked for my phone number. So now it has a Threema ID, a phone number and a username and I have to guess which of those is useful. Then it asked me to sync my contacts, I didn&#x27;t do that. Finally, I got to a screen with a QR code, my nickname, my Threema ID, something asking me to Enter Code for Linked Number, and a Key Fingerprint. This thing bears only a passing resemblance to a messaging app.<p>Most of that setup I kind of understand, but then I&#x27;m the sort of person who reads HN. There is not a hope in hell of getting even 1% of the people I know to even make it through the setup process though.<p>Once inside, I apparently have one contact called ECHOECHO who, when I message them, repeat the message back to me. The messaging UI is slightly nicer than Signal and WhatsApp&#x27;s though, but not as nice as Telegram&#x27;s.')
