The PureOS distro is based on Gnome so GTK is the blessed framework for app development. However, Qt works just as well, and is used a lot in KDE&#x27;s Plasma Mobile. And if that doesn&#x27;t suit you either, any other framework will work, with the caveat that they might not support mobile form factor natively.')
