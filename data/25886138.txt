Item(by='dragonwriter', descendants=None, kids=[25889973], score=None, time=1611436318, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25885949, text='&gt; A McDonalds double cheeseburger meal costs $8.<p>&gt; I remember when that was 3.99 not too long ago. Somehow I doubt that price difference is captured by the official 1 - 2% inflation rate.<p>Probably not exactly (and maybe not even approximately), because while restaurant meals are included in the CPI, the CPI is a somewhat broader index than the “McDonald’s double cheeseburger meal index” (also, McDonald&#x27;s prices have regional and even store-to-store variation, and it&#x27;s possible your local prices have varied differently than average for that particular item.)')
