Item(by='piaste', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602002871, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24698913, text='&gt; and that needs to be achieved first before we can achieve a GitOps philosophy like Weave Cloud.<p>I think &quot;[automatically] export all generated YAML templates and CLI commands as a git commit &#x2F; git patch&quot; is something that may be worth supporting even without the import of existing templates.<p>First, it should be much easier, since you&#x27;re already doing the hard work of generating those strings. Exporting them as a git patch could be as straightforward as keeping an internal repo folder and running git format-patch.<p>Second, it would make for a much easier sell to greenfield projects (which don&#x27;t need import), because if your GUI tool can export back to the usual YAML code, I might consider using it knowing that I can &#x27;eject&#x27; at any time, or that if the generated YAML suffers from any ShuttleOps bugs I can at least fix them and apply the fixed YAML manually while I wait for a bugfix.')
