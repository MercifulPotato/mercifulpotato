I&#x27;m an apple machine user. I work on an iMac Pro everyday and have used mac&#x2F;ios for over a decade. But i&#x27;ve also extensively used Android, Windows, Linux etc extensively.<p>From what I&#x27;ve experienced it is true that when using apple with apple, it just works. that is true and i won&#x27;t dispute that. they own the ecosystem so they can handle the integration well, obiously. But the opposite is also true. When using apple with non apple, it (sometimes) just doesn&#x27;t work or works poorly. When i use the same device on Windows or Android (linux is a different beast), it just works when it won&#x27;t with iOS or Mac. and sometimes i just want to use a brand thats not apple...<p>I think for many apple users these days, they believe that Android&#x2F;Windows still have the problems they faced back in 2009 and havent extensively used either since switching.<p>Android pairs newer bluetooth devices essentially the same way apple pairs airpods now and windows doesnt still have all the issues from windows vista that made them switch in the first place and has support for way more devices than apple ever will.<p>I&#x27;m not trying to make the point that one is better than the other, my point for apple users is that the experience on windows&#x2F;android isn&#x27;t as bad as they think it is and my point for windows&#x2F;android users is that you&#x27;re not missing out on much or anything at all from the apple ecosystem.<p>Buy devices that fit your use case and budget. its as simple as that.')
