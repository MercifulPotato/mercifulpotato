I&#x27;m not suggesting for a moment that fixing labor union litigation would fix housing.  It wouldn&#x27;t.<p>I was using the pipes as an accessible example of what is a single piece of a very, very large mosaic.<p>The assertion I intended to make was precisely this:  That it is impossible to point to a single bad actor (although, you are likely correct in pointing out the most egregious of them).  The core issue (IMO, the thing to fix) is that the system of incentives that surrounds the developers, contractors, politicians, homeowners, and everyone else involved rewards slicing the pie over making more pie.

And too many lawyers.')
