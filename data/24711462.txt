Massles particles don&#x27;t experience time.<p>* black holes eventually evaporate due to due to Hawking radiation. 10^100 years or more.<p>* after particles with mass and black holes have decayed,  universe continues to expand without event until infinity.<p>* signal left from black hole evaporation travels as massless particles to the infinity.<p>* New universe can start after infinity (aeon). Angles are preserved in  conformal geometry but not the distances. New universe starts small.<p>* You might be able to see the signature of the black holes from the old universe in the cosmic microwave background.')
