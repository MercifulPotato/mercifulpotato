History generally starts around 5 thousand years ago, with the development of writing.<p>(Were there people in charge of other people 6 thousand years ago? Sure, it&#x27;s not unlikely. But Çatalhüyük is a more or less urban area 9 thousand years ago; if we&#x27;re going on what&#x27;s likely, your estimate of 6 thousand years is much too low.)')
