They sets higher prices at launch (3060Ti&#x2F;3070 is 30%-40% expensive than US&#x27; MSRP) and finally decreases the prices. As a result, now we can easily buy any 3060Ti&#x2F;3070, and 3080 if you don&#x27;t choose brand, but expensive. What&#x27;s interesting here is that sold price in Japan is sometimes far cheaper than scalper&#x27;s price in US.')
