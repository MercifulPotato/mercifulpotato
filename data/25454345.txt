Learning an opening isn&#x27;t just about memorising moves, it is also about understanding <i>why</i> the moves -- both your own and your opponent&#x27;s -- are good. If you have studied an opening well, you will understand why a stupid move is stupid and be able to punish it. Of course you may still end up messing things up and lose the game later on, but you should be able to emerge from the opening with an advantage.')
