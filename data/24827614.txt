Where I grew up, it wasn&#x27;t unheard of for individuals by themselves or with a stroller to be attacked and mugged or worse. If you were going to go into old down-town to the plaza or walk the shops, it was a really good idea to let someone know where you were going and when to expect you back.<p>When I went to college, it was rather common for individuals in my physics program to ask to be escorted to their cars if they were in the lab after dark, due to a few incidents of assaults and attempted kidnappings in the dark parking lots. It wasn&#x27;t restricted to gender lines either. Luckily better lighting and cameras were installed rather quickly after the rash of incidents, but that fear persisted for a while.<p>Just because you were lucky enough to live in an area where you were unlikely to be accosted when going out on your own, it doesn&#x27;t mean that others have unfounded fears.')
