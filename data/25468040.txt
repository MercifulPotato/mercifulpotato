Item(by='cambalache', descendants=None, kids=[25468801, 25470006], score=None, time=1608305798, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25467686, text='No communication is possible BUT, I have this toy scenario where a &quot;quasi-communication&quot; may be possible in FTL speed.<p>&quot;2 generals command 2 armies hundreds of km apart. They want to attack a common enemy, there are 2 options, A) And all-front attack. B) From the flanks. The generals want the plans to remain uncertain until the  last second before the attack. So  from an intermediate point, they send two &quot;entangled coins&quot; , one to each general, the coins will arrive at both sites at the exact start of the battle.Both will show the same face when &quot;measured&quot;. The generals have agreed previously that if they turn out &quot;heads&quot; they will both attack from the flank, in the other case, they will do a front-attack.<p>Of course you dont need a quantum system for this, you could have agreed on other stuff (like it if it is raining that day at certain place or sending a framed coin by regular mail) but I think the quantum solution is the more elegant, assuming no 3rd party snooping.')
