In quite a lot of backend systems, you&#x27;re only as strong as your weakest link.  Now you&#x27;re in a situation where you have to audit the attack surface of several different systems, so I&#x27;m not sure how Vault would be particularly worse at this task.<p>I would wager a larger portion of security incidents due to security products being harder to use correctly, and Vault is one of the cleaner and easier-to-use solutions in this regard, so I still think it&#x27;s a step forward.')
