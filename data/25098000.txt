I had originally asked him about Panasonic inverter microwaves but he dissuaded me saying that the Panasonic ovens suffered from reliability problems.<p>The inverter cooking is fantastic and makes the oven a lot more useful for serious cooking. I will use 20-40% power for re-heating foods over a longer time and the results are that there are none of the weird molten-hot and still-cold pockets of food. Pre-packaged foods whose directions are, say, &quot;heat for 3 minutes,&quot; I will instead heat for 5-6 minutes at 40-50% power and the results are considerably more consistent. Plus, I have found that I can get sous vide-like results at low and long settings. For example, I have discovered that heating a filet mignon cut gently at 10-20%, and periodically halting cooking for a minute to let heat distribute evenly through the cut, and then continuing slowly until it temps at 115Â°F, and then searing on rocket-hot cast iron produces great results. Better than sous vide, at least for beef tenderloin.<p>I know I will never go with a non-inverter microwave again as it turns a blunt instrument into a device capable of truly nuanced cooking. If something is going to tie-up counter space, it had better be worth it and the LG is worth it.<p>The next thing I am looking at is the Anova Precision Combi-Oven. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;anovaculinary.com&#x2F;anova-precision-oven&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;anovaculinary.com&#x2F;anova-precision-oven&#x2F;</a>')
