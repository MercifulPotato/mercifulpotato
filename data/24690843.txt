Especially for critical things like this, it&#x27;s always a good idea to perform the conversion from the old file format to the new one, and then to go back and extract the data from the new one to compare to the source data.<p>This can also find issues like Excel cluelessly assuming a field is a date, PHP automatically converting a string which happens to only contain numbers into an integer, and so on.<p>From what I can tell, that sort of thing, <i>assuming proper monitoring</i> (which is a huge assumption), would have detected this immediately (plus however long until someone notices the error e-mail, etc.).')
