Currently, HTTP&#x2F;2 can multiplex streams, but if one has an error, all must be stopped while TCP fixes it. In QUIC they use UDP, which doesn&#x27;t do error checking, so QUIC implements the error checking itself. QUIC will handle the error checking while the UDP streams continue to deliver at the same time.<p>This is all based on my brief reading of the QUIC Wikipedia article, so take my knowledge with a grain of salt, but I think that my above summary fits.<p>Wikipedia at relevant anchor: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;QUIC#Background" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;QUIC#Background</a>')
