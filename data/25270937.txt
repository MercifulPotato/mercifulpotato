Make it clear you literally don&#x27;t want a gift and make them find a moment to give it to you if they insist on going against your express request. This isn&#x27;t always an option, like if there&#x27;s a Christmas party with an inviting-looking tree, but it can be on a birthday organised out of the house.')
