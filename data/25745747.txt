It has an not so mainstream ATI integrated GPU and I had a difficult time configuring compton (with i3) to just look good and perform well. With wayland and latest mesa everything just works and is very snappy. It&#x27;s not perfect though whenever I reboot my machine I have to put my display to sleep first just to make the display work (just shows a blank screen otherwise) but that&#x27;s a problem with mesa though and nothing to do with wayland.')
