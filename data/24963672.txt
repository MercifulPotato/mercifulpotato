You are being very deceptive here by trying to dismiss the guy&#x27;s concern over small sample size with &quot;total dataset&quot; as if that compensates for a minuscule sample size. The supreme court ( all nine or so members ) and the oral arguments isn&#x27;t a sample size worth drawing any objective general conclusions from.

The only one who cherrypicked here is you. The guy responded to your cherrypicked data.')
