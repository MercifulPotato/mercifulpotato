Perhaps I’m being dense? The hard part about SQL isn’t picking out the keywords in the select&#x2F;insert statement, it’s understanding the DB relations, its structure and constraints.<p>If you want to make SQL easier to understand then take a look at a 15 year old stored procedure that’s been hacked at by a dozen devs is over 1,000 lines long, has sketchy rollback error protection, uses two CTEs, a pivot, no temp tables and does some xml shenanigans in the middle (I’m being hyperbolic obviously)<p>This feels like trying to loose weight by trimming your toe nails, you’re technically lighter but not so as it matters.')
