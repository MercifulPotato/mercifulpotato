If it&#x27;s $20&#x2F;month, they may not say &quot;oh but why isn&#x27;t it free&quot; or even more so at $50&#x2F;month.<p>At low prices, maybe it just seems too much of a hassle to sign up and pay, ie, &quot;Ugh, just $4&#x2F;month? And I have to go thru the burden of signing up and giving my credit card and all that?&quot; Whereas at $50&#x2F;month, the paying process pain may feel relatively smaller.')
