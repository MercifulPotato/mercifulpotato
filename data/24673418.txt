And media outlets have been full of hyperventilating editorial and opinion articles on it.<p>And, weirdly, also pushing the “the media is ignoring it” narrative, which as bizarre self-referential media metanarratives go, is a doozy.<p>&gt; I assume it’s because Wikileaks’ mission came under question because their leaks benefited the wrong side.<p>Wikileaks had very little support outside of the far left fringe even before they became overtly part of the Russian influence operation in 2016 so, yeah, when they became a tool of the Russians supporting the American hard right they lost a lot of that; the mainstream media, of any leaning, never really supported them but is, nevertheless, hyping the media freedom angle in the Assange case.')
