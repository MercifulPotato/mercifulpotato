How much of the &quot;productivity gains&quot; in USA comes from that? It isn&#x27;t fair that the money we save by paying a Chinese laborer less should be used to make the wealth gap between Chinese labor and American labor even wider. If anything you should argue that companies should pay their offshore labor more before they pay their American labor more. If there is any money left after we increased all offshore labor to American standards we can pay them more, but not before that. That is what would happen if we apply fair labor rules. The current system is what we get if we use market rates.')
