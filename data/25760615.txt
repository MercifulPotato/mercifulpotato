He&#x27;s free to speak to every media outlet in the world every day in the Press Room if he wants. He just chooses not to as that would make him accountable and it&#x27;s easier to rant on Twitter instead of doing his job. The Gulag Archipelago is as much about the unchallenged silencing of free media outlets, opposition parties and growth of tyranny (&quot;Yes communists have some fringe ideas but they won&#x27;t really be that bad when they come to power&quot;). FB, Twitter, YT have been banning all sorts of groups over the years, in Palestine for example - it&#x27;s just more people are noticing it now.')
