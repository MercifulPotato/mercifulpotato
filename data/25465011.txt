When the user clicks “Save” that’s when your application calls the sqlite api to update the database. When the user clicks “Save as” the application calls the sqlite api to create a new database file, it then creates the database schema and dumps the internal representation of the document into it.<p>You might be confused by the GP comment. It says that if something bad happens with the computer after your application started saving, but before the transaction is commited then the database still will be in a consistent state. (Altough the document will be in the pre-save state.) If the application is the “click save” kind then here we are talking about what happens if the power goes out in that fraction of a second after you hit save, but before the cursor stops being a hourglass.')
