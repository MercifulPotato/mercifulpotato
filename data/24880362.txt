If you base your information off what he says, you will only see the world through his rose colored glasses.<p>For him, it is a political wedge issue meant to drive partisan policy development.<p>If we are to be hard nosed climate hawks, we need to look at the reality of nuclear, as it exists today, and the reality of our capacity to change our industrial processes. And having done that, after being very bullish on nuclear starts in the 2000s, I do not see how Shellenberger can be taken the least but seriously. He doesn&#x27;t address the reality of nuclear on the ground, instead focusing on political statements.')
