What are you going to buy, thousands of dollars worth of My Pillows?<p>I&#x27;m no economist, but my understanding is that paying down debt (universally considered a responsible use of money, as opposed to TV purchasing) is  actually one of the least stimulating ways to spend money. You&#x27;re effectively just hoping that the lender is going to spend the money on something stimulating instead of yourself.')
