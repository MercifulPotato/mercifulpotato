If the goal isn&#x27;t clear, start asking questions about why it isn&#x27;t clear and expand the mind map until there&#x27;s enough there to continue. Sometimes this requires research while constructing the mind map, especially for assigned academic writing. Tag pages with sticky notes or copy data with references into a large research doc as you go.<p>Once the outline is done, the rest is straightforward. An editor always helps if you can afford one, but you don&#x27;t always need to agree with the suggested changes.')
