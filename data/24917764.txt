We&#x27;ve had lots of bugs caused by new people coming in, not understanding the functional style and making bad changes such:<p>- Doing side effects from functions that are assumed to be pure.<p>- Writing a lot of logic into functions that are directly doing side effects, instead of refactoring the decision making into reducers.<p>While I still love mostly pure functional code, I would only recommend it for smaller projects, where one or few developers with strong grasp of the style would strictly review every new PR to ensure new people don&#x27;t mess up.')
