The owner of the multi-purpose root will either make a big fuss when policy changes down the road make that conflict painful or <i>worse</i> they&#x27;ll persuade themselves that we can&#x27;t <i>really</i> have meant what we just told them because it&#x27;s so painful, &quot;obviously&quot; the policy change doesn&#x27;t apply to their multi-purpose root and they&#x27;ll ignore it until discovered.<p>If for example Microsoft had separate &quot;Code signing&quot; and &quot;Web PKI&quot; trust programmes then you get two good things for the price of one: Less incentive for CAs to do things we&#x27;ll regret even if they don&#x27;t; and clarity for users about the purpose of the trust relationship.<p>Mozilla could do better here too, it&#x27;s actually not easy to discern from Firefox which built-in CA roots are actually trusted in the Web PKI, and it&#x27;s outright impossible as far as I know to discover any of the special case restrictions described in <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.mozilla.org&#x2F;CA&#x2F;Additional_Trust_Changes" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.mozilla.org&#x2F;CA&#x2F;Additional_Trust_Changes</a> from the user interface of the software itself.')
