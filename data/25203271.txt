You pay some money to cover some materials and labor, that labor will result in x amount of carbon-dioxide being sequestered over a certain amount of time. You can actually go and research this stuff if you&#x27;re so skeptical. There are actual explanations for how everything works, so it is in absolutely no way like a catholic indulgence, where you never actually know if the money you&#x27;re spending is doing anything. You can actually go on the web and find answers to all your questions. Yes, I mean you, specifically.')
