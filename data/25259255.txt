Do some digging into historical pandemics.  City entrances would be boarded up.  Villages might be &quot;shut&quot; and their people would <i>literally</i> starve to death if the they could not sustain themselves.  Harbor chains were raised against suspected plague ships.  Innocent people were confined to pest hospitals, even exiled to dedicated colonies on remote islands.  Londoners once feared being boarded up in their own houses should they get ill.  The pre-computer past was full of much more draconean efforts than anything COVID-19 has brought us.<p>And for all the horrors of being locked indoors with covid, just spend a few minutes reading about the kids polio trapped inside iron lungs.  That was within living memory.')
