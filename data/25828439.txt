In real life, I&#x27;ve found that most people will respond or ignore. Like a tiny minority will act like you killed their mother, but that&#x27;s life.<p>I know you know this, if you&#x27;re in sales, but I, like many other engineers who read this forum was overly cautious when I first started speaking to people because I anticipated that 99&#x2F;100 would be upset at having to talk to me.<p>The truth was that 99&#x2F;100 were willing to speak to me and listening to HN and Reddit set me back farther than I expected until I unlearned that lesson.<p>So I&#x27;m saying this for the benefit of all those other engineers like me.')
