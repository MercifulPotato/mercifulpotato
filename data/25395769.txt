ERA5 is gap-free, gridded dataset generated using data assimilation method (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Data_assimilation), similar to NWP models but with the benefit of hindsight.<p>As far as we&#x27;re aware of, we&#x27;re the first weather data service provider to have this extensive range of coverage accessible via REST API, where one can quickly query time-series of weather parameters for any location in seconds rather than hours or days from the original source.<p>Here are some stats:<p>Coverage: Global, from 1950 to 10 days ahead<p>Spatial Resolution: 0.25 deg x 0.25 deg (lat x lon)<p>Temporal Resolution: Hourly<p>Weather Parameters: ~30, including longwave&#x2F;shortwave radiation, wetbulb temperature, windspeed at 100m, etc. (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.oikolab.com&#x2F;#3-weather-parameters)<p>NetCDF&#x2F;GRIB Data Size: ~100TB<p>Data Sources: \nHistorical (ERA5) - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ecmwf.int&#x2F;en&#x2F;forecasts&#x2F;datasets&#x2F;reanalysis-datasets&#x2F;era5\nForecast (GFS) - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncdc.noaa.gov&#x2F;data-access&#x2F;model-data&#x2F;model-datasets&#x2F;global-forcast-system-gfs<p>Any feedback or comments would be much appreciated.
