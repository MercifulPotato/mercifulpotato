Pre-plague, I&#x27;ve talked with hundreds about their views on their work, and at least dozens about Uber. Were cab companies beloved? Mostly not. Did drivers see themselves as being &quot;totally screwed&quot;? Definitely not. And they almost universally despise Uber.<p>The daily vehicle rental approach in their eyes has  advantages. Number one is zero capex. Number two is predictable, controllable opex. Number three is a hard cap on the number of drivers on the road, meaning they have a good idea of the supply&#x2F;demand balance. Number four is competition; if they didn&#x27;t like one cab company, they could switch to a variety of others. And number five is regulation: if they were having issues with a cab company, they could take it up with the taxi commission.<p>Contrast this with Uber&#x2F;Lyft, which is a dupoly with almost no regulation, few constraints, and which has shifted core capex and opex onto drivers, as well as most of the risk. With power and incentive to push driver pay well below sustainability. And of course a history of labor exploitation and the willingness to spent approximately infinite money to lock that exploitation into law.')
