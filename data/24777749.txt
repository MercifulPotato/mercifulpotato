But not the end of the world if you&#x27;re not reusing that base image. Feels weird that an article on &quot;Security Best Practices&quot; would advise _against_ latest versions of your software, especially using apt as an example which is usually used in stable distributions (major version upgrades happens seldom) like Ubuntu&#x2F;Debian.<p>But yeah, that last part doesn&#x27;t make any sense. If you&#x27;re not running `apt-get upgrade`, it doesn&#x27;t make sense to run `apt-get update` as nothing is using the newly fetched data anyways...')
