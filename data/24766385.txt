In the cities listed in the first paragraph there are, unique bars (not sure what word to use) and interesting restaurants. In most cites there are just places like AppleBess and the local versions of same. If that makes me a bar&#x2F;food snob okay but what&#x27;s available in many cities is just not comparable in random small city.')
