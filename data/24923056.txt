I&#x27;ve got flutter apps running great on my cheap, old (circa 2015) phone with android 6.0. That&#x27;s also a huge benefit of flutter, it can target older phones because it doesn&#x27;t have many dependencies on native widgets etc, it just need a canvas to render.<p>- Dart not being a successful alternative to js(dart2js compiler), doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s a bad language. In fact, Dart 2.0 was a serious update and the language now is great, with sane defaults and a nice standard library. I can&#x27;t imagine any serious developer who knows at least one popular programming language like java,js,c# that would have problem with Dart. It&#x27;s very easy to get used to it a couple of hours<p>&gt; there are objective facts about it that are bad, and yet so many people love it.<p>can you elaborate more about those facts?')
