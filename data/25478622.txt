They used &quot;assigned location&quot; to determine who was working with COVID patients, but residents don&#x27;t have an &quot;assigned location&quot;, so they were incorrectly passed over even though they do in practice work with COVID patients. Maybe that doesn&#x27;t completely exonerate the administrators from blame, because someone should have sanity checked the plan, but it also seems like a very understandable error to make when you&#x27;re rushing.')
