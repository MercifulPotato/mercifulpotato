Item(by='nijave', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610077957, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25674964, text='I originally liked Simple but hit some rather unsavory bugs like getting a notification there was an error with a transfer that later went through (around 30-40 minutes later when their job queue apparently caught up) and bugs where a transaction would show as pending and cleared at the same time (there was this weird 4 hour window when I got paid)<p>Either way... I ended up splitting between Ally and Discover. Paychecks go into Discover and a scheduled transfer (the sum of all budgets) goes to Ally along with a separate savings transfer. The end result is Discover is &quot;safe to spend&quot; but there&#x27;s less granularity in the buckets&#x2F;envelopes')
