You cant get it work by 100 - 200 connection <i>and</i> response time are very slow at 50ms+ and a lot higher at 95th percentile. AnyCable helps a lot but this is another pieces of complexity added to the system.<p>Not a problem for Elixir and BEAM when they are sort of built for these type of workload.<p>Although I am waiting for all the Fibre, Async and Ractor addition to Ruby 3 and see how they add fit in.')
