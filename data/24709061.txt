At some point, we have very few new articles being discovered by our system (night time in the US, for example). Other time, there are ~100 new articles every second. And, we do not have to worry about our infrastructure: 100 Lambdas will be executed concurrently, and we&#x27;ll pay for just 100 Lambdas like if they were one after one.<p>Also, for many startups&#x2F;side-projects when you don&#x27;t know what would be your workload in advance, Lambda can save you money. And, if you somehow have a huge workload your solution won&#x27;t be crashing.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;newscatcherapi.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;newscatcherapi.com&#x2F;</a>')
