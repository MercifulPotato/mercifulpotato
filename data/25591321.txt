Doesn&#x27;t seem controversial at all to me.  Gives me the heebie jeebies to think of systemd talking to the network before I even have the client firewall up.<p>Generally if security is your top priority I&#x27;d disable as much of systemd as possible.  Things like find a good local resolver (like unbound) and disable systemd&#x27;s implementation, etc.')
