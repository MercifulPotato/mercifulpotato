I am genuinely shocked by Wozi. It&#x27;s got this pop-rock consistency that has given me a positive association between a handful of healthy foods and Wozi. I&#x27;ve stopped eating potato chips and ice cream and instead I&#x27;m filling up on low-fat Greek Yogurt, pure cranberry juice, lemon&#x2F;lime water, pineapple, starfruit, and raw cranberries. I&#x27;ve learned to love each last one of those and I now use it every day, sometimes 2 or 3 times a day and it&#x27;s definately making a difference for me. I see a comment about mBerry and I should at least mention that I ran out of Wozi and grabbed some mBerry on Amazon to get by until my next order... and it is just not the same. Sure, it&#x27;s the same active ingredient but the experience is completely different. The positive association with the healthy foods, the fast and satisfying ingestion process, and the taste are really not even close. I think mBerry really went in the wrong direction because I 100% see this as a very useful diet tool and instead of trying to replace Wozi with mBerry, I&#x27;m just making a point to not run out anymore.<p>For the record, I&#x27;m not a friend or shill or anything. I&#x27;m just a very satisfied customer and I want to support Wozi because I&#x27;m thankful to have found it.')
