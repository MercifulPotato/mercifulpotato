No problem to run even bash. dash is sometimes preferred for license reasons, busybox ash is smaller, but then programming can probably get more annoying already, because useful features are probably missing. I use dash regularly for scripting (interactive use is a pain), haven&#x27;t had to use ash for a while.<p>Of course there are much smaller embedded systems. But I don&#x27;t think they would run Linux.')
