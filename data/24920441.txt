Then I started thinking about the developers that have never touched git and I need to support. I looked at the tools available and what workflows they dictate.  Then there&#x27;s the drive to do something similar to the rest of the company, autonomy only goes so far without a good reason.<p>Fuck me. I&#x27;m going to pick GitLab and hate it.')
