Personally I&#x27;m fine if projects takes less than few hours, 2 days max.<p>But I get overwhelmed, stressed and completely demotivated even just thinking about having to work on long projects. It looks like a never ending mountain, a mountain of suffering.<p>All the &#x27;big&#x27; projects I&#x27;ve ever done seems to have some things common<p>- I&#x27;m beholden to someone else.. Monetary reward seems to be waaay less motivating.<p>- Reward probability has to be 100%. Add any chance &#x2F; risk &amp; it&#x27;s not worth it. Highly averse of looking stupid to myself for some weird reason. Personal projects often have no clear reward. Why work on futile things?<p>- Deadline which would have resulted in certain loss.<p>- Permanent! Achievement would also result in permanent gain.<p>- Clear! I need a clear goal to hit, if it involves me figuring out what to do then that&#x27;s the most amount of work. Again making a right decision is very crucial.<p>I really wonder if there is psychological therapy that can change my brain calculus, any experience?<p>But if I have a cursory idea and want to build it and see where it goes... brain is tsk forget it... then writing even one line of code feels like such a drag.')
