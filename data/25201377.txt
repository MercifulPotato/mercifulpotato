Entry into that team is determined by the consensus of the team itself. Anyone can comment on proposals, and of course, a company could hire those individuals, but it&#x27;s not possible to become a decision maker (or stay one) without the explict consent of the existing set of decision makers.<p>That being said, we (that is, the Rust team broadly, I am not on the language team) do weigh companies&#x27; desires fairly heavily, because we want Rust to be used for real, important things by companies. But it&#x27;s always a balance. Famously, the lang team even resisted some proposals by the Servo team way back in the day, even though most people involved on all sides were Mozilla employees at the time.')
