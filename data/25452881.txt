We study inter species communication all the time as a species don’t we? We communicate with dogs regularly. The challenge is that we haven’t learned how to have higher-order communication which makes it challenging (we learn to communicate primarily with the species, primarily mammals, we co-habitate with). The more distant evolutionarily from us the harder it is to communicate for us as there’s less commonality and more technological assistance needed.')
