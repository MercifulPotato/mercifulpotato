But I saw the alternative as fascism and sectarian violence. I predicted Trumps 2016 win and no one took me seriously. I predicted the rise to prominence of white nationalism and even the Cville event. \nI think Biden is a terrible candidate but the alternative is worse. If there is ever a non racist non violent Republican party I will join it but right now everything is off.')
