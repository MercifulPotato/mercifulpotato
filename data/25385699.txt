They employ psychologists to tell them how to appease and use activists to foster their image.<p>I believe most engineers have a left wing political position for that matter, although I dislike these classifications and that doesn&#x27;t mean it is still true for publicly traded companies.<p>And of course big tech would try to reduce anonymity, get people to sign up for their ident services, want to impose closed systems for security and &quot;left wing&quot; people eat that up like candy.
