I don&#x27;t really care about &quot;a criminal&quot; getting their account back on my service (well, unless I am SilkRoad or something).<p>My point is that I am able to get a new SIM for the same phone number as long as I&#x27;ve registered my ID with the provider. I have even kept my phone number even though I had my phone stolen 3 times for the last 20 years or so. Thus, if any of my accounts rely on that phone number for 2fa, I am good.')
