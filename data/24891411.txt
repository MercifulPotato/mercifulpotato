What we need them to do is stay at home.<p>There shouldn&#x27;t need to be any debt involved.

Normally this would cause excessive inflation because it would be injecting extra money into the economy. But it shouldn&#x27;t in this case because it&#x27;s injecting money that was already there until very recently.')
