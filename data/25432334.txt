Item(by='LoSboccacc', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608052551, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25432243, text='there&#x27;s an abyss between &quot;saturated fat are evil&quot; and &quot;eating a stick of butter every day is great for your health&quot; but apparently the forum is looking for a science based dichotomy, which cannot exist because nutrition is all about daily intake - hence why my original post topic was about proportions and only tangentially related to saturated fat health, and why I carefully avoided to answer to the clear bait: notice how the same poster is claiming two post above that palm oil is good for health, but <i>he</i> doesn&#x27;t provide any citation, instead pretending that everyone else does the homework for him.')
