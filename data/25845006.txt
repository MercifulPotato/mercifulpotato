The only time I&#x27;ve had a car broken into I had left a suit jacket on a hanger next to a rear window. Perhaps they thought the jacket might have had a wallet in it. They didn&#x27;t find my emergency cache of &#x27;petrol money&#x27; I keep in my car in case I forget or lose my wallet and need to fill up. This was a hotel car park in the UK town of Bedford.<p>If you do put stuff in the boot (trunk) you should do this before you park, otherwise it is a dead giveaway that you are hiding something valuable.')
