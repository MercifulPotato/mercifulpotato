It also suggests that it could kickstart someone&#x27;s effort to make their own tools which avoid the signature detector which is sad.<p>A technique we used at Blekko (and hopefully you guys do as well) was logging&#x2F;tracing statistical traffic flows for normal cluster operations such that we could alert on atypical traffic (which in our case meant something was likely kinda broken but limping along and needed to be fixed&#x2F;replaced.). We also didn&#x27;t have to deal with APTs before we were acquired so the stakes were way lower.<p>Agreed that getting hacked is inevitable if the prize is worth it, always interested in adding new ways to instrument the world to detect sniffing or attacks.')
