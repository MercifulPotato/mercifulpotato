The Federal government wonâ€™t grant a security clearance to individuals that owe substantial amounts of money, especially to foreigners, or who have deep personal ties to foreigners or ownership stakes in foreign businesses. I for one would like to know whether candidates would be eligible for a security clearance (though of course the President themself is not subject to most rules about classified information).')
