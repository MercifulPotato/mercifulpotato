Anecdotally, my old method for studying while in school was just to handwrite out notes as I read.  I would not even go back to review them as the act of simply writing it out by hand was enough to retain it.  Typing I feel like is much more autopilot.  The amount of times I misspell or write the incorrect word while typing is way higher than anything done by hand.<p>That said, my handwriting is also atrocious and I would not want to ever have to disseminate something in that form over a nice, typed document.')
