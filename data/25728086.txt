Item(by='treekogreen', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610368627, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25727984, text='From a personnel safety standpoint (what a catastrophic failure looks like in each case), \na unit installation cost standpoint (fabricate x amounts of bricks with x tolerance in the grooves plus a crane with y units of generation on top) and finally from  \na complexity standpoint of stacking stacking bricks (I assume is not just going to be a stored procedure and include some kind of error correction and monitoring).<p>I just cant see anything positive about this solution in the slightest. I wouldn&#x27;t want to be anywhere near that structure. A crane truly is a simple and well known thing but I have tangible knowledge of a large community pushback in the UK where all that was installed was a relatively small turbine on the top of a hill.<p>Boring and reinforcement (concrete spraying) is a tried and true technology and most importantly its out of sight.')
