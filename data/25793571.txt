These types of pricing agreements are <i>usually</i> not sustainable for a company long-term, I go into the agreement with eyes open and I&#x27;ve got rclone ready to move the data again if I have to migrate.<p>My actual expectation is that at some point, 500G will be &quot;small&quot; in provider terms and they&#x27;ll offer upsells to 1TB, 2TB etc. over the life of my account trying to get me to the next level or some other features (which they already have - you can buy add-ons). Nothing wrong with that, I still get my portable 500G &quot;for life&quot; (of the Product) which suits my current space needs. I have enough portable space now that I can upload a hundred gigs of Music, something I wasn&#x27;t able to do before (increased cost) and use that 500G space. (I had uploaded everything to Google Music over a decade...so... yeah)<p>(edit: typos, wrong word&#x2F;replaced)')
