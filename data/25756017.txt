For instance, we all know that illegal activity gets you kicked out immediately. You can&#x27;t be running a brothel or crack house on the one hand, and demand 90 days notice on the other. At least not in my state you can&#x27;t. No court judgement is required either, the cops show up and arrest you, you&#x27;re gone. (In fact, in my state, if a landlord does <i>not</i> boot you in a swift enough fashion, the municipality can confiscate his&#x2F;her property.)<p>So that&#x27;s fine. The rules should be approximately the same as the rental protection laws in the state hosting the data center. If you&#x27;re running a service that is objectionable, but no cops or feds are knocking on the landlord&#x27;s door, then there should be notice given that your provider wants to boot you. Again, if the owner has a fed asking him questions about you and your service, that owner should be free to act much faster. No one questions that.')
