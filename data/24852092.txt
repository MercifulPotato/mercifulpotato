People with jobs, or friends, hobbies, etc.  There is however, a surprisingly large class of people that aren&#x27;t even remotely capable of the fairly rudimentary skill-set required to do something like: read a summons, understand that it says they have to go to court on a certain date, decide that they should in fact go, schedule that date and reserve the time to go, wake up on time, remember to go, find reliable transportation to get to court, find the court, figure out how to get into the building and through security, and figure out where to go once in the court building.   Failing at any one of the steps in that chain means failing to appear.  It may be hard to believe, but in my experience, there are actually a LOT of people for whom this sequence would be a pretty big stretch.  Guess which segment of society makes up a disproportionate number of police encounters which will ultimately lead to a court summons?')
