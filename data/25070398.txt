Item(by='DanBC', descendants=None, kids=[25070628], score=None, time=1605192305, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25069732, text='&gt;  such as ketamine and estketamine for TRD, are really only available in the US<p>Go careful here. Ketamine infusion is a pretty heavy duty intervention and patients require careful monitoring while taking the infusion and for a short term afterwards.<p>In the UK we&#x27;re looking at 1:1 nurse:patient ratios, delivered in ECT suites.<p>In the US the way increased access has been achieved is by dropping down the nurse:patient ratio and delivering it in wider settings. It&#x27;s a more risky way to deliver the treatment.<p>We know that in the US there&#x27;s already a problem of &quot;doctor shopping&quot; -- going around doctors until you find one willing to prescribe ketamine &#x2F; eskatamine. This is normally associated with harmful prescribing, although it&#x27;s too early to say if that&#x27;s the case with these meds.<p>EDIT to add:  There are cultural differences here. The US sees access to medication as being the same as access to treatment.  The UK sees it as over-medication with at best ineffective treatment, and at worst treatment that causes harm.')
