Second time was a lot faster since I was essentially playing the same game and I could fly through the same situations and dialogs. It&#x27;s a hollow experience, pretty but zero substance.<p>I know there are additional endings and side quests, but the problem is that game has no depth whatsoever so I&#x27;m not exactly motivated to spend more time. It&#x27;s mindless action with a few variations on the quests that keep repeating themselves. After playing the game for a few hours, the shallowness and superficiality of it all starts weighing on you.')
