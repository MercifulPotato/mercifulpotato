Item(by='rozab', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611095088, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25838877, text='Reddit is unique in that it allows you to find and connect to a community with very little friction. The other day I was thinking about buying a mini PC. I googled &#x27;mini PC reddit&#x27;  and immediately find r&#x2F;MiniPCs and r&#x2F;sffpc. Now I can sort by top all time and see the lay of the land in the community, see which devices are popular, etc. I can ask questions and get a quick response.<p>If these communities were on traditional forums, I wouldn&#x27;t be able to do any of this. I would never bother to make an account specifically for that forum. Some communities benefit from keeping out tourists like me, but not commercially.')
