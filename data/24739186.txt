As an example a fanboy is emotional y invested, Apple is part of his identity. When reports of broken keyboards surfaced the fanboys attacked the affected users and defended Apple.<p>Other fanboy examples, Apple does bad thing X, fanboys defends Apple, class action lawsuit forces Apple to stop doing bad thing X , Apple announces that they kindly stopped doing X and fanboys praise Apple for their goodness.<p>Other example, Apple removes you the choice for alternative payment methods, removes the choice for you to get informed of alternatives and from this articles seems they refuse to inform people where censorship was applied and for some reason fanboys will defend the fact that all users are deprived of mere choices.,<p>Some other examples is when the fanboys complain about ads, lootboxes and other shitty in app payments but ignroe the fact that Apple gets a cut of the money instead of just banning ads,tracking,lootboxes etc.<p>Even people here on HN that should be more competent  try to push a narrative that a side loaded app is insecure when in fact the same sandbox will protect the user and web notifications seem to be also some extremely hard concept to implement right by Apple engineers, you would think they have competent developers and designers that could find a good UX.<p>Conclusion, Most Apple users are not fanboys, I seen them on the Apple reddit criticising when Apple does some shit,  so when somone  uses the word fanboy he means a person that  has Apple as part of his identity, criticizing Apple is the same as an attack on him or his mother.')
