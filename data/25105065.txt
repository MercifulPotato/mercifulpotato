You didn&#x27;t have to count 151 million votes in the UK election<p>2. You didn&#x27;t have to wait a few days for mail-in ballots that were delayed in transit to arrive<p>3. You didn&#x27;t have to do this in the middle of a global pandemic that required poll workers to stay 6 feet apart<p>Generally the US election results can be predicted the same day, this year had additional challenges due to extremely high turn-out, high use of mail-in ballots, and limited number of pool workers due to pandemic.<p>In my opinion, elections should be done using paper ballots, and those ballots are counted using electronic tabulation machines. After a batch of ballots are counted, a random sample of them are selected and manually counted. Should the results match, then you can have a high certainty of the accuracy of the count. Electronic tabulation machines are actually more accurate than hand-counting, and by hand counting again, you reduce the risk of the machines making &quot;mistakes&quot; due to technical glitches or malicious backdoors etc.')
