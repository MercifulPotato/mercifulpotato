It just exists and we can all edit it at the same time.<p>My todo list app used to sync with Dropbox, now it syncs for free without Dropbox.<p>Even Microsoft office documents on 365 sit in a weird space between ‘kind of a file and kind of not’ - the file is there, but when you are doing live collaborative editing that’s presumably not also updating the file on the disk in real time - there is some other sort of magic going on.<p>The important thing with the above examples is they can offer better sync <i>because</i> they don’t rely on Dropbox, rather than <i>despite</i> not using Dropbox.<p>If sync is an application feature, sync tends to be better than if sync isn’t an application feature and it’s left to Dropbox to do the sync.')
