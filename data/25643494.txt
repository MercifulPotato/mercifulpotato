I&#x27;m a big privacy advocate, so I don&#x27;t personally like volunteering location info, but personally know lots of people who will happily do so for all sorts of reasons (e.g. seeing each other on snapchat maps), they understand what they&#x27;re doing. Simple fact is, plenty of people just _don&#x27;t care_ and that is their right to do so.')
