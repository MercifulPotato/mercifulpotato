Almost everyone want as much freedom of speech as possible but ethically if it leads to huge number of people suffering&#x2F;dying needlessly there has to be some safeguards. Also, note that FB not publishing something is not against freedom of speech, since they can always create a website to publish any disinformation they want. As long as the government doesn&#x27;t make a blanket rule against publishing something, there is still freedom of speech.')
