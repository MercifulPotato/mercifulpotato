I have three grandparents who I love dearly in their 80s - one with diabetes, one with rheumatoid arthritis, and the other with lung scarring from tuberculosis.  My parents are approaching 60.  My wife&#x27;s parents are in their 70s (both have had covid already).  And I have several of my own children.  My position is that, yes covid sucks.  In my personal view&#x2F;opinion, the danger&#x2F;risk levels of covid don&#x27;t warrant anything nearly so severe as what has been going on all over the world.  Let people live.  Don&#x27;t treat them like babies that need to forced to take their medicine.  We&#x27;ve long since crossed the liberty&#x2F;safety threshold I&#x27;m comfortable with.')
