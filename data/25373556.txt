Can we discuss that? Or we have to accept that it is great because it is great?<p>Is it allowed to cite Pfizer that in the III tests phase it applied vaccine or placebo to 43 000 people out of which 170 developed COVID-19 - 162 in placebo group and 8 among those vaccinated.<p>On that base vaccine producer claim that they achieved 95%   effectiveness. Can we doubt that number because of the small number of people who developed disease? Is that fact somehow proves that Covid is not that infectious as people thought? And so on.<p>Should we believe Swiss regulator who refused to accept vaccine? Or maybe Swiss regulator did that since some Swiss company is working on the vaccine?<p>Can we ask if taking vaccine makes someone non-spreader of the virus? Can we ask if it was tested on older people, people who take a lot of other medicines (like many older people do)? Is seems that people with allergies (what?) should not take vaccine. Was this even testes?<p>There are many pros and cons and doubts, the evidences is one thing, the conclusions might be different.<p>Same with election case. Was there at least one case when we have a prove that election result was manipulated? I think at least one can be found. Why can&#x27;t this be discussed?')
