Most Hondas made around 2016+ are running Android 4.x.  Most Hyundais&#x2F;Kias from 2015+ are running running Android 2.3 or 4.x (including my 2015 Genesis sedan).  Meanwhile, most other vehicles are running proprietary embedded OSes (QNX, Windows Embedded) or very old versions of Linux.<p>So Android Automotive OS is an improvement over this, since Google will be updating the system (or mandating some updates) and system apps will be receiving updates decoupled from the OS.  Cars are already insecure and connected.')
