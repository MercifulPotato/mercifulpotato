Absolutely.<p>Does the mere existence of people whose lived experience contradicts that of the aggregate majority suggest that we ought to upend our systems? No, and that&#x27;s the point.<p>In general, when we see (overwhelming) empirical outcomes that don&#x27;t confirm our priors, we ought to shift our priors.
