Maybe it is 95% or something.<p>I find it hard to believe,  however,  because the usual pattern when I want to fly out of my small airport is as follows.<p>I might find United is $298.44 and so is Delta.  American airlines is $301.55.  Maybe there is a $375 flight listed with an extra stop on one of the airlines.  The next price up is a $700 flight which has nothing obviously special about it,  in fact it might be worse with more stops,  more delays,  and worse timing.  (Maybe the expensive flight lets me reschedule or has some other benefit but that&#x27;s not clear when I am buying the ticket)<p>The market is not giving me any meaningful choice at all through the price mechanism in that two airlines seem to be colluding to give me the exact same price,  and the difference between the third is so small that $3.11 is not worth thinking about if you find anything about the American flight preferable to the other two.<p>In theory I could pay $1200 for a first class flight but the first leg of the flight has no first class cabin,  and that&#x27;s a huge jump.  Before 2008 there was no &quot;Premium Economy&quot; or other efforts to let people vote with their dollars in a meaningful way.  Still it&#x27;s limited.  When I save everybody time and frustration by checking a bag instead of contributing to &quot;rollerbag hell&quot;,  why I am paying more when I should be getting a discount?<p>Looking at airline pricing shows the rules of microeconomics are being thoroughly violated and I&#x27;m not going to believe the claim that &quot;customers won&#x27;t pay more for a better experience&quot; until somebody hits the STOP button on both the flights and the airline bank accounts and accountants go over every single line and they can tell a story that makes sense.<p>What I see is that customers aren&#x27;t being offered meaningful choices about their flights,  or if they are,  only in certain geographies.<p>I was a 737 hater long before the MAX came along so now it&#x27;s appealing to drive to Syracuse to take Jetblue which is a no Boeing airline.  In terms of $&#x27;s to the airline it isn&#x27;t dramatically different than what I&#x27;d pay to fly out of Ithaca,  but I an now paying with transport costs and maybe an extra night&#x27;s hotel stay.<p>At ITH the service from the major airlines is undifferentiated (do you want to fly a CRJ-200 or E-145?) other than the hub you go to.  Delta&#x27;s Detroit hub is ideal for the west coast,  American&#x27;s hub is ideal for points south.  Somehow they charge the exact same for flights that must cost differently for the airlines so there must be price fixing involved.')
