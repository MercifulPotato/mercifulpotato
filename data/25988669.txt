A few different approaches in terms of chipsets used and performance targets.<p>I&#x27;m trying to track them in this GitHub issue [1] but a couple people have remained more or less anonymous as they don&#x27;t want to attract attention too early.<p>The single PCIe lane is the biggest limitation if you&#x27;re looking for raw speed (350 MB&#x2F;sec is kind of the upper real-world sustained transfer limit), though since the gigabit Ethernet port is on a different interface, you can still expect to get 80-100 MB&#x2F;sec network transfer speeds.<p>Something like this, with the right case and OMV or other adequate software would be a relatively competitive replacement for low-end NASes.<p>I&#x27;m also exploring building a 2.5G NAS with a CM4, but the PCIe bus speed limitation is what kinda hamstrings that. Hopefully the next Pi revision has a 4x (at least) lane, like the RockPro64.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;geerlingguy&#x2F;raspberry-pi-pcie-devices&#x2F;issues&#x2F;25" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;geerlingguy&#x2F;raspberry-pi-pcie-devices&#x2F;iss...</a>')
