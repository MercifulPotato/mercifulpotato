I recently watched some of the HD restoration and the use of sound and image is really wonderful.<p>I suspect a lot of it flies under the radar because The Wire purposefully used a style that wasn&#x27;t overly pretty, was closer to verite than visually stunning. But there&#x27;s some great ideas there. The utter commitment to diagetic sound (barring one scene in the first season). The use of complex camera movements and an Altman-esque zoom to provide a documentary or even voyeuristic perspective.<p>You could make an argument that The Wire is more innovative in filmmaking than a lot of the typical prestige TV, who simply mimicked Hollywood big budget artistry.')
