Part of the problem with their 10nm process is that they tried to scale transistor density far more aggressively than their competitors.  Jumping 2 nodes in one go is far more difficult today as feature size approaches atomic scale than it was 20 years ago.  Better to have a process that&#x27;s an improvement over the previous generation than to have a process without the yields needed to support commercialization (which is effectively no process at all).')
