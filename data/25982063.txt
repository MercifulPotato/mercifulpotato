They would rather move to different technologies in case Java is abandoned.<p>&gt; Companies that are able to maintain Java are X times larger than Oracle<p>With exception of maybe IBM which anyway is crapping out, none of the other owe their business success to directly to Java based product or services. If Java were to be abandoned they can easily migrate &#x2F; rewrite their internal tools &#x2F; products to a different platform even if it takes 5-10 years. It is not like current prod systems will stop working just by announcement.<p>Also to think further Oracle abandons Java , Amazon and Google  would have huge incentive to either charge lot more for Java on cloud or redirect their customers to alternatives.')
