But the common theme is empathy.<p>As a guiding principle, think about what each team member needs and how they feel. Doing so would make the type of communication that would help them accomplish their goals very clear.<p>Imagine a car and a driver. Now imagine the car had no gas level gauge. Instead the car has two rules. 1. A driver can enter a destination distance and get a yes&#x2F;no depending on gas levels, or 2. The car will give random updates of remaining range. Maybe this is reasonable from the perspective of the car designer; I mean how often does the gas state change, isnâ€™t it micromanaging to get updates every second?<p>From the perspective of the driver though, how can they determine how far to go, when to stop to get gas, whether a detour is ok or will exceed range.<p>Empathy goes both ways. Imagine that checking the gas levels is computationally difficult and expensive. Imagine each measurement burns a gallon of gas? An empathetic driver would agree to less frequent readings.<p>So empathy all the things.')
