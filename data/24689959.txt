But I&#x27;m aware that police are people, and I am fully cognizant that they have a gun and I do whatever is necessary to assure them that I am not a threat to their safety.<p>For example, during a traffic stop I keep my hands firmly visible and on the steering wheel. When the cop asks for my license, I say it is in my right front pocket. I do not move my hands to get it until he says ok. I do not reach for the glove box until he says ok.<p>I do not berate officers, I don&#x27;t argue with them, I don&#x27;t move unless they tell me to. Yes, I have been held at gunpoint by the police.<p>I never lunge for my cell phone in my pocket. I do not run at the cop or away from him. I do not try to touch the cop. I do not reach for the cop&#x27;s weapon.<p>Back in the 60&#x27;s, when toy guns looked like real guns, my dad (WW2 and KW combat vet) gave me one. I am white and lived in a small all white town. My dad said if I ever pointed it at anyone, I was liable to be shot, and he didn&#x27;t want me to be shot. Being a rather stupid boy, I pointed it at people, and he took it away.<p>Always remember you&#x27;re dealing with an armed person who does not know you&#x27;re a sweet old gent with a cellphone in his pocket. Never force him to make a split second decision at night in poor visibility as to whether you&#x27;re whipping out a cell phone or a gun.')
