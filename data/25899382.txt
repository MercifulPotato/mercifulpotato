You could extend it to 3D with some serious work, and for simple geometries at low angles of attack and high Reynolds Number it will probably do fine.<p>But if you want better fidelity the best open-source CFD suite I&#x27;m familiar with is OpenFOAM.  Unfortunately you have to have an adequate understanding of the math&#x2F;physics to use that as OpenFOAM doesn&#x27;t hold your hand even a little bit.  There&#x27;s really not much of a market at all for &quot;casual flow modeling&quot;.')
