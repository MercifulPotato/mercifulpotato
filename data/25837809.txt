So in your society, potential rapists worry about facing 10 years in prison, and in the other, an extrajudicial death penalty. Seems to me the latter might be a better deterrent.</i><p>There is no need to theorize.  You can just look at statistics.  According to Wikipedia, the rape rate in Germany is estimated at 9 per 100,000.  (Men and women.)  The rape rate in the USA is estimated at 2.1 per thousand women per year.  Rapes happen per capita at 10x the rate in the USA as in Germany.<p>Theories about deterrence notwithstanding, Germany is actually working out better than the USA.  This is typical of other statistics that I&#x27;ve seen.  Being in a society that has internalized law and order is safer.  By about a factor of 10.<p>(Side note.  The internalized US belief in deterrence is why we have the highest per capita incarceration rate in the world.  And yet we also have higher rates of violent crime than any other developed nation.  Deterrence may sound good, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to work out very well in practice.)')
