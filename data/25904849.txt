I really tried. Perhaps there are more small accidents on local roads, but they would tend to be less dangerous. The evidence suggests that highways are significantly more fatal[0].<p>Also, Autopilot is not essential forced off for anything but highways. That is just factually incorrect. Notably, straight-aways are where Autopilot works best and are the most dangerous by crashes.[1]<p>I found data suggesting that a lot of accidents happen because people rear-end stopped cars at intersections[2] and issues with navigating intersections[3]. That is an area where Autopilot is pretty great today.<p>0: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www-fars.nhtsa.dot.gov&#x2F;People&#x2F;PeopleAllVictims.aspx" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www-fars.nhtsa.dot.gov&#x2F;People&#x2F;PeopleAllVictims.aspx</a> (see last table)<p>1: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www-fars.nhtsa.dot.gov&#x2F;Vehicles&#x2F;VehiclesAllVehicles.aspx" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www-fars.nhtsa.dot.gov&#x2F;Vehicles&#x2F;VehiclesAllVehicles....</a> (see last table)<p>2: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hg.org&#x2F;legal-articles&#x2F;when-and-where-do-car-accidents-happen-the-most-52023" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hg.org&#x2F;legal-articles&#x2F;when-and-where-do-car-acci...</a><p>3: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www-fars.nhtsa.dot.gov&#x2F;Vehicles&#x2F;VehiclesLocation.aspx" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www-fars.nhtsa.dot.gov&#x2F;Vehicles&#x2F;VehiclesLocation.asp...</a>')
