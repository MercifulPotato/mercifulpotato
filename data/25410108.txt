What could that be?</i><p>Very often the answer is mundane; <i>&#x27;It&#x27;s what my parents taught me.&#x27;</i>  Particularly in the most contentious cases, like religion and politics.  It seems like &#x27;born thinking it&#x27; vs &#x27;was persuaded&#x27; is a false dichotomy, unless you count being steeped in a culture as a child to be a form of persuasion.')
