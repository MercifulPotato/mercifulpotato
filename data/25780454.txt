It&#x27;s not particularly hard, just longer than a small language like go.<p>- Having Ruby and&#x2F;or functional programming experience shortens that learning curve.<p>- Developer experience&#x2F;satisfaction is very high.  This helps retention<p>- Some devs will just never &quot;get&#x2F;grok&quot; Elixir.  They may have 20 years of java experience or a new dev better suited to a FE role.  This doesn&#x27;t mean they are bad, just not a great fit.<p>- The devs that do get it? They are quite productive.  Feature velocity is high.<p>I disagree that Elixir&#x2F;Phoenix isn&#x27;t a fit for CRUD apps.  I&#x27;m seeing high feature velocity across small and large scale products.<p>In particular, feature velocity per engineer is quite high.  A smaller team in Elixir&#x2F;Phoenix&#x2F;LiveView can outpace a similar full stack team.')
