Item(by='wtallis', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605255178, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25079171, text='&gt; &gt; It is our belief that the repo as a whole represents a circumvention tool in violation of 1201 and therefore needs to be removed.<p>That bit is probably irrelevant to the DMCA takedown procedure, which only applies to &quot;material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity&quot;. I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s much clear precedent to what &quot;be the subject of infringing activity&quot; means, but decryption tools that don&#x27;t use stolen code definitely don&#x27;t qualify as &quot;material that is claimed to be infringing&quot;.<p>And if Google does want to claim that the circumvention tool is infringing a Google copyright rather than merely running afoul of an unrelated provision of the DMCA, then Google has to specifically identify their own work of decryption code that the circumvention tool is ripping off. All this notice specifically identifies in the way of actual infringement are two documentation PDFs and an API header file (and we all know where Google stands on API copyright).')
