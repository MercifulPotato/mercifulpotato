At my company, I notice this makes the managers very concerned, so they don&#x27;t take any chances on translations.<p>We also get a lot of &quot;french language warriors&quot; who call our call centers and complain about ANY mistake they can find. One that pops up frequently is if we use the incorrect punctuation mark (&quot; as opposed to « and » for French), which happens a lot if a naïve marketing manager is copying and pasting text without regard for the format.')
