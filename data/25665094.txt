It makes me sick.<p>Unpopular speech is the most important, perhaps the only speech that needs to be defended. As Rosa Luxembourg said: those who do not move do not notice their chains. Any discourse that isn’t allowed to happen in popular mediums don’t disappear, it happen underground, and it’s a lot harder to detect.<p>I get removing calls to violence, but I don’t want these tech overlords making these judgment calls.')
