Don&#x27;t know why but the thought of modern &quot;big sur&quot; macOS on such beautiful hardware seems a bit sad to me. KDE&#x2F;Manjaro has made me pretty happy lately and the battery life could make an amazing linux laptop. Of course you could run CDE or XFCE to get your Win95 DE. ;) Well in a few years when hopefully Linux supports M1 devices. Till then probably have to play with a PineBook or something.')
