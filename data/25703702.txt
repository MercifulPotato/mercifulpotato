It&#x27;s not just a failure of the architecture though. The tactics used were mostly ineffective. Defensive forces were positioned thinly with few real blockades. I saw one instance of police blocking an entrance through sheer mass and it was effective. The cops could have been done the same in the interior hallways instead of giving up their spread out weak positions. This would have prevented the use of firearms.<p>If you can stomach it, I ask everyone to watch the full lead up to the shot. It is an absolute failure of policing.
