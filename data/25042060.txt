How can you amortize your recent experience while it is fresh?<p>Let me explain: conventions are powerful. A reason many repositories on github have a &quot;README&quot;, &quot;CONTRIBUTING&quot;, &quot;CODE_OF_CONDUCT&quot;, &quot;LICENSE&quot; files is because of conventions (and sometimes legal requirements).<p>What would have lowered the barrier to entry for you if you had read it on a project&#x27;s site or repository?<p>&gt;<i>You need a sound bite that strips all that away and tells people &quot;See a typo? Submit a pull request!&quot; That&#x27;s the part non-coders don&#x27;t understand and aren&#x27;t being told.</i><p>Some sites have that. &quot;See a typo or have feedback?&quot; with links to repository&#x2F;issues.
