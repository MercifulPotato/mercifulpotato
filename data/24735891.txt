I don&#x27;t really consider &quot;by using this site you agree to such and such&quot; to be consent, and I don&#x27;t know of any sites that ban ad blockers in their ToS. But in a theoretical situation where a site made you explicitly agree not to block ads before allowing you to use the site, then yeah I think it would be reasonable for them to expect you to adhere to that agreement.')
