This isn&#x27;t as common anymore since it has massive security risks associated with a &#x27;godmode&#x27; TLS cert.<p>But there are still ways to inspect encrypted traffic. TLSv1.2 and lower expose the SNI in the handshake. Even on TLSv1.3 there is plenty of metadata exchanged during the TLS handshake. For example, the JA3 spec [1] is a standardized hash of selected connection parameters such as cipher suites, extensions, curves, etc. It can reveal a decent amount of information about the software initializing the connection, and when compared to a list of known good or known harmful JA3&#x27;s can flag connections as malicious.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;engineering.salesforce.com&#x2F;tls-fingerprinting-with-ja3-and-ja3s-247362855967" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;engineering.salesforce.com&#x2F;tls-fingerprinting-with-j...</a>')
