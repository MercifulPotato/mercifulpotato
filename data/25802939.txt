Those were the people that started using Groovy and also projects such as Grails (especially since they saw the success of Rails and Django and wanted to emulate that).<p>Also, I guess some people genuinely like gradual typing, although I&#x27;ve never found much use for it.<p>Nowadays, I wouldn&#x27;t pick up Groovy anymore, but there was a time where it was basically that, or Java (or a different ecosystem entirely; or something like JRuby &#x2F; Jython).')
