Dithering can also be done across color channels, which can be useful for displays with more than three primary colors.  Even in those cases, I found dithering to work better in the physical space, and not in perceptual space.  I am trying to understand why.<p>Further, the question still remains why is it that mixing of photons spatially as you explained works better imperceptible pixels, and yet we need these non-linear color spaces when having larger areas.<p>Goes without saying that the intensity hit for 50 need not be the midpoint of that hit for 0 and 100 given the gamma curve, and actual mapping of the value to intensity for the pixel.')
