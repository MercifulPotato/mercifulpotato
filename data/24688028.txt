Spend too much time at the extremes and negative results will follow.<p>This is no different.  Sit too long; stand too long; lay down too long.  All bad for you in the long term.<p>I switched from a sitting to a  standing desk with a high chair.  This allows me to switch between sitting and standing multiple times per day without having to fiddle with the motorized desk too much.  I make it a point to go for a short walk a few times a day when I transition from sitting to standing.  And exercise is key.<p>I&#x27;ve seen lots of these desks that allow you to lie down.  From my perspective, this is a horrible idea unless there&#x27;s a solid medical reason for it.  In other words, someone with a condition that almost requires it.  People in bed at extended care facilities develop all kinds of problems.  This is no different.  Almost every muscle in your body weakens.  Not a good thing.  I hate to think what happens to gamers who buy these desks and sit there for ten hours at a time playing.  Horrible stuff.<p>Avoid the extremes at all costs.')
