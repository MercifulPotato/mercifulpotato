The batteries take up a lot of weight and weigh the same at the start of the flight as at the end, and while I&#x27;m sure battery technology will continue to improve, the weight issue is going to be a problem for a long time. Trying to pursue this commercially just seems like a quick way to lose a lot of money.<p>It makes sense for short flights. The vast majority of costs associated with aviation are in maintenance, with the majority of <i>those</i> costs coming from engine overhauls. This means you have a high fixed cost of operation per flight hour regardless of distance traveled&#x2F;passengers carried. Electric motors will reduce that cost by orders of magnitude and make these small flights economically feasible.<p>&gt; I&#x27;m not saying it won&#x27;t work, just that it will be significantly more expensive than a conventional plane for the same performance for a long time to come.<p>The key is that you don&#x27;t need the same performance of a piston engine aircraft. Batteries are <i>just</i> good enough now for these types of short flights to be possible. And with the maintenance savings, you come out ahead. Electric motors will also be <i>vastly</i> safer and more reliable than single engine piston aircraft, leading to insurance savings.')
