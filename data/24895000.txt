Aside from that, there isn&#x27;t anything wrong with nineties Linux which couldn&#x27;t have been brought up to modern standards with a bit more discipline.<p>Someone decided ALSA (or OSS, it doesn&#x27;t matter) was rough to deal with, so they build Pulse and JACK on top of it, rather than a modest expansion of ALSA. Someone didn&#x27;t like the network layer, so they build a userspace wrapper, and someone didn&#x27;t like that, so they wrapped it up in a GUI.<p>At the end of the day:<p>1) Everything is slow, requiring literally more than 100x the resources it once did.<p>2) Everything is complex, with layers upon layers, and text files with comments &quot;This is managed by my hack.

I knew how nineties Linux booted.
