I know of some human rights issues, though, so for the sake of argument I&#x27;ll assume this is a thing. Nevertheless, hypocritical or not, it would be better (from a worldsuck perspective) to decrease these issues in China than to not do that. And isn&#x27;t the issue much more widespread in China than in the USA?<p>Looking for &quot;concentration camp USA&quot; on DDG, just to make sure we&#x27;re talking about the same thing, it comes up with some site about customs and border patrol stations where refugees are imprisoned in for-profit facilities. Is that what you are referring to?')
