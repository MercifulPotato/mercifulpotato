We’re doing this by making Handshake — a new decentralized DNS protocol — easy-to-use. You can think of our product as GoDaddy for Handshake.<p>Since launch six months ago we’ve already processed over $20M in transaction volume and tens of thousands of Handshake name registrations. We work in a highly collaborative environment across a distributed team (currently in US and Australia). Open communication is the standard — strategy discussions occur in slack, not behind closed doors. New initiatives have a single owner to maintain focus while feedback is solicited from everyone.<p>We use Node and Go on the backend, React on the frontend. We&#x27;re a small team of 7 with ample funding — we&#x27;ve raised from Coinbase Ventures, Thrive Capital, Paradigm Capital, Balaji Srinivasan, and count Josh Elman (board member at Discord) amongst our advisors.<p>We&#x27;re on an ambitious mission to fight the trend of the traditional internet becoming balkanized.
