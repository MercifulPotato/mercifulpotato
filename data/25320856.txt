It’s a text feed, for crying out loud.  One of Apple’s worst antiuser moves...all for the sake of Apple News that goes straight into Trash without reading?  Every time I delete the email, it reminds me how shortsighted and arrogant Apple can be.  So I get a daily dose of antiApple by way of Apple themselves.  Hurrah?<p>MetaFilter is slanted in the content presented...used it heavily in its early days.  Yield rate plummeted to near zero so skipped it...I assume I aged out of its content.<p>Instead of webrings, I collect blogs that have embedded a miniRSS list of followed blogs.  Can glom together a decent  RSSish feed in a particular topic of interest from them.')
