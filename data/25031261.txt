As an original Vive owner I&#x27;m astounded at how far VR has gotten for the price. Getting past the forced FB integration, the Quest is one of the best VR experiences I&#x27;ve had. The inside out tracking is nothing short of magical and using Virtual Desktop to stream PCVR wirelessly works so much better than I was anticipating.<p>I&#x27;m not a FB hater, and I think the social integrations could actually be very useful in the future - especially in a post covid world.')
