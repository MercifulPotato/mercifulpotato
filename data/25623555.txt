We know that many of these will convert but do not know exactly how many, the last type is the users who are using the tool for more then one year and they praise the tool as how it has evolved in this time and they get real value but not all of these will convert.<p>The think i am worried is that our growth happened like this, A dev team from a company started using it and then they like it and in few months it will be 5-15 teams from same company will start using it because they liked it and it was free now<p>If we go hard with pricing and lockout free users then our growth may suffer, Is it a good idea in our case to offer 90% of the product as free and lockout the remaining 10% features for paid.<p>One of my friend in SaaS thinks we are crazy stupid to do it like this, he suggests that we lockout the whole product and offer 1 month trial, the people who really needs this will pay and rest will run away, and I do not feel comfortable doing this. Sorry for the long answer but just want to write everything.')
