Thank you all for sharing.<p>For me, a good programmer realizes that &quot;everything is code&quot;. Like, sometimes it&#x27;s easy to think X problem is too hard for me or I don&#x27;t have enough experience or this bug is unfixable but end of the day, it&#x27;s all just code. You can change it however you want and if someone else did implemented something before, it&#x27;s highly likely that you&#x27;ll be able to do the same. Having a level of distance from the code one writes really helps.')
