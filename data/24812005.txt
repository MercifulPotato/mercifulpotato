Item(by='barnacled', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602958982, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24809530, text='Personally I have found a rather different factor has been at play in my career - I have been in the industry for 15 years and made several side-steps, including working as employee #1 at a startup (which I cashed out from a buy-back), working at a GPU company on the driver and much else. I&#x27;ve also contributed to the linux kernel, chromium, the go programming language and a number of others.<p>I have never lacked the ability to make a change in my career even when it was scary, including taking the early stage startup job at a &gt;30% reduction in pay + they only had 2-3 months money in the bank max.<p>However I&#x27;ve found that my career progression has been stalled by each and every move. I&#x27;m back at the bottom of the ladder and those years of experience? Worth absolutely nothing.<p>It&#x27;s felt like every move to another position for whatever reason (typically to have a more interesting, fulfilling career in my case) has absolutely reset my career every time.<p>I&#x27;m 39 years old and last week a 25 year old was promoted in my company above my position after he&#x27;d been there for 3 years. It&#x27;s pretty galling to think that I could be in the same position as not far off a graduate engineer in my early 20&#x27;s.<p>My experience has consistently been that only your experience at $CURRENTJOB counts for anything when it comes to progression.<p>By all means, seek out the best job for you, but don&#x27;t be surprised if there&#x27;s a cost in progression of any kind. I don&#x27;t regret taking risks and aiming for happiness but I do regret that I was naive about how to do it in a smart way.<p>I think part of the issue is that many technical roles (note: I have never worked for FAANG so maybe different there) do not have a well-defined or sensible technical promotion route, so only managerial experience matters in terms of progression.')
