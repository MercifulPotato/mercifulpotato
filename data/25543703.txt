You put a marble in a bowl, then another marble in the bowl, you now have two marbles in the bowl. If you remove conservation then there is no reason why 1 + 1 should equal 2. 1 + 1 being equal to anything could just be nonsense in that universe, such a construct wouldn&#x27;t exist and there would be no way to reason about quantities. That isn&#x27;t a logical inconsistency, so such a universe could exist.')
