If the chance of a collision happening within a millisecond is 1 in a billion then my intuition is that the probability of a collision happening at least once a year is quite high, indeed.<p>It&#x27;s like a dice: You have 1 in 6 chance of getting a 6 every time your roll the dice. Now, if you roll the dice 100 times the chance that you&#x27;ll get a 6 at least once is then pretty high.')
