Just because it is widespread today does not make it acceptable or good in any way or form. It does not mean that it is the cause for our advancement (association fallacy, and correlation vs. causation fallacy).<p>As a matter of fact, I would wager that these practices are a main driving force of the wage gap we see today, causing instability and unrest, inflation, and tons of other problems.
