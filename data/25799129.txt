Signal has been down for <i>nine hours.</i>  the vast majority of people who turned to this platform today as an alternative to Whatsapp or Facebook probably quit looking into it after the first two minutes of that outage.<p>for a platform that bills itself after installation as a suitable drop in replacement for your SMS service (and encourages you to shill it to friends as such) this is completely unacceptable and could have easily been avoided with better leadership and architecture.<p>Cheerleading your users endorsement of privacy on twitter during an outage is insulting.<p>Most sites and apps monitor things like news sites, twitter and the like for instances where their namesake may be trending. This is done in order to quickly head off DDoS type outages due to things like the slashdot effect.  Signal doesnt do this for the same reason Signal is centralized:  Moxy writes code like he still lives in 2006.<p>- Nobody scrambled to bolster capacity after the electric car porn star (Elon Musk) gave a full throated endorsement?<p>- Nobody raced to improve capacity after Apple looked to be in a position to piss in Facebooks cheerios?<p>- Nobody even thought to reconsider capacity after Whatsapp showed up in the news JANUARY 6 with a bombshell announcement of privacy changes for users?  we waited over a week?<p>It also needs to be said --yes im aware of my audience-- that centralized services DO NOT scale.  Moxys response to this has been cantfix&#x2F;wontfix, so in traditional dev fashion he throws more hardware at the problem to make it go away instead of looking into a better architecture.<p>Microservices do not scale.  Yes, they scale across the cloud, but they do not scale across <i>support</i> channels.  Microservices trade gaming cloud providers for precious pay-by-the-second service for an endless byzantine dumpster fire of almost impossible to diagnose failure conditions.  A highly secure end to end encrypted service that expects to replace your SMS needs to be quick to diagnose and fix.  Again:  NINE HOURS.<p>A more callous review would suggest that Signal remains centralized because Moxies waiting for an IPO, or an offer from FAANG to buy him out.  Im certainly not of that opinion, but FWIW this was a disaster for Signal and most of HN is about to break an arm patting the company on the back.<p>Whatsapp certainly took notice, and certainly used it as an opportunity to win back some of its detractors.')
