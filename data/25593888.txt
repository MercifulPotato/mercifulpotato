Supposedly, I have more in common with folks 50 miles away in Kingwood than I do with the folks two streets over.  It&#x27;s BS and leads to Crenshaw getting elected (who I didn&#x27;t like but at least respected at the beginning of his term, but really kinda do hate now).<p>There is a bit more than just the usual gerrymandering at play here, though.  Notice where the southern tip of the district is.  The med center is deliberately split between (almost) every congressional district in Houston.  That means that it gets multiple representatives in congress from multiple parties and remains well-funded.  That&#x27;s actually not a bad strategy, but it unfortunately gives the Republican state legislature a justification to hide behind for their blatant gerrymandering.<p>It&#x27;s also why the current configuration isn&#x27;t likely to change dramatically.  Both parties want to ensure that the TX Medical Center has lots of representation in congress. As a result, Houston&#x27;s core will always be divided among multiple districts.  Republicans control the state legislature, so they make the districts have big &quot;blobs&quot; from outside the city, but if it were drawn by the democrats, it would still have this weird tendency to have narrow &quot;arms&quot; reaching towards the med center.')
