Item(by='kls', descendants=None, kids=[25157345], score=None, time=1605837543, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25152109, text='The problem is it is not &quot;smart but lazy&quot; it is a value proposition and some kids don&#x27;t see the value, even if they are smart enough. The reality is many smart kids today know that even higher education, unless specifically focused is a waste of resources. The smart ones generally leave the uni for a business venture before they even complete postsecondary.<p>Further grade inflation and the continuing of lowering standards means that the ones that know how to game the system, can skate in general ed, pull out 2, 4.0 GPA years at community, where they get some choice in their direction, save money and then usually gain admittance into a decent school. As I said, it&#x27;s not lazy it&#x27;s a value proposition and in many ways the ones that don&#x27;t totally wash out, don&#x27;t see the value in applying their faculties to the endeavor of educating themselves the way the State proscribes.<p>Boot camp is for discipline and grit, compulsory education is well compulsory and you don&#x27;t get a choice in how you learn, not everyone learns the same, and not everyone is lazy for seeing the emperor has no clothes. Many successful tech Founders&#x2F;CEO&#x27;s would meet your definition of &quot;Smart but Lazy&quot; but some smart people do just wash out. Maybe it&#x27;s just like burnout that is so prevalent in the tech industry, yet they hit it early.<p>For example my youngest son can look at a fairly complex algebraic equation, and within a few seconds he can tell you the answer by calculating it in his head. It&#x27;s some nearly savant level stuff, one time I asked him how does he do that and he said the equations are a painters pallet, each part has a color, he takes the color and paints a picture in his mind and that picture is the answer. I think you can imagine sitting him down to force him to learn algebra the way most of us do it, is painful to say the least. Not only can he arrive at the answer faster than us, he has to actively suppress the way he learns to learn a process he will never use in reality. He does not see the point, he already has the answer. He is not being lazy, his mind just uses the creative half to solve logic, its pretty messed up, but it works for him, so you can imagine his frustration when he has to show his work because we &quot;The Education System&quot; want him to think and solve the problem the same way we do. The value proposition for him is not there. My older son is the exact opposite, once he learned the mechanics of solving equations and how to apply them to real world problems like fabrication, fuel maps, etc. etc. he was hooked but he is the one that struggles in other areas, because he sees the value proposition of focusing on what he is interested in and sees subjects such as English and Literature as a complete waste of his time. I sympathize with him, because I hated those two subject as well.')
