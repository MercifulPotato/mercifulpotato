There&#x27;s real production cases where even default Clojure can result in the same or faster performance than Java. One hypothetical case is a system that does a lot of complex in-memory reads and a few writes to persistent data structures. That kinda of system <i></i>could<i></i> be faster than the Java equivalent, out of the box, in Clojure.<p>A write-heavy system would benefit Java mutable collections out of the box. Clojure can get pretty close to Java with transients and a good dose of type hinting in all the right places.<p>When we say &quot;faster&quot; or &quot;slower&quot; it&#x27;s equally important to specify &quot;faster&quot; or &quot;slower&quot; <i></i>when<i></i> and <i></i>where<i></i>. It&#x27;s a complex question with no easy answer.')
