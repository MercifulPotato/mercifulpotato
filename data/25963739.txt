I wonder if repackaging a viral content of  &#x27;&lt;meme&gt;&#x27; as a conversational cartoon, &#x27;A: &quot;&lt;meme&gt;!&quot; B: &quot;LOL!&quot;&#x27;, might increase the likelihood of it being spoken?  Perhaps yielding viral content spread, with oral storytelling leaves.  Or maybe even A: &quot;&lt;idea&gt;&quot; B: &quot;Neat! &lt;question&gt;?&quot; A: &quot;&lt;answer&gt;&quot; to scaffold further conversation and thought?<p>There&#x27;s a common professorial comment, that they didn&#x27;t really understanding some topic, until after preparing for, and teaching it.   So the exploratory question is, how might &#x27;preparing for, and teaching it&#x27; be made a greater part of the science education content and outreach experience.  For the additional motivation of sharing the knowledge with others.  And for the incentive towards clearer, more integrated understanding - eg, to be able to answer non-toy real-people questions.')
