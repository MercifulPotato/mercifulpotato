Of course they did.<p>What I meant was that Apple themselves talked about significant optimization for Apple Silicon in Big Sur. The question is if any of these optimizations could have also been applied to x86 but aren&#x27;t because x86 is the outgoing platform.<p>I&#x27;m skeptical of the assertion (without supporting documentation) that there is some hardware design choice in Apple Silicon that makes it _drastically_ more memory (quantity) efficient than x86 when using presumably the same kernel, same toolchain frameworks (LLVM), etc.')
