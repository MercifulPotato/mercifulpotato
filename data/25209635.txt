With the large farm we have insurance so that when (WHEN not IF) there is a crop failure we just buy something from a farm far away. Distance is important here: crop failures tend to be because of a situation that affects your entire village so you can&#x27;t fall back on a local safety net, you need a large one with a distribution network.  The distribution network in turns requires a lot of people not working the farm but instead distributing things around.  To make this work you need large farms with surplus.<p>In short your ideals sound good, but they just don&#x27;t work out. Too many people are needed off the farm to pull it off, but you put them on their little farms.')
