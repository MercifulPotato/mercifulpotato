If you allow the article, the article goes viral, then the retraction a day later gets no attention (because it’s not as interesting) well then now a ton of people are gonna be walking around thinking “didn’t they get Biden’s son’s emails and catch him in a crime or something?”<p>There’s no cool cosmic justice here, where the Post loses readership because they publish lies or that politicians will be punished for promoting lies from sources they knew to be bad. There’s just this hazy miasma, where the Post is vaguely not credible but also not totally distrusted, and people forget which politician promoted which story a couple days later.<p>That means the best way to play the game isn’t to research the truth but to drum up the most fantastical lies you can. That game has nothing but bad outcomes for humanity in the long term, and I don’t blame the platforms for trying extremely flawed approaches to prevent it.')
