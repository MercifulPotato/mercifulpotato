Where are its iron laws written? There are 100,000 books on epistemology, the philosophy of science, methodology, and so on, but there&#x27;s no concrete singular set of guidelines or tenets of practioners to uphold at every point (besides generalities like &quot;experiment&quot;, &quot;falsifiability&quot;, &quot;process&quot; etc).<p>And these things mean even less so in soft-sciences, from sociology to economics.<p>&gt;<i>The goals of being popular and asked about important questions and the goals of whatever your field are ... two different things.</i><p>It&#x27;s not just the media goals that are at odds with your &quot;pure&quot; field&#x27;s goals.<p>So are (or can be) the goals of your university administration, of your state, of your industry sponsors, of your vanity and&#x2F;or greed, or your career advancement, of those that give grants, of the public opinion, of your personal ideologies, and so on...')
