I probably think about this game at least once a month, but am unable to return to it since &quot;solving&quot; the core loop. Once you figure it out, it&#x27;s easy. But the climb to the solution is... steep to say the least. It took me a few failed runs to survive the winter easily.<p>What a great game. There&#x27;s a lot of mod content out there, but it all just felt off to me, so I never really explored outside of vanilla.<p>I hope Shining Rock&#x27;s next game is along the same lines and as good, if not better!')
