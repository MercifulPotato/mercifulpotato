The strongest indicators that I&#x27;ve found for whether someone can do complex, research-level work are:<p>* Being able (and willing) to <i>try</i> at a problem, even with partial information. Even more critically: being able to subdivide a problem such that they can solve <i>some</i> of it and be forthright about being unable to solve the rest.<p>* Just knowing a lot of productivity- and thought-enhancing <i>stuff</i>. My best interviewees are active and vociferous readers, both of technical and non-technical materials. They almost always end up treating interviews as conversations, ones where both parties end up learning a bit.')
