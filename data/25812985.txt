Conformity is the worst thing ever. I am probably more in favor of that view that anyone else. My appreciation for weird people is extremely high.<p>I am approaching this from a different angle - from the individual&#x27;s point of view. As an individual, you &quot;should&quot; want to be as capable and versatile as possible. The version of you which is capable of enjoying socialization with your coworkers is strictly more flexible that the version of you that fears it. It doesn&#x27;t take away your option to go home and do introverted activity when you want to.<p>I have infinite examples of this in my life. Just a quick one - I grew up extremely introverted and shielded from human interaction, spent much of my (especially) highschool and college years behind the computer. This was very helpful to me developing great technical and developer skills.<p>Fast forward many years, I had the opportunity to go to business school. One of the most painful parts of b-school for me initially was the happy hour. I didn&#x27;t know how to small talk or just hang out and &quot;be.&quot; It was rough and I hated it. But over the course of the years, I got used to it, relaxed about it, and found myself enjoying it. It&#x27;s one of the things that enabled me over time to move to product management - the realization that I went from someone ill at ease speaking with new people to someone who doesn&#x27;t think twice about it.<p>Did I &quot;conform&quot; or lose a part of myself? No, I am currently hiding out on the balcony learning React and playing with Serverless while my wife is hanging out with the baby. I am choosing right now to spend my time not much different than how I spent it in high school, and I am loving that. The point is though if I had a social family or work obligation to go to in the evening, I wouldn&#x27;t lose my shit about it anymore - I&#x27;d get dressed, go, enjoy it, and possibly get the networking&#x2F;wife brownie points out of the experience. It&#x27;s a strictly better way to be than dreading&#x2F;avoiding it.<p>PS: thank you for your comment, it made me reflect on what I am trying to convey and, hopefully, convey it more clearly in this response.')
