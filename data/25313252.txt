Item(by='preommr', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607162703, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25313000, text='&gt; &quot;One is that shifts in language play an important role in social change; the MeToo and Black Lives Matter movements, for example, have tried to establish a new anti-sexist and anti-racist vocabulary. An AI model trained on vast swaths of the internet won’t be attuned to the nuances of this vocabulary and won’t produce or interpret language in line with these new cultural norms.&quot;<p>This was just glossed over and maybe slightly off-topic, but what kind of shifts in language did these two movements in particular affect?<p>Stuff like #MeToo was about raising awareness about sexual abuse, particularly in the entertainment industry, can&#x27;t really think of how it forced people to change words that they use.<p>The best example I can think of is people opting to not use &quot;master&#x2F;slave&quot;... Which is much more debatable and far off from &quot;core tenets&quot; of the BLM movement like police reform and dealing with systemic racism.<p>I guess what I am trying to say is that when it comes to language, things are a lot less black&#x2F;white (heh) and we should be careful about people that are setting themselves up as arbiters. Sort of a who guards, the guardians issue I suppose.')
