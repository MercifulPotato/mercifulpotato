I&#x27;ve always wondered why people were so enamored with screen and tmux, when I don&#x27;t really want a second, full-fledged terminal emulator running inside my desktop terminal emulator—I just want to detach from sessions.  Most importantly, though, I want this to be baked in, ideally at the system level, but would settle for dtach-like integration with gnome-terminal; whatever allows this to be done lazily, without needing the foresight to use dtach from the beginning—just like you&#x27;re not required to specify ahead of time whether you want to use job control (Ctrl-Z) at the time that you start the process.<p>It&#x27;s a big shame.
