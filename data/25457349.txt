I can&#x27;t remember the last game I played that was Windows-exclusive.\n  * Business apps work in the browser or Electron, or are otherwise cross-platform. Things that aren&#x27;t, could work with emulation\n  * Developers are using unix-like operating systems, and MS has leaned hard into that. Windows is incongruent with the rest of their developer strategy.\n  * The server ecosystem is almost entirely Linux based, apparently even on Azure\n  * By all appearances, Windows is now a service that upsells other services, and there won&#x27;t be a Windows 11 as we would traditionally think of it\n  * The people who know what an OS is, prefer unix-like OSes by a vast margin. The people who don&#x27;t, wouldn&#x27;t notice the difference.\n  * x86 looks even less like the future than it did a month ago\n</code></pre>\nSo I don&#x27;t understand what the holdup is?')
