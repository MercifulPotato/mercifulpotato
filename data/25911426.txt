Atomic clocks were part of Hewlett-Packard&#x27;s glory days and in that era the user got full documentation, schematics, theory, trouble-shooting guides, etc. The manuals are all still available online or on eBay.<p>There is also the time-nuts mailing list where hundreds of us share questions and experiences with repairing and running old atomic clocks. The archive is 20 years deep so there&#x27;s lots of good info on bringing dead cesium and rubidium clocks back to life:<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;leapsecond.com&#x2F;time-nuts.htm" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;leapsecond.com&#x2F;time-nuts.htm</a><p>The one problem is if the old cesium clock you buy has &quot;run out of gas&quot;. The quantum mechanics physics experiment encapsulated inside the tube is a one-way street so once the tube runs out of cesium one has to replace it. The typical solution is to buy a few cesium clocks over time on eBay and mix parts until you have one that works well.')
