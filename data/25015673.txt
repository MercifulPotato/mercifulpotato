Most historians have judged him to be quite a good one, in fact.<p>Rather than a weakness, the teleology inherent in Stoicism is part of what makes it attractive against the ubiquitous reductive materialism of the modern world. One can just as easily point to materialism&#x27;s <i>lack</i> of teleology as a critical weakness that ruins any virtues it might otherwise have had.<p>I also disagree that his journal reads as though it was meant for publication. In fact I get the opposite impression when reading it, that a man like Aurelius would have been mortified to know some of these entries would be known and re-read by audiences of millions of people for thousands of years to come.<p>It&#x27;s also not clear how having a son who turned out to be a bad man and heir would count against a philosophy that <i>explicitly rejects</i> the idea that we can control such things.')
