Facebook has much more problematic content in an absolute sense than Parler does, even if they have better moderation. After all, they have a far larger userbase. Parler may have a higher amount of problematic content as a percentage of all its content, but Facebook still has a large total impact. So why is their app still available?<p>The article that is linked here in the NY Times (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;09&#x2F;technology&#x2F;apple-google-parler.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;09&#x2F;technology&#x2F;apple-google-p...</a>) states examples of Parler deleting content encouraging violence. So it&#x27;s not as if Parler is doing zero moderation. But it is clear that Facebook and Twitter are not perfect (or even consistent) in their moderation. So where&#x27;s the threshold for when the unmoderated posts cause you to get deplatformed? That line seems arbitrary to me. It also seems like an unfair line since Parler has only 30 employees. If the response to censorship is &quot;go build your own social network&quot;, then surely there needs to be allowance for small social networks that face a sudden influx of new users and traffic. Most users of Parler, and most content, is not problematic.<p>The same question should be asked when it comes to Twitter banning Trump&#x27;s account. Twitter&#x27;s own blog post (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.twitter.com&#x2F;en_us&#x2F;topics&#x2F;company&#x2F;2020&#x2F;suspension.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.twitter.com&#x2F;en_us&#x2F;topics&#x2F;company&#x2F;2020&#x2F;suspensio...</a>) does not make a great case for proving Trump was inciting violence - certainly none of the quoted info (like Trump choosing to skip the inauguration) would pass the bar necessary for a court to prove incitement. But a more basic issue here is that the vast majority of those who turned up in DC to support Trump and see him speak did not participate in the riot. Per various sources (example <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.localdvm.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;washington-dc&#x2F;three-demonstrations-permitted-by-national-park-service-for-week-of-january-4&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.localdvm.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;washington-dc&#x2F;three-demonstrat...</a>) there were <i>tens of thousands</i> of attendees to the recent DC marches, across several fully-legal fully-permitted events. Out of all that, a few hundred raided the capitol. So if a small percentage of your followers engage in criminal activity, is that cause for a ban? And if that is the case, why wouldn&#x27;t the same apply to other politicians or activists or social media figures? Why do BLM-affiliated events get a pass, with the criminal elements written off as a small fringe?')
