I&#x27;m not terribly excited by save&#x2F;sync either. But as long as it doesn&#x27;t have adverse effects, e.g.:<p>* promotes bad history patterns<p>* makes it easier to miss when unwanted changes are included<p>* makes it easy to accidentally push<p>...I see it as a good thing to have new UI patterns tried out. If nothing else, it can act as a counterpoint to show that the complexity of the Git CLI actually is necessary for some of the flexibility.<p>EDIT: I see now that &quot;bit save&quot; encourages using single-line commit messages, which to me promotes bad history patterns. That&#x27;s too bad.')
