But I think in order for me to consider that they&#x27;d need to have a somewhat competitive pricing model.<p>For example: I&#x27;m currently slowly running out of my free Google cloud storage that came with my Gmail account (15GB?). The next step for me is to upgrade to 100GB which will probably be enough for at least the next 10 years or so. With Google Drive that will cost me $1.99 per month which is more than reasonable. With Dropbox the next biggest package (after exceeding the free storage limit of 2GB) is to upgrade to a $11.99 plan for 2 TB (waaaaay more than I will ever need).<p>I&#x27;m willing to pay 5.99 for idealistic reasons but I&#x27;m not willing to pay more than that just for the sake of supporting a &quot;smaller&quot; non-FAANG company. They need to provide a better deal for something between 2 GB and 2 TB.')
