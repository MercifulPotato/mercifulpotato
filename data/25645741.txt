Such high quality filtering can be done more simply and more exactly with an inverse Fourier transform.<p>The second technique doesn&#x27;t seem promising because shuffling is very crude: differently shuffled small blocks are going to have border artifacts, repeating small blocks are going to have worse periodic artifacts, large blocks are going to approximate white noise rather than blue noise. Higher quality would require precomputing blue noise images, losing the advantage of on-the-fly computation.<p>The third technique, being sequential, is unlikely to be practically cheaper than an inverse Fourier transform.')
