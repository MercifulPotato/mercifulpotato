Inconvenience based solutions don&#x27;t address the problem: using apps to restrict phone use, physically hiding the phone etc. Once you leave those carefully constrained conditions, you are more vulnerable than ever. Not to mention the contradiction with the core issue that it&#x27;s a symptom rather than a cause.<p>2. Turning abstinence as an ongoing status condition (e.g. &quot;X days since I did Y&quot;) is a trap. It sets you up for later failure by burdening you with a perpetually unfinished objective with psychological consequences that only increase as the &#x27;highscore&#x27; increases. This could work with things that are less easily accessible like heroin, but it&#x27;s not going to work with something as easily accessible as a phone or computer.<p>3. The solution that works with 1 and 2 is probably urge surfing as it tackles the issue directly<p>4. It&#x27;s easier to think of it as an addiction to browsing rather than an addiction to the phone itself. You have to catch yourself during any browsing moment in any context to eventually make progress. Be intentional in almost every action instead of going on auto-pilot, although obviously resting at the end of the day is fine. It&#x27;s more a general philosophy than a hard rule meant to exhaust you.<p>5. The eventual goal is a rich life where you no longer feel the need to distract yourself')
