By that time I thought I was totally &quot;over&quot; my bullying, if anything I felt shame that something that happened so long ago that I thought was behind me could have such a strong hold on my current behavior. Therapy has helped me immensely, and while I realize that talk therapy results are highly dependent on individual therapist and patient, my biggest regret is that I didn&#x27;t start sooner.')
