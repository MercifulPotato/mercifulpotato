I&#x27;m a fan of Reply All, but this was an episode that was so good it almost didn&#x27;t seem real. Low spoilers, but they downplayed the ending so much that even without it, it&#x27;d have been a really good episode. But with the ending, I straight up dropped my jaw. Such a cool, relatable, story.')
