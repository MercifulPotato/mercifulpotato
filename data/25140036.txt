Attitudes to Down&#x27;s have changed a lot in recent decades, and children now get access to education and assistance, instead of being stuck in an institution to rot. As such, life outcomes are <i>vastly</i> different to what they used to be.<p>I have a daughter with Down&#x27;s, so I probably know more about it that most.<p>&gt; You will never surpass the cognitive capacity of a young child<p>This is just completely untrue.<p>&gt; you will have impaired vision and hearing<p>There is certainly a higher incidence of vision and hearing problems in people with Down&#x27;s, but it&#x27;s far from guaranteed. Further more, glasses and hearing aids are a thing.<p>&gt; if you ever manage to speak at all<p>I&#x27;m struggling to take you seriously now - this is utterly absurd.<p>&gt; You will have a myriad other chronic and painful health problems<p>There is a higher incidence of some physical and mental illnesses in people with Down&#x27;s, but again, it&#x27;s far from guaranteed, and again need not have a large impact.
