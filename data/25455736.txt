But if the test itself is not mandatory, then it defeats the purpose.<p>i.e. If I have the choice between taking the test or not, and I know the test is going to report me if my result is positive, leading to consequences I see as negative, then I can just choose not to take the test.<p>If I see the consequences of a positive test (quarantine, isolation, etc.) as necessary then I would just do it voluntarily and the government wouldn&#x27;t need to step in.')
