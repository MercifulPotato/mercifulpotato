It is quite easy to make up a conspiracy, as ill-defined as that term is, and spread it. It is much harder to craft an argument against conspiracies, since it requires adherence to the truth. It is easier to create chaos than order. Then there is the additional factor that onlookers might just see it as baseless arguing---whom do you trust unless you do careful fact-checking (but which repository of &quot;facts&quot; can you trust?). Somewhat related is that &quot;common sense&quot; thinking is often flat out wrong. Sometimes, truth is counter intuitive.<p>Humans will always fall prey to grifts.
