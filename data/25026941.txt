Item(by='carapace', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604854101, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25024017, text='&gt; lying is absolutely rampant. Are there politicians who are relatively honest? Sure, but while they may have loyal grass-roots support, they tend not to be the most successful and they are most definitely in the minority.<p>That actually matches my default belief pretty well, FWIW, but I don&#x27;t have a lot of evidence for it.  Yes, there are lots of news stories about lying&#x2F;corrupt politicians, but without the greater context how can you tell the prevalence?  It&#x27;s like a negative survivorship bias, we only hear about the scandals.<p>&gt; I think the main difference is the willingness (or lack thereof) of people in respectable positions to cover for his lying, because he is not considered respectable.<p>Yeah, I found that sad and disgusting.<p>My personal problem is, is this just what humans are?  Can we do better?  Should we &quot;Take off and nuke the site from orbit.  It&#x27;s the only way to be sure.&quot;?<p>I try to remind myself that we are in fact getting better, we have the tools to fix our problems, and there&#x27;s reason to hope.  Yay us!')
