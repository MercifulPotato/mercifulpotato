If your code assumes everything&#x27;s in drawable coordinates, it&#x27;ll work in a top-level window on X11, but may break when Wayland w&#x2F;CSD shifts things.<p>That slide is potentially quite damaging to GTK+&#x27;s reputation, to not even provide a way for us to independently verify the results is frustrating.')
