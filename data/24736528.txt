Item(by='nobody9999', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602300895, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24736066, text='&gt;If you have never met a representative sample of half the country it seems reasonable to assume anything you don&#x27;t like is done by someone evil outside it.<p>That&#x27;s part of the problem.  <i>You</i> are assuming that <i>everyone</i> who doesn&#x27;t live in a small town or rural area believes that those who do are bad, evil or wrong.<p>Well I&#x27;m here to tell you that you&#x27;re mistaken.  The vast majority of my fellow Americans (regardless of where they live) are decent people who just want to have a country that respects the rule of law, provides equality under those laws and gives everyone a fair shake to succeed.<p>There is a very small group that doesn&#x27;t want that.  And they seem to have successfully pitted us against each other, rural vs. urban, white vs. black, young vs. old, etc., etc., etc.<p>But those are <i>false</i> divisions.  Sure, we disagree about a bunch of things.  But the vast majority of us agree about much more than we disagree.<p>So please, don&#x27;t just paint everyone that&#x27;s different (in this case, the population density of their residence) with such a broad brush.<p>I was born and live in the largest city in the US.  I&#x27;ve also traveled all over this country, and lived in cities, suburbs and small towns.  What I&#x27;ve seen in my more than half-century of living, is that we mostly want the same things.<p>The problem is that we&#x27;re not getting them!  But it&#x27;s not the city dweller or the rural resident that&#x27;s keeping us from doing so.<p>We could make this country a good place for just about all of us if we stop hurling insults at one another and work together to <i>make</i> our government work <i>for</i> us.<p>Because, in the end, the government <i>is</i> us.  That we allow ourselves to be divided, keeps us from working together to create the change <i>we all want</i>.<p>If we do that, and build bridges of communication to do so, we&#x27;re in a much better position to communicate and compromise about the stuff we disagree upon.<p>I don&#x27;t care where you live or what you look like.  Americans are my brothers and sisters, and I want you to have the life you want to live.  And I want to have the life I want to live.<p>Let&#x27;s not let those who don&#x27;t want that keep us from getting it.')
