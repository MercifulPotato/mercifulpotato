Before adopting TypeScript, I&#x27;d have to read documentation in a wide variety of documentation styles and standards, and then manually ensure that I was calling the right functions with the right arguments (or - alternatively, if I was lazy - I&#x27;d just write some shim code and attach a debugger to figure out the call signatures of callback functions). With TypeScript and type hints installed for the libraries I&#x27;m using, instead I just let my editor hand out typing information and autocomplete hits, and let the typescript compiler do type checking.<p>If anything, TypeScript sometimes feels like a nice middle-ground between C# and JavaScript (and Java?), and though it&#x27;s not perfect, I do feel that it&#x27;s pleasurable once you get the hang of it and the quirks of the ecosystem.')
