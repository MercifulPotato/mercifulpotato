Gold has been used as money for millennia, so it lets us go back even further than we typically do with inflation data.<p>Everyone always references Henry Ford&#x27;s $5 a day wage in these discussions. $5 during that time was worth 1&#x2F;4 oz of gold, so at 260 days a year, they were pulling in the US dollar value of 65 ounces of gold a year.<p>You would need over $120,000 today to buy 65 ounces of gold. Sure beats the heck out of $48,000. If you buy the notion that wages should track productivity, it makes you wonder what they were doing in 1913 that made everybody so darn productive.')
