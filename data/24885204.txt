Splitting code up in files requires some extra work and makes refactoring harder as you have to spend a lot of effort on trivial tasks such as moving dependencies between files and updating includes all over the place.<p>Personally I tend to want to split up code written by others so I can focus on the parts that go together without having to read through irrelevant parts, but I can easily navigate larger files&#x2F;classes I&#x27;ve authored myself. I mainly split it up for the sake of future readers.')
