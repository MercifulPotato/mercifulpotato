Weren&#x27;t those complete in June for those vaccines that are getting deployed now?<p>And, anyway, I&#x27;m sure getting safety data from a large scale trial, where every vaccinated person is a data point is much faster than getting effectivity data, where only the people exposed to the virus count.<p>Shouldn&#x27;t vaccines made with proven technology carry a somewhat high prior of efficacy?<p>(And, anyway, with all those problems people are finding on the trials, we are still green lighting them. What&#x27;s only fair, because it&#x27;s very likely that the problems aren&#x27;t important. But why can we make that calculation now, but couldn&#x27;t in June?)')
