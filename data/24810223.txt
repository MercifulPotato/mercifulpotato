Ideally you validate the market and your place in it early on, for instance by hitting the front page of HN&#x2F;a subreddit or something like that with one of your articles every so often. If your hit rate is too low your market probably is too small or you&#x27;re not giving them content they want (even though it may be high quality content that they need...). At some point you change what you&#x27;re doing, change your goals or move on.')
