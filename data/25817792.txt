So you probably spend most of the time working in some other platform, and doing macOS work for you is just an annoyance, having to context switch to another process, etc.<p>Apple tho wants macOS developers (and users prefer apps from people dedicated to macOS). That&#x27;s because such vendors (e.g. Panic, BareBones, Omni, and so on) won&#x27;t do lowest common denominator apps, they keep up with the platform, they understand it, they hook in to new platform-only capabilities, etc.).<p>&gt;<i>Apple&#x27;s desktop market share being what it is, I cannot comprehend how they&#x27;re generally getting away with this.</i><p>Apple&#x27;s market share is what it is, in part because they enforce things like this. This means they can add new OS&#x2F;hardware features and devs will add support for them fast (instead on relying to 1000s of half-ported apps, with shared functionality on Windows and Mac, and horrible cross-platformy UIs).<p>That&#x27;s also why (forcing more people to use XCode, and thus the official APIs, BitCode, and so on), they can introduce a whole new architecture like AS, and have macOS apps support it from day one, or old x86 apps running smoothly translated.')
