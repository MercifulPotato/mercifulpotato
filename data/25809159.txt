TANSTAAFL.<p>Downvoters, kindly explain what is so wrong about my statement. There are costs to run the operation, having generous benefactors writing big checks (a) do not change this, (b) makes Signal&#x27;s operation dependent on the source of revenue and (c) hide these externalities long enough to hinder the development of cheaper&#x2F;more efficient alternatives.<p>IOW, &quot;depending on donations&quot; is not a solution. Just like Socialism, it works until we run out of other people&#x27;s money.')
