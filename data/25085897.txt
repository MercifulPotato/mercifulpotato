This is a crime, whereas being disloyal to the president is explicitly not a crime.<p>I&#x27;m not a fan of vigilante justice in general, but at least the targets in the &quot;punch a nazi&quot; case have <i>confessed</i>, and the punishment called for isn&#x27;t death.<p>However, I do not believe that posting &quot;punch a nazi&quot; is a conservative enough position given that the standard of evidence for labelling someone a nazi, in practice, is that they disagree with you on the internet.')
