With anything under 6-8 hours of driving, if a car, train or bus is available I&#x27;d take that.<p>First off, getting to the airport is guaranteed time lost since airports are nowhere near where I want to end up. Second, the security theater. Take off your shoes, belt, get X-rayed.<p>Next come the delays. The worst is when you can be stuck on the tarmac for hours and you can&#x27;t even get up to go to the toilet or stretch your legs. If a train is stuck you can get up and walk around and if you have a car you can take a break.<p>Definitely the most inflexible form of travel.')
