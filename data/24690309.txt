Headings, paragraphs, list items, <i>&amp;c.</i> all get their widths constrained (deliberately to different points, in my case, which wouldn’t work if you were going centre-aligned), but figures can be full-bleed simply by not having that max-width (though in my case they still need negative side margins, but of known values).')
