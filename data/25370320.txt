Funny how somebody who believes in invisible ghosts and resurrection and chants magic soap labels but doesn&#x27;t believe in science or cause and effect will accuse somebody else who does of insanity. You&#x27;re the deranged one arguing that the poor should suffer to help the world and the environment. That makes your personality very dark, indeed.<p>We&#x27;re having a discussion about psychopaths with dark personality traits who deceive people into thinking they&#x27;re saints, and Mother Teresa is the archetypical textbook example of that. Do you have any evidence to the contrary? Can you prove Christopher Hitchens&#x27; criticisms are wrong? All you&#x27;ve contributed so far is serving as an example of somebody who refuses to look at the evidence and was gullibly fooled into believing a terrible person is actually a saint. Which was my point. Thank you!')
