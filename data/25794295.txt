Even the worst people should enjoy the protections of a free society, because any one of us could at some point somehow (accidentally!) become the worst.  The police don&#x27;t get the right suspect 100% of the time, so if you were in the wrong place at the wrong time you could now be a murder or rape suspect, or worse yet charged.  Anyone could!<p>Similarly we should favor even &quot;bad&quot; people being allowed to speak because norms change, often very quickly.  15 years ago it was entirely within the mainstream politics to not publicly support gay marriage.  Now if you&#x27;re against it you&#x27;re labelled a homophobe.  What views do you have today that might be decidedly distasteful in another decade?  Do you know?  Do any of us?<p>Suggesting that because you&#x27;re expressing what are now mainstream views means you&#x27;re reasonable and thus safe is to -- at least to me -- completely misunderstand the ideas behind equality under the law or the real goal of freedom of expression.')
