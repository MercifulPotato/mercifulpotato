Trump&#x27;s vast popularity showed up again in this latest election, they couldn&#x27;t even try to hide it behind fake Russian interference. It was nothing more than a politcal ruse, a frame to hold Trump in, which the media almost universally played along with (and simultaneously they won&#x27;t tag Biden as being controlled by China despite Biden having far closer ties to China than Trump does to Russia). It&#x27;s the exact same thing they did to Tulsi Gabbard when she dared to go against their agenda. We&#x27;re all owned by the all-powerful, magical Russians if we go off the acceptable message.')
