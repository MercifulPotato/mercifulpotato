E.g. Windows natively supports ARM32 and ARM64 in Windows 10. Apple chooses to only support ARM64 for simplicity.<p>In either case any future change in the ARM architecture couldn&#x27;t be worse than how each platform handles running x86 apps on ARM and currently the Apple M1 does that better than the previous Intel chips they were using.')
