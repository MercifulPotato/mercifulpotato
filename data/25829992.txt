If we instead built long term competence within public institutions, including competitive remuneration and career development like training programmes, there wouldn&#x27;t be a need to have a door between the private and public sector quite as much in the first place.  The reward should be delivered <i>in situ</i> for continued constructive service, not be an <i>upgrade</i> to a private sector gig after holding your nose and&#x2F;or making decisions you feel will be looked upon favourably by future employers.<p>Private and public sector employees could collaborate where it makes sense, just like companies sometimes collaborate on shared initiatives like working groups or open source projects.<p>Government can actually work better than it does in the US -- as it does in other countries -- but one must first accept the ideological premise, which seems to be what holds the country back.')
