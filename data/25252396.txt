I also see a staunch neo-liberal who is a product of the United States capitalism.<p>He knows how he was able to get out of Brownsville and he wouldn&#x27;t want to change the system that brought him his American dream.<p>At the same time he&#x27;s compassionate and pragmatic so I&#x27;m sure he would be behind free health care and free education but he does truly enjoy having less government, less taxes and more profit for himself.<p>These are all views that are incompatible with mine, but then again I am not from the US so I have no idea about how he got that mentality on his journey.<p>I can speculate that growing up in Brownsville instilled a sense of independence and an emphasis on doing for self what no one else will do for you.')
