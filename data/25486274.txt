This discomfort with one&#x27;s own thoughts, this inability to sit alone, this irritation with being is an aspect of life I identified and seriously attacked in my pre-teen years. I foresaw that aspect of life as an exploitable weakness, and a weakness exploited everywhere - religion being #1 abuser of this weakness, but it&#x27;s shadow used to sell products and politics and all using fear of self as it&#x27;s key mechanism.<p>I started reading the literary classics early, like 3rd grade. They were far too mature for me, but that information at that age was a crash course in the true nature of this world and life itself.
