No one is saying you should see them as victims. No one is saying you should see them as the good guys. The only thing you should be sorry about is not trying to accurately understand the replies you are getting here or look objectively at the situation.<p>BTW since you like whatabouism with your argument regarding Russia: Please do compare the Iranian and Saudi Arabian regimes for me; one is an enemy with sanctions and the other an ally. Internally they are not that different. Externally there is a major difference though: only one is engaging in a hostile war in another country which has resulted in civilian deaths and famine. While there are claims to be made about Iranian foreign interference it is nowhere near that level. So again please take some minutes to ponder objectively how these countries are treated.')
