I would say two draws per week is wrong but I&#x27;m not a lottery expert. Every 10 years may seem surprisingly often, but we are including sequences like 2,3,5,7,11,13 which most people wouldn&#x27;t find special. Even 10,12,14,16,18,20 (double of this &quot;special&quot; sequence) I think a lot of people wouldn&#x27;t care as much.')
