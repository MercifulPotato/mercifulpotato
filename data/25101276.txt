Item(by='wholinator2', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605449413, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25101110, text='Right, right. But come on man. This is literally a post entitled &quot;Are you depressed&quot;. Did you really expect no one to come post a story? I understand the point about the hard logical instructions rather than the soft warm consolation but have some compassion, some empathy for your fellow human. Telling the guy he should just go to therapy instead of posting his story on a thread that&#x27;s _literally asking for his story_ is the same kind of hard uncaring logicism as the parent comment.<p>Please, I beg of all of you, do not forget what kindness and compassion can do for all of us, and that no matter where we are now, life and success is fragile and can be taken in an instant. Are we all anti-social corporate robots on here? So much so that the usual &#x27;all business&#x27; crowd is now attempting to convert any &#x27;human and not business&#x27; threads back into the corporate ethos? Why can&#x27;t we just say something nice or leave and go back to toxifying about the latest Twitter gaff or apple device. As much as you can say that this forum is about silicon dreams, I can say this forum is equally about the human minds that have them. This forum and more its tone is what we make it, and the recent anti social push worries me and threatens to push any actual compassion away.')
