It&#x27;s page 72 of <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.morganclaypool.com&#x2F;doi&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;10.2200&#x2F;S00874ED3V01Y201809CAC046" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.morganclaypool.com&#x2F;doi&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;10.2200&#x2F;S00874ED3V01Y...</a> and with luck <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;books.google.com&#x2F;books?id=Td51DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA72" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;books.google.com&#x2F;books?id=Td51DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA72</a> will get you to the page. The numbers have changed (commodity SSDs have markedly improved!) but the idea still makes sense.<p>Fun to consider that boxes under one top-of-rack switch can hold dozens of TB of RAM and hundreds of TB of Flash with latency measured in Âµs between them. There&#x27;s legitimately interesting space in between writing code for a single machine and code for huge, spread-out clusters of thousands of boxes.')
