Item(by='mcv', descendants=None, kids=[24966823], score=None, time=1604309271, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24963821, text='I don&#x27;t know much about Haskell, but I was struck by this:<p>&gt; <i>&quot;Suppose we want a type for “an integer between 1 and 5, inclusive.” The natural constructive modeling would be an enumeration with five cases&quot;</i><p>Does that really make sense? Using an enum for a limited integer type? I realise most languages don&#x27;t actually support true limited integer types, but if I recall correctly from my introductory programming classes 28 years ago, Modula2 does allow you to specify a number type with a range of acceptable values. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve seen that in any other language, but it sounds like an incredibly useful feature if you want type safety.')
