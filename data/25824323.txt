Customer service bots that go beyond FAQ to do a very convincing impression of a human service rep promising an investigation into an incident but can&#x27;t actually start an investigation into the incident are negative. An information retrieval tool which has no information on a subject but can spin a very plausible explanation based on data on a different subject is negative.<p>Of course, it&#x27;s entirely possible for humans to bullshit, but unlike text generation algorithms it isn&#x27;t our default response to everything.')
