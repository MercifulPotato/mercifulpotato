Of course, this is just training material which I&#x27;m sure they make mandatory primarily to avoid liability, and I&#x27;m pretty far removed from the actual sales people in the company. It&#x27;s entirely possible the training is more what you&#x27;d call &quot;guidelines&quot; than actual rules, to paraphrase Hector Barbossa from Pirates of the Caribbean.')
