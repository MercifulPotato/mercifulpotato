Most Star Trek series didn&#x27;t get decent until the third season.  Looking even further back, something like Cheers would have been axed almost instantly.<p>Back when I used to give a damn about television series, I followed a lot of the inside baseball, including incidents that might lead to a series getting cancelled.  Some networks were just more prone to cancellation than others.  For a while, Fox was particularly eager to take a sackful of new kittens down to the creek; I recall one series didn&#x27;t make four shown episodes before cancellation.  The Sci-Fi Channel (later SyFy) had a particularly brutal streak for a while.<p>It&#x27;s clear that whatever any network promises at the outset, they exist in a huge tension with the actual show creators and runners (and yet more tension with the actors).  All negotations should be performed with that in mind.  I wonder precisely how hard an &quot;exit clause&quot; would be to wrangle.  You know, you cancel the show, we get four or six episodes, at such and such budget, and such and such filming time, to wrap things up.<p>Since about 2005, my television series selection is what I call the &quot;vulture strategy:&quot; I wait until a series is cancelled before I watched.  Then I wait for the hype to die down (the carcass gets more juicy).  If it is still appealing after all of that, I stick my beak in.  I just cannot get invested in something that might have the lifespan of a carnival guppy that could be flushed down the toilet at the first sign of listlessness.<p>Netflix in particular has been very clumsy in the execution of its shows lately, even once I filter out the endless annoyance of its dark UI patterns.  Very &quot;message-y;&quot; I got a bellyful of that with the Christian types.  And that&#x27;s without them going and retroactively editing their old shows.  Netflix is turning into my <i>last</i> pick when I want to look for something random to watch.')
