The word count challenge here got my interest at the time, so I whipped up an assembly language version of it and iterated several times, trying to figure out the value of switching different registers. In the end, I took second place:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jagregory&#x2F;abrash-black-book&#x2F;blob&#x2F;4028269fe1f847f81dfae21bf01b185fecbb9075&#x2F;src&#x2F;chapter-16.md" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jagregory&#x2F;abrash-black-book&#x2F;blob&#x2F;4028269f...</a><p>However, there&#x27;s an interesting story behind this story. David Stafford, who came in first, posted that he thought he had the fastest solution and bet $100 that nobody could beat it. I posted my code which was significantly faster, and David tweaked it further to eventually win the challenge. Like a true person of honor, he did pay the $100 and I cashed his check.')
