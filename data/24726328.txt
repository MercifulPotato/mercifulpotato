The way we moderate HN when YC or YC startups are involved has been stable for many years: we moderate less in such cases. You&#x27;ll find many statements of this going back a long time here:  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?query=moderate%20less%20not%20more%20yc%20by:dang&amp;dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=false&amp;sort=byDate&amp;type=comment" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?query=moderate%20less%20not%20more%2...</a>.<p>Less, however, does not mean zero. You posted 15 aggressive comments in this thread; that&#x27;s extreme. You&#x27;ve crossed well into trolling, and even descended into personal attack (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24724190" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24724190</a>). I don&#x27;t know where this grudge is coming from, but it&#x27;s time to stop.<p>Plenty of other commenters have been raising similar concerns (e.g. about hosted secrets); that&#x27;s obviously fine. The difference is that they&#x27;re doing it in a decent and non-vindictive way, as the site guidelines require.')
