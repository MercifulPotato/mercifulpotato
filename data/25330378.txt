This sort of code acts as a natural filter.<p>Someone&#x27;s who finds it difficult to learn or to use it may not be ready for the kernel development. So it works as expected on more than one level.<p>The same goes for intrusive containers and few other things that many people learn in school, but get at first confused by in practice. If this creates a friction at the group level, then it&#x27;s the problem with the average group skill rather than the code. And it&#x27;s the former that (ideally) needs addressing. Just like you wouldn&#x27;t use bubble sort because the &quot;group&quot; has trouble understanding the alternatives.')
