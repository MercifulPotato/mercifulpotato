It&#x27;s a problem! We think that knowledge should be on the government side, but the structure isn&#x27;t there yet: USDS and 18F have rotational term limits that keep people moving through, and at the VA (not sure about other agencies) they&#x27;re just in the last couple years building out an organization to do that long-term product ownership and institutional knowledge retention, even if implementation teams come through. It&#x27;s moving in the right direction but it&#x27;s slow, large-organization change, with a lot of extra slowness that&#x27;s unique to government.')
