If you&#x27;re a resident in another state (Texas), and are conducting work in that state (Texas, home office), then HR has to make sure they&#x27;re conforming to the labor laws of that state (Texas), not the state of the office where you used to work (California).<p>&gt;You could maybe fight with the State of California for the refund next year, but in the meantime you&#x27;ll pay taxes in the state if your paycheck says so.<p>That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s pertinent to change your residency as soon as you move, and then update HR the same day. Else you&#x27;re fighting an uphill battle for no reason.<p>&gt;If your desk is in NYC, but live in CT or NJ, you&#x27;ll pay taxes in two states, even if you haven&#x27;t set foot in your office for months.<p>No longer true if you no longer actually work there.<p>&gt;You can try changing your residency to e.g. Texas as you say, getting assigned by HR to a new office or marked as remote, but you can bet that the original state will try everything in their book to keep some of your money.<p>And you can give them the middle finger because they&#x27;re wrong. Spending $300 to get your taxes prepped by a CPA will stop 99% of this shenanigans.<p>&gt;Although you&#x27;re right in general, there is actually a history of CA going aggressively after the money of residents of other states, like the screenwriter in AZ that did a lot of work for a California customer<p>That&#x27;s because he was deriving his income as a unitary business from entirely California sources: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forbes.com&#x2F;sites&#x2F;robertwood&#x2F;2019&#x2F;10&#x2F;22&#x2F;now-california-can-assess-taxes-no-matter-where-you-livereally&#x2F;?sh=587ffe9e3e7f" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forbes.com&#x2F;sites&#x2F;robertwood&#x2F;2019&#x2F;10&#x2F;22&#x2F;now-calif...</a><p>Again, a lot of states have similar laws on the books (VA, NY, etc.).<p>Source: I used to be a paralegal, and have worked remotely for a long time in various states.')
