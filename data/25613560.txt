While really CVEs should just be seen as an identifier. It means multiple people talking about the same vuln know they&#x27;re talking about the same vuln. It means if you read an advisory about CVE-xxx-yyy you can ask the vendor of your software if they already have a patch for that.<p>It simply says nothing about whether a vuln is real, relevant or significant.')
