I am one of the designers from the Lobe team here speaking. This is what we strived for when we designed the website, and to be honest, when we designed the product, too, so I am really happy it came across this way.<p>In fact, our process for every feature we work on is the sameâ€”we start thinking about it with the way users are going to learn about it in mind, that allows us to simplify the way we talk about it and massage the messaging as much as possible, so when we have to talk about it externally, it&#x27;s so tested that it just comes natural to us, and hopefully to the world.')
