Item(by='curiousllama', descendants=None, kids=[24704362], score=None, time=1602016877, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24701560, text='Ah, yes, but that&#x27;s not really the point, is it?<p>COMPAS points out an uncomfortable trend (&quot;violent crime is more prevalent in black communities...&quot;) but applies it in a way that is bad (&quot;...and therefore black people should get longer criminal sentences for the same crime&quot;).<p>We both agree, I&#x27;m sure, that socioeconomics and race shouldn&#x27;t meaningfully impact sentence length. We may also agree that it often does.  What a lot of these models do is encode that outcome (that bias, some might say) in seemingly &#x27;objective&#x27; systems.  That reproduction of bias is why they&#x27;re discriminatory - not because they look at crime stats, but because they apply them in a way that most people wouldn&#x27;t.')
