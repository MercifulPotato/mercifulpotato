In practice there are wealthy people willing to pass vast majority of their wealth through generations.<p>Personally I don&#x27;t think it is fair or likely healthy in the long term for the society to let vast majority of the income&#x2F;wealth of wealthy and thus powerful people to go untaxed - even[1] if that income&#x2F;wealth is not consumed.<p>[1] Actually it should be &quot;especially if it is not consumed&quot;. In the old days there was a shortage of capital for investments indicated by relatively high interest rates. Nowadays there is shortage of consumption.
