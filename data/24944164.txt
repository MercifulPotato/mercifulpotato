Drivers are considered to have a &quot;Heavy Duty of Care&quot; since they are of course driving large dangerous vehicles and pedestrians are more vulnerable, but they still have the right of way on your average road.<p>Road death rate is a very broad statistic. As an EU citizen living in the US, there are certainly more differences than road-crossing rules and etiquette. For one, population density is almost an order of magnitude more sparse in the US (36 people &#x2F; km^2) vs the uk (275 people &#x2F;km^2). This, among other things means there&#x27;s a dramatic shift in driving norms. There are also major cultural differences, eg talking on the phone while driving in Ireland is taboo (and illegal), but in Boston it&#x27;s totally normal (and perfectly legal). Drink driving here is far more acceptable too. The list goes on and on.<p>[0]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.birchallblackburn.co.uk&#x2F;do-pedestrians-always-have-right-of-way-on-roads&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.birchallblackburn.co.uk&#x2F;do-pedestrians-always-ha...</a>')
