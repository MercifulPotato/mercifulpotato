Schiller is determined to view a drastically different culture in terms of present ideologies. He&#x27;s almost into classic Marxist analysis. That&#x27;s not helpful.<p>What he doesn&#x27;t get about Banks&#x27; universe is that the sentient machines are in charge. They treat humans almost as pets. It&#x27;s a very pleasant society for humans, but the humans are not running it. Now and then the Culture has to deal with people who really want to be in charge, and it usually finds a place for them, elsewhere.')
