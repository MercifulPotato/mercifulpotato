Can you imagine a time before Youtube and cheap hosting for a college student?  Well, that was a time for me involving FTP servers, hosting on some place with great bandwidth, a time of Emule, Limewire, sharebear?, I can&#x27;t recall it all.<p>There were so many video extensions like .avi, .mpeg, and my favorite was .dvix.  When you use some reguar player, it was always say &quot;codec not found&quot;.  I always knew it would run in VideoLan.  VideoLan you are my codec saver and many hours saved and enjoyed!<p>Happy Birthday!')
