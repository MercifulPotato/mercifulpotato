(where our key optimisation is that we needn&#x27;t restore contexts in tail position, just as Mazewalk doesn&#x27;t palindromise its last unary tree)<p>Consider it as an alternative to the more common strategy of absolutising the modifications onto the leaves in a first tree walk, and then executing all the now-labelled leaves in arbitrary order in a second pass.')
