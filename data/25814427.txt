I doubt it. I&#x27;d say there&#x27;s a significant filter between our technology level and large-scale inter-solar-system colonization. It&#x27;s not at all clear that there is a strong motivation for that - except for a continuous-growth economy, which is kind of unsustainable anyway. Once the population stabilizes and human civilization is basically energy-neutral (i.e. not taking more than the sun provides), where&#x27;s the great need to colonize someplace else (as opposed to communicating)? And if we don&#x27;t stabilize - civilization will burn itself out soon enough, colonization or no.<p>&gt; Even if life only evolves once per galaxy, that still leaves the problem of explaining the rest of the filter<p>No it doesn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s extremely unlikely that one planet with life will travel to a different galaxy. Even with intelligent life it&#x27;s extremely unlikely. Only if instantaneous travel were possible would this be likely.')
