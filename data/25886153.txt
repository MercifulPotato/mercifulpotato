Why, how about having a huge slump, to which central banks respond with aggressive monetary expansion? And that is, of course, the test we’ve just run. And everywhere you look, inflation is low, verging on deflation.</i><p>&gt; <i>So we’ve just run the Schiff test — and his brand of economics, by his own criteria, loses with flying colors. And that goes for just about all anti-Keynesian doctrines: we ran as close to a clean experiment as you’re ever going to get, and the answer is no.</i><p>* <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;krugman.blogs.nytimes.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;11&#x2F;22&#x2F;the-wisdom-of-peter-schiff&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;krugman.blogs.nytimes.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;11&#x2F;22&#x2F;the-wisdom-of-p...</a>')
