Nice, take this randomly generated list of names and numbers! Location? Take this random place. Phone or cell ids? Take this random stuff...)<p>Advantages is that they can start with a bunch of free apps (F-droid is nice!), do not get too far from what SoC vendors already have and can move to another distro (even running both them in parallel) once they sold a good number of devices and the business is sustainable.  All while respecting user freedom even when they really need some proprietary stuff (e.g. bank apps).<p>But, well, that ship has sailed. Let&#x27;s see what we can do.')
