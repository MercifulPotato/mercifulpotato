For example, consumer car models were in production for years after the start of the wars, which was the opposite of the US and Britain.<p>This was because Germany relied on slave labor and imports of many goods, not internal production. (The French resistance ramped up after Herr Sokel initiated the slavery draft of all able-bodied French men and women.)<p>Hitler made 4 mistakes that helped doom Germany:<p>1) He thought the occupied countries would continue to be productive and willing exporters of goods and slaves.<p>2) He mistreated the slaves working in his arms factories, killing around 10 million through malnutrition and mistreatment.<p>3) Russia was shipping in the area of 30% of Germany&#x27;s goods via rail until the day of Operation Barbarossa - the invasion of Russia, Germany&#x27;s super market.<p>4) No oil. :)')
