Item(by='Lazare', descendants=None, kids=[25984671], score=None, time=1612140006, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25983833, text='&gt;  I still don&#x27;t understand why these kinds of derivatives are not banned. They&#x27;re, as you described, basically betting.<p>Imagine I run a chain of hotels in beach resorts. When tourism is up, I make a ton of money; when tourism is down, I lose a ton of money. I&#x27;d like to flatten this so I can make a steadier, safer stream of money, budget more sensibly, and not be at risk of going under if 2-3 bad years come in a row.<p>What can I do? Well, maybe I look around and notice that a big spike in jet fuel prices drives ticket prices up, and when ticket prices go up people stay home and I lose money, whereas cheap jet fuel means high occupancy rates. So I might hedge by buying put options (and&#x2F;or selling call options) on jet fuel. When fuel prices go up, I can offset my low revenues with cash from selling my now-valuable put options (or the cash I received earlier from selling now worthless call options). And when fuel prices go down, I can use some portion of my higher revenues to pay for the cost of the worthless puts I purchased (or to settle the now valuable calls I sold).<p>This sort of thing is common and healthy, not just among end users, but even more so among intermediaries working to remove and reduce the amount of risk inherent in the system.<p>Why are they not banned? Why <i>would</i> they be banned?<p>&gt; Except for a handful of folks, everybody loses money on them.<p>That&#x27;s not really how this works. Or indeed, <i>could</i> work.')
