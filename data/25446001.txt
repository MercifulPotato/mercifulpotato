Item(by='toyg', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608142333, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25445832, text='<i>&gt; demand that W3C, WHATWG clear up their shit and publish formal standards </i><p>WHATWG was founded explicitly to avoid that, i.e. &quot;let&#x27;s get shit done without ceremony, and whatever comes out is the actual standard&quot;. Going back to W3C-like processes would remove the very reason for its existence. Google has been very good at leveraging this, but that&#x27;s mostly because other players seem unwilling to dedicate as many resources to browser-dev as they do (even when, like in Apple&#x27;s and Microsoft&#x27;s case, they have more than enough money to spend).')
