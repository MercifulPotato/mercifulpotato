If you have seen enough tech come and go, you can figure out which 98% of this year&#x27;s idea are the same as the year before, and 40 years ago.<p>At that point you can start cutting through the bullshit and design things using brand new tech as if you had used it for 20 years already. At that point you&#x27;re way ahead of the rest of the pack.<p>(And you can choose not to use the brand new thing, and argue convincingly for why the almost-exactly-the-same 30 year old, more mature and stable, tech is better.)')
