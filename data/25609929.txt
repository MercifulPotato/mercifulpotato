Even within single documents you&#x27;d find the same words spelled in both the British English and American English spelling.<p>As a Canadian, only found the &#x27;s&#x27; instead of &#x27;z&#x27; in words that end with -ize unfamiliar. The other flip-flopping didn&#x27;t bother me because it was essentially what I always see here at home with Canadian&#x2F;American spelling norms.<p>Usually there would be a standard dictating how things should look and feel, and that would indicate spelling norms. But when there isn&#x27;t a standard, I&#x27;d just consider who I think would be the next people who have to look at my work, and go from there.<p>I always felt though, that the lack of standardizing (or standardising, as the case may be) the language of choice is the type of thing that leads to hard-to-find bugs. There should never be the option to have both a getColour() <i>and</i> getColor() defined.')
