Others distract them these days. He was very happy in India because of the genetic diversity that aided his research and as a true scientist, it delighted him. He was a little nuts, but he was one of us because he suffered the same ills of bureaucracy and red tape that plagued Indians as well. His wife was a scientist too in her own right. His Marxist&#x2F;communist ideas found a comfortable place in India where being tolerant and acceptance of diversity of opinions is a survival tactic. Every time India veers away from this survival hack, the country descends into chaos..then learns its lesson and back up again until intolerance raises its ugly head again. Itâ€™s a cyclical thing. Unlike England, I think JBS was able to get lost amidst all the millions people without sticking out like a sore thumb but also continue to do the work of a brilliant scientist that he was..a true citizen of science more than anything else.')
