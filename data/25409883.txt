But I can&#x27;t think of a good sentence that starts with &#x27;if&#x27; and contains &#x27;or else&#x27;.<p>It could be that the &#x27;if&#x27; is implied if you say &#x27;or else&#x27;. But &#x27;otherwise&#x27; works fine following &#x27;if&#x27; and it would probably have been better if they stuck to that. (Albeit lots more keystrokes - but as keywords go it&#x27;s shorter than &#x27;instanceof&#x27; and people don&#x27;t complain about that one.)')
