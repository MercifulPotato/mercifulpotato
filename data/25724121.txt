For all we know the other companies have an agreement to deplatform apps like Parler in the name of &quot;free speech&quot; but just to make sure that one of the big tech companies is dominant in a given space.<p>I&#x27;m not saying I think such an agreement exists in this latest spat of deplatforming. I am suggesting that that&#x27;s the kind of conspiracy theories such capricious &amp; unprincipled stances take (&amp; yes - they are unprincipled given how much it depends on which political party is dominant when they go to do something).<p>A more benign framing of the conspiracy is that the tech companies desperately want to avoid any trust-busting activities by Congress so when the right is in power they don&#x27;t do anything about right-wing extremism letting it grow &amp; conveniently when the left is in power they deplatform right wing extremism that has grown, making legislators more anxious to enact any kind of regulation (just like the BS that MPAA played with ratings to avoid getting regulating).')
