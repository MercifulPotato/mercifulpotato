But common sense makes the idea of &quot;More performance with more details!&quot; just sounds too good to be true, even with ML magic involved. Reminds me much more about something like Temporal Filtering: Giving more performance, but a slight cost of picture quality that might not be too noticeable with the extra raw pixels trough upscaling.')
