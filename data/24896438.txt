My main job is programming, my main hobby is programming and my passion is programming. I really like to write code and create stuff via code. But for the last year or so, I no longer can find passion or any meaningful side project any more.<p>I always remember myself starting different projects. I didn&#x27;t stick to any of them, most of them died in shame, other are living their last breaths in my private gitlab or public github.<p>I&#x27;ve spend my last years learning new languages or frameworks, or trying different areas: NodeJs, TypeScript - which eventually got me the job I have, Kotlin with Desktop development, Rust for game development, Unity for game development.<p>I have the initial passion to start and learn but eventually I realize - its bigger than I can handle. Its either a SaSS that is too ambitious, or a game I&#x27;ll never finish because I only code and I need artist&#x2F;models&#x2F;sfx&#x2F;ui&#x2F;game design.<p>Maybe I lack dedication, maybe I want quick results. Maybe I just jump into something without knowing what the final product should be. Or maybe I aim too high and too big. But I no longer have any ideas for a side projects. I really like programming, but I simply can&#x27;t find a field &#x2F; project that I can stay dedicated to.<p>I can&#x27;t seem to find &quot;life area&quot; that I can improve (a classic side project path - find something in life that is missing and create it). I can&#x27;t find any open source project I am really connected to so that I will be willing to contribute back. Maybe I am just lazy. Or maybe I&#x27;m just not good enough.<p>I really feel a hole inside since I do miss fun programming outside of work hours, but I really don&#x27;t know how to fill this void.<p>How do I find and stick to a side project that will fulfill my passion to programming?')
