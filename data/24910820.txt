Whenever typing a destructive command, he&#x27;d take his hands off the keyboard and drop them to his side, re-read the command, then put his hands back to press enter.<p>I do this whenever I&#x27;m on a production server (which is rare anyway). I use different colored prompts for local and remote shells.<p>[0] Technically he had no beard and if he had, it wouldn&#x27;t have been gray.')
