Based on news I completely agree with you.  I found no evidence online of any Belarus police being killed or even harmed.  (I&#x27;d edit my GP message to clarify that if I could but the time limit has passed.)<p>In referring to identified people being killed I contemplated a worst case scenario, following up on comment <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24737255" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24737255</a> &quot;in Hong Kong similar channels were used to kill police&quot; and <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24737546" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24737546</a> &quot;possibly leading to innocent people being lynched or killed by the mob because almost no one will verify whether that someone was really to blame&quot;.<p>However, a bit of Googling later and I haven&#x27;t found any confirmation that any police in Hong Kong were killed either.  Perhaps the HN commenter was a bit overzealous to say so.  Only death threats to them... and their children (which is pretty bad in its way).<p>Meanwhile, the same Googling revealed a lot about Belarus: Shooting protestors with live ammo, horrendous abuse, medical abuse, torture, and some death; it sounds pretty bad there.  I can see why doxxing them is compelling and perhaps moral.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hrw.org&#x2F;news&#x2F;2020&#x2F;09&#x2F;15&#x2F;belarus-systematic-beatings-torture-protesters" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hrw.org&#x2F;news&#x2F;2020&#x2F;09&#x2F;15&#x2F;belarus-systematic-beati...</a><p>Some police resigning in disgust too.  That&#x27;s good to hear.<p>The possibility of innocents getting harmed due to false identification remains though.  Those AI face recognition and deep fake reconstruction techniques really are prone to errors that look convincing.  I hope the committed doxxers have high standards of review and understanding, and are able to correct mistakes.  I&#x27;ve read enough stories about innocents being attacked and sometimes killed in the past due to an angry vigilante group&#x27;s lack of care that I think it&#x27;s a genuine concern if AI-assisted doxxing ever escalates to violence.<p>I found this article about Hong Kong interesting for how doxxing and counter-doxxing are evolving: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;asia.nikkei.com&#x2F;Opinion&#x2F;Hong-Kong-protesters-are-naming-and-shaming-police-officers" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;asia.nikkei.com&#x2F;Opinion&#x2F;Hong-Kong-protesters-are-nam...</a><p>&gt; &quot;There is power in being able to name those who have wronged you. Doxxing may not be good practice -- the pro-democracy camp has the moral high ground right now -- but few condemn it while the police operate with impunity. Right now, the police doxxing channel on Telegram has more than 242,000 subscribers. As a comparison, the movement&#x27;s fact-check channel has 60,000.&quot;<p>&gt; &quot;Unsurprisingly, the police have found ways to hide their identities. Since late June, their helmets have had one-way-mirror privacy film adhered to what were see-through visors. Almost none wear their warrant cards or produce them when requested, even under circumstances where force regulations compel them to.&quot;')
