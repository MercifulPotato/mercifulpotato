Are you solving ticket A but need another person to help you with a bug you discovered in the API that the person across from you wrote and can fix in 2 mins? Sometimes they just do it and don&#x27;t raise a ticket. If management likes to mark you on tickets, you might as well raise the ticket.<p>I work at a big company, and every time the IT Helpdesk does a password reset they open a ticket, then mark it as closed, every time they do a password reset (because they get marked on how quickly they close tickets). Believe it or not, median resolution time for a raised support ticket is in seconds, despite it usually taking days if you open a ticket for anything yourself!<p>8 person teams are usually the recommended max team size anyway under Agile (two pizza team).')
