It was even in foreign ownership up to not long ago (when it was repurchased by its original founders). \nThis is not something AIPAC is concerned with. Clearly US government as well as Israeli government have some interest in letting NSO roll its operations (have any NSO officials been banned by the US? US knew to ban Israeli officials in the past, AIPAC or not).')
