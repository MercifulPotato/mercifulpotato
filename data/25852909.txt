Read up on how humans viewed one another 1,000 years ago or 10,000 years ago and see the trend. There&#x27;s no reason to believe or to ONLY believe that we&#x27;d be a violent and evil species if we became space-fairing and had FTL travel. In such a far future, I&#x27;d like to choose to work towards and to think about having a society that is even more moral than what it is now.')
