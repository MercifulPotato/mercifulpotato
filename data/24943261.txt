You don&#x27;t believe that people have the right to have opinions that you dislike.  And don&#x27;t see that as a problem.<p>Possibly because you expect people whose opinions you dislike to treat you like you would treat them if positions were reversed.<p>I don&#x27;t mind being dead to you.  But I don&#x27;t want you, or people like you, to be in a position to make decisions about what I can say.  Nor do I particularly want to be in a position to decide what you can say.  What I want is called &quot;freedom of speech&quot;.<p>As the old saying goes, &quot;Sticks and stones can break my bones, but words can never hurt me.&quot;<p>However when you open up the door to stopping other people from speaking, you have opened up the door to them stopping you from speaking.  Are you sure that all of your opinions agree with that majority?  Really?  You think nothing that others might find controversial?  If so, that&#x27;s weird.  And good luck if you ever change your mind about anything important.')
