If you&#x27;re using this for rough work, no biggie, but if I&#x27;m setting up a router table, I want precision out of it. You have two options: spring for an aluminum plate, or use thick plywood, but cut a circle down where the router mounts. You have to cut the circle down because you won&#x27;t be able to lift the router high enough for some cuts. I have the 3 1&#x2F;4 HP Makita, and neither the 1&#x2F;4&quot; phenolic plate it came with nor 1&#x2F;4&quot; acrylic will hold it without sagging.<p>2) M6x1 threaded rod is <i>way</i> too small diameter for this application. If you want to get good precision out of this, use a rod with a larger diameter from the fine pitch series. In theory, you can get 1mm pitch in 8mm through 28mm diameter rod, though I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s common. I&#x27;d want something around 15mm. In old money, you want 16TPI, which is 3&#x2F;4&quot; UNF threading.<p>3) If you want to build one for the exercise of doing so, go for it. If you think you can do better than commercial for your application, build one. If you just want to get on with building furniture, buy one. Nancy Hiller put it best[0].<p>4) If you&#x27;re hard up and you need a router table <i>RIGHT NOW</i>, screw a plunge router to a piece of MDF, plunge a bit through that&#x27;ll cut a hole (N.B. most straight bits won&#x27;t, but an upcut spiral will. Once you&#x27;ve got the center hole cut, you can plunge through damn near anything; I&#x27;ve used a chamfer bit for example), screw a piece of straight scrap on at one end, and clamp it at the other as a pivot fence. Adjust the router using the plunge mechanism, and the fence by gentle taps. Use a square piece of MDF to back up any end grain cuts. You can get pretty far without spending any money and a very small investment of time. You can also build an edge guide on the same principles.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.finewoodworking.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;11&#x2F;26&#x2F;to-build-or-to-buy" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.finewoodworking.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;11&#x2F;26&#x2F;to-build-or-to-bu...</a>')
