The app store needs to be eliminated.</i><p>Oh fuck NO. Apple has saved me from scummy apps more times than I can remember. They have always refunded without question, including when I fell for Match.com&#x27;s &quot;Pay up to see how many bots like you&quot; scam.<p>Right now I&#x27;m fighting to get my money back from Couchsurfing.com and they&#x27;re flat out ignoring me. They use a custom payments system. If it was a regular In-App Purchase, Apple would have refunded me within hours by now.<p>Anyone clamoring for the protections of the App Store to be abolished is very likely someone salivating to prey upon users.')
