That phrase is akin to &quot;we&#x27;re not digging up the begonia bed lad, this is our potatoes for the whole year and if you don&#x27;t do that double trench properly the first frosts will have the lot &quot;. I have obviously expanded and provided explanatory context. There&#x27;s nothing gay about double trenching potatoes in late fall at the same londitude as Moscow.<p>If I had to define the derogatory use of gay, my own experience would make me place far more emphasis on the adduced insult to be ineffectual or unnecessarily fancy and therefore wasteful and inefficient. From there to get to mean not very manly seems to me a much easier etymological path.')
