In collaboration with end users, we have developed a fast and intuitive workflow software that takes you from defining your parameters to viewing your data in no time.<p>We also build C-Trap, which can be used to &quot;grab&quot; a single molecule, and apply precise mechanical forces to it. At the same time, one can visualize the molecule using highly-sensitive fluorescence microscopy. Our customers use it to watch DNA being copied by the molecular machinery of the cell, or observe molecular &quot;engines&quot; walking across the scaffolding structures of a human cell. LUMICKS systems are currently in use in opinion-leading labs across the globe, including Stanford, Johns Hopkins University, Tsinghua University, NIH, Max Planck Institute, TU Delft, and Imperial College London.<p>We&#x27;re an academic spin-off from a research group at VU University Amsterdam. We care deeply about providing our users with easy-to-use, reliable software that actively supports Open Data and Reproducible Science. To make this happen, we&#x27;re looking to expand our software engineering team with additional:<p>C++ developers -- <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;lumicks.com&#x2F;vacancies&#x2F;cpp-software-developer" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;lumicks.com&#x2F;vacancies&#x2F;cpp-software-developer</a>\nWe use the following technologies. When applying, it&#x27;s fine to be familiar with a subset of these:<p>C++17 (soon 20) for the core code, Qt5 (QML) for the UI and Python 3 for bindings. CMake builds everything and Conan manages the dependencies. Libraries we use include abseil, asio, caf (C++ actor framework), catch2, cereal, fmt, opencv, ranges-v3 and spdlog. Our Python bindings are implemented using pybind11.<p>Read the full job descriptions, and apply directly, at: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;lumicks.com&#x2F;careers" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;lumicks.com&#x2F;careers</a>')
