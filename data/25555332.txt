Seems to me both ways of thinking about this is the wrong mindset.  The more important thing is the operational &quot;flow&quot;, how your toolsets come together to allow you to operate your business.  Trying to micro optimize costs is not terribly useful, one sass offering on it&#x27;s own may not terribly justify itself, but because they way it connects with other pieces of your operation, the overall flow is better, and therefore justified.  It&#x27;s the difference between an &quot;accountants&quot; way of seeing a business vs systematic thinking.  Much important to think about how the &quot;whole&quot; than the parts.')
