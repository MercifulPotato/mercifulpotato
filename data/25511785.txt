What if a computer can match mine and another one&#x27;s happiness with a % of success that it&#x27;s impossible for me to match, what happens then?<p>since any system has to start with a set of assumptions and expectations, and based on feedback loops for what works and what doesnt, always optimizing for what &quot;works&quot;, wouldnt such a system more and more narrow itself down to a limited scope of outcomes and possibilities that basically we stop being peoole and turn more and more into basically narcisistic psycophants?<p>wouldnt it basically be the end of evolution and society?')
