No way they would be using that sort of prop.\nThat said, Li-FES2 primary cells  (at 400Wh&#x2F;kg) have well over twice the energy density to LiPo&#x2F;LCO rechargables (at 190 Wh&#x2F;kg).\nIf I can make a custom 7&quot; bi-blade quadcopter fly for 30 minute, 40 minutes is doable with better battery density.<p>In my own builds it is much easier to get long flight times with larger props but that is probably on account of the lesser need for exotic material science at larger scales.')
