If properly implemented, there is nothing that makes generator-like laziness slower than transducers, and since it is pretty central to clojure I doubt you will see much speed gain by using transducers.<p>In scheme, the srfi-158 based generators are slower than my own transducer SRFI (srfi-171) only in schemes where set! incurs a boxing penalty and where the eagerness of transducers means mutable state can be avoided.<p>Now, I know very little clojure, but I doubt they would leave such a relatively trivial optimization on the table. A step in a transducer is just a procedure call, which is the same for trivial generator-based laziness.')
