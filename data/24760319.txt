As much laughed at as Ballmer was for the whole &quot;Developers! Developers! Developers!&quot; moment, that very much was a mantra for Ballmer. Despite not having nearly the technical acumen of his predecessor nor his successor, he never forgot Microsoft was a company founded on Developer Tools and Developer Experience. He tried his best to cheer-lead it where he saw it (literally in some cases, hence the moment that got so many laughs around the internet), and enable whatever he could to get the ball rolling for good Developer Experiences. Even when his stubborn &quot;home team or no team&quot; cheer-leading for Windows and Office sometimes got in the way of cheer-leading for Developer Experience, he could still sometimes be persuaded that the right thing for Developers was the right thing for Microsoft even when it wasn&#x27;t always the right thing for Windows or for Office, because he worked to never forget that cornerstone of Developer Experience to the company. (Though of course he still tried to prioritize where those overlapped, he wasn&#x27;t as bad as some make him out to be about it.)<p>Those specific things didn&#x27;t happen under Ballmer or kick off under Ballmer, but some their predecessors did (the earliest open source projects happened under Ballmer; the Monaco Code Editor was started under Ballmer even if the trajectory to it becoming VSCode wasn&#x27;t likely clear back then). You can&#x27;t necessarily draw a straight line from Ballmer era to those those projects that you like, but you also can&#x27;t connect all the dots without including some of the dots from the Ballmer era too. Ballmer wasn&#x27;t the great villain a lot of retrospectives seem to want to make him. He was an infectious cheer-leader and sometimes his cheer-leading led him astray (especially in trying to <i>force</i> people to use Windows&#x2F;Office, instead of trying to encourage people to <i>want</i> to use Windows&#x2F;Office; probably the biggest distinction between Ballmer and Nadella, and even then it doesn&#x27;t seem that wide of a gulf as people make it out to be), but his intentions were in the right place and some of his instincts still lead the company in the right general direction (eventually).')
