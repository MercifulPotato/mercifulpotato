What about really nefarious stuff like CP?<p>How can it be private if it&#x27;s possible to check what the content contains? If it&#x27;s private you can&#x27;t tell which network packet contains CP and which cat videos.<p>&gt; Do we know who is responsible and is it possible to report and take down links?<p>How can you report it if you haven&#x27;t viewed it?\nIf you&#x27;ve view it and then report it, how do you think would that work out for you?<p>&gt; Also does running a node involve you in anything unknowingly?<p>If it&#x27;s censorship-free then you serve all content unknowingly.')
