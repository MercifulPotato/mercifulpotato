If your neural net (haven&#x27;t actually met anyone who uses these in trading) takes 5ms to make a prediction that&#x27;ll lock you out of a whole lot of trading opportunities&#x2F;strategies.<p>Speed always matters, no matter where on the smartness spectrum you are, but it&#x27;s relative. If your model prediction takes 5ms you&#x27;re not getting much ROI out of investing $1M into shaving off 50ns in your data processing. But if your end-to-end latency without prediction is 1ms, you better invest in getting that down.')
