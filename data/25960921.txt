This is exactly the type of service that academic institutions could benefit from.<p>When I was a medical student and resident on rounds, it was really stressful trying to do literature searches on pubmed and up-to-date (esp while taking care of active patient problems!) I often didn&#x27;t have the time or bandwidth to comb through the papers&#x2F;lists of care guidelines, and the abstracts often didn&#x27;t give the clear story (or the relevant numbers!)<p>If I had had access to InpharmD, I could&#x27;ve 1) looked like a rockstar to my team, and 2) actually learned and understood the info I needed. :)')
