It doesn’t matter that it’s a bare quote. It doesn’t make a difference that it’s objectively true THAT he said so.<p>If the statement itself is highly questionable or outright false, then a news source must either a) qualify it as untrue&#x2F;disputed&#x2F;... (depending on the degree), or they must choose to just not report it. That’s it. Those are the only two choices.<p>What they <i>cannot</i> do is simply report he said it and “leave it to the courts” to determine whether it’s true.<p>Freedom from bias does <i>not</i> mean Reuters can engage in relaying quotes they themselves suspect are false without qualification, since merely choosing to report it without comment means actively relaying a lie. It’s not “editorializing”, but still actively doing whoever is lying a favor.')
