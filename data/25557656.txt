Alberta is really only known for reinforcement learning as one of the leading academics relocated to Edmonton, but they&#x27;re not known for much else. You won&#x27;t hear of Alberta much in academia or in Silicon Valley, and the only reason I know of them is due to prior interactions with Richard Sutton.<p>UBC and UT certainly receive more funding for computer science and engineering and they&#x27;re generally well regarded research schools and highly recruited from. UT seems to be slightly more prominent but I&#x27;d wager it&#x27;s a result of the school being much larger with multiple campuses all considered the same school. Same story with Waterloo&#x27;s computer science faculty being many times the size of UBC with mandatory internships in its undergrad program.<p>Perhaps the reputation of schools domestically in Canada is different than their brand overseas, as UBC is known even in Switzerland and Sweden, but Alberta and Waterloo are completely unheard of. Even now as I relocated to the USA, UBC comes up often (despite the relatively small Computer Science faculty) and all the past companies I used to work for across quantitative finance and autonomous vehicles recruited from them.')
