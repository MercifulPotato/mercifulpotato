From a usability stand-point, hints are a very useful way to navigate web-pages without requiring a lot of dexterity to select small elements. Once skilled at typing the hint labels, it&#x27;s almost like having eye-tracking.<p>One practical limitation is that it requires two hands to browse, so not great when eating, writing in a notebook, holding a drink, etc. Also if you float your hands above the keyboard instead of using a wrist rest, it&#x27;s not very practical for extended casual browsing. In that scenario I find having a nice ergonomic mouse hard to beat.')
