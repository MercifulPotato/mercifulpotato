F1 is faster, we get it. The <i>racing</i> in MotoGP is so much better.<p>I caught the start of F1 Mugello this year and I turned off after 7 laps of safety car. (Was the first real lap 11?) It&#x27;s embarrassing. The amazing additional crash under safety car wasn&#x27;t the kind of entertainment I was seeking.<p>And what are the rules for track limits in F1? I understand that braking when running wide - if not an outright incident - is safer with a &quot;normal&quot; grippy surface, but now it appears that both sides of the ripple strip are in bounds!? I think many people agree, independent of alternate formulas&#x2F;vehicles, that the last 10+ years of F1 is questionable progress and the races are too often outright boring.')
