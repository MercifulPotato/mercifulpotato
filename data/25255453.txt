But all we have to go on is what&#x27;s happened so far. In the past even the worst entry+exit points are acceptable for retirement if not astounding, if you&#x27;ve saved something like 15% of your income for age 30-65 (I forget the exact numbers but that&#x27;s more-or-less close to it). Yes, some people have to choose between cutting their standard of living and retiring on time, and retiring later for the expected standard of living. I&#x27;m not sure what we can do to change that? Like you said, we have limited time and everyone&#x27;s situation is different. Go onto any of those retirement income calculators and compare the person who starts saving in their mid-30&#x27;s but maxes everything out to the person who starts saving with their first job out of school and gradually increases from $100 or $200&#x2F;mo.<p>Your comment was that equity investing can be disastrous if you hit the timeline wrong, and my only point was that unless you&#x27;re speculating or are only in the market for 5-10 years, that has never happened. We have no way of knowing if that will happen in the future or not, but there&#x27;s no reason to believe that we&#x27;re going to see decades of middling or negative growth. There&#x27;s really no other option if you want to have a real retirement unless you plan to just rely on whatever government assistance you can get.')
