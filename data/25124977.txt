With every release they are shipping tons of specific sets of cores and clock speeds to meet their market. Then you have the raw investment in Fab that has turned out to be just lighting cash on fire for Intel. They make all kinds of claims and then fail over and over, plus they are hemorrhaging key talent. I think their soul really isn&#x27;t in the game.<p>Apple has the luxury of building two or three chips total per year and simply funding TSMC fab. All of this is to fund the largest grossing annual product launch. If their chips fail at being world beaters, hundreds of billions of dollars are on the table. All in, Apple spends an incredible amount of money here, ~$1 billion. Per chip design shipped, Apple is probably spending much more but also getting their return on investment. It&#x27;s such a tight integration that if TSMC were ever delayed by say, four months, I have no idea what Apple would do.<p>AMD is playing smart, fast and loose. Best chip CEO by a wide margin. AMD&#x27;s gains really are on Apple&#x27;s back, their chip design is brilliant and they get to reap the leftovers when Apple turns out their latest chip. They don&#x27;t have to fund Fab, they don&#x27;t have to make crazy claims to appear relevant like Intel does. They just ship great bang for the buck and the fab gains and their own hard work has given them best performance title too. Going Fabless was one of the most controversial choices ever made in the industry...and wow, was it the right move.')
