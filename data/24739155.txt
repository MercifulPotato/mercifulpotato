I was a Gentoo user then. Gentoo broke all the time, but Arch has been a rock-solid experience since day one. I can easily run the latest version of everything, and if anything doesn&#x27;t work out of the box, the wiki always has answers.<p>I&#x27;ve used Ubuntu at work, and I&#x27;ve had problems with it, which are not as debuggable as in Arch, because there&#x27;s less documentation.<p>Rolling release + great docs is what made Gentoo great 15 years ago. Arch is the same, but better, because it doesn&#x27;t break.')
