It is merely processing the one training sample over several seconds, because it takes a few hundred milliseconds for the human brain and visual system to process an image, and several more seconds for the brain to analyze and memorize key features of the sample.<p>Standard machine learning systems don’t work like this. No matter how much time they’re allowed to process a single sample image, they are unable to learn to classify it. There are of course machine learning systems that work more like humans (facial recognition is a notable example), but they’re the exception not the norm.')
