When it comes to trying to read anything out of how someone does in something like ICPC, I compare it to doing well as an athlete: there&#x27;s definitely something transferrable in there, but it&#x27;s hard to claim that it&#x27;s any specific technical skills.<p>If you&#x27;re good at competition programming, you can probably sling code pretty well, but that doesn&#x27;t mean you&#x27;re good at writing maintainable code in team contexts. But if there aren&#x27;t other red flags I&#x27;d take it as positive signal that you&#x27;re smart enough and hard-working enough to learn to do it quickly.')
