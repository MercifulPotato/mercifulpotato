I&#x27;ve used multi-platform Docker containers before, and that makes sense to me.<p>What I don&#x27;t understand is how they are running x86 containers on an ARM64 VM? Docker Desktop still works by building a Linux VM and running Docker there. But the VM would be an ARM VM. So, are they running qemu in the ARM VM to emulate an x86 processor in a nested VM?<p>I had imagined they&#x27;d try to do something like run x86 qemu through Rosetta, but it seems like this is not that. And the Apple Hypervisor Framework documentation leaves a bit to be desired, so I&#x27;m not sure if you can switch vCPU architecture, but I highly doubt it. (And I thought it was established that Rosetta wasn&#x27;t emulating VM instructions).<p>Can anyone shine any light on this aspect?')
