The language implementation is mostly fine-ish. But plotting (which is like half the point of MATLAB) is unusable slow.<p>It&#x27;s not just Octave though. All of Julia&#x27;s plotting libraries are similarly slow. MATLAB still has a monopoly on fast scientific plotting.<p>Matlab&#x27;s hobby license is sufficiently cheap that I really would recommend getting that unless you absolutely can&#x27;t afford it.')
