Are you referring to calling into 3rd party Java libraries  or the implementation details of Clojure data structures that are under the hood?<p>If the former, the usual thing in Clojure is to make an abstraction layer for them that doesn&#x27;t leak mutability into your code (or just skipping those libraries altogether if that doesn&#x27;t work). But of course some things are just inherently side-effectful anyways, where you have to be mindful to isolate&#x2F;refactor things like IO the edges of the system.<p>(And yep to echo a sibling comment, Clojure is not a purely functional language, and doesn&#x27;t pretend to be one)')
