They&#x27;re saying Google&#x27;s engineers can&#x27;t do better. It&#x27;s sarcasm, but at the same time there could be a grain of truth to it - it would be unfair to believe Google&#x27;s engineers aren&#x27;t doing the best work they can. Most people do try their best. Perhaps it&#x27;s actually fair to assume Google&#x27;s engineers just aren&#x27;t very capable when it comes to frontend dev work.')
