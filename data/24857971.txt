I think you are assuming the best case scenario in a loss for Google.<p>Mozilla doesn&#x27;t factor into this for me. They have been making missteps for years. The fact that they have become totally dependent on Google rather than finding other partners and business models is on them. Live by Google, die by Google.<p>While Mozilla has made some progress on the browser quality, the reason they are loosing the browser market is 1) the browser just isn&#x27;t as good as Chrome (I&#x27;ve tried to love Firefox) and 2) Google is spamming Chrome on all its platforms. This lawsuit may resolve #2, but only Mozilla can resolve #1.')
