Steve the UberEats delivery driver can be moved into the ICU, putting folks on ventilators and providing critical care in a week or so, right?<p>And Gustavo, the busboy can be out providing EMT services in just a few days, right?<p>A doctor requires 8+ years of post-secondary education, in addition to several years of on-the-job training.<p>An RN requires at least 6+ years of post-secondary education, plus several years of on-the-job training.  LPNs even longer.<p>So, yes.  In the short term (~6-18 months), staff are most certainly fairly fixed resources.<p>As for hospital beds, those are limited to the square footage available for them.  Sure, temporary hospital wards can be constructed and put in place fairly quickly, but unless Steve and Gustavo are staffing them, you still have a big problem.')
