Item(by='Memosyne', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604098933, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24931468, text='You are referencing my comments without the proper context:<p>&gt; who doesn&#x27;t trust people<p>I do not trust people because I write in a journal? How is this incriminating? I don&#x27;t find it any more peculiar than speaking to oneself or opening with &quot;dear diary&quot; -- as if those who address their text to something inanimate are any better. I fail to see any merit in this revelation aside from attacking my character. I could try and dig up something equally irrelevant from your history but I find that act to be in poor taste.<p>&gt; You seem to think &#x27;How to win friends &amp; influence people&#x27; is an acceptable instruction book for manipulating people<p>Once again the context is conveniently missing: the individual I was replying to described himself as someone who dislikes talking to average people (had a sense of superiority). I figured rather than offer him something vague and patronizing like, &quot;be nice and try to be humble&quot;, I would endorse a resource that would offer solutions pertinent to the subject matter. I was not sharing my own personal opinions; one does not have to ascribe morality to a function in order to see merit in its execution towards an objective.<p>&gt; You think a public psychological label is a life-and-death matter<p>Not entirely, no. But is this a minority opinion? Why would they blackmail the patients if they didn&#x27;t believe that some would be willing to pay? I have recently lost someone precious to me as a result of similar circumstances and my mishandling of the situation by encouraging therapy and medication played a key role in her suicide. I apologize if my original comment appeared unnecessarily reflexive -- I&#x27;m still reeling from the guilt and I could be projecting some of that bias in my response to these types of things.<p>I think if something necessitates intervention then by all means seek professional care. But if you&#x27;re unsure and living a decent life make sure you exhaust all other options before considering yourself diagnosed with whatever label is put in vogue by pseudo-scientists. If you think some secrets are uninteresting consider if they&#x27;ll remain that way when the culture inevitably shifts and society decides to reject certain categories of people. The normal of yesterday too often becomes the enemy of a better tomorrow.')
