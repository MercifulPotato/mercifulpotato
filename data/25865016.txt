That&#x27;s the funny thing about conspiracies. Everyone whose in on it flatly denies it, even when it is obvious.<p>Not saying there was one mind. Just pointing out that assuming &quot;management in the Valley&quot; who have go&#x2F;no-go on firing customers equates to &quot;everyone&quot; not being okay with it. It does not build confidence to many when unilateral decisions by execs shape the landscape for everyone else. Also yes, some of that population who aren&#x27;t okay with that likely buy in to more conspirarial thought as well. Doesn&#x27;t change the facts of the matter.')
