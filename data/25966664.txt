Item(by='topkai22', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611986778, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25962178, text='I&#x27;ve been in the consulting &#x2F; field service part of a major tech company for 10 years. I&#x27;ve been remote for 6 of them and remote with minimal travel for 4. I started remote because we wanted to move closer to family (and ended up closer to my wife’s family.) That part has been brilliant- I think it’s been very good for my kids to grow up close to at least one set of grandparents and I like my in laws*<p>Mostly is been really good - my team is fully remote, we are supportive of each other, and we take time to be human (chit-chat, complain, etc), which can be a problem remotely.<p>One thing I’ve learned is that you have to be more intentional in your communication. Yes, everyone is only an IM away, but not being able to see someone in there office brings communication changes. I’ve found it helpful to try to pull more communication out of people (“let’s screen share, it’ll be easier”).<p>On the work-life balance side is also been really good for the most part. I have a physically separate workspace (a converted garden shed) and little ones that make sure I’m done at 5p and stay done. I do miss in person coworker chats and hangouts at times, but I’ve been able to substitute other relationships over time.<p>One surprising “drawback” is the increased flexibility I have working remotely means I tend to get stuck with a lot more home chores than my wife. We do share some responsibility, especially during covid, but it’s both reasonable and expected that I get to deal with the majority of the childcare or dealing with workmen, etc.<p>Another problem, for me at least, is that I do feel trapped at times. My current job pays well above the market rate in my area and I have not heard of any remote alternatives with similar compensation for my skillset. This wouldn’t be as much of a problem in a tech hub.<p>Overall though, I wouldn’t want to go back to commuting. WFH means at least an extra hour a day or more, and I feel like it makes it much easier to engage with other things I love like my family and the outdoors.<p>* in the off chance my parents read this- I like you MORE, but you know why I ended up where I did. Retire and move here :)')
