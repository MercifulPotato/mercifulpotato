When it appeared there was some genuine controversy regarding certain political persons and their associates instagram profiles where they posed with fistful of euros, drugs and various children who literally looked like they were nabbed from the streets. Also terms such as &quot;chicken lover&quot; was frequently used in association to pictures of grown men holding little kids.<p>I am not saying that comet ping pong has a rape dungeon, but its undisputable that they had some pretty wierd entertainment shows featuring &quot;not so kid friendly&quot; nudity, anal insertions etc.<p>For me Q seems to be a useful excuse for the media to assert censorship and filtration of information. Its just noise put out for those who actively seek out the fringe or the controversial. Like when political forums are bombarded with flat earthers, same shit. Just useful idiots used to spread noise. I believe its some letter soup shenanigans to be honest.')
