People voted for him from a pool of 20-ish candidates in the democratic race. Yes, Biden is soft. He is not an entertainer. He probably has many missing qualities that Trump had. However he has almost half a century of experience in Congress driving bills and fighting for his constituents. He was the safe bet.<p>Out of the 20 candidates, Biden was the most likely to defeat Trump. He is a realist compared to the other candidates.  People realized that and voted for him. If Bernie was chosen as the candidate, Trump would have won a second term. The bet panned out.<p>I feel it’s so easy to live in a Democratic bubble in Washington state. I guess same goes to California. Middle America thinks in a very very different way than we do.')
