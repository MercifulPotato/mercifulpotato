They gloss strait over those two facts as if they are not related.  Covid anxiety? Armrests?  You know what makes me anxious?  Missing my connection because the airline is late AGAIN!  I&#x27;ll suffer through any number of in-cabin discomforts.  I&#x27;ll get out and pull the aircraft back from the gate with a rope.  I&#x27;ll climb in and out via ladders.  I&#x27;ll shovel snow off the runway by hand.  I&#x27;d even pay a premium on if doing so meant the flight <i>arrives at the time indicated on the ticket</i>.<p>Want to know what really makes passengers anxious when flying?  It isn&#x27;t the flight.  Few really care about the actual flying part of the journey.  It is that in-seat time before and after the flight.  It is rolling the dice to see if your plane will be allowed to take off without mechanical issue or delays due to baggage problems.  It is not knowing whether there will be a gate available for your aircraft once you land.  It is knowing that you will often spend more time in the plane <i>on the ground</i> than actually flying.  Fix that before talking to me about my armrest preferences.')
