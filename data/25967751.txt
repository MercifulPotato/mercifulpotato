You can cause variable shadowing that way.<p><pre><code>   VAR\n     B : INTEGER;\n\n   WITH ^P DO\n     A := B;  (* B is just a local, A is a field *)\n   END\n</code></pre>\nIf B is added as a field, the above suddenly means ^P.A = ^P.B.<p>Any time you edit a Modula-2 record, you have to search the program for all the places where its type may be targeted by WITH.<p>Probably if you stick to some rules, like never using WITH on another module&#x27;s record type, you will be fine.<p>Diagnostics related to shadowing could help.')
