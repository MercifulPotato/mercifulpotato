Item(by='KineticLensman', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608395124, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25477886, text='&gt; A croc is still a croc, but the dinosaurs are hummingbirds and seagulls.<p>Slightly off-topic, but I went to Wikipedia to remind myself of the specific category of dinosaur that birds are descended from, and the &#x27;Today&#x27;s featured article&#x27; was about Achelousaurus, a ceratopsid dinosaur! I think this is the first time I&#x27;ve had such a close match to the thing I was interested in. From there, it was just three clicks to the article I needed [0], which, incidentally, stated that &quot;The present scientific consensus is that birds are a group of maniraptoran theropod dinosaurs that originated during the Mesozoic Era&quot;.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Origin_of_birds" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Origin_of_birds</a>')
