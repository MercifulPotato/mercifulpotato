Signal days that they don&#x27;t store phone numbers beyond the initial setup&#x2F;verification. See here:<p>&gt; Does Signal send my number to my contacts?\nSignal does not send your phone number to anyone unless you send them a message or make a call to them. The Signal service does not have any knowledge of your contacts. Data is all owned by your phone. Registration notifications are never transmitted by anyone in any direction at all; these notifications are created by your phone.<p>&gt; How does Signal know my contact is using Signal?\nSignal periodically sends truncated cryptographically hashed phone numbers for contact discovery. Names are never transmitted, and the information is not stored on the servers. The server responds with the contacts that are Signal users and then immediately discards this information. Your phone now knows which of your contacts is a Signal user and notifies you if your contact just started using Signal.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.signal.org&#x2F;hc&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;articles&#x2F;360007061452-Does-Signal-send-my-number-to-my-contacts-" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.signal.org&#x2F;hc&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;articles&#x2F;360007061452-Do...</a><p>(Btw, I think that first sentence is a bit confusing and should be classified&#x2F;reworded.)')
