Kids back then had the same approach, large and heavy coin, flip from a consistent height, consistent strength. Heads every time.<p>There were popular coins made specifically for Pokémon TCG then, and they happened to be large and thick and plastic and heavy, so the cheating was widespread.<p>I was one of the many kids who did this routinely. But there was one kid who took first place nearly every week, out of a field of 50+ entrants. “He must cheat the coin, AND be an amazing deck builder and card player on top of that”, I thought.<p>Then one week I was matched against him, winner goes to top 8.<p>Our decks were nearly identical, I could flip heads every time, I was a strong player. “50-50” I thought.<p>Turn one. Retreat Scyther, in Electabuzz, Thundershock. I flip my giant coin, and before it flattens, he picks it up and hands it back to me. “Flip it higher please.”<p>He must know I’m cheating. I assumed he must be cheating too though, every other kid is, and he wins this tournament every week!<p>Guilty, I flipped the coin fair this time, higher. Before it flattens he picks it up again, hands it back to me. “Higher please.”<p>I lost every coin flip that match. He won, went to the top 8, later won the tournament for the nth week in a row.<p>It wasn’t until adulthood that I realized how he was winning every tournament. In a field full of cheaters trying to flip heads every time, all he had to do was wait for the coin to enter that terminal spinning motion every coin does right before it flattens. Well practiced at this, if he sees that it’s about to flatten heads, he quickly grabs it and hands it back to you. “Higher please.” Repeat until the coin flattens tails.<p>His tactic was a silver bullet in a field full of flip cheaters. Nobody ever questioned his intentions when he grabbed the coin and asked for a higher flip.')
