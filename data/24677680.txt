Item(by='vladvasiliu', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601805611, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24677413, text='I don&#x27;t know about others, but I think there might be an inertia component to it.<p>I first used mac os seriously starting with 10.5, when it was possible to it run on a PC, and I was lucky enough to have a compatible enough PC.<p>The experience was unbelievable to me. Everything was so smooth and snappy. I was using mainly linux at the time, with KDE. I naturally wanted to get an actual mac, especially since I was tired of the plastic laptops of the time, failing in random ways, being noisy, shoddy linux support, etc.<p>My current daily driver is a late 2013 15&quot; MBP and it is honestly the best computer I&#x27;ve ever had. It&#x27;s almost 7 years old and it never had any kind of problem whatsoever. Connectivity is superb (integrated optical out, sd card, thunderbolt, 4K60 output, HDMI). The only thing I sometimes missed was an ethernet port (I work in operations). I actually enjoy the touch of the metal, prefer it to the plasticky PCs. Yes, the glossy screen is sometimes a pain, but it&#x27;s actually usable outside whereas my work PC with the matte screen is a mess. Performance is sufficient for my needs, though, granted, I don&#x27;t do heavy lifting with it.<p>While I love the computer itself and used to love mac os, I do have the feeling that it&#x27;s gone downhill. As others have noted, there&#x27;s random lagging in Safari, random system services start using the cpu at 100% for no reason, etc.<p>So I guess my point is that a lot of people used to love the mac ecosystem, which I think was really great, and they still want to love it despite the drop in quality, maybe hoping it&#x27;s only temporary. There might also be some kind of &quot;brand loyalty&quot; &#x2F; &quot;emotional investment&quot; going on. Although, as far as I&#x27;m concerned, I seem to be looking much more at thinkpads as a possible replacement if I had to get a new computer right now.')
