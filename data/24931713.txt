Now you have the choice between using that $200 to buy a widget that&#x27;s worth $100, or a widget that&#x27;s worth $200.<p><i>Obviously</i> you&#x27;ll buy the widget that&#x27;s worth $200.<p>EBT&#x2F;food stamps are a bad analogy because the missing $15 in your example goes to transaction costs -- a middleman needs to buy, market, sell.<p>In real estate, that simply corresponds to the real estate broker&#x27;s fee -- 5% or 6%. <i>Not</i> 50%.<p>The point remains: it doesn&#x27;t matter if you&#x27;re laundering or not, you <i>never want to lose money you don&#x27;t have to</i>. Just because it was illegal in the first place doesn&#x27;t make you magically charitable. <i>Everyone</i> always wants the best bang for their buck. Period.')
