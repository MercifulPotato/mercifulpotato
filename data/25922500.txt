It’s one thing to succinctly write Maxwell’s equations in some chosen notation, but it’s another thing to understand why E &amp; B fields in a light wave are separated by a pi&#x2F;2 phase. Or why monopoles could exist and what their profile might look like (and the implications for charge quantization).<p>While it’s technically true that it’s “just using math &amp; computing consequences”, it’s an endeavor of enormous (essential) complexity, warranting focus and effort. Likewise that engineering is “just applied physics”, product design is “just applied engineering”, etc.')
