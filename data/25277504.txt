It&#x27;s how the web started with super-practical, no-nonsense backend scripting. I&#x27;ve worked with React and even like it <i>when it fits</i> (eg. a highly interactive app where everything can change at any time). But it doesn&#x27;t do anything for content-driven sites yet requires enormous infrastructure compared to just run stuff on the command line.<p>Where PHP got it wrong is that it did just such a hack job of pasting program output into HTML without HTML-aware, injection-free templating for us to endure in the form of DoS attacks. When all this was readily available - you just don&#x27;t use SGML processing instructions (eg &quot;&lt;?php ...&quot; which is just a fallback method of last resort) but regular, typed entity expansion, with escaping depending on markup context and content model checking for rejecting eg. script elements in user content.')
