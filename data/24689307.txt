Any vestiges of privacy are being eroded. Not that recently, inside of the car was relatively safe from eavesdropping. Cell phones and Alexa devices changed all that.<p>What I do find odd, however, is the weird distribution of those devices. In my immediate social circle, its either old people who want to show they have something cool and hip and young tech enthusiasts. My sample may be completele skewed as I am not the most social person ever though. The trend may be much more pronounced.<p>Still, it boggles my mind. Why would you voluntarily do it? My parents only invited trusted friends to ensure nothing &#x27;questionable&#x27; made it to the authorities ( former soviet republic ). People today brazenly broadcast it.<p>I honestly do not get it.')
