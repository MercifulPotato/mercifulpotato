Some non-traditional arrangements have been used to very good effect here in the UK in recent years, though personally I&#x27;d say the experiments have had mixed success overall and we&#x27;ve had our share of well-intentioned changes for the worse as well.<p>That said, it&#x27;s also important to use these design techniques for clear reasons. Some people don&#x27;t like motor vehicles and want to deter their use for reasons other than safety. They have been known to argue for road designs that limit capacity or force traffic to go very slowly as a deterrent measure, when perhaps a road designed to support faster speeds could have been just as safe and allowed a more efficient transport system. Sometimes, they even argue for measures that would likely be counterproductive given their stated goals, possibly without understanding why that would be the result. So before you can design a road, you first need to establish what your requirements are and what you&#x27;re trying to achieve, which is more of a political question than an engineering one.')
