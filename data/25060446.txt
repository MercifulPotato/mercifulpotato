If one of these laser lines gets disrupted, say by a bird, or someone knocks over the laser receiver - how quickly does the PoP reroute traffic over a different path in the grid? Does it wait for a timeout, or is there some meta-data from the laser link to know when the interface is down?<p>One of the reasons you use the laser PoPs is that underground fibre is expensive. However - given that you have to pull overground fibre to every customer within the PoP - the total &quot;length&quot; of fibre in play will be roughly equal to the length of fibre required in a traditional underground installation. What&#x27;s the advantage then? Why can&#x27;t you pull all the fibre overground and bypass having laser PoPs completely?<p>Finally - given the massive investment in 4G and price wars in India, I would assume you are competing with mobile broadband routers. How is performance of such solutions in dense cities like Bengaluru? Is it unreliable or congested enough for people to want to pay for a dedicated fibre&#x2F;laser internet connection?')
