For example, they dramatically changed diplomatic practices toward Taiwan and shifted military responsibility for Israel from European Command to Central Command (you can lookup its impact).<p>The rules won&#x27;t be put into effect, afaict - there&#x27;s no time - and are worthless for the American people. If the Trump administration thought they were worthy, presumably they would have enacted them years ago when Trump have could utilized them.<p>AFAIK, it&#x27;s like a CEO changing a bunch of policies on their last day at the company. Now the only purpose I divine is to undermine the American government or score political points. You can ignore it, but then there is no reason for it ever to stop.')
