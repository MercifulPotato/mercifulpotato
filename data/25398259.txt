Instead of an “accent” you then have a “speech impediment”.<p>I grew up with a couple, I had some special instruction in high school to correct the fact that I said my R’s with the same mouth positions used for W’s; I also had a persistent issue with saying “tr” as a mushy kind of “ch” on one side of my mouth that I only finally corrected in, like, my mid-forties.<p>And yeah, once I looked up how to properly pronounce that “tr” it didn’t take too long to fix it.')
