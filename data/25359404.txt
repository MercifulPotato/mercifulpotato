Item(by='loughnane', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607527401, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25357830, text='DNS will only let me block specific domains, right? So I can&#x27;t do blocking of specific channels that way (though I do use a nice big blocklist for adult content [0])<p>Google is a bit of a non-starter for me unfortunately. Their tools for protecting kids&#x27; eyes from content are probably great, but then their just building a catalog of my kids&#x27; viewing habits from a really young age... which I find off-putting. Maybe if that was the only way to block I&#x27;d go down that road, but there are others.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;raw.githubusercontent.com&#x2F;chadmayfield&#x2F;my-pihole-blocklists&#x2F;master&#x2F;lists&#x2F;pi_blocklist_porn_all.list" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;raw.githubusercontent.com&#x2F;chadmayfield&#x2F;my-pihole-blo...</a>')
