Item(by='neilv', descendants=None, kids=[25377788, 25377654], score=None, time=1607628698, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25377045, text='I&#x27;ve done the scary fistful of personal credit cards <i>twice</i>, while starting businesses, in addition to burning through personal savings, and strongly disrecommend it.  I had no family safety net as a fallback, and had to pay off the cards in full, Lanister-style, including all the predatory 29.99% APR interest that kicked in on one when I was accidentally late on a payment.<p>Funny: Sometime after paying off the first time, I was talking with a CSR at one of the credit card companies, and she looked at my account, and said, kinda awkwardly and with surprise, &quot;You&#x27;ve been a <i>very</i> profitable customer...&quot;.  I&#x27;m pretty sure that&#x27;s not in any script. :)  But I did have a stellar credit score by then.<p>One of my businesses did some great and beneficial work that I feel really good about, but I should&#x27;ve used angel&#x2F;seed investors from the start.  That would&#x27;ve made things a lot less painful, helped me formulate a more profitable business, and helped the second business actually get all the way to launch before I couldn&#x27;t stomach any more fistfuls of personal debt.<p>How I see it now: no matter how much I&#x27;d prefer to focus solely on product and engineering, and not having to play business-person with investors, investors are so much more preferable to self-funding a startup as a non-wealthy person.  If you can&#x27;t convince investors, I&#x27;d advise being very skeptical of a survivor bias story from Airbnb, and instead find a way to modify or explain the business to convince investors.  (You could just tell them: &quot;we&#x27;ll make money by disregarding existing regulations for a market, undercutting the competition.&quot; :)')
