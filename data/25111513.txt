In Germany (where I live and regularly volunteer as a polling worker), a larger county does not report slower than a smaller county. &quot;Larger county&quot; would just mean &quot;more polling places&quot; so that each polling place maps to about the same number of voters, therefore the load is distributed smoothly. The longest line I&#x27;ve ever seen in a polling station was 10 people who showed up in a group, and it took only 5 minutes to serve all of them.')
