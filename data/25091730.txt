And what does &quot;extremely densely populated&quot; mean?<p>Basel&#x27;s mass transit system was a lovely fit for my needs as a tourist, for example. (Berlin&#x27;s big city system confused me and I wasn&#x27;t there long enough to learn it.)<p>&gt; you are often quicker by bike .. barely walkable for a lot of passengers<p>That&#x27;s two opposite complaints. At least, I assume that those people who can barely walk the distance are also those that can&#x27;t bike the distance. So, do you want <i>more</i> stations (for those who can&#x27;t walk) or <i>fewer</i> (making it better for those who bike)?<p>&gt; you often wait 10min for a connecting train<p>Umm, 10 minute average wait is a sign of a good mass transit system. That&#x27;s short enough that most people simply show up and wait, rather than having to make specific plans.<p>How often do you want it to be?<p>&#x27;Course, I grew up in Miami. Quoting <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.masstransitmag.com&#x2F;bus&#x2F;news&#x2F;21157358&#x2F;fl-tired-of-waiting-and-waiting-for-the-bus-miamidade-route-redesign-ready-for-green-light" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.masstransitmag.com&#x2F;bus&#x2F;news&#x2F;21157358&#x2F;fl-tired-of...</a> :<p>&gt; maddening delays and 30-60-minute waits on a network that meanders to all nooks of the sprawling county at snail-like speeds.  ... Of the county&#x27;s 100 routes, only five are scheduled for maximum frequency; passengers can count on buses arriving every 15 minutes or less at all hours every day.<p>You mentioned a few of the negatives about buses. Another is that they can carry fewer people. If the train is at max capacity, how many buses do you think will be needed to replace it?<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;BVG_Class_HK" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;BVG_Class_HK</a> says the capacity of one of the U-Bahn trains is 296 seated; 1,624 standing and <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;de.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;DB-Baureihe_481" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;de.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;DB-Baureihe_481</a> for the S-Bahn has seating for 94 standing for 200 (for a 481-482)a and the minimum for a train is twice that (as a 481-482-482-481 configuration). So call that 500 people. But note that that&#x27;s the <i>minimum length train configuration</i>.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Bus_transport_in_Berlin" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Bus_transport_in_Berlin</a> says the biggest buses - double-deckers - carry 110 people. So you&#x27;ll need at least 5x the number of buses as you currently have trains, and more likely 8x or more.<p>Another issue with buses is that unless you have dedicated lanes, they end up getting stuck in traffic.')
