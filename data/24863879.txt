The post title is the same as the site, but really you wouldn&#x27;t bother with this for stills. Follow focus is useful or essential for video production. On large shoots, there is a person dedicated to twisting a large knob which usually has white tape on it so the operator can write on marks for various focus depths that the director wants to hit at different times in the scene. Sometimes these follow focus systems are semi-automated to allow for smooth controlled transitions from one pre-rehearsed focus point to another.<p>The particular lens this is being demoed on is a 50mm f0.95, which will have a very shallow depth of field. Any minor focus error will be very apparent.')
