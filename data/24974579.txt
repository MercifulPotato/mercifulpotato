Sure, you could throw a banner up on your website - but the comms should be immediate.<p>This might be reasonable for a service that doesn&#x27;t sell anything, or there&#x27;s absolutely nothing owed to users and users have no reasonable expectation of privacy. But any commercial or professional organisation that doesn&#x27;t have a method for contacting end-users is either A. Shady as fuck (numbered accounts, darknet-hosted, ignorance by design), or B. irresponsible.<p>This is a website who&#x27;s pure purpose is to extract PPC&#x2F;ad and referral revenue from its users. There&#x27;s no personal information requested from users, other than &quot;Display Name&quot;. This is actually one of few exceptions I think the owner of the website is being more responsible with their user&#x27;s data by not keeping anything.<p>However, if they are breached and are serving malware to customers for a week before realising, they will have no way to tell their users they may have been affected. Or what if someone decides to install a backdoor and log the user&#x27;s email and password when logging in?  This is nitpicking and honestly probably 1% of websites hacked in this way actually notify their customers, but it&#x27;s nevertheless still a hole in the design.<p>They&#x27;re also likely capping their earning potential if they do plan to sell the website, as they don&#x27;t have any delicious user data to sell to marketers.. For which I commend Daniel and Bjorn! Well done.<p>I don&#x27;t know, I&#x27;m thinking this is great, but also pretty bad. Maybe adding an opt-in for breach notifications would be useful, or having a third-party service to subscribe to breach notifications for the website would be the best of both worlds.')
