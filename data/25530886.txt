While a trained human might be able to work all of this out on a case-by-case basis, the issue was that of designing a planetary-scale medical system that could do this without the need for such detailed human oversight.</i><p>I&#x27;m not a data scientist and I&#x27;ve never encountered that term &quot;provenance&quot; before but I&#x27;ve encountered the problem he talks about in the wild here and there and have searched for a good way to describe it. His ultrasound example is a great, chilling, example of it.<p>I also like the term &quot;Intelligence Augmentation&quot; (IA). I&#x27;ve worked for a couple companies who liberally sprinkled the term AI in their marketing content. I always rolled my eyes when I came across it or it came up in say a job interview. What we were really doing, more practically and valuably, was this: IA through II (Intelligent Infrastructure), where the Intelligent Infrastructure was little more than a web view on a database that was previously obscured or somewhat arbitrarily constrained to one or two users.')
