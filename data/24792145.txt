I would imagine that the Desert Fathers would have mentioned it at some point (if it happened in their time), but perhaps they weren&#x27;t aware.<p>Since this practice doesn&#x27;t seem to be a part of Christianity elsewhere, it seems like it could something unique to a coptic interpretation of scripture. I&#x27;m not qualified to interpret this - but it does appear that a coptic translation of leviticus 21:18 uses a word which is translated to &quot;cut off nose&quot; ( <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;coptic-dictionary.org&#x2F;entry.cgi?tla=C5694" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;coptic-dictionary.org&#x2F;entry.cgi?tla=C5694</a> ) in for a word that is usually interpreted as &quot;flat nose&quot; or &quot;deformed nose&quot; elsewhere.<p>Whether there&#x27;s some other connection between that word and idol worship, who knows.')
