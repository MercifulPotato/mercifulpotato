Depending on the environment. It&#x27;s probably worth pointing out here that Python isn&#x27;t controlling that buffering - print could have its own buffer, and it could be read that way, but it doesn&#x27;t.<p>And buffering-to-newline is a common behaviour, but not necessarily a guaranteed behaviour. You may still wish to flush after a newline, depending on the platform.<p>Unless you&#x27;re in REPL, in which case Python often tells the environment how it would like it to buffer, as part of the readline implementation.')
