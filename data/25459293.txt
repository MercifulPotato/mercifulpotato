Perhaps a better math analogy: one point can be subtracted from another to give a vector.<p>&gt;  It&#x27;s not clearly (to me) defined which parts of the files are considered to part of the diff and which parts are to be excluded.<p>You&#x27;re right that it&#x27;s not precisely defined in that way, but there&#x27;s a good reason for this.<p>If you move the top line of a file to the bottom, should the diff tool show you that one line was deleted and one new line was added (i.e. that one line having been moved), or should it show all the other lines in the file as having been deleted and re-added in a different place? Both are valid interpretations of the difference between the two snapshots, but of course a real-life diff tool will show the former, as that&#x27;s what&#x27;s helpful to the user.')
