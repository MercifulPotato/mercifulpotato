Of course I was building .net SOAP web services for years and knew the customers&#x27; needs. Another reason was the developers knew first hand how inflexible was configuring IIS with its web.config and the efforts needed to make it work.<p>Then the adoption of Kubernetes was easy too because it was written on Golang. The next transition to GCP was natural too. Basically being backed from Google made all this technology development and adoption a natural and I&#x27;m glad that I made this choice early.<p>Another reason I&#x27;m using Golang is that my recent project is mobile-GCP solution making possible to get information about 80mil&#x2F;100GB US Property database in iOS App:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;topinvestor.app" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;topinvestor.app</a><p>One of the reason this functionality was made possible because I managed to create Gomobile embedded database in iOS which is much faster than SQLite or CoreData for my purpose - creating geodetic solution - tapping on the map is retuning lat&#x2F;lng which are two numbers and creating just one number representation of location suitable for key-value datastore.')
