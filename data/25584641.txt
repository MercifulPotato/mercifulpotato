(You order something from them -- say, a mouse -- and they find some shitty used product on Ebay or someplace and ship <i>that</i> to you<i>. Getting a refund can be a challenge).<p>Multiple complaints (including contacting the CEO of NewEgg) haven&#x27;t removed this bad actor. So I just assume that this practice of retaining terrible 3rd parties reflects NewEgg&#x27;s </i>true* extent of their caring for customers, and I don&#x27;t buy stuff from them anymore.')
