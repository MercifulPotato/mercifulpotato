Yes, all evidence has to be evaluated against a background theory.  That does not mean that the background theory has to be taken as an <i>axiom</i>.  The background theory that there is an objective reality governed by laws that are invariant with time and space is not an axiom, it is a hypothesis that has emerged over literally <i>centuries</i> of work as the best current explanation for all the observed data.  It is open to question, but if you want to question it you&#x27;d better have some damned good evidence.')
