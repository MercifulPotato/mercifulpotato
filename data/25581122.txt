Certainly on Hacker News I find it nearly impossible to raise a principled opposition to something, even if I&#x27;m just playing devil&#x27;s advocate. Seems like no matter how I try to phrase things they&#x27;re apparently taken as personal attacks (not certain of this, because the vast majority of my downvotes are made with no feedback). I should be used to it by now, but because the minds on HN are so keen in so many other ways it&#x27;s extra disappointing.')
