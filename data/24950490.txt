Another important topic of discussion derailed by HN&#x27;s garbage algorithm.<p>It&#x27;s #20 now but you can always tell when a post is doomed to oblivion by comparing the upvotes-to-time ratio to other posts on the front page. Unless the mods save it, this should be gone in a few minutes.<p>I don&#x27;t like the ideas in most of these comments so far, but I still don&#x27;t want to suppress this discussion. Let people show themselves for who they really are and what they really think, for good or bad, because we&#x27;re never going to make any progress unless a discussion can actually happen.')
