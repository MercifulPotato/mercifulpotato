Blocks get progressively smaller and clunkier in later work.<p>Egyptian sculpture made of basalt and granite, smoothed to a satin finish. Basalt boxes, 50 tons and more, with perfectly right-angled and smooth interior cuts, without tool marks.<p>I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s aliens, because... <i>why the hell would aliens care about rocks</i>? But people were doing things that we don&#x27;t understand, and cannot reproduce with the tools they should have had.<p>There is a great deal more to learn about the prehistoric past than we have even begun to get a handle on.')
