Item(by='yorwba', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608337149, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25472874, text='&gt; Propagandists know the propaganda they are spreading is false.<p>If everyone who says something untrue is a propagandist who doesn&#x27;t believe their own lies, then there&#x27;s little reason to debate, since then everyone would know the truth, even if some may deny it. I rather think that most people who spread propaganda do so unwittingly, because they earnestly believe that they have some information that is both true and important.<p>&gt; I love the role you are trying to play. It&#x27;s a bit obvious, but a welcomed distraction.<p>I have some trouble noticing how I am perceived by others, so could you tell me what that role is? Am I the incorrigible idiot who thinks there are no bad people, only good people making mistakes? The mediocre mediator who believes the truth is always found in the middle between two extremes? The compulsive contrarian who&#x27;ll find a reason to disagree with anyone? The perfidious propagandist who serves up a watered-down version of the same lie if the previous one didn&#x27;t catch on? The annoying alliterator for whom words are toys and the truth a bendy reed?')
