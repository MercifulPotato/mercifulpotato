Item(by='thewebcount', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609446969, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25594654, text='&gt; I could be wrong, but Iâ€™ve had a lot of spam calls in the last few years, and never have I gotten multiple calls from the same number in a month.<p>But it doesn&#x27;t say &quot;from the same number.&quot; It says the same entity, which should hold regardless of the number.<p>That said, whoever had my phone number before me (over 3 years ago) owed a lot of people money. I get 3-5 calls per day from debt collectors looking for her. I&#x27;ve never answered any of the calls, and they&#x27;ve rarely left any messages, but the caller ID often says, &quot;such and such credit service&quot;, so it&#x27;s pretty clear what&#x27;s going on. The same company calls literally every day several times per day. It would be great if they could only call 3x per month. One actually does use the same number every time, so I eventually blocked their number. Another one uses a different number every time, but the callerID is always of the form &quot;V12345678&quot; where the number is just some incrementing integer, so it&#x27;s obviously the same people.')
