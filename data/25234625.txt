Companies publish investigator reports of bias and discrimination somewhat regularly. It&#x27;s possible that Coinbase contractually can&#x27;t disclose the reports they&#x27;ve already commissioned --- in which case they probably ought not to have tried to refute the article with them --- but they can certainly commission a new one that they can disclose. It&#x27;s a 600+ employee company; the cost of the report is a rounding error.<p>As it stands, the kernel of Coinbase&#x27;s defense here is &quot;we paid for a secret report and it says we&#x27;re great&quot;. Reasonable people can find that response unpersuasive.')
