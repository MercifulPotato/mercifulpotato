Item(by='kelnos', descendants=None, kids=[25721340], score=None, time=1610314493, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25719321, text='For non-businesses, I think one thing that would make donations a lot more attractive is if they could be made to a tax-exempt org (that means I can donate more at the same cost to myself, or donate the same at lower cost).  But I get that something like that is hard to set up for someone who is already under water funding-wise.  It would be great if there was an umbrella org that could handle this, perhaps for a fee&#x2F;percentage much lower than what is usually &quot;lost&quot; to taxes.<p>patio11&#x27;s comment is about donating vs. paying by a business entity.  Something I hadn&#x27;t considered is that a business (even if it&#x27;s just a one-person developer who has incorporated) can pay for software tax-free to any org as long as it&#x27;s an actual business expense, since businesses (at least in the US, and I assume in Japan as well) are taxed on their profits, not on their gross income.<p>Patrick&#x27;s issue with donating as a business makes sense: the tax authorities will look at a donation and think it&#x27;s a part of a tax-avoidance scheme, but if the business pays for a license to software (even the payment is essentially a part of a custom license, and the software is also available for free under the same or similar terms), and has that payment documented, it&#x27;s fine.')
