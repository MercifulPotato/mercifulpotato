It was completely cold and not moving. I picked it up and was about to discard it again, thinking it was dead, when I noticed its claw twitch slightly.  So I cupped it in my hands to warm it and took it home with me and gradually nursed it back to health.<p>It stayed with me for about a year or more and even came on a couple of camping holidays round Ireland and Wales with me. I became quite a tourist attraction, as I&#x27;d be walking along a beach or in some countryside and suddenly this bird would appear as if from nowhere and land on my shoulder. passers by would be gobsmacked and ask to take a photo of the crazy bird man.<p>As the jackdaw got older, it got more independent and would go flying off for longer and longer periods until, one day it flew off to join another group of jackdaws in a park and never came back.<p>One of my coolest memories ever was one night me and the missus had gone out to dinner. The jackdaw had flown off somewhere, earlier in the day and not come back. When we returned home around midnight we found it fast asleep in its cage in the living room. It had come home, found us not there and let itself in through the cat-flap and went to bed, all by itself. Even though it had always been &#x27;free&#x27; in the sense it never had a door on its cage and was free to fly off wherever and whenever it wanted, somehow that incident really touched me as it was like the bird was telling me that it considered our house its home too.<p>Absolutely amazing creatures and so intelligent. I read once that corvids have similar amounts of neurons in their brains to small monkeys but the folding of the corvid brain is more complex, so those neurons fit into a smaller brain volume. After having the privilege of spending that amount of time with one &#x27;close up&#x27; I can certainly believe it.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;qOAN2ro.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;qOAN2ro.png</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;PO06LII.jpg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;PO06LII.jpg</a>')
