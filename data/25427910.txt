This could mean you are not as good as you think you are, but it could also mean that you are better than the average (e.g. most people on this site might be better with computers than the average of the world population).<p>Assuming other people are idiots is never a good thing, even if it was true. I&#x27;d rather assume they have a bad day, or misunderstand what you mean because they dont have the same mental map unrolled in front of themselves as you have, and that can also be due to miscommunication.<p>Whether someone really is an idiot will come to light through repetition.')
