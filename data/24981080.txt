If you read their blog post, you will see it&#x27;s mostly self-inflicted pain: they suddenly discovered vendors don&#x27;t ship SDK for niche languages, they wrote single threaded code because they couldn&#x27;t figure out how Lwt - probably the most popular OCaml library - works and apparently couldn&#x27;t be bothered to ask and failed to understand how the debugger works (like GDB and with documentation shipped with the compiler).<p>I mean, F# is a very reasonable choice if you want the .Net ecosystem and will most definitely solve the SDK issue but the whole thing certainly didn&#x27;t convince me to try Dark.')
