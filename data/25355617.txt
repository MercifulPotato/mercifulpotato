In general, harm must be direct and specific, not indirect or generalized. Biden <i>could</i> move to push for legislation to combat climate change that harms the oil industry, but until that legislation is enacted, no harm has been suffered, and no suit could be brought to remedy that harm until that point, since it is only theoretical and speculative until then.<p>&gt; So does this not answer why the suit was filed after the fact?<p>No. There are a couple of mechanisms that will let you challenge election procedures before an election. I&#x27;m shaky on the actual legal justification behind it, but my recollection is that it is based on the idea that a voter experiences harm when the election procedure denies them the right to vote, even if an election has not actually been conducted that would deny them the vote.<p>I should point out that there was an awful lot of election procedure litigation prior to the election, with heavy media coverage, which was mostly not shot down due to lack of standing or lack of controversy, so it is not reasonable to be surprised that this pathway exists.')
