The introduction is quite good and the table of contents gives a good overview of the current challenges in the field.<p>From the paper, &quot;Federated learning is a machine learning setting where multiple entities (clients) collaborate in solving a machine learning problem, under the coordination of a central server or service provider. Each clientâ€™s raw data is stored locally and not exchanged or transferred; instead, focused updates intended for immediate aggregation are used to achieve the learning objective.&quot;<p>0: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;1912.04977" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;1912.04977</a>')
