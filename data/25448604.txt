If you are studying openings at the expense of doing tactical puzzles and sharpening your tactics, it is not the most efficient use of your time at the 1200 level.<p>If you have a 1200 level tactics skill and 1500 level openings skill, you are going to be about a 1200 rated player.  If you have a 1500 level skill in tactics, you are going to be about a 1500 rated player regardless of whether you&#x27;ve studied openings.  Remember: Being able to calculate tactics better helps with openings!  Just because your opponent has memorized something and you haven&#x27;t doesn&#x27;t mean you can&#x27;t just calculate on the fly and avoid falling into obvious traps.')
