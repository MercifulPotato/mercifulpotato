After FAO for example, percentage of pigs being breed in intensive in 2010 ranged from 6% to 60%. In Europe it was a 30% for example. The current 2020 values can differ a little of course, but definitely would not support such bold claim as &quot;99% of animals come from a factory farm... so we should we all turn crazy, or start eating pills, or whatever&quot;. This is a myth.<p>As the IF(statement) part is False, the THEN{we should...!} part does not apply.')
