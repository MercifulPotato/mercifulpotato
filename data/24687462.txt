Scientific language used to document the behavior of a species should use the same standards for objective documentation that illustration&#x2F;photography employ. In this context a bird is most commonly captured in a profile that most clearly illustrates the coloration and pattern of plumage on the crest, chest and wings, the shape and size of the beak and the shape and length of the legs. This standard allows for an accurate representation of a species with no additional encumbrance. Scientific language should, whenever possible, omit flowery linguistic embellishments like terms of venery.<p>It seems like most of the comments critical of the article are arguments for language without consideration for context.')
