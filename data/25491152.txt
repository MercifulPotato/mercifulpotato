Item(by='nullsense', descendants=None, kids=[25492253], score=None, time=1608513268, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25490282, text='I have trait agreeableness in the bottom 1st percentile.<p>I&#x27;m also diagnosed with ADHD which is often co-morbid with ASD.<p>I very much refuse to go along with a looooot of things just for the sake it. Anything steeped in tradition without a whole lot of logic to it gets met with mostly flat rejection. This has steadily increased as I&#x27;ve gotten older.<p>My mum used to be a special needs teacher and she kind of suspected I might be on the spectrum when I was a teenager. I&#x27;ve met people diagnosed with ASD whom I share a bunch of lived experience in common with. My step brother has a son whose diagnosed with ASD and he sort of indicated I show some signs of it. So, there are hints that maybe I am somewhere possibly the invisible end of the spectrum? Or maybe it&#x27;s just my personality?<p>I read through Asperger&#x27;s The Complete Guide. There are a few puzzle pieces which fit like ding ding ding. But there just aren&#x27;t enough of them. And I watch things like Love On The Spectrum etc and I have had my share of difficulties perhaps but nowhere near what those people experience.<p>I&#x27;ve kinda tossed up getting a professional opinion about it multiple times. I just mostly feel like this is me and it&#x27;s who I enjoy being. Perhaps my 20s were just one big development of coping mechanisms? My social skills just haven&#x27;t really troubled me until this year. Mostly it&#x27;s either workmates, long term friends who share my interests, or special interest groups where I have stuff in common with people. This year I had to take my son to a school thing where there were other parents and the only shared context was our children. It was very anxiety inducing and I just felt like I had nothing. My son wanted to stay longer but I panicked and I said we had to go home.<p>So... At this point I don&#x27;t really know.')
