This usually requires setting up different config files (.npmrc for Node.js&#x2F;NPM), installation of custom root certificates, ssh keys, etc. None of that includes project&#x2F;team specific configurations and workflows.<p>Take all that and multiply it by thousands of developers and you have a recipe for an endless stream of Slack chats, email chains, and Teams messages repeating the same config questions and answers.<p>If you can reduce all that down to a single docker pull, while making sure everyone&#x27;s development environment is consistent, it can be a big win.')
