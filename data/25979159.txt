And then wrapped up with the breaking up of the Soviet Union&#x27;s Red Army military disbanding to serve as local counterprts for now independent soviet satellite nations.<p>I&#x27;m not sure why I felt I was watching all of this like it it was the first time, even though I lived all of through this and saw a lot of it in TV first hand back then... it was incredibly surreal.<p>0 <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dailydot.com&#x2F;layer8&#x2F;john-mcafee-dick-bitcoin-bet&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dailydot.com&#x2F;layer8&#x2F;john-mcafee-dick-bitcoin-bet...</a>')
