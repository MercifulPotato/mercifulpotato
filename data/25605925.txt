My indoor air quality is unaffected due to central air filtering.<p>Given the health impact, these burners should be seized and replaced with almost anything else, with full financial assistance. (Why? It&#x27;s cheaper to replace these burners than it is to suffer the long term public health costs caused by their existence).')
