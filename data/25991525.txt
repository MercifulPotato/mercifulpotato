One of the prime examples here is search: if Google didn&#x27;t keep a history of my search terms and&#x2F;or other data about my account, the results they&#x27;d return would be far less personalized. I could (and do) use DuckDuckGo instead, but the search results are far less convenient (e.g. when I look up &quot;compilation&quot;, DDG shows me literary compilations, Google shows me code-related things).<p>This in itself is fine, as long as either:\n1. The drop in convenience isn&#x27;t so high that people would prefer an alternative service\n2. We can impose these rules worldwide.<p>If the drop in convenience isn&#x27;t too bad, then even though there&#x27;s a little more friction, there&#x27;s not a mass exodus from these services. If we could impose these rules worldwide, that&#x27;d also make this an easy decision.<p>Given that the web is global, however, my biggest area of worry is that we squeeze all national companies to protect privacy, but it turns out the consumers really <i>did</i> like the personalized and convenient experiences and immediately switch over to Baidu or some other site that falls outside national jurisdiction <i>and</i> personalizes user experience well (presumably through even stronger privacy invasions).<p>tl;dr: I am cool with legislation, but given the global scale of the web we need to make sure we get the incentives&#x2F;changes <i>just</i> right.')
