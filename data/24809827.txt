However, the actual percentage simply cannot be that high as 73 percent of households have satellite or cable TV and thus are at least occasionally responding to mailed documents.  73 percent of the population isn&#x27;t even white anymore.<p>I mean, yeah, as a political purity test we can rally around Orange Man Bad and try to one up each other in our two minutes hate to eliminate diversity of opinion while encouraging groupthink, but reality is so far from the politics in this particular situation that its hard to play along.  And if an individual can&#x27;t stomach the extreme virtue signallers, may as well join the reality-based community and just vote Trump.  So ironically I don&#x27;t think this topic is a PRODUCTIVE purity test even from a purely leftist perspective.')
