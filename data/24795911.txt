Tried it without much hope and damn it, it worked well. Sometimes it goofed, but truth be told, it may be my problem.<p>Also, it had the ability to identify covers in a crowded bar, or non-playback live versions. Shazam, which was very popular at the time, admittedly couldn&#x27;t do any of that - in their FAQ (which I could not find right now) they even told that if Shazam recognize a live version, it must be either a playback or a player with microsecond precision repeatability.')
