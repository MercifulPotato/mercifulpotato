I don&#x27;t see it. You&#x27;ve provided two links in response to two of your many points. You&#x27;ve made claims like &quot;this is Germany+&quot; without actually supporting that claim. The burden of proof is on you to prove this is Germany+ (as the one making the claim), not me.<p>I have no interest in winning the argument, I have an interest in the truth and sound fiscal and social policies that result in a good balance of strong economy + innovation + lack of exploitation.<p>For all the things in the discussion that you claim Germany does that make its economy stronger, you need to demonstrate that. For all the things in the discussion that Germany is not doing, you need to justify why they are good, as the one making the claim that they are good ideas. You have not done so. You made a list, and are now claiming everyone else is arguing in bad faith when they ask you to justify that list. My response was not very high effort because I was not actually responded to a thoroughly sourced list. It was just a list.<p>You accurately stated that I was incorrect about co-determination in Germany. I read your point as &quot;majority representation on boards&quot;, when what you actually said was &quot;significant&quot; â€“ an error on my part. Germany does indeed do that, and as such the policy would indeed fall under &quot;Germany+&quot;. However, I maintain that amongst all your other bullet points, the only other point that 1. Germany does 2. US does not is living wage. And one (good) argument for why the federal minimum wage is not particularly looked after &#x2F; updated is because the US is a federation of strong states, so minimum wage is better handled by states individually (which they currently do). Cost of living in Montana is very different from NYC.')
