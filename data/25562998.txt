This would allow a path for the potential-hire to provide feedback (good or bad) to someone other than the recruiter, but wouldn&#x27;t spam the recruiter directly (like this tool would).<p>I&#x27;m sure some would use it for &quot;revenge&quot;, but I think the survey could account for that and it&#x27;s up to the head of recruiting to filter through that anyway (i.e. sort through data on how their subordinates are doing).')
