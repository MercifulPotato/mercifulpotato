Item(by='wtallis', descendants=None, kids=[25709147], score=None, time=1610248535, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25708569, text='&gt; this is exactly what the right side thinks is happening to them. Each side thinks its the other.<p>The symmetry is pretty shallow, though. If you look past the grievances about being criticized and ostracized by the other side and dig into the underlying public policy goals, it&#x27;s pretty easy to spot categorical differences. When a BLM protestor talks about equal protection under law, they&#x27;re referring to <i>not getting shot by the government</i>. When an alt-right protestor can be coaxed into listing the ways in which their legal rights are being infringed, they start bringing up stuff like the right to fire someone for being LGBTQ.')
