Item(by='uoaei', descendants=None, kids=[25446881], score=None, time=1608143926, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25446293, text='&gt; the government does not have any of &quot;its own&quot; money - all money it can possibly distribute is taken from taxpayer&#x27;s pockets<p>This is absolutely not the case. The government owns and operates a mint, and we haven&#x27;t been on the gold standard since Nixon. There is no zero-sum double-entry accounting when it comes to sovereign fiat currencies.<p>If you analyze the monetary policy of the federal government like it&#x27;s a family balancing a checkbook, you are buying right into the rhetoric that keeps the peanut gallery shrieking &quot;but the deficit!&quot; and prevents us from actually investing in the public&#x27;s health and needs.<p>Federal deficit is public surplus. It is the federal government investing in its citizens in the most literal way possible.<p>&gt; Call me cynical, but people working in the service industry were the safest ones to let fail without causing domino effect - they are already poor so they don&#x27;t have mortgages to default onto - they can&#x27;t afford even in good times - and that avoids a major risk of repeating 2008.<p>That&#x27;s not cynical, that&#x27;s sociopathic.')
