The romanticism of the adventure did lure me in, though I wouldn&#x27;t have looked for it (I&#x27;m not on the same continent).<p>There is an incredible amount of cynicism that the treasure did not exist though, and there were lawsuits implying that.<p>Personally, I appreciate the story for what it is, and admire someone for having the idea of doing it, not for the money but for someone else&#x27;s sense of adventure.')
