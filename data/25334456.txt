I’m increasingly coming across devs who’ve never used Promises directly, only async&#x2F;await. They’re introducing all kinds of problems into code because they don’t have that foundational understanding of Promises. I think it’s essential to know how Promises work, even if we generally recommend async&#x2F;await.<p>Also, Promise interface can do things that async&#x2F;await cannot, such as Promise.all, and other unusual async execution scenarios. It’s important to have those tools in your belt.')
