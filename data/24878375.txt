Nothing significantly impacting compilation times is fundamental to the language afaict.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s same issue as in C# and many others: someone has to write and support the bindings, which adds cost.<p>True.<p>&gt; In VM-based languages <i>which don&#x27;t use unsafe code</i><p>Since you&#x27;ve added that qualifier, sure, Rust would be less safe. But how many VMs don&#x27;t have such escape hatches? JavaScript in the browser is the only one that comes to mind.<p>&gt; vulnerabilities like this are impossible by design<p>I find this very hard to believe. Even if your VM has no unsafe code, its standard library is probably implemented in unsafe code, where vulnerabilities like this can definitely happen.')
