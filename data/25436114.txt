Every SNES game comes in a cartridge that includes additional technology built into it. You can take the technology that the author created, package it up into a cartridge and plug it into a vanilla SNES as would be required by any other SNES game.<p>The inherent limitations of an SNES cartridge are the power consumption (although some cartridges actually included batteries) and the memory bandwidth (it&#x27;s a 16 bit system so the cartridges have 16 pins).')
