So at the minimum, one would have to set up a US company. At the &quot;easiest for the employer&quot;, one would have to bill&#x2F;apply and work through a US resident.<p>If someone has other solutions for out-of-the-US, non-US-tax-reporters to applying to US remote jobs that list &quot;US based&quot; as a requirement I would love to hear about it.')
