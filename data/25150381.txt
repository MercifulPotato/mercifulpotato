A while back I wanted to spin up a forum, and I wasn&#x27;t super impressed. There&#x27;s a mix of new projects that don&#x27;t really get the forum <i>thing</i> (they&#x27;re often very focused on businesses rather than communities), and old PHP projects which haven&#x27;t advanced since the early 2000s.<p>This also goes for the infrastructure around forums - several turnkey sites I tried simply didn&#x27;t work, and I ended up deploying one myself through a crufty Bluehost portal. Given that a lot of forum activity is driven by non-tech people, I&#x27;m not surprised they&#x27;ve started dying out. It&#x27;s a shame, but the monoliths like FB have both the audience and the on-ramps.<p>Edit: as a side note, I eventually gave up because I couldn&#x27;t get my target community to join the forum. Most people were already on a Facebook group and uninterested in switching.')
