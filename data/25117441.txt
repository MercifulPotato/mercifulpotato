That thing that we discussed, no problem I arranged everything, T says it&#x27;s cool, just wire us the money and the project is yours.&quot;<p>In my view, if someone is going to blackmail me for some sensitive topic like being HIV positive or dox me in revenge, solution is not that I have to go public and lie that it&#x27;s not real (and risk to be counter-proven it is) - but to have police put their blackmailing asses in the jail.
