The facts have been corroborated by multiple sources, published by hundreds of media outlets, many of which are international and apolitical towards the US. And they likely wouldn&#x27;t have been anonymous sources if your chaos-mongering sociopath president didn&#x27;t have a long history of attacking whistleblowers. Deflecting and disregarding substantial and material evidence because the person who exposed it wanted to not be attacked is pretty fucking pathetic.')
