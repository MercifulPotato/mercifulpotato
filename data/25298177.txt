It might be something to do with the windows bluetooth stack, as i noticed the respobce was more sluggish during high CPU use, while USB mice seem unaffected.<p>The same logitech mouse performs much faster through their universal wireless adapter than trhough bluetooth (it has 2 modes), they also have lightspeed adapter, but I haven&#x27;t noticed much difference.')
