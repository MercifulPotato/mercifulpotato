I was going to downvote you, but it does seem a bit demagogic, because other minorities besides blacks are being financially exploited too. People of all colors can make bad financial decisions, it&#x27;s not their color but their lower income and education.<p>Ideally, I&#x27;d expect legislation to steer these eCoins to less muddy waters for everyone, not to appeal to emotion.')
