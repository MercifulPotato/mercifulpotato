Thank you for creating these sites.<p>What I don&#x27;t understand is how the mailing list itself works. When I want to start a thread, I send an email to the list. When I want to reply to someone, do I email the list or the person? How do I make sure the emails are threaded properly? During my first mailing list interaction I ended up emailing another developer directly somehow.<p>The git email client seems to have support for message IDs. They seem to work just like post identifiers in forums. Mail clients like mutt let users actually edit the email&#x27;s headers and include metadata like that. I&#x27;m not sure if gmail does it behind the scenes.<p>Also, gmail has moved on to newer authentication mechanisms. Is there a simple plain text email client with native support for this? Mutt apparently requires an external program which is seemingly unmaintained.')
