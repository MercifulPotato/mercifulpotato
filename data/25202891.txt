Clearly in the case of this machine, whose carbon impact is tiny compared to nearly every other combustion based machinery we use, the intent is symbolic.<p>&gt; ...that might eventually plant some trees (or use your money to buy&#x2F;rent fossil-fuel-burning machinery to orchestrate the planting of trees)?<p>For a reputable carbon offset, those carbon costs are accounted for in the offset, so even with them, it&#x27;s a net-negative carbon transaction.<p>&gt; Seems like guilt-avoidance to me.<p>That&#x27;s besides the point.  If it offsets the carbon produced, then it works, and it doesn&#x27;t matter what the psychological motivation is.<p>But I agree that there is a problem with offsets:  In a saner world we&#x27;d be imposing carbon taxes instead of this, but this is where we are today, with CO2 mitigation effectively taking the form of &quot;donations&quot;.')
