This is great research, but it is odd to see here on HN.<p>It costs &gt; 1 billion dollars to bring a drug to market and put it through clinical trials. This means most off-label drug uses like this will never reach cancer patients because the drug patent will expire leaving no backer that can make back the cost (even if the cost is less than a billion for off-label drug use). This situation is similar for most complementary and alternative medicine: there are many compounds shown to be anti-cancerous even beyond test tubes in mouse models and initial studies in humans. But there is nobody able to take them through clinical trials.')
