Yes, it&#x27;s true that even a low or medium end gaming PC is going to have a much larger power source that can contribute to the fireworks if a small explosive is properly placed &amp; detonated. PC enthusiasts will often point to this in order to support their choice of gaming hardware.<p>This ignores the realities of modern day explosives, or even what can be cobbled together from household items. Any discernable difference between a PC &amp; console all but disappears if they&#x27;re detonated with even a modest explosive.<p>Context matters as well: A PC is more likely to be in a clearer zone, at the very least for better ventilation. A console on the other hand is much more likely to be in an area that is more densely populated with other consumer electronics. The television alone is likely to be sufficiently large to make a more impressive field of debris than a PC.<p>Obviously this is just taking the typical setups into account. All bets are off when dealing with a PC that has some truly exotic cooling mechanisms. Detonation under those conditions should, at minimum, be accompanied with evacuation orders for neighbors within a 3 to 4 block radius of your home.')
