This is what initially got developers to move to Mac. But it&#x27;s been fifteen years, and all jokes aside, the &quot;year of the Linux desktop&quot; for developers was probably around 2012. Linux may still have issues, but they&#x27;re not worse than the hoops you have to jump through to make today&#x27;s macOS behave.</i><p>I&#x27;ve used Linux for close to 20+ years, and Unices more, and never had to jump through any major hoops to make macOS behave.<p>What would those be (talking about something major, not &quot;I can&#x27;t get my favorite window manager to replace the macOS window management&quot; -- the non-tinkering-friendliness is part of the allure to me and from what I read others too)?<p>On the other hand, Linux on the desktop never fails to dissapoint me in one way or another because of the need of tinkering, half-sketched apps for many things I want to do (especially anything multimedia and&#x2F;or document related), driver issues to get things working (sound, compositor, 3D, bluetooth, sleep, etc), and so on. And judging from the everpresent &quot;just use &lt;name of another distro&gt;&quot; in the relevent forums, it&#x27;s not something others don&#x27;t have.<p>Thus I prefer to stick to Linux on the server and Docker, or for setups where I have investigated the hardware in advance, and only mean to use basic things (e.g. happy with just some terminals, emacs&#x2F;vim, i3, and some mp3 playing).<p>&gt;<i>not because they actually ask new hires what they prefer.</i><p>Those that do found that hires generally prefer Macs. That&#x27;s how they have ~ 50% of the dev surveys on Stack Overflow whereas they&#x27;re just 10% of the general market...')
