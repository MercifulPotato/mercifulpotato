I always had a few exercises where I&#x27;d show a slide with 10 related words for 10 seconds and ask the students, without writing them down, to remember as many as they could. Then I would go through a few, asking them to close their eyes, and I&#x27;d repeat a few words, asking them to raise their hands if they remembered one word, then another. Then I would ask them if they remembered an 11th related word, one that was <i>not</i> on the original list. Cognitive priming with the first 10 words usually produced a 50% response of students saying they <i>remembered the word that wasn&#x27;t even there</i>. It would always get a good laugh. I hope it also left a lasting impression.')
