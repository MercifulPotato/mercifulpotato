She was majorly sketched out by the whole thing and that the PI supported the whole op. It was very painful and set her back a bit but she managed to switch to a different lab and do proper work, defend her thesis, graduate, and get far away from those people. Now we just shake our head in disbelief at them but at that point it was fairly existential. It&#x27;s not easy to switch labs after some time there and people will sort of distrust you and everything.<p>My impression is that some large number of &#x27;results&#x27; are fake results. I can&#x27;t even imagine in non-hard sciences what the fakery is when the hard sciences have this stuff.')
