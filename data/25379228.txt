Quite the opposite.<p>I like the walled garden and have no interest in it going away. I like that my mom can install apps and not worry about them spying on her.<p>I like that developers aren’t allowed to use their own payment processors. I don’t want to input my credit card into your black box payment system that might or might not charge me correctly.<p>I see that it does harm developers, but that’s a different conversation entirely.<p>If you want to install whatever apps you want, buy an android phone! And have fun while their bloat ware and preinstalled crap spams you with notifications and scams you.')
