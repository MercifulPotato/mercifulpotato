It&#x27;s also been around for nearly 20 years, they own their own datacenters, and have a proven track record with thousands of users.<p>This is cheaper (maybe, depending on your bandwidth usage) and gives you better &quot;ownership&quot; of the hardware, but because it is <i>hardware</i> its just as likely to fail or corrupt data as a hard drive sitting under your desk. This service is also in beta with just a handful of users.<p>Both companies seem to have really good policies and to be unix user-friendly.')
