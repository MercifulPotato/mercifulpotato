And since we&#x27;re talking about rural, this uplink is the expensive part as you will want to put it below ground so that random car crashes, forest fires, lighting strikes, wind damage, falling trees or <i>anything</i> don&#x27;t take down the single uplink for days.<p>You can link up such concentrators using directional wireless (this is how many LTE stations are uplinked, for example), but suffer from degraded performance in bad weather, lower total performance for the satellite stations&#x2F;APs, and it isn&#x27;t always possible (as it&#x27;s line-of-sight based).<p>Source: worked in constructions digging trenches for FTTN buildouts in Germany.')
