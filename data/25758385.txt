Just like we use anti-virus software on our OS. And sometimes we also use non-Apple softwares for products or features over Apple&#x27;s because the third-party has a better product.<p>&gt; The person I replied to had an even sillier version<p>Silly for you who are just evading the actual issue and instead want to try and focus the debate to <i>&quot;let&#x27;s discuss your beliefs  instead, and pretend everything is normal with an OS vendor deliberately crippling a useful software&quot;</i>.<p>Yes, Apple does want access to your personal data. Yes, the deliberate crippling of firewalls on the macOS is an an ATTACK by Apple against its users towards this end. And yes, malwares can exploit the whitelist to hijack these whitelisted process.<p>All the other irrelevant babble you spouted on how you have to be &quot;firewall admin&quot; itself is laughable when all you have to do is toggle a button to control whether an app is allowed to connect to the internet.<p>&gt; Defending against the OS vendor is close to impossible<p>It needn&#x27;t be if the OS vendor has good intentions. And that&#x27;s no excuse to shut up and not criticize them.')
