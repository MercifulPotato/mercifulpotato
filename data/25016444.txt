An ideal world where nobody drinks?<p>We&#x27;ve tried idealism via a prohibition and last I checked, that caused so much harm we went back to letting people have a drink.<p>A comparison of drugs vs no drugs ignores reality - we are not lab rats, we live within a society and a little vice lubricates the cogs of society. To deny that this is how it is, was and always will be is not helpful.<p>Your point regarding for-profit companies is valid - the likely solution to that is to control advertising so that it doesn&#x27;t advertise drugs, as we have already successfully done with cigarettes.<p>The larger point is that there needs to be a balance of individual good vs collective. When society tips too heavily in the direction of collective, drugs&#x2F;corruption&#x2F;disobedience&#x2F;crime will always be a &#x27;problem&#x27; because there&#x27;ll always be people who aren&#x27;t interested in living to enable arbitrary collective goals somebody has decided everyone else ought to follow.<p>Long story short, it&#x27;s a balancing act, maaan :)')
