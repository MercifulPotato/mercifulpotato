No one else has an idea what depression is ether, even professionals.<p>For example here are two things drastically different and the medical industry considers both to be depression:<p>1) Being overly pessimistic and skeptical to the point of believing nothing is worth trying and nothing can be done.  &quot;Nothing I try will ever help me.  My depression will last forever.&quot;  This can come in the form of rationalizing why nothing will work when they have a problem, so they get suck.  (An example of learned helplessness.)<p>2) Catching a chronic cold that may or may not cause irritable bowel syndrome that has the side effect of inflammation in the stomach which then in turn minimizes or outright removes the ability to feel positive emotions.  Some may experience other side effects beyond inflammation, like long term cold symptoms where they want to lay in bed all day, not socialize, or do much.  They feel sloth-like in an identical way to one feels when they have a cold, minus the sinus pressure and coughing.')
