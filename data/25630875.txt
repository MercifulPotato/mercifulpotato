Item(by='TeMPOraL', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609766054, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25627677, text='Yup, I usually used EvalDraw in (x,y) mode to graph inequalities. You have to remember though that equations like x=y or x-y = 0 represent a line - an infinitely thin object - so EvalDraw will likely not draw you anything given such input. You have to translate your equation into something that has thickness. E.g. an f(x) = 0 into abs(f(x)) &lt; 0.01<p>For instance, GP&#x27;s example:\n  (x,y)\n  abs(sin((1+sin(x+y))<i>asin(.5</i>(sin(x)+sin(y)))+(1+sin(x-y))<i>asin(.5</i>(cos(x)+cos(y)))))&lt;0.01<p>Draws a beautiful red chain-link fence on blue background.<p>If you can rewrite your formula to give you a value between 0 and 1, you&#x27;ll get a nice color gradient. And then you can have more direct control over colors using some of the things I described in the linked comment.')
