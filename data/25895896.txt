Having children compounds matters because wealth and competitive advantage is largely about relative values.<p>If it becomes the norm that, defying economic pressures, everyone has children, culture in a democracy can force societal change in policy and business to make these conditions reasonable. On the other hand, in a highly competitive labor market, it&#x27;s a chosen competitive disadvantage to have a child. Less time to devote to work, higher comp needed to support them and the family, etc. You&#x27;re at a disadvantage to your peers that can sacrifice their personal lives more easily than a responsible parent can.<p>Case in point, I&#x27;ve done a large amount of contractual work. I have a friend who works in the same ecosystem and they&#x27;ve had to pass up on opportunities to work a bit of overtime that helped me solidify a future business relationship and contract by being there to deliver when they needed it. My friend on the other hand has a family and simply couldn&#x27;t put in the extra hours in the short turnaround requested. The bias went towards me, the one with flexibility (no children but relationship with working professional who understands) to grasp these opportunities. That person shortly after had difficulty finding a new contract while I had a solid portfolio to work from. I don&#x27;t like the idea because I&#x27;d like to have kids in the near future but it&#x27;s quite clear you suffer a huge blow economically, in ways often seen and unseen, at least in the US.')
