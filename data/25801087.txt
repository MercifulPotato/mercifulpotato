I have to tell you that if you apply the things they share, where previously you had a home-grown &quot;process&quot; or lack thereof, your engineering organization will produce better results and your engineers will be happier. I can&#x27;t vouch for every single thing they ever wrote, but I think this style of rebuttal must be coming from someone who&#x27;s had to work in disfunctional places with overbearing product management.')
