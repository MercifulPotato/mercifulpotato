I&#x27;m saying the allegation is that they fudged them, and therefore you can&#x27;t simply point to the official numbers to support the claim that they did not fudge them. The way to refute that claim is with transparency and addressing this woman&#x27;s specific complaints.<p>Of course the state isn&#x27;t really obligated to refute every claim made against them, but whether they do it don&#x27;t, I&#x27;m only saying that the state is only denying her claim, snot actual evidence to support their counter claim of no manipulation of the data.')
