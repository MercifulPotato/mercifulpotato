Tesla, for instance, has spent billions of dollars to optimize their battery packs with their lithium-based chemistry and specific cathodes&#x2F;anodes. To then switch over to fuel cell + hydrogen is a completely different architecture, and Musk is notoriously anti-Hydrogen.<p>There is a case to be made that excess renewables can be used to attempt to generate &quot;green hydrogen&quot; which is then a &quot;storage&quot; of renewables that can also be used for vehicles. I think in practice, it&#x27;s a much smaller scale than battery electric vehicles.')
