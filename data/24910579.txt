We theoretically owed them millions of dollars for several years of unlicensed music streaming, and they waived the statutory penalties they were legally entitled to in exchange for us agreeing to pay a few hundred dollars of royalties a year to stream their members&#x27; music. All told, we paid less than $2500&#x2F;year for streaming licenses for all of the Big 3 labels and a dozen or more smaller labels.')
