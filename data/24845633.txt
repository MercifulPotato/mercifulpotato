You dismissed the core premise of the article,\n&gt; which is that lots of people propose blockchain as\n&gt; a solution to non-currency problems.<p>Whenever I see a proposed blockchain solution to problem, in particular problems that are not related to currencies, I read their descriptions to figure out what they are actually proposing.<p>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever seen such a proposal not involving some value token of some kind kind. In other words, even non-currency problems becomes currency-problems when you apply a blockchain solution.<p>If I&#x27;m wrong, I really want to see a blockchain solution which is not centred on participants earning tokena that holds value.')
