I own a Tesla and often I get some warning when the sun is at a low angle blinding the cameras.  I&#x27;ve no problem seeing stuff at the same direction.<p>So both sides of that sentence seem wrong.<p>EDIT: it&#x27;s also worth noting that Tesla is accounting for a whole bunch of future revenue from FSD.  If Tesla admits at some point that they can&#x27;t make it with the current sensors that would have huge financial implications.')
