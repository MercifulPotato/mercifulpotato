For example, the coffee one is this one:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.snpedia.com&#x2F;index.php&#x2F;Rs2472297" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.snpedia.com&#x2F;index.php&#x2F;Rs2472297</a><p>So you search your dna file for rs2472297 and then check which combination you have, e.g., you see “C T” which is slightly associated with coffee consumption. You can probably write or find a script that does this for you.')
