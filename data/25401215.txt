You pay for licensing those servers, which gives you Red Hat support, and also because you have proprietary software which is only supported on Red Hat.<p>You pay a pretty penny for those production servers. But you also need development servers, and staging servers. For those servers, RHEL would be a gigantic waste of money. It&#x27;s the production servers you need enterprise support for, none of the rest.<p>CentOS was a downstream release of Red Hat, with the same packages from Red Hat compiled. It was, for the most part, identical to Red Hat without the support. This meant you could develop on CentOS Dev Servers and test deployment on CentOS Staging servers, and expect it to work exactly the same when you sent it to production. Lots of less licensing costs, same results.<p>Now, CentOS Stream will be upstream of Red Hat. Instead of getting the same packages as Red Hat, now you&#x27;re getting the testing packages of Red Hat. You can no longer expect to get the same results from CentOS stream as from RHEL. The end of life for updates for existing CentOS releases has also been moved up drastically. By all appearances, Red Hat and IBM are essentially forcing companies to license and use RHEL on their dev and staging servers, by making CentOS Stream unusable for it.<p>Lucky for many, Canonical went and got Ubuntu certified for many of the same proprietary hardware and software systems that were previously only supported for proprietary linux distros. This means your dev, staging, and production can all be the exact same distro, and the only difference is which servers you&#x27;re paying for Canonical support for. This is a recentish change though, so many companies locked into Red Hat &#x2F; CentOS because of the clear path that was established between Development and Production. And certainly not every proprietary software&#x2F;hardware is supported on Ubuntu, yet. Lots of companies won&#x27;t switch (the structure of Red Hat to Debian is pretty drastically different), and IBM is counting on that.')
