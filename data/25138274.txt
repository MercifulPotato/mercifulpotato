With so many unemployed and so much unpaid rent. I find it hard to believe that landlords won&#x27;t try and recoop those lost rents. Short of interesting payment plans, which don&#x27;t work for the unemployed, they still have property taxes, property up-keep, loans, paychecks for themselves to manage.')
