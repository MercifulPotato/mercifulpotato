We had a PhD level intern applying our techniques to various open source projects. One target was MongoDB. After a few days of investigation of the Mongo source code, he had to give up because he couldn&#x27;t even find the critical sections in the source. They had locking, but it was extremely convoluted.<p>So yes I would agree with that. Never use MongoDB.')
