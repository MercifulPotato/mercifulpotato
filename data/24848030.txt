ORMs are a (failed?) attempt to do so.<p>I would very much push for computer-language integrated query support â€” (such as Datalog or Linq), and that is what the database server should be accepting as input, instead of a raw string.<p>Although a lot of people hate MongoDB, I&#x27;ve personally felt way more productive expressing queries with their query document system rather than using SQL.<p>Fixing design flaws with other software ain&#x27;t gonna bring us that far maybe.')
