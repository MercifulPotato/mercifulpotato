It&#x27;s like general relativity, left vs right only exist in relation to something else.<p>Yes, and the US Republican party is extremely far right, so labelling other parties solely in relation to US politics is not useful for discussing like actual political ideology.<p>It is, however, useful if you want to paint mainstream European political ideologies as socialism.<p>&gt; Everyone is aware that politics change over time.<p>Then recognize that and be willing to have a discussion about politics in relation to time. If you refuse to engage with someone who points out that a political party or idea is not actual far left in the grand scheme of things, you are refusing to recognize the larger context.<p>In general, its difficult to have conversations without consistent definitions, and if the Republican party can change the definition of &quot;left&quot; by moving further to the right, this makes discussion of left politics hard, so people interested in discussing leftist politics have to reject that definition to have productive conversations.<p>If you don&#x27;t want to have productive conversations with those people, that&#x27;s your choice. But say that, don&#x27;t claim they&#x27;re being disingenuous.<p>&gt; Clinton was a Democrat who wanted strong borders and now the modern left wants open borders. Isn&#x27;t that a shift to the left?<p>Depending on exactly what you mean by &quot;open borders&quot;, Sanders, who is conventionally considered left-of-the-median Democrat, wants less open borders than the democratic party as a whole. He&#x27;s for freedom of movement of people, but for more tariffs and economic protectionism than the democratic party.<p>Trump and Sanders are actually sort of unique in this regard. Conventional Democrats and Republicans both favor free trade, although perhaps for different reasons. Trump, being anti-globalization does not, and Sander, being pro-labor, does not.')
