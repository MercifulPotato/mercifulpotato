If you register your LLC in Delaware or Nevada and live in MA, you still have to register it as a &quot;foreign corporation&quot; and pay the annual fees (which is approx the same as just having an MA registered LLC).  And since you&#x27;re &quot;earning&quot; in MA, yeah you&#x27;ll have to pay MA taxes on that.<p>And if you have a co-founder in a different state, chances are they&#x27;ll have to do the same in that state.')
