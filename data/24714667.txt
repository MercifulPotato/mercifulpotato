They are saying that &quot;It&#x27;s unfashionable these days to play Bach <i>on the piano.</i>&quot;<p>The modern fashion is to play Bach on a period-appropriate instrument like a harpsichord or clavichord.  The piano wasn&#x27;t invented until much later so it is anachronistic to play Bach on a piano.  But the disadvantage of Bach on period-appropriate instruments is that the modern piano is really quite an incredible instrument with a much better ability to produce subtle changes in dynamics.  So what you gain in historical authenticity you may lose in emotional expression.')
