We have more means of communicating our ideas (even without the internet) for cheaper than we have in the entire history of humanity.<p>Never in history have the mediums of communication of the day been required to communicate what you ask them to. Sure, you could print a pamphlet, but I guarantee you&#x27;d rather have it in the Boston Gazette.')
