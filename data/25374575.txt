You may feel uncomfortable letting yourself go, but it will give you a much needed break and you will come back more energized.<p>Speaking a bit more anecdotally, what worked for me when I facing a similar problem was shutting off the computer immediately after work and allowing myself to relax and prioritize other hobbies. I was watching more documentaries and vlogs, as well as going outside and hiking on the weekends as opposed to being bunkered down at my desk. This opened my eyes to what there really is in life, and I now view programming almost completely differently as a result, but in a sustainable, healthy way. I slowly built my passion back up, but not as compulsively as before. I don&#x27;t program just to program anymore, which actually makes me more efficient.<p>I know your struggle and I wish you the best. Accept you need time off and it will get so much better.')
