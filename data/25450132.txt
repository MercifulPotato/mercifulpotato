Half Life: Alyx is one of the best gaming experiences I&#x27;ve had in my life. I have witnessed everyone who tried Beat Saber completely fall in love with it after about 10 minutes, including people who were 100% positive that they hated video games and would not enjoy it. It is obvious, if you have the right system and you do the right things, that VR is mind blowing.<p>BUT, the VR ecosystem is a shitshow. So many manufactures are making crappy headsets and wondering why they don&#x27;t sell. The HTC Cosmos Elite, for example, ships with old base stations and clunky-as-hell Vive wands, and costs almost as much as an Index. Windows Mixed Reality is, for one, not &quot;mixed reality&quot; at all, and the tracking is so fucking broken I&#x27;m honestly surprised we haven&#x27;t seen class action lawsuits. Most VR games are just normal 2d games with VR tacked on, or if they are made for VR they&#x27;re tiny.<p>Valve made a good headset and it&#x27;s been sold out since launch. They made a good game and it&#x27;s won awards and sold to pretty much every single person who can play it. Facebook (as much as I hate they&#x27;re a major player here) made a good headset with the Quest (not with the Rift), and it&#x27;s been sold out since it launched as well.<p>Just make good products and we&#x27;ll buy them FFS. It&#x27;s not that complicated.')
