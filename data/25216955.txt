I&#x27;m not totally certain but I think the LM systems don&#x27;t have adaptive optics. But DARPA had a program where they were making something analogous to a phased array out of fiber lasers, where each individual laser had its own independent lens, and a phase shifter is used on each to align all the beams in real time so they&#x27;re all mutually coherent. The phase shifter is tuned in real time by reflection back along each beam line from the target, split off with a beam splitter to some sort of sensor.<p>They stopped talking about it after like 2 years, which maybe means it was a flop or maybe they took it secret. Who knows.
