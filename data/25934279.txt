By expecting people to have someone to support them while they take a chance to get in the door, you are saying you don&#x27;t want folks that don&#x27;t have that or aren&#x27;t rich enough to suffer through it.<p>Just because a few people are willing to work for less - or for free - to get in the door doesn&#x27;t mean it is just to take advantage of them and pay them less than a living wage. Not everyone will be working x job for opportunity. Some folks need to eat. And yes, it is taking advantage of people - artists and musicians get offers to get paid in Exposure all the time. Which is really, &quot;please work for free!&quot;.<p>The only real exception to this is, perhaps, when the work is actually part of schooling, and that should be limited. Teachers, doctors, and pharmacists come to mind, though we do treat the doctor interns quite horribly. (some pharmacist interns get a bit of pay).<p>If you want labor, pay a decent wage.')
