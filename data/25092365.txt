Item(by='throwaway100900', descendants=1, kids=[25092564], score=1, time=1605362975, title='Ask HN: Mail service that allows storing naked children pics (No CP)', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='My wife is a pediatrician. Her work email address is managed by Google (Google Apps). Due to her work, she often receives and sends photos of children, both body parts and whole body, dressed and naked. I am worried that some ML piece of software flags the account for child porn and bans her mail (or worse, “inform the authorities”). Is there a mail service that she can migrate to (she owns her domain) that can tolerate such pictures being stored. She can provide all the documentation required if it is needed to apply for an exception. Thanks.<p>Edit: We live in a country with no special requirements for medical data (eg HIPAA).')
