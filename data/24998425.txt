They don&#x27;t tell you why, but I accidentally submitted two credit card applications (one for myself and one for my wife) with identical northwest airlines frequent flier miles numbers.  I think this must have flagged something because one day I noticed all of my Chase cards and accounts stopped working and I got a letter in the mail a few days later.  There was no phone number, only an address to mail a letter for further inquiries.  I mailed a letter explaining that I thought they made a mistake.  Someone called me back and told me it wasn&#x27;t a mistake and they wouldn&#x27;t give me any more information.<p>I suppose somehow, legally, this became the best course of action for Chase bank - to cut the customer off immediately and give them zero information about it.  But it really doesn&#x27;t feel right and made me never want to do business with Chase again.')
