Genuine platform exclusivity is rarer and rarer these days, as the underlying engine market has become more and more commoditised. It is relatively cheap to port a game built in Unity or Unreal engine from PC to Xbox, PlayStation, etc.<p>Mac has always lagged because the market wasn&#x27;t big enough to warrant investment. Catalina wouldn&#x27;t have cratered your gaming library if there was enough incentive for the developers to update the game. Now that iOS apps (read: games) can run on Mac with relatively low effort, and we already see PC games being easily ported to iOS (eg: Fortnite, legal challenges notwithstanding), I feel that this is the best thing to happen to Mac gaming in years.')
