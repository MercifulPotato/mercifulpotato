When I was working on my degree in the mid 90s nearly everyone had a recorder on their desk while they were taking notes. I didn&#x27;t record every class or even every lecture, I focused mostly on the topics&#x2F;lectures where I had difficulties. If I &#x27;got it&#x27; I usually recorded over that tape.<p>I may even have a box of them somewhere around here in the barn.')
