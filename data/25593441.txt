Take Trump - if he had any shame then the revelation of multiple affairs would have been enough to bring him down. But by being so previously shameless it just runs off him.<p>The problem is this expectation for politicians to be perfect humans and never do or say, or have done or have said anything wrong. So they&#x27;re all kind of emulating this robotic version of themselves that never has any opinion people can object to.<p>Shamelessness cut right through that and let Trump speak from his (very dark) heart, which is part of why people like him.')
