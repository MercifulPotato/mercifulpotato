In the end the dead bodies count and it doesn&#x27;t matter whether a cautious or inexperienced driver killed them. Inexperienced drivers are prerequisite of experienced drivers, there&#x27;s no way to get rid of them. Excluding them from statistics is just discounting those deaths as... somehow less important?<p>If a self-driving vehicle is only 1.5x (instead of 5x) as safe as the average human driver then you&#x27;re not trading between <i>death by humans</i> vs. <i>death by machine</i>, you&#x27;re primarily trading between <i>death by human</i> and <i>spared by machine</i> and only secondly between the former.')
