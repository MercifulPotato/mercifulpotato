The registrar activates the app and generates the key pair. The registrar records the voterâ€™s public key. The voter can now use the app to vote and his votes are encrypted using his private key which can be read using the recorded public key. Every election cycle or if he loses his phone the voter needs to go back to the registrar. Is there anything I am missing?')
