Real batteries tend to charge groups of cells, or individual cells, separately anyway.<p>Let&#x27;s have 4 cables, or maybe 6 cables, charging separate sub-batteries. Since the surface to mass ratio grows as mass decreases, passive cooling becomes more viable. The mass of each cable also becomes manageable.  Of course, now you need to have several connectors on the car, likely under a dedicated retractable panel.<p>Cars aside, I&#x27;d apprentice a phone that can charge in 10 minutes, even if it needed to be under a fan during that.')
