We&#x27;re solving a small part of this by making notebooks play nicely with GitHub (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;reviewnb.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;reviewnb.com</a>). Code reviews &amp; collaboration for Jupyter Notebooks, essentially.<p>Happy to see more products taking a stab at this problem. I&#x27;d be curious to know how you implement version control (git or something else) &amp; what kind of experiences does that translate to for the user. Congrats on the launch!')
