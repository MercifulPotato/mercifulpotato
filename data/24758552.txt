It&#x27;s those conversations in the hallway, or seeing someone in the break room that reminds you about something you meant to ask them about.<p>It&#x27;s really hard to replicate that in WFH. I can&#x27;t want to say &quot;can&#x27;t be replicated&quot; or &quot;shouldn&#x27;t need to be&quot;. I think they absolutely <i>should</i> be replicated. But I don&#x27;t know how. Things like slack help, but it&#x27;s just too disconnected. You can have &quot;fun meetings&quot; (a contradiction in terms!), but those feel like a waste of time. Zoom happy hours exhaust me.')
