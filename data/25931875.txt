I don&#x27;t always see these things or spend my time logged into these sites.<p>There are some people (including family members) that simply no longer &#x27;talk&#x27; to me but think that they are &#x27;always telling me&#x27; things. I&#x27;ve been caught out with things like phone number changes, address changes because someone has moved home and think they have &#x27;told me&#x27; because they did some random tweet to &#x27;everyone&#x27; some time back.<p>There are two sides to &#x27;staying connected&#x27;, social media (generally speaking) has made these connections rather one-sided. Staying connected should be more like a gentle came of catch-and-throw but instead it&#x27;s more akin to beig stood in front of one of those machines that fling balls at you relentlessly regardless if you are ready or not.<p>I hate it.')
