Every single seed you plant from an apple will come up as a different variety. Most of them will be completely impractical as an eating&#x2F;cooking apple, and most of the trees will grow huge. The rarity is getting an apple variety that tastes good and grows well. Then you have the added complexity of having to graft it onto a useful root stock to get a reasonable-sized productive tree.')
