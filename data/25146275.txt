Item(by='krapp', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605760644, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25140926, text='&gt;but I don&#x27;t think a site like e.g. HN or pornhub are the types of sites people are talking about when they refer to those problems.<p>Yes, when people talk about those problems, they&#x27;re usually only referring to two or three sites (Twitter, Facebook and maybe Youtube) but those sites don&#x27;t comprise all of social media. The issue is discussing &quot;social media&quot; as an entity rather than recognizing that the cultures and implementations of social media differ between platforms. Social media is just an umbrella term for any site that allows users to create and share content. And it exists on a spectrum, with simple forums and imageboards on one end to the complex, algorithmically driven big three at the other.<p>Otherwise, one could say that Pornhub could implement literally every feature that exists on Facebook and yet somehow still <i>not</i> be &quot;social media&quot; for no other reason than discussions of social media tending not to include Pornhub. The features <i>are</i> what make it social media.')
