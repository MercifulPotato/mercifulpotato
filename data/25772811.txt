Yes the autobiography is really influential, but for a lot of people (esp older generation) Malcolm is still defined by his nation of Islam days, his &quot;angry&quot; days, which make it easy to put him in some sort of &quot;angry black man&quot; box... His later thinking is much different, and the autobiography does reflect that (though it looks like there was more that was left out).<p>RIP Malcolm. A man willing to fight for what&#x27;s right, willing to speak up, willing to evolve his thinking over time. Not many modern leaders are willing to take such risks.<p>And he was such a brilliant speaker. He is missed.')
