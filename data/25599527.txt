In that way the defaults go out the window and I can build up to the style I want.<p>If you don&#x27;t do this approach you&#x27;re going to want to keep in mind differences in default whitespace handling and alignment&#x2F;sizing model defaults which are going to be different in a button vs a typical &lt;div&gt; container.<p>.<p>Nothing wrong with going into a technical comment or discussion in hopes of sharing knowledge but that&#x27;s not what was being talked about here. Look how long you and I have been talking about a single button in the UI. Look how many other comments there are about this. Now go back to the original comment &quot;It breaks my heart that when this project was started in 2017, some 20 years after web accessibility advocacy had started in earnest, the developer was still uninformed enough about accessibility that they would create a custom button component with no ARIA support.&quot;. Ignoring that it&#x27;s talking about a COMPLETELY different approach to making the button accessible the assumption is the developer is uninformed about accessibility. My argument is knowledgeable or not it&#x27;s a lot of work for a passion project and not something reasonable to expect be done in one. If you want to make a PR to add user accessibility so they can understand that&#x27;s great but I think you&#x27;ll find it was a lot more work than figuring out how to make this one button be marked for a screen reader. You may also (likely) find they knew many of the things that would be needed to make it accessible but went with what was quick and easy for the passion project, especially considering the thing is still marked beta.<p>Taking that to the other part of your content no it&#x27;s not alright for you to decide what&#x27;s acceptable code quality for someone else to be able to share their free project. It&#x27;d be nice if it was accessible to the blind, it&#x27;d also be nice to have Chinese and Indian translations. None of these is something reasonable to expect from a project like this simply because it was shared for free. A government project definitely. A commercial project very much so. Some person&#x27;s passion project? No, you don&#x27;t get to decide when it&#x27;s usable by enough people for them to share it with others. And you shouldn&#x27;t expect open source developers to do anything for you, always be happy they picked something up they didn&#x27;t want&#x2F;need themselves. Otherwise do the work or pay them to, don&#x27;t just demand they follow your standards. This is very different than making a helpful PR or comment about how to do it which is on the &quot;totally acceptable&quot; side of the fence.<p>I&#x27;m not here to shame anybody but if I was it&#x27;d be people that see an free and open source project and the first thing they think is to comment to shame the author about it.')
