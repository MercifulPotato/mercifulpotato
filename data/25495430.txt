There are plenty of &quot;open source&quot; projects run by a corporation that are a shit-show because they put the corporations&#x27; interests first.<p>Honestly, screw everyone that uses some annoying &quot;Open Source <i>unless you compete with me</i>&quot; license, or doesn&#x27;t include non-corporate engineers on an oversight board for the project. I don&#x27;t give a crap if your code is available if you never accept the PRs that I make, or never address the issues I raise. Often these issues stay open for <i>years</i>, and the reason why is almost always the corporation didn&#x27;t want to fix them. Do they invite the community to provide a fix? Nope.<p>Sure, I can make my own patch for a bug affecting me right now. But then I have to maintain that patch into perpetuity. At that point I&#x27;d rather just pay for a commercial proprietary product. So what was the point of the source being open?')
