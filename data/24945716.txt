The gravitational path integral doesn’t distinguish replicas from a real black hole. It takes them literally. This activates some of the latent topologies that the gravitational path integral includes. The result is a new saddle point containing multiple black holes linked by space-time wormholes. It competes for influence with the regular geometry of a single black hole surrounded by a mist of Hawking radiation.&quot;<p>Ah yes, the complex of wormhole interlinked blackholes surrounded by mists of Hawking radiation...<p>This style of writing, without the actual math, seems to more so obscure true understanding than reveal it for such a complex construct as english words are very likely insufficient for actually capturing the true meaning.<p>Adding the (partial?) equations of the path integral and&#x2F;or the matrices would allow for an actual understanding without the confining nature of human words.<p>In fact just thinking and writing this comment made me more confused, just a few paragraphs prior the path integral could not be fully calculated, but now here it is certain that &quot;the gravitational path integral doesn’t distinguish replicas from a real black hole&quot;. Just how powerful is this &#x27;mathematical trick&#x27;?')
