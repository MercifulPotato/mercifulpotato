Not one specific class.<p>I highly doubt people express in public that a particular library is too complex. They simply choose not to use it. I remember some Boost Graph library once. What a a mess. I never expressed publicly that I couldn&#x27;t figure out how do use it. Nobody does that, because nobody wants to appear stupid. Instead I just wrote a graph library in C++ from scratch myself. Discovered that was faster than figuring out the template insanity in that Graph library.<p>I have worked on usability for a number of years and done usability testing on people. And rarely if ever do anyone ever blame the system. They blame themselves. Or they shut up because they don&#x27;t want to appear stupid.<p>That is why when you do usability testing you have to sit an observe people. You cannot rely on questionnaires because people seldom admit the system was complex.<p>Actually observing a variety of people try to program modern C++, would likely have been a rather sad experience.')
