It&#x27;s occupiers will probably choose that particular hill to die on too. 4chan would be a good (if you can use that word...) example.<p>&gt; Whatever happened to freedom of speech? Why are so many people today willing to throw freedom of speech out the window?<p>Freedom of speech still exists. Case-in-point, the website in question still exists no matter how uncomfortable it makes me personally. Freedom of speech does not protect anybody from the consequences of that freedom.<p>People are much less tolerant of speech that offends them. I think this is a good thing, because many minorities were already often offended before but lacked the power to speak up. What you&#x27;re seeing now isn&#x27;t the erosion of freedom of speech, but the strengthening of it in the face of robust and diverse views.')
