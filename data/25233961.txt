The Coinbase controversy. Let&#x27;s do an objective investigation of this and see what we find.&quot; But I won&#x27;t accuse the NYT of bad faith, economic&#x2F;journalistic incentives are sufficient to explain that angle, fishing for further controversy for a company with an already bad reputation (deserved or not).<p>Notice the NYT article even wrote negatively of Coinbase&#x27;s diversity efforts: Supposedly, black people where shoed into photos, to make the company look good to the outside, but were never promoted or listened to (implying, because they were black, and white Libertarian autist tech bro&#x27;s don&#x27;t listen to or promote their black employees as a matter of principle). With such an angle about questionable motives, it is neigh impossible to do anything right. It is &quot;we already determined you are wrong, now where is your apology?&quot;.')
