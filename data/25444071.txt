It is an absolute joy to work with dedicated people who care about their craft, and FB is filled with them. Maybe you want to do a startup someday. You are going to need cofounders and go work at Facebook for 2 years and you&#x27;ll probably build a working relationship with 100-200 highly talented people (while getting paid a lot!).
