And cool to see you here on HN! I live your positioning and how you’re first and foremost building FOSS software and tools that you leverage on, as opposed to building a commercial offering that you then release software for. It’s a vital distinction that sets you apart from eg Google.<p>Let’s say you have an org that’s doing the whole Consul&#x2F;Nomad&#x2F;Vault thing, and starting to have their Nomad jobs using Consul Connect (and it’s proxies&#x2F;gateways for external).. that’s already a proxy sidecar used for all service ports. How does Boundary fit here? Is it put before&#x2F;after Connect, is the plan to integrate them, or are they supposed to not be used together?')
