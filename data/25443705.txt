With Scheme (Racket), you&#x27;ll be able to ramp up easily as it requires less knowledge (as long as you are not doing metaprogramming). You also have the option of using Scheme itself to have something even simpler (Chez, gerbil, lots of choices here).<p>So you should ask yourself what your use for Lisp is. If it&#x27;s just for fun, I&#x27;d go with the simplest.')
