E.g., Texas might go proportionate if their EC votes swing blue. Why? Because it&#x27;s not impossible that Dems might win Texas&#x27;s EC votes in the next 30 years but it is literally impossible for them to control the state government in that time-frame. However, in all the cases I can think of with that flavor, it&#x27;s hard to imagine the electoral college remaining competitive even with gerrymandered states going proportionate.<p>So IMO, the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact is much more likely than the majority of states go proportional with their EC votes (and even that is highly unlikely).')
