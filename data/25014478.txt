Item(by='leto_ii', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604748325, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25014342, text='&gt; I think heirarchy is a natural human inclination. It&#x27;s observed in every part of the animal kingdom.<p>I have two main objections to this line of thinking:<p>1. Even if a tendency or behavior can occur in &quot;nature&quot;, that doesn&#x27;t necessarily make it correct. By that measure murder, infanticide, rape etc. should also be considered acceptable since they occur in nature (both with humans and animals).<p>2. If you take a look at smth like <i>The World Until Yesterday</i> or other similar work it will become apparent that the kind of large scale hierarchies of power present in the modern world are relatively recent constructions. To me they&#x27;re more a hallmark of contingency and deliberate human choices, not of &quot;nature&quot;. If we want to make a less hierarchical society we can, it&#x27;s in our power to change the design of society (to a significant extent at least).')
