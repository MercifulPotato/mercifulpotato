Item(by='oh_sigh', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611603483, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25906672, text='I suspect this will be minorly used for direct misinformation control(&quot;Donald Rumsfeld is not a lizard person&quot;), but mostly used for narrative control(&quot;While this fact is true by itself, you need to look at the bigger context...&quot;), and so will be entirely ineffective. People readily take up new information, but are very hesitant to change their internal narrative on a matter. Especially when they&#x27;re being told by others what their narrative should be. Double especially if part of their narrative is that big tech&#x2F;liberals&#x2F;academia&#x2F;coastal elites&#x2F;etc are trying to feed you the Big Lie.<p>Conservative misinformation is a big talking point for liberals, and maybe the big societal issue at the moment, but as a small scale test run, I&#x27;d love to see birdwatch try to correct the record for misinformation that is commonly believed in liberal circles: Anti-GMO, anti-vaxx, toxic whiteness, the extents of systemic racism in our society, some of the more dire prognostications of nuclear war and global warming.')
