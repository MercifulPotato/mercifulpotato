This assumes your tenant will turnover in a couple years time, mind you.<p>I did the math for SF and IIRC ~2mo was equal to a 15% discount. if it sits empty for longer than 2mo, you should have just given the 15% discount. if you let is sit for 2mo AND have to give a 15% discount, now you&#x27;ve really fucked your finances up.')
