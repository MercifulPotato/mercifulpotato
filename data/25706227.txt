And cause and predictive capability are  directly tied to particular theory&#x2F;model you&#x27;re using.<p>so &#x27;random&#x27; might mean:<p>1) we have a good coherent model, consistent with empirical results, and a particular process&#x2F;phenomenon is unpredictable according to our model.<p>or alternatively<p>2) we don&#x27;t have a good model&#x2F;don&#x27;t understand the cause and therefore can&#x27;t predict the outcome a particular process&#x2F;phenomenon<p>both 1 and 2 leave space for a new theory to come in, and be able to explain the cause&#x2F;make the prediction and eliminate &#x27;randomness&#x27;<p>so essentially you&#x27;re right.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Randomness" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Randomness</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Stochastic_process" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Stochastic_process</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Radioactive_decay" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Radioactive_decay</a>')
