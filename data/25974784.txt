Item(by='edouard-harris', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612055965, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25972719, text='&gt; I wonder if there&#x27;s a way to marry &quot;efficient market hypothesis&quot; with &quot;reflexivity on the edges&quot; somehow.<p>The key to this synthesis is that there is sometimes genuine, fundamental value to be had in creating a Schelling point for a resource or a certain kind of transaction. This is (part of) why online marketplaces are valuable and defensible businesses, for example.<p>&quot;Reflexivity&quot; is simply what it looks like when a Schelling point is in the process of forming. There are some very rare but very real cases in which a bubble really does create its own reality, and that reality sticks around because a shared delusion turns out to create enough real value to justify its existence. There is an art to identifying those cases, and that art is as well-compensated as one might imagine. (Most of the time, though, a Ponzi is just a Ponzi.)')
