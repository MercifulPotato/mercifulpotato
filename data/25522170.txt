Are you on the fence about breaking up or leaving your job? You should probably go ahead and do it. People, on average, end up happier when they take the plunge.</i><p>Seems illogical. Presumably the reason that people are happier after leaving their job is because, on average, they wait until they are ready. That doesn&#x27;t mean anyone with the inclination to quit should do so.<p><i>27. Discipline is superior to motivation. The former can be trained, the latter is fleeting. You won’t be able to accomplish great things if you’re only relying on motivation.</i><p>This is a meme that seems pretty unhealthy to me. Discipline and motivation are not interchangeable things. They exist in a balance. If you regularly do things that you don&#x27;t feel any motivation to do, you&#x27;re on track to have a midlife crisis where you realize that you wasted your entire life trying to impress others without listening to yourself. Ideally, good discipline will nurture motivation, and motivation will help to maintain discipline.<p>If you find that your motivation to do something disappears, maybe you should question why you&#x27;re doing it rather than just telling yourself that motivation is fleeting.')
