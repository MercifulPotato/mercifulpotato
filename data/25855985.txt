This is what makes it <i>universal</i> as it is said on their website.  You have access to all the source code for every single package, so you can do anything you want with the whole gigantic system, including trying to get it running on other CPUs or building other OSes (Ubuntu, etc.) on it.<p>Debian ultimately is meant to give you power through software freedom.  Shipping closed source blobs conflicts with that value.  Other OSes may have different values, and that&#x27;s fine.  There&#x27;s room for everybody.')
