Item(by='zelphirkalt', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605187451, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25069152, text='I am in Europe and I do not see anything close to what the author is describing.<p>Nothing is really at no cost. It is paid for with tax money or directly. The author is not specifying &quot;for those who could not otherwise afford it&quot;, but describing it as at no cost for everyone. Most universities cost money to enrole and attend. Does your baker give out buns at no cost? Is the grocery store giving away all the food at no cost? Has it all become a service at no cost?<p>Nope, none of that has happened and it will not happen, as long as everything needs to be a good business in a capitalistic sense. The single person business or small business or any business cannot escape the reality in this system.<p>Show me that country or even that city please. Show me the social experiment, that tries to get people to work without pay, as long as they have access to &quot;all the things we need in our daily lives&quot;. As far as I know, it has never been done. What if you have any extra wish? How will it be supplied, without tracking your every move in such a society? How would different needs be satisfied,  everyone having slightly different needs?<p>So that&#x27;s why I call it pure fiction. You are welcome to show me that model city, which self-sufficiently makes it happen. I might move there.')
