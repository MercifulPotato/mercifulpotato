When &quot;streaming&quot; video, there most certainly is a copy of the bits being stored on a disk to ensure that the video &quot;stream&quot; plays cleanly and without interruption.<p>Are you making the claim that &quot;streamed&quot; video is never buffered&#x2F;stored on disk?  That&#x27;s an odd claim to make.  I&#x27;m no expert on video streaming, but I would be <i>very</i> surprised to find that all video streams are <i>only</i> stored in RAM and not on disk.<p>I may well be wrong about that.  Perhaps someone more knowledgeable could chime in.')
