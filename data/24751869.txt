Nowhere in the article does it say <i>all</i> knives with points. Nor did the government consider it, beyond being asked to comment on the journal article.<p>The proposal was from a hospital research group who argued that many stabbings are impulsive and that long knives cause extremely serious penetration injuries. So they suggested banning those knives for home use, or at least blunting the tips.<p>The response to this is usually &quot;well people could sharpen them?&quot; and sure, but the purpose is risk mitigation. You&#x27;d still be able to buy a smaller pointed knife if you wanted.<p>&gt; The researchers said a short pointed knife may cause a substantial superficial wound if used in an assault - but is unlikely to penetrate to inner organs.<p>They allegedly consulted with chefs who agreed that if you really need to use the tip, a paring knife would be OK. Anecdotally I&#x27;d agree - the only thing I use the tip of my chef&#x27;s knife for is for opening packaging.')
