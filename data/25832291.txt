They want their doctor to look at THEM and say &quot;hmm, we&#x27;ll try you on X but if it doesn&#x27;t help with the intrusive thoughts we&#x27;ll maybe switch it out to Y and up the dosage of Z&quot;. Or they want to tell the doctor what they think they want to be prescribed. They are paying big bucks to see a psychiatrist. Most of them are not on a self-optimization trip, they just want to feel better, and also feel like someone takes an interest in how they are getting on. Using a snazzy tool would probably lead to the patient being less satisfied with the doctor&#x27;s service, even if they have slightly better outcomes by whatever questionable metric is in the study.')
