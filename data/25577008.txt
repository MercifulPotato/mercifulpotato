The argument that an influx of cheap foreign goods &amp; cheap labor costs are good for the economy does not properly consider the long term &amp; strategic costs of hollowing out large markets where the USA once lead the world as well as the poverty&#x2F;blight incurred by former middle-class communities.<p>I grew up in Hawaii, which used to have a large sugar cane industry. I found it strange that the sugar cane was shipped to the mainland, to be processed, then packaged, shipped back, &amp; sold to the consumer in Hawaii. The value added was effectively removed the local market, which created a monopoly for H,C,&amp;S to buy land, have authority over water rights, allowing them to break treaties &amp; promises to the citizens of the islands. There were also celebrated things that occurred due to the sugar industry, such as importing many people of different ethnicities to work in the plantations.<p>Today, Hawaii has highly prized land, which is expensive, &amp; many families living there for generations who do not make much money. With few employable industries (government &amp; tourism being the largest employers), the economy is vulnerable to Black Swan events, such as the Covid lockdowns.')
