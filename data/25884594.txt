Being connected to the pulse of the world comes with very powerful pros (meeting a partner, finding a job) and cons (disinformation, social pressures). Comparing it to essential oils is wrong.<p>Also, the Facebook story isn&#x27;t finished yet. Is it really that far-fetched to believe that their influence over our lives could 10x over the next 50 years? I hope it won&#x27;t, but I wouldn&#x27;t be willing to put my money on it. So keeping in mind that the context of this thread is about getting permanently banned on Facebook, for anyone who thinks that might have zero impact on them, I would suggest you still keep a foot in the door in case you change your mind down the road.')
