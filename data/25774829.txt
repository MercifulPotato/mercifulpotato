Price-wise you still save a lot of money, after quickly googling around, roughly $1200 vs. $15k-$20k.<p>But you still lose something, e.g. if you use half precision on V100 you get virtually double speed, if you do on a 1080 &#x2F; 2080 you get... nothing because it&#x27;s not supported.<p>(and more importantly for companies, you can actually use only V100-style stuff on servers [edit: as you mentioned already, although I&#x27;m not 100% sure it&#x27;s just drivers that are the issue?])<p>[1] I&#x27;ve not used 1080 myself, but I&#x27;ve used 1080ti and V100 extensively, and the latter is about 30% faster. Hence my estimate for comparison with 1080')
