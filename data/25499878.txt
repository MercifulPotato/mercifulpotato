Ferguson is the corresponding author for a paper titled &quot;Impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to reduce COVID-19 mortality and healthcare demand&quot;, which describes itself as having &quot;informed policymaking in the UK and other countries in recent weeks&quot;.[55] Streeck stated in reference to the paper &quot;In the – really good – model studies by the Imperial College about the progress of the epidemic, the authors assume, for example, that 50 percent of households in which there is a case do not comply with the voluntary quarantine. Where does such an assumption come from? I think we should establish more facts.&quot;[56] The computer models which Ferguson authored were initially criticised as &quot;unreliable&quot; and &quot;a buggy mess,&quot;[57][58] but subsequent efforts to reproduce the results were successful.[59]<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Neil_Ferguson_(epidemiologist)" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Neil_Ferguson_(epidemiologist)</a><p>[59] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;d41586-020-01685-y" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;d41586-020-01685-y</a>')
