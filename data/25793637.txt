Behind the paywall were bonus features for them.<p>All they <i>really</i> needed to register their subscribers for the login was the subscriber code from the bill. But marketing (it was marketing that started the website, not editorial) came up with a 3-page questionnaire about background, interests, and preferences that would-be users were supposed to go through to register. Granted many of the questions were optional, no answer was required, but unsurprisingly they didn&#x27;t get a lot of signups.  And it wasn&#x27;t like the users were going to get charged more, login access was free to anyone with a subscription.')
