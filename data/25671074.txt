It&#x27;s perfectly possible votes were stolen from Biden, from Trump, or neither. We don&#x27;t know. I wish we did.<p>In this context, though, security is NOT hard. We&#x27;ve just made the decision not to do it. I see no excuse for why I shouldn&#x27;t be able to see the source code and design of the voting machines in my state, or audit any part of the manufacturing or voting process. This should all be open and transparent. A not-for-profit should be able to spot audit a hundred random machines around the US:<p>- Swipe a credit card to cover supervisor time<p>- In a secure facility, confirm the source code and hardware are as advertised on local voting machines<p>This just isn&#x27;t rocket science.<p>Judging from downvotes and comments on HN, building political consensus around that will be neigh-impossible post-Trump. Click on my post history. Most of my comments are in the +3 to +15 range. Virtually all my comments in this thread are either 1 (not voted on) or between 0 and -4 (having gone to -6). None are swinging Trump conspiracy theories; merely pointing out the obvious: we need robust, auditable, secure voting.')
