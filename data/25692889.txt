If the certificate has been revoked, the app won’t launch. To verify the status, the device must be able to reach ocsp.apple.com.<p>The OCSP response is cached on the device for the period of time specified by the OCSP server—currently, between 3 and 7 days. The validity of the certificate isn’t checked again until the device has restarted and the cached response has expired. If a revocation is received at that time, the app won’t launch.<p>Also:\n```echo &quot;127.0.0.1 oscp.apple.com&quot; | sudo tee -a &#x2F;etc&#x2F;hosts```<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;nathanhleung&#x2F;2ceeda4c743f2a1cf3d670c8b90445f6" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;nathanhleung&#x2F;2ceeda4c743f2a1cf3d670c...</a>')
