Won&#x27;t be able to use it for the foreseeable future unfortunately.<p>Apart from the considerable effort of having to enter the sheet music, there is one problem. At least where I teach, the big no-no prohibiting us from using this is always the copyright issues.<p>A public music academy where I teach once got sued by the local sheet music copyright maff^^^organisation. Not because piracy was rampant. It wasn&#x27;t. It most probably happened to us because at the time, our boss was relatively young and they guessed easier to push around.<p>No larger music educational organisation will want to touch nice toys like you built before getting a legal opinion they have no budget for :-( Hat off to you for spotting that and staying at the teacher level. Good luck with your project.<p>P.S. Always welcome if you&#x27;d like to have chat about where music education and technology touch!')
