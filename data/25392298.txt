I have a lot of headphones :) Re: the A50, I had to remove the centerpiece foam because it caused headaches pressing into the top of my skull, and so now there&#x27;s a towel wrapped around them to provide less-but-some padding. If it weren&#x27;t for that, they&#x27;d be perfect for their use case. The Beats Studio3 fit perfectly at maximum extension, as do the DT770s and the <i>old</i> Sony Gold headsets. I had to return the Sony Platinum headset for being too small, because they chose to shrink it slightly for wider compatibility and I no longer fit their line.<p>The most likely (90%) cause of having to give up and return AirPods Pro Max will be if they can&#x27;t fit over my annoying skull. Second most likely (10%), they end up weighing too much. We&#x27;ll see!')
