Item(by='AstroJetson', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603111755, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24823725, text='I have 19 Ivar units, with about 4 - 6 shelves each that have lasted for years (15 in a prior location, 6 here).  They are in good shape, show no sign of bowing &#x2F; slumping.  They are made from recycled wood that has been glued to make the uprights and shelves. If you are willing to &quot;toss the pile&quot; you can find shelves that are free of major knots and will look nice.<p>My workbench is a drop leaf table (only drops on one end h that was designed for a kitchen table.  Solid as a rock and solid pine.<p>My only regret is not buying more of the wide drawers that were available in the early 2000&#x27;.  It&#x27;s hard to find ones that fit exactly in the Ivar units.')
