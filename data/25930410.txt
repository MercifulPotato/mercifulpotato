As the USA, Germany has a strong federal constitution which allows the states some lee-way. Furthermore the German Constitutional Court has ruled crosses in schools must be removed if parents object, a ruling that was partially overruled by the ECHR.<p>That&#x27;s true in theory, but the Supreme Court has taken upon itself to impose uniform standards for the whole nation. As I recall, the German Constitutional Court upheld the practice in general, reasoning that it was an expression of Germany&#x27;s heritage as a Christian nation. It then balanced that principle against the potential burden on religious minorities, to fashion that compromise.<p>In the United States, we&#x27;re not allowed to acknowledge the country&#x27;s heritage as a Christian country. More important, there is generally <i>no balancing</i> between the cultural expression of the majority and the interests of the minority. That&#x27;s a huge difference between American and German constitutional law. In German constitutional law, there is a strong balancing of minority rights against the effect of certain things on the majority. In American constitutional law, almost zero weight is given to how recognizing a minority right (such as the right to be free from feeling excluded by seeing a cross in a school house) might affect the cultural expression oof the majority.<p>&gt; Second, Merkel&#x27;s remarks were rather specific to a form of living together without an overarching attempt at having and enforcing core values. She did not reject other cultures or beliefs. I doubt her position would be controversial in a country with the &quot;e pluribus unum&quot; as part of the brand identity, but I can&#x27;t really say as I don&#x27;t know the USA too well.<p>Merkel appears to be using the term according to its typical meaning. &quot;Multiculturalism&quot; means you have a country with people of different cultures living together, without an attempt to impose unifying core values. And rejecting multiculturalism in that sense is controversial. Mike Pompeo, the Secretary of State, was attacked as a racist recently for saying the same thing. He didn&#x27;t &quot;reject other cultures or belies.&quot; As far as I can tell, he and other American conservatives use the phrase to mean exactly the same thing as Merkel does.<p>&gt;  In Germany, due to our voting system, the conservative party is as much a coalition as the Democrats in the USA while the left is more splintered.<p>It&#x27;s not just the voting system, it&#x27;s the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court has allowed social liberals to impose policies without any coalition building, and even without building public consensus. On abortion, for example, no state is allowed to make abortion illegal before viability (20-24 weeks). This is enormously unpopular in the US (under 30% support). And presumably it&#x27;s unpopular in Germany, where there is a 12-week limit absent special circumstances.<p>I&#x27;m just trying to paint for you a picture of why conservatives in the U.S. might be frustrated, by reference to how things are in Germany. Keep in mind, though, that Americans are much more conservative than Germans to begin with! Less than 10% of Germans pray daily. For Americans, it&#x27;s 50%, similar to Turkey!<p>Germany obviously makes political concessions to Christians and social conservatives. There is (opt-out) religious education in schools, abortion is limited mainly to the first trimester, and there are things like waiting periods and counseling.<p>This is a really important point I&#x27;d appreciate your giving serious consideration to: How would CDU members feel, today, if the German Constitutional Court suddenly decided there could be no religious education in schools, that abortion had to be legal to 24 weeks, etc? How do you think people in Germany would have reacted to those things had they happened in the 1950s-1970s, like happened here?<p>Take it a step further. The year after <i>Obergefell</i> legalized same-sex marriage in the US, the ECHR ruled there was no right to same-sex marriage in the European Convention on Human Rights. How do you think CDU members would have taken having the ECHR impose that on Germany? How do you think Poland or Italy would have taken that? As I recall, by the time Germany legalized same-sex marriage in 2017, 80% of Germans already supported it. How do you think Germans would have felt had the EHCR legalized same-sex marriage in Germany back in the 2000s when under 50% of people supported it? (I think Americans are probably 10 years behind Germany on that issue.)<p>Heck, Angela Merkel voted against same-sex marriage in Germany after Trump ran on accepting it a year earlier. In the US that vote would have caused the press to go completely apoplectic.')
