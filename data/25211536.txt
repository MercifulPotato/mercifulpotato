The trophic level of animals in the food chain necessitates that they will eat more calories of plant matter than would provide calories of food upon being eaten.<p>Secondly, you should look at the sorts of plants being consumed and where they fall in the plant&#x27;s life cycle.  Fruits and nuts have been evolved to be eaten by animals. Staple crops such as grains and pulses are generally harvested from plants that have already lived to maturity and died off.  Really it&#x27;s only fresh greens and tubers that require the damage or destruction of a living plant.<p>Lastly, it&#x27;s important to recognize the evolutionary purpose of sensing pain and suffering from it. Animals use pain and suffering to detect harmful situations and learn how to avoid them in the future. This process consists of sensations, memory and adaptive behavior. Plants may have &quot;reflexive&quot; responses to stimulus, but these responses aren&#x27;t adaptive and aren&#x27;t affected by previous experience (mostly... there are some exceptions).  There would be no evolutionary purpose for plants to develop a sense of suffering if they have no practical use for that sensation.')
