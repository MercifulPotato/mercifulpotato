They mentioned something to the effect  that Elastic was being greedy with open-source software.<p>I am an early contributor to Elasticsearch. I probably have more commits to the core product than most employees. It is now incredibly difficult for a non-employee to have any PR looked at unless it is a bug. I stopped contributing after their last &quot;we are open&quot; debacle but did have one outstanding feature PR open. Over two years later, still not  merged. You will have others commenting that they would like the feature, but Elastic sits on it. Not blaming them, but at this point, it really is being driven by them. I give up trying to contribute.')
