Student unions for example, tend to take positions that are wildly inconsistent with what the average student would want, but voter participation is low, the system is opaque, and many students don&#x27;t pay any attention and are just resigned to the system. I don&#x27;t know what the answer is, but it&#x27;s probably not a union.')
