I then put it under my very big mattress. I will never spend a single one of those dollars. Has this quintillion dollar print changed the value of the dollars that are actually changing hands? It has not.<p>Obviously that&#x27;s a contrived example but it does demonstrate the principal. If economic environmental factors are causing people to spend less money, such as unemployment or a global pandemic, then the velocity of money goes down. This in turn causes merchants to lower prices to incentivize spend. This is how deflation materializes. If they cannot lower prices fast enough to actually incentivize a consistent level of spending you enter a deflationary spiral.<p>Printing new money offsets the reduction in velocity, and staves off a deflationary spiral. It doesn&#x27;t however guarantee a commensurate level of inflation.<p>You can see this on a macro scale. Since the 1970s the M2 money supply has increased 15X however inflation has only increased 7X.<p>Because the Fed, like most central banks, exercises a positive control mechanism, once velocity is restored, printing will slow or even go negative to ensure a consistent, predictable level of inflation.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.investopedia.com&#x2F;ask&#x2F;answers&#x2F;042015&#x2F;how-does-money-supply-affect-inflation.asp" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.investopedia.com&#x2F;ask&#x2F;answers&#x2F;042015&#x2F;how-does-mon...</a>')
