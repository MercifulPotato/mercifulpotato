If this trend continues we may see an energy revolution take place in the next 10-20 years. Data center costs will dive down, more places will become livable with always on AC&#x2F;heating. Even inefficient energy storage becomes viable with low enough prices (if solar is 70% cheaper than gas, then it can still compete with gas at night if the energy storage is more than 30% efficient or so, when in reality storage is close to 70-80% efficient). Humanity as a whole might even make it to a Type 1 Civilization with our increased usage. Carbon capturing even becomes a viable solution to climate change.<p>Just as rapidly changing CPU and internet speeds changed the world over the past few decades, so too will an energy revolution. I look forward to this new world and how we can use the innovations to solve todays problems.')
