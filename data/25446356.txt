They provide a cheap alternative to touch phones, are usually more robust, and allowing them to run web apps instead of MIDP stuff is a giant opportunity for any web actor.<p>Ditching Rust as a core component of the future of Firefox is also a demonstration that Mozilla isn&#x27;t a tech focused corp anymore. Rust is going to yield a lot of result when it comes to security, memory saftely and maintainability and firing Rust devs was terribly short sighted.<p>So yes Firefox was always enough. Leadership at Mozilla doesn&#x27;t get it.')
