Sure, you have to have your game in hyperbolic space, but you can have accurate movement in 8 directions. Your players will just have to deal with parallel lines diverging, there being unique things like pseudocycles, horocycles, circles with a circumference that grows exponentially with increasing radius, etc. Sadly such geometry isn&#x27;t supported by any tabletop software I&#x27;m familiar with, and crocheting a game board of sufficient size takes a very long time.')
