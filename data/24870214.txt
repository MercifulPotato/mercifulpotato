In the past, if you wanted to do something &quot;cool looking&quot; on the web, you&#x27;d describe to Google something you saw and invariably land on some Photoshop tutorial.  It doesn&#x27;t translate to other things easily.  So to switch to something like GIMP, you have to not only learn the interface, but learn how to translate all of the useful help &quot;in the wild&quot; from Photoshop to GIMP.<p>I remember when I sat down to try to learn paths and such in Photoshop, thinking, &quot;Is this really the best they could come up with?&quot;  But, yeah, it was ... when they came up with it and everyone learned how to use it.  A switch would eliminate the moat that the product has.<p>And that&#x27;s what&#x27;s been chipped away at, in general.  I haven&#x27;t had <i>any</i> need of Photoshop for web dev work in a <i>long</i> time.  My image processing needs rarely go beyond the command-line, these days, because many other things we relied on PS for are described in css or are vectors rather than image files.')
