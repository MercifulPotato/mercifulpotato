Concerted effort at Federal and State levels. We do it for Defense but not for other sectors.<p>2) would look reasonably achievable but somehow the Fed has missed its inflationary targets for the few years, so I&#x27;m a little skeptical about the chances. Also if you look at the dollar&#x27;s relative price over the last 30 years it broadly approximates a sine wave that we&#x27;re on the upwards slope of (past performance yada yada etc)')
