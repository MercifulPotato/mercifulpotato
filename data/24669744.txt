I had an iPhone 4S mixed in there for ~6mo when I broke my android and a friend let me have their old iPhone.<p>Now I&#x27;m on the new iPhone SE, entirely because I lost trust in Google. I had been worried about Google for a while, but it all kicked off when a new job last year gave me a MacBook, and I realized that Apple things weren&#x27;t actually as bad as I thought they were. The laptop was a little more expensive than a comparable linux laptop, but I liked a lot of things about it too.<p>Ended up cutting out Google entirely, and couldn&#x27;t be happier. Definitely makes me excited to talk about how I <i>took back my privacy</i>, even though it&#x27;s still a bit weird paying the &quot;actual cost&quot; of web services rather than getting them for &quot;free&quot;.')
