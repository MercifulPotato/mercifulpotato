It is certainly a public nuisance, but it is not uncommon to hear a car alarm going off in the middle of the night in most American Cities.<p>It does seem like a piece of security theater that gets put on by the dealer to make people feel safe about making a large purchase. I don’t think they really do much for safety.\nIn San Francisco (my home) we have a ludicrously high incidence of people joy-bashing car windows. The car alarms just make it more annoying for everyone else. A few weeks ago I saw someone stealing a car while the alarm was going off. The alarm didn’t stop them, but at least it made it easy to report them to the police.')
