Xbox itself was on the brink of being shut down&#x2F;sold off a few years ago. What exactly did Google (and Amazon&#x2F;Apple&#x2F;Facebook) expect would happen?<p>Focusing on Stadia&#x27;s strength as a platform seems to be a good move forward. It is a technically sound service. I&#x27;m sure the massive bump it got from Cyberpunk showed execs that a partnership-only gaming model could be successful. They do need to expand licensing, improve their subscription catalog and get more indie studios involved. Relying on users to consistently pay $60+ for games on top of the monthly fees is a losing business model.')
