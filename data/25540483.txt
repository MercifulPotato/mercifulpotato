I think my post was a little misunderstood - it wasn&#x27;t my intent to draw an equivalence. I was using the mass incarceration point as an example of how wolf warrior diplomats and the media in China disingenuously try to move the conversation away from injustices happening under the CCP.<p>A sibling comment to yours raised Assange. That&#x27;s another unfair comparison, when in 2020 alone over 100 journalists have been disappeared or detained in China. Assange has just been indicted and failed to appear in court.<p>My point was that in order to have a constructive conversation, it might be better to acknowledge and compare the facts, rather than jumping in with emotional language in the vein of (paraphrased) &quot;no matter how bad it is in the west, nothing can hold a candle to China&quot;.')
