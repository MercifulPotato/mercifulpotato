The ISA was created in 1999, but the first widely used 64-bit OS (vista) didn&#x27;t release until 7 years later. In truth, I doubt 64-bit systems became more than half of all systems until a couple years after the release of Window 7 in 2009 (a full decade later).<p>Every transistor used for x86_64 that couldn&#x27;t also be used for x86 was a competitive liability (increasing size, power, R&amp;D, etc without any real payoff). I think their decisions make a lot of sense given all the constraints.')
