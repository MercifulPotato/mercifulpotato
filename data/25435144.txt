I don&#x27;t think this is the common case. I believe, the common case is that most engineering jobs are dull and boring and are not breaking new ground. Tirelessly testing software, or polishing UI or to take my workplace (vaccine r&amp;d) performing the same set of tests&#x2F;experiments&#x2F;assays&#x2F;etc over and over again. I&#x27;d go far as to say that you have to be self-motivated to be successful in most jobs. There is a limit to which management can coddle you.')
