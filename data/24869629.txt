General relativity is useful for GPS. Superconductivity is useful for NMR that actually sometimes saves children from cancer. Neither of the applications were clear at the discovery time.<p>(My favorite was Magnetoresistance. You start to explain it as a weird quantum boring effect of the spin of electrons in magnetic conductors, and when the other person is convinced that it totally unuseful you explain that it is used in hard disks. SSD are killing the fun.)')
