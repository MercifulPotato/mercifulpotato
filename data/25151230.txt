The new M1 chips are Apple&#x27;s first foray into developing their own silicon for computers, these are not the laptops specialized users want.<p>BUT the new Air can compile Rust in half the time as the 16&quot; MBP, Tensorflow it many times faster, 1.5 hours of web browsing and YouTube depleted only 4% battery. And that&#x27;s just less than a week of testing. This is the biggest proof yet that Apple&#x27;s approach to hardware+software was always the right one for them.<p>Now, I do disagree with the increasing control they exert, how they prevent you from upgrading directly or installing other OSes. I hope they start to care more about developers and tinkerers in the future.<p>I&#x27;ve always loved Windows and Linux, and I&#x27;ve gone back to it after trying a MacBook, but I can&#x27;t deny what they have achieved with the M1 has given me second though about using an MBP as my main computer in the future.')
