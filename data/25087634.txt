Years ago, I was on an email list and I did a lot of sincere public apologizing, in part because the internet was younger, so we didn&#x27;t have a lot of stuff worked out. We were just stumbling our way forward as best we could.<p>And the end result was that I became everyone&#x27;s bitch. People would intentionally pick on me and be ugly to me and when it went sideways, the group as a whole would go &quot;There she goes again!&quot; and blame the whole thing on me and expect me to apologize and kiss everyone&#x27;s ass.<p>I am much less free with public apologies than I used to be, though I am still equally willing to own my actions (a la &quot;I did x. That didn&#x27;t turn out well.&quot;)<p>There are some people in the world just looking for someone to blame and if they get it stuck in their warped tiny little minds for some reason that you are a good person to blame, good luck escaping their shit. Such people are a case of &quot;The only winning move is not to play.&quot; and, unfortunately, you tend to find that out after the fact because they have burned you and will not stop burning you, no matter how above-board, high-minded blah blah blah you handle the situation.<p>Some people are just hell-bent on proving &quot;No one is actually that good&quot; because they have baggage, so trying to do the right thing consistently just makes you a target of their shit and they really need therapy, but aren&#x27;t getting it.<p>Such people seem to be rather poor at letting things go and my impression is some of them will cyberstalk you for years after you try to leave whatever situation originally put you in contact with them.<p>(Edit: No, this wasn&#x27;t about my gender.
