There are still several heavily blue states that have a lot of votes left to count.<p>California, for example, has only counted 77% of their votes. New York has counted 84%. Illinois has counted 89%.<p>I just caught the end of some discussion of this on NPR. Based on the number of votes left to count in the various states and how they are expected to turn out, there is a good chance it will end up at around 8 million.<p>Also, it probably makes more sense to look at it out of the number of voters, or the number of people who could have voted, rather than out of the whole population.')
