And both sides may use laws to their convenience to keep being assholes.<p>I have a neighbour in my village (and I mean, really &#x27;in&#x27;) who has several cocks, and he also has peacocks! The first ones start around 2 AM, the other ones basically never stop. I leave 300 yards away and I hear everything through the double window, every night. Oh, as I said peacocks, you probably thought &quot;that neighbour must have a large property, a real park&quot;. Yeah, no, he has a standard detached house with its small piece of land, and the hens, the cocks, the peacocks spend their time on neighbours properties: a few remaining meadows (nobody really minds) and, what is more trouble, the gardens (they ate all my cabbages one year in a garden I have even farther from their place).<p>Also, sometimes people complain against traditional things, but they often complain about &#x27;industrial&#x27; size farms. Farming has changed a lot in France in 30 years (even though it still operates at much smaller scale than in countries like the USA, the sizes and modes of exploitation have dramatically changed).\nSo people often complain about a massive pig farm, a massive poultry farm with several thousands chickens, and so on.<p>In my village (coming back a bit earlier in time), people used to have 1 to 4 cows in a tiny stable, and would take them to the meadows. Now the few remaining so-called agricultors have a hundred cows in a hangar (often all year long). Actually they don&#x27;t have a hundred cows: they have 99 cows, because starting with the 100th, the extra cows are no more subsidised...')
