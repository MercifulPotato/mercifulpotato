The actual reasoning, which Yarvin himself has explained, is to unify the underlying data values between booleans and c-style return codes. In C and unix, the convention is that 0 indicates program success and any other value indicates some kind of program failure. It&#x27;s strange for the fundamental success code to be false when cast as a boolean, so it makes sense to either change the success codes or change the booleans. Changing the success codes would actually be pretty incoherent - what would you do, 0 and &gt;1 values are failure and 1 is success? - so it makes more sense to change the booleans if something is going to change<p>Not saying I agree it&#x27;s worth the trouble. Even Yarvin agrees it wasn&#x27;t worth the trouble. But he didn&#x27;t just pull this idea out of nowhere')
