Baby came at 8 weeks before. Pure luck. Have your setup ready ideally \nearly, you really never know.<p>The concept of a go bag for the hospital also was very important and would have saved four or five family trips to our place.<p>Get the most expensive peri bottles you can, not the hospital ones.<p>More people than you think faint during the birth, if you&#x27;re sensitive, prepare to fight your parasympathetic system. Do the breathing exercises regardless of your role!<p>I was completely outside time and space for two weeks, very tired for four months and it took 18 months to feel as sharp as I did pre birth and I was the support system not the main character :)<p>Get a really long phone charger for the hospital, naturally the plugs around the bed are used by machines but not the far away ones. Naturally they don&#x27;t have them on site so bring your own.')
