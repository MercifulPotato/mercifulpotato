You can read their defunct websites at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;semireg.com&#x2F;mass&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;semireg.com&#x2F;mass&#x2F;</a> and <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;semireg.com&#x2F;labelscope&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;semireg.com&#x2F;labelscope&#x2F;</a><p>Both worked in novel ways. MASS “floated” the current weight above all apps and when double-clicked would insert the current weight at the focused cursor point via keyboard accessibility APIs.<p>LabelScope printed to label printers but wasn’t a design app or a driver. Instead, like MASS it floated above other apps as a “scope” which would real-time capture and dither the image inside the virtual label. Double-click would send the dithered image directly to the printer using the printer’s native commands via USB (no driver).<p>Fast forward a few years and I started on ANOTHER label printer app based on Electron. I’m happy to report it’s a healthy business and growing! Learn more at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;label.live" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;label.live</a>')
