Item(by='gillesjacobs', descendants=None, kids=[25688051, 25686804], score=None, time=1610116315, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25684596, text='&gt; But who is selling their (temporarily) valuable bitcoin for worthless tether instead of USD?<p>You&#x27;re asking what the utility of stablecoins is:\nStablecoins are widely used as a legislatively advantageous on- and off-ramp for the whole crypto market.<p>Off-ramp: If people want to sell BTC or other volatile tokens because they want to realize profits, the obvious thing would be to sell for fiat (USD&#x2F;EUR). But due to taxation and legislation this is often difficult. Stablecoins like Tether provide the utility of a low-volatility currency that fiat would fill. Main advantage is bypassing legislation.<p>This use is so common there is jargon for &quot;Tethering up&quot;.<p>There also exist many debit cards that allow paying with stablecoins, increasing utility. The rise of DeFi and money markets for stablecoins also provides a good return on stablecoins while in theory being low-volatility.<p>On-ramp: If people want to buy a certain token they first go into Tether. This is usually for bypassing local legislation limiting the buying of a specific token or use of exchanges. This use is less common, I would wager.<p>Of course, for any of this to be actually useful Tether has to remain the same price. If Tether starts to deviate significantly from the 1USD peg, a liquidity crisis cuold be triggered.<p>Personally, I haven&#x27;t trusted Tether since the first BitFinex scandals and avoid it like the plague. For my stablecoin needs, I use something that is audited and over-collateralized like DAIv2.')
