As of right now, in virtually any network I connect to, it&#x27;s relatively easy for me to go to pornhub.com, and even if you ban outright porn sites, websites like YouTube and Netflix allow for much more cursing and violence than what the FCC currently allows on network television.<p>I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m misunderstanding something, and I&#x27;m not a lawyer, so maybe someone with more training on this kind of compliance can explain my problems.<p>EDIT: Just to avoid downvotes that are unnecessary, I should make it clear, I don&#x27;t <i>support</i> the FCC making these regulations, and think these tasks should fall onto the parents.  I&#x27;m just saying what the current rationale is, or at least my understanding of it.')
