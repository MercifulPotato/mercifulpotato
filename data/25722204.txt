The &quot;approachability&quot; was a double edged sword.<p>One problem I fought was that a lot of people expected handholding from me, or wanted me in their meeting to &quot;feel important.&quot; There really is value to having your manager act as a gatekeeper.<p>Another problem I had was that less ambitious people in other departments (support, qa,) would throw their work over the wall to me. I eventually had to get involved with triage to train the other managers to push back on this.')
