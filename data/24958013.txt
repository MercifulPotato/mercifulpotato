It&#x27;s technically possible for a reader to technically understand what the program is doing<p>This is already well beyond what&#x27;s possible for a dead language. It&#x27;s not even possible for living languages, although in that case we can draw empiric conclusions.<p>I&#x27;ve been interested for a long time in the question of how we can determine how a language divides up the space of possible sounds. For example, English [θ] (the sound at the beginning of &quot;thick&quot;) is perceived by Mandarin speakers as being the sound [s] (as in &quot;sick&quot;). It is perceived by Cantonese speakers as being [f] (as in &quot;fickle&quot;).<p>The sounds [s] and [f] are both phonemic in both Mandarin and Cantonese. But something about the phonology of each pushes the sound [θ] into one category or the other. The choice is not arbitrary; it is quite consistent across speakers of each language.<p>To the best of my knowledge, we have no way to answer the question &quot;how would language X categorize sound Y?&quot; other than experimentation, which is impossible with a dead language. But it is a fact about the language, and in principle the question can be answered solely by looking at the pronunciation of sounds within the language -- in the ordinary course of events, a Chinese speaker would go their entire life without being exposed to the sound [θ], and yet they would largely agree with each other on what the sound was if they did hear it.<p>I say that this categorization question draws upon rules of pronunciation which we don&#x27;t presently have a good idea of how to describe or characterize at all.<p>So I say reenactment of a dead language is an interesting project, but you&#x27;re inevitably going to make choices that are wildly different from the language as it existed in the past. Pronunciation reconstruction is on much firmer ground -- and it gets there by <i>not addressing</i> most questions. But a reenactment cannot avoid addressing every possibility, and it&#x27;s going to get most of them wrong.')
