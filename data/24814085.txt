It doesn&#x27;t have to be an admin nightmare, in other words. I assume the money reported on the credit report would get reversed or marked as paid if the loan is cancelled.<p>That said, my experience is with an all-cash&#x2F;no-financing face-to-face purchase of a used car much cheaper than any Tesla, following a test drive and inspections both by the dealer and an independent inspector I chose, so mine was not all that similar of a situation.')
