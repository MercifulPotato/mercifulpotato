My biggest feedback was to ensure you&#x27;re communicating with your client and telling them <i>why</i> you make these types of decisions and point out some of the tradeoffs and later costs they might accrue.<p>1. Using some sort of typed JavaScript via Typescript or Flow makes for much more resilient and stable code. Particularly if you&#x27;re developing re-usable APIs. You&#x27;re doing the right thing with automated tests but missing an opportunity by avoiding a type system. We had a much fewer runtime issues once switching to a type system.<p>2. The above sort of necessitates a transpiler.<p>3. With respect to using your own code, most freelancers (I assume) are delivering code to third party teams to later maintain.  Using common, shared libraries is a benefit for later developers, so this rule should be tempered with later benefits.')
