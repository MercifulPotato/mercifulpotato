Apple wants <i>control</i> over their entire stack, and sure, that relates to their business as a whole, but if this was <i>solely</i> about profit maximization surely there would be better strategies.<p>&gt; it&#x27;s still an investment not directly tied to product<p>I&#x27;m not sure I follow your reasoning here. Are you arguing it&#x27;s not a direct investment because the CPUs aren&#x27;t products in and of themselves, but rather components for other products? If so, I don&#x27;t agree -- Apple&#x27;s investment in, say, case tooling&#x2F;manufacturing processes and equipment exclusive to their products is surely an investment directly tied to those products, right? The CPUs are likewise components exclusive to Apple products. That seems to me to be a pretty direct investment.')
