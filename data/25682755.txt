But might supporting ECH be completely infeasible?<p>So for those unfamiliar, sniproxy is able to forward traffic to virtual hosts with their own encryption keys, by dispatching the connection based on the SNI of the handshake. After determining the correct vhost it initiates its own handshake with the destination and then hands the connection over to the original client, so the host running sniproxy does not need access to any keys or certificates.')
