AWS if I need ephemeral boxes (I used to be an enterprise on-prem AWS consultant), but I run most everything on a home 96 EPYC core, 512 GB, SSD, HDD (ZFS) box running KVM, Docker, and open vswitch. It just isn&#x27;t worth it to rent slow, expensive servers when I need lots of them and to be fast. I don&#x27;t have any problems remoting into them with ddns and wireguard.')
