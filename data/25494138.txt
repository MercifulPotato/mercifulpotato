I would challenge the idea that Apple is doing something wrong in this given what I now about most of the supply chains producing goods in the advanced economies - everyone down to the consumer buys from the cheapest supplier. Apple is not fundamentally responsible for the labour relations of other companies, and this is a practice that literally everyone I know has engaged in to some degree. &quot;Sweatshop labour&quot; producing clothes isn&#x27;t very concealing as euphemisms go. It is far more worrying that Apple does business in China period than that Apple has dodgy subcontractor arrangements in India. India is a democracy, they&#x27;ll sort this stuff out in time.<p>There is also no need to express outrage on this one. Promising to pay one amount and then not paying it is an unpardonable sin in pretty much every value system anyone cares to name. Comparisons to slavery, however, are missing the point. This is fraud. Assuming an accurate article this is one of the few times that smashing someone else&#x27;s stuff is justified.')
