Projects like VA-API try to put a nice frontend onto them so applications don&#x27;t have to care about the hardware, but ultimately that just means twice the work needs to be done to add support for new hardware, and to maintain existing hardware.<p>If kernel developers writing drivers for hardware video acceleration were to build to a standard set of kernel interfaces, then userspace would just have one interface to work with, simplifying things and reducing overall effort.')
