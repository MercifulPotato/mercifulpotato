We do a lot to validate integrity of packages (including checking in vetted archives to our repo), but it’s hard. Our images are ballooned to like 500-600MB (we’ve hit past the GB mark because of certain packages messing up dependencies before) based on a pretty conservative list of dependencies because of node_modules. I’m constantly fighting a battle against image size increases. The sheer amount of files in node_modules ensures that io is always a problem for image size and build speed on CI.<p>Solutions like yarn berry hardly help: zipfs and patched tsservers is annoying in many editors still. Often packages break because package maintainers include implicit dependencies or the packages their packages depend on do so. Arc has frozen emacs for me several times when jumping to definition in a zip.<p>I’m just so over the package situation for node.')
