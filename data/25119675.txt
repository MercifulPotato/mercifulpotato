Item(by='roca', descendants=None, kids=[25119734], score=None, time=1605579987, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25119165, text='&gt; What they mean is ‘Sweden didn’t have a legally mandated set of restrictions’.<p>True for some people, not for others. I have talked to many people who have repeated &quot;Sweden didn&#x27;t have a lockdown&quot; and think that means Swedes didn&#x27;t change their behaviour significantly. They are surprised, even disbelieving, when I point out the quite significant restrictions most Swedes have complied with. These people were misled by news reports using the term &quot;lockdown&quot; the way you do.<p>Whether or not defining the term &quot;lockdown&quot; differently is the solution, there needs to be some improvement in the way we write about this.')
