They&#x27;d convert any space they could into rooms and house as many people as they could. That&#x27;s not a situation that&#x27;d be allowed under rental agreements or housing laws but is totally fine as long as you own the house you&#x27;re living in. Not to mention the nightmare of communicating with your landlord every single time someone moved in or out.<p>Similar for me: Before I got into tech, I bought a house on a fast food salary w&#x2F; a lot of help from housing programs. 15k of my 65k mortgage was subsidized! This allowed me to jump from a $650&#x2F;month 2 bedroom apartment to a $550&#x2F;month mortgage and house 4 children. An equivalent apartment would&#x27;ve eaten my meager salary alive and would have been untenable. Anything equivalent to the apartment I had would&#x27;ve not been allowed legally')
