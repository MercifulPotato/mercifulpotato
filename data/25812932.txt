The joke was that we exercised it several times a year -- in winter, when the big snow storms hit and everyone worked from home.<p>In February 2020 I pointed out that we had not had a single mass work-from-home emergency, so shouldn&#x27;t we hold the exercise? I convinced enough execs that we held a two-day test, on the basis that nearly anything can be postponed one day in order not to do it from home, but perhaps not two. We solved a bunch of issues... and then we left the office in mid-March and haven&#x27;t been back en-masse since.')
