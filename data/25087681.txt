Maybe even as nice as the community over on arduino. The biggest problem with Broadcom on the Pi is the videocore block, and if you never run the video (using it for IoT), you avoid the biggest black hole on the device.<p>As far as the ARM license goes, very few people are ever going to spin their own hardware, and at least the ARM programming API&#x2F;ISA is very well documented. We&#x27;ll see if that continues under NVidia.<p>Certainly MOS, ST, National, Zilog, Motorola, INtel, IBM, Dec, (etc etc) CPU were always closed source. That did not prevent anyone from learning about computer systems and programming then, and it won&#x27;t stop them now.<p>That said, I doubt Apple will ever make the M1 available for purchase. Which is where this thread started.')
