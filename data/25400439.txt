I&#x27;ve raised my rate quite a bit but at this point I think I&#x27;m getting close to hitting a ceiling &#x2F; local maximum for &quot;generic React developer&quot;. I do put a lot of emphasis on solving challenging problems (so not just generic CRUD apps) and delivering real business value, and I&#x27;m not afraid to raise my rate, but I work through recruiters because I haven&#x27;t done a lot of highly visible work or blogging, and as such I don&#x27;t have a reputation of any kind to leverage.<p>I&#x27;m happy to blog and, following Patrick McKenzie&#x27;s and Thomas Ptacek&#x27;s advice, I don&#x27;t have a problem raising my rates. I think what&#x27;s holding me back is being unable to decide on a field &#x2F; niche to really own. My current specialty is design systems, and I&#x27;m getting to know then pretty well, but I&#x27;m not sure how translate that skillset into charging more than a React developer without a specialty might.<p>I&#x27;m considering changing niches and going back-end, or maybe full-stack. Or perhaps going into IoT, sys-ops, or even lower-level. I&#x27;m really open to anything: what&#x27;s important to me is finding an interesting problem that I can also charge more solving than I am now. Are these things mutually exclusive?<p>I&#x27;m hesitant to throw away the career capital that I&#x27;ve developed over the last six years, but it&#x27;s important to me that I continue to charge more for my work and eventually move away from hourly billing and into project-based, daily, or weekly rates. I can&#x27;t do that with my current strategy.<p>I also know that I have no interest and going the managerial route, because I love coding, not managing coders.<p>How can I find better, higher-paying, more interesting work while remaining an individual contributor?')
