It&#x27;s very much alive and kicking, with subforums for every interest: cooking; comics and video games; cars; art, movies, and literature; music creation and consumption; DIY crafts like woodworking, knitting, and metallurgy; the list goes on and on. It is excellently moderated, and the paywall goes a long way to keeping out the crap that floods every other Internet community, and provides a revenue stream that doesn&#x27;t involve abusing its users. Yes, there are some regrettable things in the site&#x27;s long history, and no community populated by humans is perfect, but these days it is probably the most progressive and accepting large community on the Internet. I&#x27;ve been a daily poster there for over 14 years and I can&#x27;t imagine ever leaving it.')
