They have no interest in extracting money from the end user, instead the documentation is readily available. In comparison, Nvidia, for example, sells you a video card, then you have to pay them again for a license to do deep learning. Oracle requires the end user of Java to pay a license to use the JRE. The fear is that if Qualcomm or Nvidia buy ARM, they&#x27;re going to turn ARM into a similar business model where they try to nickel and dime the end user for everything.')
