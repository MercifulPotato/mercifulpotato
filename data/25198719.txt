If your model can&#x27;t beat it, then you need to develop a better one.<p>They can even be used as a place-holder model so you can develop your whole architecture surrounding it, while another teammate is iterating over more complex experiments.<p>You could also settle in for a moving average process as a first model in a time-series [2], because they are easy to implement and simple to reason about.<p>Never under-estimate the power of an &quot;average&quot;.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;scikit-learn.org&#x2F;stable&#x2F;modules&#x2F;generated&#x2F;sklearn.dummy.DummyRegressor.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;scikit-learn.org&#x2F;stable&#x2F;modules&#x2F;generated&#x2F;sklearn.du...</a> \n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Moving-average_model" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Moving-average_model</a>')
