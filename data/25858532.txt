This is a good example - have they done any robust analysis as to whether telling people the weather at their destination actually reduces anxiety? What percent of people didn’t have this information on their phone prior to boarding? And it is preposterous to state they save 10 minutes of loading time by lifting the armrests up - the vast majority of manipulating the armrests (that 2 or 3 seconds he refers to) happens in parallel. How much time did they actually save once they implemented? I bet far less than 10 minutes.')
