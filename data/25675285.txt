RISC-V made some design choices and some people like some of them and some people don&#x27;t like others, just like with anything else in the world.<p>Christopher Celio as part of his PhD did ISA comparison and found no way that RISC-V is systematically worse, in fact in many situations its better.<p>David A Patterson, Dave Ditzel and many other long time engineers in this space seem to really like it.<p>And btw, you could make a much longer The Good, The Bad, The Ugly list about ARM as well. By that definition no ISA is well designed.')
