Obviously, that&#x27;s not Twitter&#x27;s intention, but they want to make money, and viral misinformation seems to be an effective strategy for making money.<p>The reason I raise this issue is because the important characteristic of Twitter is that others can call out the misinformation quickly. It&#x27;s not perfect, of course, but it&#x27;s better than a newsletter, where it&#x27;s just a blob of misinformation with nobody able to call out the BS.')
