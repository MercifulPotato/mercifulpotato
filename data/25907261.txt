People in the latter camp, I believe, are somehow able to resist or discard their conditioning in order to use software in a more unbiased way. Or maybe theyâ€™re just slow learners. Either way, those people would make amazing members of a software testing team.<p>I think this is one of the big differences between junior and senior software developers. You can see juniors get very frustrated with bugs because the code they delivered was &#x27;working&#x27;. Seniors realize that software only works within well defined parameters - and it&#x27;s only a matter of time before you find another parameter that you did not define well enough beforehand.<p>I also think there&#x27;s a hierarchy of software implementations:<p>Working As Expected (by the user)<p>Working As Designed (by the designer&#x2F;lead)<p>Working As Intended (by the programmer)<p>Working As Implemented (by the programmer)<p>[this is somewhat tongue in cheek]')
