The UK Guardian and the German taz employ voluntary payments&#x2F;subscriptions with some success last I heard. US media seems to be pushing a lot more for subscriptions now (&quot;you got free 3 articles this month&quot;)<p>Creators on patreon and on OnlyFans (NSFW) seem to be making good money off of subscriptions, on a smaller scale (and if they sell a product that has some demand, of course).<p>Relatedly the greater independence of creators from advertising would in turn mean fewer ads, which in turn means potentially more competition for the available ad space again and thus potentially higher prices.')
