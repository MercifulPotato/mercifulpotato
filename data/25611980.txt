It&#x27;s not that I don&#x27;t trust my compiler (usually clang) to optimize it this way, it&#x27;s just that the level of variability <i>between</i> compilers makes me think I shouldn&#x27;t really rely on this behaving this way.<p>I wonder what the arch difference is between the clangs that do it and the ones that don&#x27;t, I don&#x27;t know much about arm and risc-v.')
