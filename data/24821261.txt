I feel like a lot of it is forced. The latest book I read was Gideon the Ninth, and I found myself doing that quite a bit. I am more interested in the story and interaction between characters. Of course a bit of setting is indisposible such as where, when, rules of the universe, tech, etc. but a lot of the minute details I find don&#x27;t matter.<p>If I were to write a novel, I would probably find it really mundane to flesh things out this way and perhaps GPT would be an ideal companion to fill in the details of the sketch while I focused on the main plot and interactions. Or maybe I would aim for readers who wouldn&#x27;t mind reading a novel without all the fluff.')
