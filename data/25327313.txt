I&#x27;ll also pop into emacs for comment formatting, macro-running, and the occasional column-based copy&#x2F;paste. Plus an auto-numbering function I wrote when I wore a younger man&#x27;s clothes. Plus a colorful highlight mode (which I wrote) + htmlize for sharing said highlights, also from my callow youth.<p>Other than that, yeah, 100% VS Code for typescript and regular VS + ReSharper for my regular life.<p>Oh, also, emacs for Haskell. And whatever other weird language.')
