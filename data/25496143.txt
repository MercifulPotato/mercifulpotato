You have no control over this AND as time progresses you get more and more diluted with new hires and rounds.</i><p>People are way too obsessed with dilution because it sounds so scary.  &quot;With the stroke of a pen they can create a billion more shares and your percentage goes from 5% to 0.01%&quot;<p>The reality is that all common shareholders have the same incentive to not dilute the outstanding shares.  That almost always includes the founders.  Outside of a money raise most of the people involved in the company are aligned in the desire to not dilute each other.<p>The major source of dilution is new fundraising and while it will effect your percentage of ownership it typically doesn&#x27;t affect the value of your stake because the dilution is part of post-money valuation.  So you might own 1% of a $10m company before the dilution and 0.5% of a $20m company after the dilution but the value of your holding didn&#x27;t change.<p>The things people should be worried about are all the shenanigans that happen around participating preferred multiples.  Or, the worst, 30-day exercise windows along with the tax treatment of options exercise&#x2F;AMT.  But since those are much more opaque concepts it&#x27;s way harder to get people riled up about it.<p>And if you have an unscrupulous CEO there&#x27;s basically nothing you can do to protect yourself as a worker.   But that&#x27;s way different from the normal dilution you get as part of raising money.')
