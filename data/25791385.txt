Found out hard way when detached VeryCrypt secure trunk and attached it day later on another machine. Started scratching my head what the heck. Upon checking, the file was not synced&#x2F;uploaded and that&#x27;s how I managed to discover their change.<p>Business-wise, it was a stuck forced update that made me drop them (pun intended). At some version it did not want to open anymore before update. Fine. The problem was that you could not download update; it was downloader you download and that downloader himself pick file over the internet to download. Problem is the folder and file name was always different causing my simplewall (best firewall I know for Windows 10) to block the file each single time. Before I had chance to fiddle with firewall settings - something I never like doing - I was already registered into lifetime 2TB offer with pCloud, including their &quot;Cyrpto&quot; package for $299 one-time. Never looked back. And also upload speeds I found much faster than DropBox. As of syncing... I think its decent enough. Never had problem. Although their local drive logic is tad different - you are mounting a remote drive which is not equally convenient like DropBox local folder, but at least pCloud does not check folder for changes non-stop.<p>Disclaimer: have nothing to do with pCloud as a company, just their happy client.')
