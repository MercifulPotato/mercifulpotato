It&#x27;s high-level enough that you have to learn something completely different than plain sockets (and have more stuff to debug when it breaks), while also being low-level enough that it can&#x27;t provide many of the features I&#x27;d expect out of a message-oriented middleware--  no message broker, no anonymous pub-sub, no reliable transport, etc. unless <i>you</i> go and build them yourself (which they provide documentation and patterns for, but they&#x27;re not things you get for free like you would with other frameworks).<p>&quot;Bag of tools&quot; is about right.  Where RabbitMQ&#x2F;AMQP or MQTT or DDS can, depending on exactly what I want to do, provide me an end-to-end solution where, with a bit of configuration and network management, throw in a message and expect it to go where I want it to, ZeroMQ hands me a pile of pieces with which I can, presumably, build a thing that will do the same thing.  That&#x27;s not something I&#x27;ve ever found that I need--  either one of the premade solutions fills my needs, or I go and write something myself and skip ZeroMQ.')
