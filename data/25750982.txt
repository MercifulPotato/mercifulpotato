Apple and Google (in the Parler context) are essentially publishers of a sort:  they publish apps.  I don&#x27;t see a meaningful difference between publishing tweets and applications.<p>However, the AWS activity seems troublesome.  Would it be OK if AWS pulled the plug on you if you criticized Bezos or consumerism or big tech in general?  The line between AWS and your public utility is not that far.  The line between AWS and &quot;net neutrality&quot; isn&#x27;t that far either.')
