My point was the situation is indeed dramatic (perhaps &quot;significant&quot; is a better phrase?) on its own, and they weren&#x27;t unfairly exaggerating it for clicks&#x2F;attention&#x2F;fearmongering&#x2F;whatever.<p>It makes sense that &#x27;absolute deaths&#x27; would rise as a function of absolute population size, but that&#x27;s why this data is important to pay attention to: if our death rate is climbing more than expected, there&#x27;s problems we should probably pay attention to.')
