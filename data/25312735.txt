There are organizations that help people navigate the mazes and paperwork, but it&#x27;s still too much friction.<p>In America, it&#x27;s both, but primarily economic. The levels of economic inequality in America is something I&#x27;d only seen in third world countries before. TBH I&#x27;m surprised at how low the corruption level in government jobs is given how dire peoples circumstances have become. It is much worse than in other first world countries, but not as bad as in places like Mexico or India. The higher the inequality, the more the proportion pushed towards mental illness in the homeless people living there. San Francisco was particularly bleak...<p>In Japan, it&#x27;s also primarily economic, but I suspect that&#x27;s mainly due to their tendency to hide mental illness away since it&#x27;s a source of shame.
