So since we have land, free-oxygen harvesters live there.  Then they turn around and eat anything close to the surface that could evolve into a land-equivalent.  But on an all-water planet, the putative bio-land makers would not have to compete with actual land-dwelling creatures because there wouldn&#x27;t be any.<p>[UPDATE] Just to be clear: there&#x27;s obviously no way to know whether this <i>would</i> happen.  I&#x27;m only arguing that it <i>could</i> happen, and so lack of land is not necessarily a show-stopper for industrial civilization to emerge.')
