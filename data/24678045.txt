A family living in this house would currently pay about $1,500 per year in taxes to the local government of which 10%, approximately $150, goes to maintenance of infrastructure [...] To maintain just the roads and drainage systems that have already been built, the family in that median house would need to have their taxes increase by $3,300 per year.<p>As best I can tell, the author was saying that Lafayette is spending only $150 &#x2F; ($3300 + $150) =~ 4% of what it needs to spend to maintain its roads and drainage systems. That seems implausible. I wonder whether he has made an odd assumption: &quot;currently, 10% of taxes go to maintenance of infrastructure; thus, if we increase taxes by $3,300, only 10% of the increase will go to maintenance of infrastructure.&quot; That odd reasoning might account for his &quot;need to have their taxes increase by $3,300 per year&quot; claim.')
