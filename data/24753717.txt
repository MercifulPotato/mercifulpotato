They are more often carried around, have GPS and more cameras.<p>They are MUCH more difficult to manage centrally (e.g. company-managed antivirus&#x2F;vpn&#x2F;firewall, locked-down software installation, secure boot...), or inspect or modify.<p>They are more often used to all sort of untrusted networks (cafe&#x27;, airport, hotel...)<p>Personal phones often have tons of untrusted apps with access to microphones.<p>&gt; Unless this is advice for state-level institutions discussing state secrets, this seems like completely useless advice<p>citation needed, especially after Snowden revelations')
