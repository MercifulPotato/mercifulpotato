Also, &quot;Communitarianism&quot; is a western (Christian) philosophy. It may have been borrowed from Confucianism? I&#x27;m not sure. A lot of religions and philosophies share these kinds of values, so it&#x27;s not unique to just one region &#x2F; culture, IMO.<p>Anyhow, neither is better or worse, and probably a balance between communitarianism and individualism is best. All cultures can learn from each other.')
