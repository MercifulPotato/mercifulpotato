She was a heroin addict. Every other year she&#x27;d have a baby, malnourished, underweight, in withdrawal, neglected taken away. 4 kids: 2 had adhd, 1 was developmentally delayed, 1 autistic, 1 had ADD, plus all were smaller and weaker than their comparative age peers.<p>After taking the forth one, they were too over stretched to take anymore.
