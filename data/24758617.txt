I wasn&#x27;t expecting so much comments!\nI would have chosen a less provocative title if I had known :)<p>Just to clarify: I founded a company a few years ago from a side project I had started three years before, and this year I released two projects, so I can say that I love side projects. I simply regret this tendency to start so many shallow side projects (which are little more than tutorials) just to build a portfolio instead of focusing on creating something really substantial, or something that at least you really like. It&#x27;s a waste and an illusion to think that it could help to be hired. I know too many developers stuck into this pipe dream.')
