My friends had experienced a few cases where they were never asked to return company equipment upon leaving, and that includes expensive laptops, phones, etc. E.g. the company was supposed to contact them to get it back, but never did.<p>If this equipment is then simply marked as &quot;stolen&quot; to write-off, and this situation is prevalent in tech companies, I could see it being a sizable chunk of the &quot;shoplifting&quot;.<p>P.S. I don&#x27;t claim literal shoplifting is not happening.')
