Item(by='__blockcipher__', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611268338, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25865322, text='No, you&#x27;ve got things reversed - as do most in this thread.<p>Elastic&#x27;s original announcement was disingenuous, they titled their blog post &quot;Doubling Down on Open&quot; when they were making Elasticsearch and Kibana no longer open source. Furthermore, Elastic promised in the past that ALL FUTURE VERSIONS of the open core of Elasticsearch would remind Apache 2.0. They broke that promise when they switched to proprietary licenses only with 7.1.1.<p>BTW, while the reasoning from Elastic is that they did it because of Amazon, the actual effect is just to make organizations like the one I work for (a non-profit that refuses to run proprietary software in prod) have to use one of these Apache 2.0 forks, while not stopping Amazon from operating their Elasticsearch service at all (since Amazon is always free to operate an Apache 2.0 service and indeed that&#x27;s the whole damn point of the license)')
