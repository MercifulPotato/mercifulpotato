People don&#x27;t understand the DNS terminology.  Very few people indeed get &quot;resolver&quot; right, for example, and they only then end up confusing the rather larger number of people who get it quite wrong.  Similarly, &quot;authoritative&quot; confuses people when they have to try to understand why it isn&#x27;t actually the same as an &quot;authoritative answer&quot;.  Whereas they do understand the idea of DNS records being content, that is published by content servers.<p>Hence why many years ago I took to explaining DNS using HTTP terminology.  It works quite well.')
