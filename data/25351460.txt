For one, switching back and forth between the light colored windows (most websites, word processor, all my scientific PDFs) and the dark ones (previously, terminal, some websites, etc) is so bothersome. But lately I&#x27;ve been finding dark theme too hard on my eyes as well, just in general.<p>So now pretty much everything is light theme, and it&#x27;s like I&#x27;m living in 2004 again.<p>Just gotta keep the lights on in the room when working, which is what I should have always done anyway.<p>I still love the dark themes on my phone and tablet. I use those more often in poorly-lit areas, so that makes more sense, I guess.')
