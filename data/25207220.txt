It&#x27;s more performant than JS and especially Python, the other 2 top 3 languages. And unlike Cxx&#x2F;Rust, you have the convenience of GC. And the new GC&#x27;s are VERY good.<p>It has a nice niche where it&#x27;s less chaotic than JS and has better threading support and uses less cpu&#x2F;ram than JS and python. But it&#x27;s still high level enough to not be inconvenient to work with. These traits make it a great fit for beefy back end machines at big companies.<p>Rust will always be targeted at low level work unless they add a GC. Even with lifetimes etc a GC is just way more convenient')
