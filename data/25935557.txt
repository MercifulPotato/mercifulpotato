They do it in jenkins, because a stack consists of multiple services, and they may want to choose which branch to deploy. It would be cumbersome to type a combination of branch names in chat.<p>However, if your UAT is a manual refresh with no branch names, for example, that seems perfectly reasonable (so long as it&#x27;s triggering a pipeline like you mentioned).<p>However if I worked where you worked and you wanted slack to deploy prod, I&#x27;d probably try to talk you out of it.')
