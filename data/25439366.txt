Item(by='StanislavPetrov', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608096032, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25438567, text='&gt;To make use of David Friedman&#x27;s observation about a similar remark, unfortunately this sentence remains true if you take out the last seven words.<p>I don&#x27;t disagree with that statement, but reasonable people can debate and disagree in a hypothetical fantasy world where central planners are thoughtful and competent.  This is why I find it more useful to address the situation in the actual world we live in, where stupid, incompetent and corrupt people like Chirlane McCray (wife of NYC Mayor Bill DeBlasio) are appointed to spend billions in taxpayer dollars to do the &quot;planning&quot;.<p>Unfortunately with this issue, as with every other, most people are more interested in ideology than reality.')
