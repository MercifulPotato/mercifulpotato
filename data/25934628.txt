This is relevant because government money is not scalable. If they grow revenues by 1000% and don&#x27;t improve efficiency, they will lose money. Ridiculous for a company with P&#x2F;E = 1700.<p>Energy generation and storage has a gross profit of -$30M. But &quot;they&#x27;re not just a car company&quot;.<p>Edit: Why the downvotes? Is it because this is a skeptical view that goes against the crowd?')
