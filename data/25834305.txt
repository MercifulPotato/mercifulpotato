If I&#x27;m a business that may be impacted due to the licensing change, it would seem my safest (legal) option would be to freeze on the last version with a friendly license and then transition to the Amazon fork, since it will probably stay under a more open license. While maybe not the smartest technical decision, from a business standpoint it seems like a reasonable insurance policy, at least until someone else tests the waters in court.<p>Amazon doesn&#x27;t have any interest in making their version closed because they want the money from hosting. Even if the product isn&#x27;t that great, it&#x27;s super easy if I&#x27;m already 100% in on AWS anyway (not necessarily reality, but it is an easy conversation to have and the service should be big enough to warrant investment from AWS).<p>I applaud the stand they are taking and it will be interesting to see how this plays out.')
