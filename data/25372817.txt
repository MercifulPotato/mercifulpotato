This has been done in many countries now.<p>The most obvious example is China, which essentially eradicated the virus months ago, but even European countries have had success with lockdowns. For example, take a look at the graph of new cases in France: [1]. Case numbers were growing exponentially in October. The French government implemented a lockdown on 30 October. About one week later, the number of new cases began to rapidly decline. A recent relaxation in the lockdown (beginning 1 December) has caused the decline to stop, and new case numbers are now approximately constant at 20% of peak level of a month ago.<p>For the US, an equivalent effect would be reducing new case numbers from 200k&#x2F;day now to 40k&#x2F;day in one month. The US could do this, and it would save hundreds of thousands of lives over the next few months.<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.worldometers.info&#x2F;coronavirus&#x2F;country&#x2F;france&#x2F;#graph-cases-daily" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.worldometers.info&#x2F;coronavirus&#x2F;country&#x2F;france&#x2F;#gr...</a>')
