Personally, I used the tactile function keys for exactly six things (brightness up&#x2F;down, volume up&#x2F;down, mute, play&#x2F;pause). Those six functions are now available on my touchbar. They&#x27;re no longer tactile, which, yes, is a minor inconvenience. I wouldn&#x27;t use a touchscreen for touch-typing code, of course. But for a handful of buttons way off the home row, it doesn&#x27;t affect me much.<p>In exchange, I get to add other buttons which can also display customizable state. Yes, zoom has a global shortcut to toggle the mic. The problem is, the mic state is not visible on your screen unless the zoom window is visible. This is a frustrating design flaw IMO, which really should be addressed in some consistent way across every phone&#x2F;video app. But, it&#x27;s not, and so I need to pay attention to my mic state. My touchbar button toggles the mic, and displays the current mic status. I would imagine that every phone&#x2F;video chat app is similar.')
