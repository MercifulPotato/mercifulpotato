Decrypting the root volume is fast, so I suspect I set this one up correctly. Once the root volume is decrypted, I have a separate key on the filesystem to re-decrypt &#x2F;boot so that it can be mounted without re-entering the &#x2F;boot passphrase. This part is also fast.<p>Something must have gone wonky with the boot passphrase. Either a crazy iteration count or a key slot that forces GRUB to not test it first.')
