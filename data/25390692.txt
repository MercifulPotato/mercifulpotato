The choice between using a packrat parser, LALR, or LL would be easier to explain to someone who has been exposed to those concepts and understands the advantages and disadvantages of each approach compared to someone who has never heard of the terms.<p>Best practices change with time, but knowing the base concepts and how to apply them will help people adapt.  If they&#x27;re only exposed to what&#x27;s considered relevant at this time, then they won&#x27;t have the necessary exposure to concepts that may pertain to future best practice.')
