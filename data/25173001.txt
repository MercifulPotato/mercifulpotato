The iteration time to build + copy + boot is about 10 minutes.  And the images are too large to easily distribute.<p>Packer [2] has some of these things, but it has to run on an actual EC2&#x2F;DigitalOcean VM to produce images for them.  That&#x27;s a lot of extra config, potential for cost overruns from failed VM shutdowns, more secrets to manage, and more ACLs to maintain.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Robertof&#x2F;nixos-docker-sd-image-builder" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Robertof&#x2F;nixos-docker-sd-image-builder</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.packer.io" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.packer.io</a>')
