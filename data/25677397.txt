The way to fix that is to create&#x2F;force dedicated turning lanes.  There is a plugin that lets you manage it.  It should be built in.  If you do not have the plugin sometimes you can fix it by changing the number of lanes on both sides of an interchange (what biffa calls lane mathematics).  Basically if you have 3 lanes merging into 3 you need a 6 lane on the other side.  If you have 6 and 3 dumping off you need 3 for both exits.  That does not fix 4 way intersections though and usually you need the plugins to fix that.')
