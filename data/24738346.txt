Aristotle argued that the actual infinite didn’t exist.&quot; the article shows that Archimedes dealt with both, mathematically. And both are accepted today in mathematics, although calculus deals with the potential infinite.<p>There is another type of infinity I&#x27;m looking to understand or find a mathematical name for. I recently read Spinoza&#x27;s <i>Ethica</i> (Ethics demonstrated in the style of geometric proofs) where he uses infinity axiomatically to refer to what might be called &quot;allness infinity&quot;. I don&#x27;t know another mathematical name for the concept, even though it is quite intuitive.')
