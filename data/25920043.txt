Item(by='jasonlaramburu', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611689143, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25919524, text='&gt;My point is that btc is being targeted as big bad meanwhile same people who demonize it for its environmental damage are perfectly fine with heavy industry causing global warming.<p>The difference is that with heavy industry, we sacrifice environmental quality in exchange for a product with known utility (gas to make our cars go, energy to light&#x2F;heat our homes, etc). While industrial products can function as a medium for speculation, and do make a few people very rich, they are still primarily produced for immediate consumption.<p>Bitcoin does not, per se, provide any utility to anyone other than speculation.')
