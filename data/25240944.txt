These days the ubiquitous Shimano Nexus hubs can shift under load. For the kind of bicycle most people buy they are a reasonable alternative because there isn&#x27;t a fragile derailer, there&#x27;s no double shifting, and the adjustment is static alignment of two yellow marks.<p>In terms of friction, there are no jockey wheels and the chainline can be perfectly straight. Anyway, the internal friction of a geared hub is going to be unnoticeable for an average cyclist because the tires will be under-inflated, the chain covered in crud, and the brakes will be rubbing on untrue wheels.<p>But like everything it&#x27;s a tradeoff.')
