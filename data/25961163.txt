Cable news is talking about GME and the White House press secretary was asked about it. I think you grossly underestimate how mainstream Robinhood and GME have gotten just this week. 100k people in a day leaving a review because they found out about the app and GME at the same time and tried to strike it rich but were blocked seems like an under-estimate to me.')
