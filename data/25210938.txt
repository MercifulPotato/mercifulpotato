If they never release a workstation-class Apple Silicon chip, that&#x27;ll likely mean that they&#x27;re still using Intel&#x2F;AMD chips internally, and so macOS will likely continue to be compiled for Intel indefinitely.<p>2. If they <i>do</i> design workstation-class Apple Silicon chips for internal use, they may as well also sell the resulting workstation-class machines to people at that point. (Or, to rearrange that statement: they wouldn&#x27;t make the chips if they didn&#x27;t intend to commercialize them. Designing and fabbing chips costs too much money!)<p>Which is to say, whether it be a Hackintosh or an Apple Mac Pro, there&#x27;s always going to be <i>something</i> to cater to workstation-class users of Apple products â€” because <i>Apple itself</i> is full of workstation-class users of Apple products.')
