The controller is always charging the battery (when there is power output from the panels), and the consumer power output is supplied by the batteries. This way you get much higher peak current output than the panels could provide, you also ensure stability.<p>In fact, many cabin installations don&#x27;t even use inverters to convert into AC. They instead use DC appliances. So no, going through AC makes no sense in this scenario.<p>As for DC voltage levels, that of course is dependent on solar panel configuration and battery cells configurations&#x2F;packing. Virtually all electric cars have a built in charger with a switching power supply that&#x27;s already doing the DC voltage conversion. What I was remarking was that there is a lot of duplicate electronics that perform the same function and that a lot of intermediary steps can be eliminated.')
