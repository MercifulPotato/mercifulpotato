I am not sure what a &quot;Gaia proper motion measurement of the source&quot; means [this is from the article] but I am not an astronomer and didn&#x27;t read the whole article.<p>Keep in mind how they detected this: they looked at the gravitational distortion of light caused by the planet&#x27;s influence. We are used to seeing this gravitational lensing with black holes, which is visibly obvious even to an untrained human eye. The effect exists for every object with mass, but it&#x27;s extremely tiny for planet-mass objects. For planet detection without a host star, it is the best measurement we have, but it&#x27;s very finnicky and doesn&#x27;t contain very much information compared to spectral analyses, motion around a host star, etc.<p>From that paper&#x27;s abstract:<p>&gt; Although in practice [rogue planets] do not emit any light, they may be detected using gravitational microlensing via their light-bending gravity. Microlensing events due to terrestrial-mass rogue planets are expected to have extremely small angular Einstein radii (~ 1 µas) and extremely short timescales (~ 0.1 day). Here, we\npresent the discovery of the shortest-timescale microlensing event, OGLE-2016-BLG-1928, identified to date (tE ≈ 0.0288 day = 41.5 min). Thanks to the detection of finite-source effects in the light curve of the event, we were able to measure the angular Einstein radius of the lens θE = 0.842 ± 0.064 µas, making the event the most extreme short-timescale microlens discovered to date. Depending on its unknown distance, the lens may be a Mars- to Earth-mass object, with the former possibility favored\nby the Gaia proper motion measurement of the source. The planet may be orbiting a star but we rule out the presence of stellar companions up to the projected distance of ∼ 8.0 au from the planet. Our discovery demonstrates that terrestrial-mass free-floating planets can be detected and characterized using microlensing.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;2009.12377.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;2009.12377.pdf</a>')
