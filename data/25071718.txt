The title is &quot;Automation should be like Iron Man, not Ultron&quot;. The idea is &quot;augment the human, don&#x27;t try and replace the human,&quot; since the combination of the human and computer will always be better than either one alone (at least with our current level of programming&#x2F;AI&#x2F;hardware capabilities).<p>To apply this to self-driving cars, we need more driver support. Visually identify cars and obstacles which could be an issue to supplant the driver&#x27;s identification. Help the driver keep in a lane. Help the driver keep a speed relative to traffic around them. Help drivers see in the dark, and past bright headlights. Help drivers see lane lines through snow packed roads.<p>Help the driver see and hear things, but don&#x27;t override their decisions.<p>Some of these technologies are available today in luxury cars - let&#x27;s make it available to everyone on the road.')
