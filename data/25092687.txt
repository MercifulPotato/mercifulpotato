Basically its a guide how to make friends, with a realization that we live in a world full of selfish people, that are self centered and don&#x27;t have much empathy. This is the default state of human beings. I watched an interview with Pol Pot and even he thought of himself as a good guy.<p>Quick Book Summary<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=9qvUYtwASqY" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=9qvUYtwASqY</a><p>Pol Pot last interview<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=CQ9_BMshyiw" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=CQ9_BMshyiw</a><p>[edit]\nI should qualify what I mean by selfish as it relates to the book. Basically humans tend to act in their self interest by default. And will go a long way to justify that behaviour to themselves even when it hurts others, so they can preserve a positive self image. this a common behaviour pattern. The book doesn&#x27;t claim its universal, and no exception exist. I&#x27;m sure there are exceptions. But even modern &quot;saint&quot; equivalents like Gandhi did some messed up selfish things.')
