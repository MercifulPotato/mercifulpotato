No.<p>Do I believe that JK Rowling (one of the signees) should lose fans and book sales because those fans don&#x27;t like her outdated and problematic views on trans people?<p>Well actually that&#x27;s the beauty - it doesn&#x27;t matter what I think. It matters what her fans think, and they think it&#x27;s fair. That&#x27;s consequences. That&#x27;s not cancel culture.')
