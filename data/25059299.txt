It’s like a CMS for your static variables &#x2F; copy &#x2F; constants so you can easily update them from a web UI instead of deploying code.<p>We’re software engineers and saw that the source of many bugs, incidents and time-sinks stem from hard-coding data. For example - waiting a day or longer for an iOS app store approval of a copy change, waiting hours on an internal CI&#x2F;deployment process to bump a timeout during a traffic spike incident, or having the same dollar-cost value diverge while hard-coded on iOS, Android and web clients.<p>In an ideal world, data would be completely separate from code. Databases can do this but often aren’t used that way for good reasons (they can be cumbersome to wire-up, there are scale concerns about adding extra load to your DB, it’s risky to touch a production database, etc). So we built Config.ly.<p>It has a simple web interface to define Strings, Numbers, Booleans and JSON objects and arrays. We think it’s so simple that even non-technical folks can update basic Config data like copy and colors (so you can focus on code!). We have client libraries (in four techs and growing!) that fetch these values from the server and intelligently handle optimizations like caching.<p>It’s free to use (with genorous size and bandwidth caps) and getting started from sign-up to fetching values in your client should take &lt; 5 minutes.<p>And we’d love to hear what you think!')
