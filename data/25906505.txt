Here, up to 0.56g&#x2F;L of lead content is used as an octane booster&#x2F;anti-knocking agent.<p>Many attempts have been made to remove lead from Avgas but it&#x27;s fairly difficult since the substitute needs to work with the vast majority of current engines <i>and</i> it needs to be easy to produce and distribute in large quantities around the country. Given the <i>much</i> smaller demand for 100LL (primarily used in general aviation) compared to Jet-A used for turbojet aircraft there hasn&#x27;t been a big push.')
