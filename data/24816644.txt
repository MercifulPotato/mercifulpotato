My experience and the experience of my teammates on the DevOps team? We did everything manually and <i>slowly</i> because we couldn’t see past our own fear to think creatively on how to automate away errors. And yes, we still made errors doing everything carefully, with a second set of eyes, late night deployments, backups taken, etc.<p>Once our leadership at the time changed to espouse a culture of learning from a mistake and not being afraid to make one as long as you can recover and improve something, we reduced a lot of risk and actually automated away a lot of errors we typically made which were caused initially by fear culture.<p>Just my two cents.')
