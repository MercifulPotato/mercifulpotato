Don’t remember exact age when this happened, maybe 6 or 7 (she’s 10 now). Before Minecraft, she would go a word at a time and not really comprehend but once she started playing her reading became fluent within weeks. Had an immediate impact on her performance at school too.<p>Now she’s into Roblox and I sometimes see her in Roblox studio hacking some Lua (or their version of Lua).')
