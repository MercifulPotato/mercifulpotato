It was Logitech C310 HD[0] for like $40 including delivery. When we became full WFH in april, people in working chats started asking me what kind of that super nice camera do I have.<p>Our company is issuing MacBooks for workers. Turned out that internal webcam of MacBook is so crappy that even cheap 720p Logitech looks &quot;HD&quot; compared to it. Logi also has quite nice mic.<p>Another thing was that I made my workplace in the erker, facing windows, so I got plenty of light in the summer. I noticed that I got the best picture in the morning and on the sunset, when light is abundant.<p>So, the takeout is: get yourself not a great but just a decent webcam, figure out the lighting. And for god&#x27;s sake, do not buy this clown looking mic to hang in front of you, you don&#x27;t need it at all.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.logitech.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;products&#x2F;webcams&#x2F;c310-hd-webcam.960-000585.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.logitech.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;products&#x2F;webcams&#x2F;c310-hd-webc...</a>')
