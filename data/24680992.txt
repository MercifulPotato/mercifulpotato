I once taught a class similar in spirit to this, although it was aimed at first-year undergraduates with only a basic knowledge of programming, squashed into a single quarter, and designed on the fly, so we only got partway through implementing a C compiler. Instead of writing a full C compiler ourselves, we considered &quot;cross-compiling&quot; one by taking one that compiled to bytecode, and writing an emulator for that in assembly, taking that to be our first &quot;compiler&quot; and then progressively bootstrapping from there to a better compiler until it became feasible to start writing (or porting) a C-based OS.')
