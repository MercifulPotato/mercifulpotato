Microsoft are arguing that the malware operation damages Microsoft&#x27;s brand, instead of putting the fault onto themselves for making vulnerable software.<p>I think both can be true. Even if you think Microsoft should be held legally culpable for making vulnerable software, I don&#x27;t think that should be a &quot;get out of jail free&quot; card for someone exploiting it.<p>I therefore don&#x27;t see how agreeing that Microsoft is being harmed by malware authors could possibly result in a legal precedent exonerating them from legal liability over vulnerable software. Courts consider what is presented to them and their rulings tend to be narrow.')
