A generation of script kiddies too lazy to learn Java invented NodeJS, so they could run the toy version of Java on the server side. Then they have the audacity to claim the shoulders of giants upon which they stand should&#x27;ve been strong enough to comprehend JS rather than Java...even though those giants invented BOTH JS and Java before you were even born.<p>Here&#x27;s a newsflash for you: if the Netscape inventors of JavaScript had been capable of making Java run in the browser then all you kids would be running Java instead of JS today.<p>The only reason JS exists at all is because early browsers had limited memory and CPU back in 1990s, so they cobbled something together over a weekend and named it JavaScript. Now that JS is running server side, these kids claim that&#x27;s the way it should&#x27;ve been from the beginning. No, sorry JS is a train wreck compared to Java, which is why MSFT had to come to the rescue with TypeScript.')
