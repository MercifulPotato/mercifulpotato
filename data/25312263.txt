Like, being based on race.<p>If you dig deeper, you will find that the racism of our world was excused with &quot;God blessed our people&quot; while LOTR made it true. So, if there is something unethical, then it must be Tolkien who made people not exactly equal. However, I&#x27;m not inclined to judge someone&#x27;s fantasies until they stay there.<p>In regard to genetic exceptionalism, it is practiced as a policy or unconsciously by many communities around the world. Whether it is bad could be decided when checking the consequences. They are rather obvious in small communities where inbreeding leads to all kinds of genetic diseases and &quot;preserve your genetic line&quot; turns rather ironic. In bigger communities the effects are a bit more subtle because the lack of diversity is not so pronounced. Issues begin when you consider your own as human+, because it is not so far off to consider everyone else as human- which provokes things like lack of cooperation, general hostility, and the occasional genocide.<p>Of course, the topic is much larger. I haven&#x27;t talked about diversity of communities and cultures, what makes humans a species, and so on, but I spread myself well enough, I think.')
