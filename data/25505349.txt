Portraits are usually taken from a distance with lenses with narrower FOV[1], typically 50 to 90mm in 135 equivalents or 45 to 25 degrees in FOV diagonally.<p>So to make a &quot;good&quot; webcam, the first step is to give it a &quot;longer&quot; lens if I&#x27;m going to do it. Trying a cheap clip-on &quot;macro zoom&quot; lens on a existing webcam, etc.<p>1: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gettyimages.com&#x2F;detail&#x2F;news-photo&#x2F;president-donald-trump-addresses-the-nation-from-the-oval-news-photo&#x2F;1206667595" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gettyimages.com&#x2F;detail&#x2F;news-photo&#x2F;president-dona...</a>')
