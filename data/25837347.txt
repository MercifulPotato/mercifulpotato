Parler had something like 2-3 million daily active users at its peak [1], and most of them joined after the Twitter started putting warning labels on false claims of election fraud.  Parler also billed itself as a &quot;free speech&quot; social network, which in practice means allowing things other social networks prohibit, which means its mainly gets users who want to post and read such stuff [2].<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnn.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;10&#x2F;tech&#x2F;parler-downloads&#x2F;index.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnn.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;10&#x2F;tech&#x2F;parler-downloads&#x2F;index.h...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pbs.org&#x2F;newshour&#x2F;nation&#x2F;right-wing-users-flock-to-parler-as-social-media-giants-rein-in-misinformation" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pbs.org&#x2F;newshour&#x2F;nation&#x2F;right-wing-users-flock-t...</a>')
