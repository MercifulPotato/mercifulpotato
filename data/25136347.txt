Consider why Saddam was not deposed in the Gulf War. It&#x27;s because to depose him the coalition would have to go all the way to Baghdad and endure a guerilla war, something that a conventional army just can&#x27;t really endure. That&#x27;s why Bush did not go for it - he knew Saddam would not go quietly into the night, but he also knew he could not win the land war against Iraq. So the operation ended in a withdrawal, much like the second gulf war will also end in a withdrawal, allowing the local elites to re-emerge.<p>That&#x27;s like saying we &quot;won&quot; in Afghanistan just because the Taliban temporarily moved elsewhere. As long you don&#x27;t have permanent control of the country, you haven&#x27;t really &quot;won&quot; anything there. And I don&#x27;t think you will argue that we have any kind of permanent control there, then or now, or can realistically get it in the future.<p>At least the Gulf War achieved something worthwhile. Later Iraqi and Afghan wars achieved nothing whatsoever.')
