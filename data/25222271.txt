Being willing to share your secret sauce doesn&#x27;t necessarily ensure you have direct competitors, it means you are establishing a foundation that others can build on. And it means others may contribute to your efforts.<p>It&#x27;s a little like open source software. It&#x27;s pretty unlikely that every SaaS provider needs to write their own DB and gain a competitive advantage that way. Why not work together to maintain one?<p>Communities like these then succeed a little more based on their own merits and what they add beyond the table stakes instead of just happening to get the right combination together at the right time.<p>I help run a community myself, but I&#x27;m tired of doing so for getting back very little of what I give. This post has given me some ideas on how to continue my journey a little more sustainably.')
