When it died I had its location moved and got a model with a circulating system that loops around to the downstairs locations (kitchen&#x2F;bathroom).  Now what took 20-30 seconds to get warm water is 2-3 seconds.  I spent a lot (for me) and it was worth it.<p>I replaced the 2 DIN radio in my car with an android head unit.  Driving became much better with my personal audio selection rather than over the air radio (What&#x27;s that?).  A few years later I upgraded the unit and reduced the start time from 20-ish seconds to 2 seconds.  Both changes removed irritants and noticeably improved my quality of life.<p>Previously I would wonder if getting a new car, or bigger TV, or going to Hawaii would improve my life.  Now I am more inclined to seek out irritants and try to find ways of applying money or effort to reduce them.  I&#x27;ll still make the occasional new&#x2F;splurge purchase, most recently Ring video cameras - they&#x27;re fun, but that comes second and I&#x27;m happier for it.')
