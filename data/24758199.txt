Per-capita numbers or something along those lines would be helpful.  Even the chart halfway down that appears to address proportionality doesn&#x27;t indicate what percentage of indicated departments are in each distribution...you could have, for example, a university police department that&#x27;s in a district with 15k violent crimes per year but they are only responsible for handling parking and property violations.<p>I don&#x27;t doubt there&#x27;s an impact, I would expect it to be honest, but it&#x27;s not clear that this article is making an objective case for it.')
