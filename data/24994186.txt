No, I didn&#x27;t.<p>I did suggest that C could have learned a thing or two from them.  A higher semantic level does not imply reduced performance.  In many cases, a richer language can give the compiler more opportunities to optimize.  Walter Bright&#x27;s D is a good example of a slightly-higher semantic level that still generates speedy binaries.<p>And a slow Pascal of yesteryear doesn&#x27;t exactly put the nail in the coffin.  C has also had its share of lame compilers.')
