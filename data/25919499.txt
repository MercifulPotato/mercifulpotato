The shipper has to request that specific service.  Basically, you bought from someone that either didn&#x27;t know how, or didn&#x27;t care, to do it the right way.  Compared to regular UPS&#x2F;Fedex, the big downside is that someone has to be there when it arrives.  They won&#x27;t just leave it at your door if you&#x27;re not there.<p>The LTL market is ~$46B&#x2F;year, and was growing prior to COVID.  The COVID hit makes sense, as the big boys don&#x27;t do a lot of LTL, having enough volume to do full truckloads.')
