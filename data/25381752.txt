Item(by='chordalkeyboard', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607655469, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25381571, text='&gt; Have you ever been too invested in some problem, or too upset by something, to see the truth of the situation? And when you ask someone else, who is not emotionally invested, they easily point out the way forward? That is the kind of phenomenon I am talking about.<p>Yes I have. Unfortunately, I am not aware of a reliable test to identify whether a person is capable of rational thought on a given subject. This means that when we witness a dispute between people about an issue, we are unable to reliably and provably evaluate the disputants meta-level reasoning. This is complicated by the fact that evaluating someone&#x27;s reasoning on the meta level is nearly always complicated by object-level concerns, including our own cognitive biases.<p>&gt; Most humans have the capability to objectively assess ideas in general, but when someone has a strong emotional attachment to a specific idea—such as partisans who are predisposed to believe voter fraud misinformation—they are not going to be capable of evaluating that specific idea as well as someone who isn’t predisposed to believe it.<p>Thats why its so harmful to put people in a position of being an information gatekeeper. You have no way of ensuring that your information is being filtered by a person who is emotionally detached. In fact, due to the potential for influencing other people, those positions are much more likely to be occupied by partisans who will then use it to advance their own perspective, often without even realizing it.<p>&gt; In this case, YouTube moderators are almost certainly going to be more capable of objectively evaluating whether or not a video is proof of widescale voter fraud than a poster who is strongly motivated to lie (intentionally or not)<p>This is exactly the problem. There is no reason to suppose that a youtube moderator is non-partisan, a high rung thinker, or emotionally detached from the subject they are evaluating.<p>&gt; And in that way, there are some people who are more capable of evaluating the objective truth than others.<p>Yes but there is not a reliable, objective way to identify them or to check their reasoning process for errors.<p>&gt; Yes. Exactly. I’m confused how we are arriving at such different conclusions from the same basic understanding. I hope that this added explanation helps.<p>I feel <i>exactly</i> the same way. I&#x27;m at a loss to explain this except that either we have some different premises that have not been revealed in this discussion so far, or perhaps Aumann&#x27;s agreement theorem [0] is not applicable to this issue for some reason.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Aumann%27s_agreement_theorem" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Aumann%27s_agreement_theorem</a>')
