It is the exact reason Facebook is a nice way to login to mobile multiplayer games.<p>Can you elaborate? What&#x27;s the issue with multiplayer games?<p>I own a Rift and I play (mostly Echo Combat) online... I don&#x27;t see what&#x27;s wrong with the games or why a facebook link would make it any better.')
