Restaurants pay fees just to be listed.\nDelivery company gets a cut of every sale AND they charge the customer a delivery fee AND a &quot;service&quot; fee, which I&#x27;ve found to be roughly 2x the tax rate (which is very high here already). Restaurants a lot of the time make menu items more expensive to offset the cut of the sale that the delivery company takes... which also makes the &quot;service fee&quot; charged to the customer higher. Don&#x27;t forget, still need to tip the driver, because they are not being paid a living wage.<p>It is a shit business. Companies trying to be unicorns and don&#x27;t want to be relegated to being behind the scenes. Even with all the insane fees, they still don&#x27;t make money.<p>Make a habit of asking the restaurant how they&#x27;d prefer you to place your order.')
