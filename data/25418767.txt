The idea is flawed in itself and we&#x27;ve seen it doesn&#x27;t lead to good things when it is tried.<p>Even the soviets came to that conclusion during their existence, starting with adopting leasing and then near the end full ownership for agriculture and then eventually for homes.<p>I still remember a friend from college telling me how his father had to retain his property after the fall of the USSR and new land rights were established in one of the now former satellite states, with a gun and an axe.<p>Not to create a false dichotomy but I&#x27;ll take a stable slightly coercive economic system over a system that requires me to use violence to keep what is mine.')
