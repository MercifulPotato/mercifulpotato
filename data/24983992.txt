Buy a $20-30 Lamy Safari as a good first pen (the shape of the grip helps to ensure you hold it correctly). Unless you&#x27;re writing novels by hand, a smaller ink bottle will last a long time. I&#x27;ve not had to buy new pens or new ink for a couple years (I&#x27;ll need to buy more ink soon). I keep a couple ballpoint pens around for random things where that&#x27;s easier (what they can write on, not all papers take fountain pen inks very well). I don&#x27;t buy those, they&#x27;re usually the freebies given away by car dealerships, doctors, banks, whatever. I use them until they stop writing.')
