An amoral entity will do evil if and when the benefit of evil outweighs the consequences, or the benefit of doing good. In terms of moral alignment, corporations as entities often behave like sociopaths.<p>One infamous example is Ford deciding not to fix the exploding gas tanks in Pintos because they estimated the cost of paying out lawsuits and settlements would be less than the cost of recalling and repairing their automobiles. Choosing when to do evil and how much evil to do is SOP for any corporation big enough to afford the risk.')
