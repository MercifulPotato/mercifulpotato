Good example is open office. I haven&#x27;t heard companies pointing to studies that shows a nice cubicle with walls is better for employee&#x27;s mental health than open office. On the other hand they keep telling how open office promotes open collaboration etc because it saves them money.<p>People keep saying that productivity will go down will all remote arrangements. But so far assumptions have that company has to worry about it. However I feel once employee&#x2F;team&#x2F;projects been identified for low productivity it&#x27;s them that have to worry. The reason is simple, barring few top percent of employees most do not have any negotiating power on whether to work from home or from office or few days from office to preserve their office seat etc.<p>So to think that low productivity will bring every one to office seems unlikely.')
