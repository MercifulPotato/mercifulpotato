Only a few of the companies are all in on electric- and 10 years from now there will be no new old school cars. Some of them have even giant liabilities because of the mess to the environment they have created, which also damaged their brand. Some of them probably wouldn&#x27;t even exist anymore was it not for government backing&#x2F;looking away and in some cases even intervention.<p>Many of the companies mentioned are quite far behind, and will face severe challenges in the coming years trying to adjust with little marging for error.<p>But most importantly Tesla is also a battery company! Who knows, most of the other players might even have to buy batteries from Tesla.<p>Gut feeling tells me that Tesla will still grow significantly, especially if they start selling batteries to other markets at scale, but also the car business itself will experience a tremendous growth.')
