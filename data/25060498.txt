Presumably it makes life easier for the bureaucrates, which I don&#x27;t particularly mind. If you had a mariage cerremony, and started calling yourselvs married without actually doing the paperwork, would anyone actually care?<p>The registration bit is the most important part, it’s not bureaucratic.  For the same reason that you need to have documents drawn up to form a business partnership, it’s for when things go sideways.  The registration is the proof that both parties entered into a contract, enforceable by the government.')
