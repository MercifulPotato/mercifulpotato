It absolutely may have happened, and if or when it has, I want those instances known. But if someone were to have been arrested wrongly, or some government blamed wrongly, this would be a huge deal, and I&#x27;d expect there to be a lot of public controversy and discussion about it.<p>Everyone should be subject to due process. If some organized crime ring in Ukraine is blamed for some particular ransomware attack and they get tricked into traveling somewhere that lets them be extradited and tried in a US court, the prosecution still needs to prove beyond a reasonable doubt at trial that they&#x27;re the responsible party. Things get more complicated when an entire nation-state government is accused of launching ransomware attacks, but so far I think only North Korea has faced that (someone please correct me if I&#x27;m wrong), and they&#x27;re kind of an outlier among all the other countries.<p>We should always be skeptical any time any government accuses any entity of a crime, of course. There should always be a presumption of innocence. But that&#x27;s what the legal system and due process are for. The onus is on the government to prove their case.')
