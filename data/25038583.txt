I realize there&#x27;s ethical concerns in increasing exposure etc but in my experience, that&#x27;s in the ballpark of sample sizes where unacknowledged heterogeneity can be manipulated to distort findings.<p>I&#x27;m not suggesting Pfizer is up to something nefarious, just that the biomedical literature is littered with studies with N &lt; 100 for the outcomes of interest and they don&#x27;t replicate. The N &gt; 40k in some ways is irrelevant if none of those participants have the processes in play. It&#x27;s more like recruiting N &gt;40k to get N=94 to study.<p>I&#x27;m also not suggesting with 90% effectiveness that there&#x27;s probably no effect, just that my guess is a true value of 60% isn&#x27;t outside the realm of possibility once you consider all the factors that could be in play besides the random sampling variation that&#x27;s assumed by their tests.')
