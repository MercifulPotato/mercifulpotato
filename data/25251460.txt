Item(by='tasogare', descendants=None, kids=[25251485, 25252209], score=None, time=1606721014, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25251147, text='&gt; Is that enough to have an acceptable lifestyle?<p>I’m always baffled by this kind of comments. The world isn’t made of SV engineers making 300K$&#x2F;year, living in appartment with 5K appartment and buying 40$ sandwiches. Sure, most places and jobs are paying less, but cost of living is also lower. In Japan for instance eating out is cheap compared to Europe. Healthcare is accessible too. Cooking can help saving money too. Heck, I’m living (alone) fine with $16K&#x2F;year (yes, per year) in one of the biggest Japanese city and I still can go to parties, buy video games, travel abroad while saving some money.')
