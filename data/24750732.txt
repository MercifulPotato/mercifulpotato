One is that they lost the browser war, so they should cut their losses (like with Thunderbird) and move on. The other was that they underinvested in what their supporters care about (the browser) and were distracted by things like Pocket. Mozilla is also in a different situation than a spun-off Chrome; Chrome would be a market leader with licensing deals.')
