CO2 is the primary global warming gas, and other gases contribute also\n2. CO2 precedes temperature change\n3. The warming trend is unique to earth because of human activity\n3. We understand the Climate science and carbon processes well enough to make accurate predictions\n4. Climate modeling is accurate, and contributes to knowing what will happen\n5. Our temperature measurement systems are accurate and scientifically valid\n6. We understand all the interplay between albedo, cloud formation, and water vapor at different altitudes\n7. We understand why the earth appears to be getting larger\n8. The earth&#x27;s warming is due to human activity and is not a natural process of warming and cooling driven by solar activity and events\n9. Solar activity levels play no part in global warming; these changes are from human activity\n10. Green biomass has decreased, not increased due to human activity<p>Alternative claims exist such as:<p>1. CO2 is primarily plant food\n2. CO2 is a trailing indicator of temperature change\n3. The warming trend exists among multiple planets not just earth\n3. Climate science and carbon process knowledge are in their infancy\n4. Climate modeling is inaccurate, and has been very inaccurate thus far\n5. Our temperature measurement systems have been contaminated by the heat island effect, and are not accurate and scientifically valid\n6. We do not yet understand all the interplay between albedo, cloud formation, and water vapor at different altitudes\n7. We understand the earth appears to be getting larger but we do not know why\n8. The earth&#x27;s warming is to a natural process of warming and cooling driven primarily by solar activity and events\n9. Solar activity levels play the most significant part in global warming; these changes are not only from human activity\n10. Green biomass has increased due to human activity<p>Regardless of position, I don&#x27;t believe name calling will convince people either way.<p>I have no personal interests in either idea though I have some investments in green energy &amp; petroleum.  As green energy is not self-sufficient, I expect that petroleum will continue to be around for many years as we transition to future energy sources.')
