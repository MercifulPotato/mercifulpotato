It has a proven track record of high performance and embedded implementations. A lot of ISA design is about avoiding patents and other traps. Ultimately it doesn’t really matter because most of the value is in the implementation and the software is the commoditized complement.<p>Truly innovative designs don’t actually use RISC encoding and hide the details of instruction encoding. See for example NVIDIAs PTX , which gets mapped to hardware specific instruction streams, which are nothing like a traditional RISC architecture.<p>To me RISC-V is another example of how open source often produces lowest common denominator copy cat versions of ideas that are 30+ years old. Just like Linux. The sad thing is that this often kills innovation and locks in suboptimal designs for a long time, because it is hard to compete against something that is free.')
