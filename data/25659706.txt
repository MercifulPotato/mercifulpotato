Item(by='dls2016', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609953189, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25658298, text='&gt; The new approaches disguise that nonlinearity as a more digestible set of linear approximations, though their exact methods vary considerably.<p>The idea of reducing a nonlinear problem to a sequence of linear problems is the bread and butter of nonlinear PDE, both theoretical and numerical. The trick is always in the reduction and I guess here you want the reduction to have a nice &quot;quantum&quot; solution.<p>I&#x27;m not qualified to say what either of these papers have to do with &quot;chaos&quot;. You&#x27;ll notice that this word only appears in one of the papers and then only once in the intro.')
