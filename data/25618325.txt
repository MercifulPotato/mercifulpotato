Item(by='mcavoybn', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609635728, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25600229, text='I was upvoted for this comment at first, then harshly downvoted.<p>Let me expand on what I meant:<p>Leveraging consumer data (and marketing that process in a blog post) is an insidious affair. This article is just a rebranded, simplified version of a research paper. There are many other articles like it, and they intend to simplify and sensationalize (to the degree that they can argue plausible deniability) something outrageous.<p>This entire article; the webpage, the work of the author, the words the article is composed of, could easily be reduced to a simple statement: &quot;People who are more willing to take a risk on an unusual product are more willing to take a risk in multiple categories.&quot; This such an obvious conclusion that the publisher of this article should be tried for conspiracy and fraud. A child could come to this realization.<p>This is clickbait, plain and simple. Furthermore, its insulting. I look forward to the day that those who publish these article lose their incentive to do so.')
