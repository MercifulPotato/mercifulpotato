You can colocate so many useful things with power supplies, like electric metalworks.<p>The mining incentive structure and automatic deoptimization of the algorithm mean that there’s a constant arms race to build faster hashing hardware that lasts a few months and then gets thrown out without improving the performance characteristics of the underlying system. 7 transactions per second costs 620kWh and yields 107g of garbage. Each pair of transactions is like chucking your phone out the window and powering a home for 45 days. Do you see how shameful that is?<p>A Tesla gets 4 miles per kWh, so each pair of transactions  - where you scribbled down an IOU into a big multiplayer excel sheet - consumes as much resources as driving round-trip across the United States <i>and</i> throwing your iPhone out when you get back.<p>The crazy thing is there&#x27;s frequently a big overlap between the crypto enthusiasts and people who you know, believe in global warming and recycling.<p>&gt; And again, nobody is looking for other things just for the sake of proving that something else can use less energy because there isn&#x27;t a problem.<p>And I bet global warming isn&#x27;t real either huh? I mean those oil companies aren&#x27;t looking for alternative sources of energy <i>because there isn&#x27;t a problem</i>.<p>The reality is economic incentives beat rationality pretty much every time hands down.')
