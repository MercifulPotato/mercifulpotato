Someone with known ties to Russian intelligence claiming that his lawyer received a surprise hard drive from a computer repairman who has an utterly implausible explanation for his acquisition of said drive.  Someone who has been known to spread false allegations and conspiracy theories including the claim that Joe Biden is suffering from dementia.<p>The Biden campaign has records to that time indicating no such meeting took place.<p>So far, without further corroboration, it&#x27;s an allegation with no basis.  Especially given justice department investigations into the purported impropriety that the supposed emails revolve around did not reveal any evidence of involvement of Joe Biden in his son&#x27;s dealings.')
