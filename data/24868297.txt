Before the pandemic I never even had the option. Now I do have the option, and that&#x27;s great.<p>I&#x27;m never going to push for everyone working from home, or everyone working from the office. It should be flexible, it should be easy to make that choice when it suits you.<p>Some weeks I&#x27;ll go into work every day, some weeks I&#x27;ll have a few days work from home. That&#x27;s how I want to work. I still put in the face time, I still get to see most people. I just get to have a more relaxing time working from home now and then.<p>I could never be a fully remote worker right now. But I&#x27;d always advocate for more flexibility. And I&#x27;ll be honest, I like seeing my work colleagues, we have a laugh, and I&#x27;d miss that in a permanent work from home setting.')
