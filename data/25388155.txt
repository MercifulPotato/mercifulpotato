I think we often make the assumption that more is better, but it&#x27;s quite possible that in our search for more we&#x27;re putting ourselves in situations that run counter to our biological nature. Animals in captivity have many advantages over their wild brethren (they don&#x27;t have to worry about food, about being eaten, they have access to advanced medicine, etc.), but I don&#x27;t think we can say that they&#x27;re clearly better off or happier.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npr.org&#x2F;sections&#x2F;goatsandsoda&#x2F;2017&#x2F;10&#x2F;01&#x2F;551018759&#x2F;are-hunter-gatherers-the-happiest-humans-to-inhabit-earth" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npr.org&#x2F;sections&#x2F;goatsandsoda&#x2F;2017&#x2F;10&#x2F;01&#x2F;5510187...</a>')
