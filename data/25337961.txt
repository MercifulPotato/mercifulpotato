Plenty of open-source projects like Dokan will typically run fine with an anti-cheat (ours will, certainly). What stops you from running a patched version is actually Windows itself, since Windows requires drivers to be signed with an authenticode codesigning certificate. Plenty of open-source projects and people have one, though. So it’s not an anti-cheat blocking you, it’s Windows itself. Of course, if you go out of your way to disable driver signature enforcement, most anti-cheats will prevent you from playing, but this is a mode strongly discouraged from Microsoft and does weaken your computer’s security.')
