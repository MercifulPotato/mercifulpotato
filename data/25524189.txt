By the early nineties, say 12 years later, it was down to $1 per megabyte. By the mid-90s it was down again to about 20 cents a megabyte - I was speaking to a computer shop owner and he was raving about his new 500 MB disk: &quot;That&#x27;s half a gigabyte!&quot;. Then the bottom fell out of things, and storage got very, very cheap.<p>I recently looked at a 256 GB micro SD card online and marvelled at it. If I could have shown my 30-years-younger self that, I just would not have believed that something so TINY could hold an enormous amount of data.')
