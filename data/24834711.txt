Item(by='joe_the_user', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603178872, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24834135, text='&gt;&gt; everyone argues from an emotional perspective<p>&gt; You kind of have to. If you were not emotionally invested in some way, you wouldnâ€™t be arguing.<p>The thing is, if you&#x27;re talking about an average online debater, their emotional motivation is likely quite confused. The emotional distribution might be: 20% wanting to appear smart&#x2F;reasonable, 30% wanting to insult their idea of bad people, 30% wanting to reinforce their lifestyle as valid, etc or whatever. With that, you could can could translate liamrosen&#x27;s comment to say &quot;if they&#x27;re motivated 30% to appear smart, you can involve them in the framework&quot; and once you involve the person, Cialdini&#x27;s commitment and consistency can strong motivators to keep them there.<p>That said, I think this does raise the point that there are other good way to deal with the emotions behinds arguments that aren&#x27;t mentioned in liamrosen&#x27;s essay (the OP). One standard approach to determine the emotion behind a given irrational claim, acknowledge the emotion, sympathize with it and then go back and show that the original claim is unnecessary.')
