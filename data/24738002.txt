Is it a separate architect role, or part of engineering roles?<p>- How are architecture decisions made and validated?<p>- How is architecture documented?<p>- How much freedom is there in making architecture decisions as a (product) team?<p>- Related to the previous question, are there top-down &quot;rules&quot; in terms of technology choices? For example: what databases you can use, what API protocols are mandated (e.g. REST vs GraphQL vs gRPC). If there are general rules, who makes those rules and who updates those rules?<p>- Does your company explicitly deal with &quot;Business Architecture&quot; next to technology architecture? If so, how and why? (ie. what problems does it solve for you?)<p>- What downsides do you perceive to the way architecture is practiced at your company?<p>Some background: I&#x27;m working at a big enterprise&#x2F;corporate in Europe that wasn&#x27;t originally a digital business. Like most companies, we&#x27;ve been focusing on making more parts of our operations digital and basically becoming a digital-first company. Now I&#x27;m interested to have a look outside my own bubble and to see how companies that are technology-focused at heart and digital-first are approaching architecture.<p>I&#x27;m not looking to start a flamewar on the merits of architecture roles or anything. I just want to understand how others are doing it, so I can learn.<p>Thanks in advance for your answers!')
