We’ve outsourced so much manufacturing that there’s a ton of different items we can’t build. We’re in the middle of a pandemic where we found we couldn’t make enough Ppe and there was literally a single American factory left for n95s.<p>Having the materials available is important but useless if we can’t do anything ourselves with them.')
