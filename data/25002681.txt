The web is meant to be machine-readable (we wouldn&#x27;t have Google or anything nearly as convenient in the first place if it wasn&#x27;t).  Whatever have been published is public and should not come with artificial limitations on how do you read and process it. Blocking crawling should be outlawed as it clearly is a monopolistic practice. E.g. I want to build my own crawler to index and categorize the web subset I choose for me. I believe this is a perfectly legitimate use. But they will probably try to stop me.')
