Does the author think there&#x27;s no need for security? That it&#x27;s not important?<p>I can&#x27;t speak for the author, but I think a lot of this industry sacrifices way way too much in the name of nebulous &quot;security&quot;. Case in point: Spectre and Meltdown are not likely to ever be a significant threat to any desktop computer user, nor to any server that is only running trusted code, yet a lot of IT people lost their shit over it and were willing to significantly degrade their performance via heavy handed mitigations.')
