Item(by='nobody9999', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602299109, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24736205, text='&gt;Stopping people from questioning the narrative is fundamentally against free speech and having a small group of people presume to be the final arbiters of truth with the power to suppress contrary speech is dystopian to the max.<p>I am so sick to death of hearing this &quot;argument.&quot;  Because it&#x27;s irrelevant to the situation.  And I&#x27;ll tell you why:<p>In the United States,<p>1.  Private entities are <i>not</i> bound by the First Amendment.  That means they can host (or refuse to do so) any speech they choose, because that&#x27;s the First Amendment right of all individuals and private entities;<p>2.  The US government is forbidden to be the arbiter of speech, except in a few, clearly defined areas (advocating the violent overthrow of the government, making credible threats of violence, etc.);<p>3.  If you don&#x27;t like decisions about speech that a particular individual or private entity makes, you are perfectly free to speak out against those decisions, organize others to do so, and&#x2F;or vote with your feet&#x2F;wallet and don&#x27;t engage with that individual or entity;<p>4. Unless you have a management and&#x2F;or ownership role in a private organization (e.g., Twitter), you don&#x27;t have the right to change their policies or speech;<p>5.  You absolutely have the right to speak out and say just about <i>anything</i>, but you don&#x27;t have the right to <i>force</i> others to host that speech on their <i>private property</i>.  And that&#x27;s a very <i>good</i> thing.  If that weren&#x27;t the case, I would have the right to blare midget furry porn or all-goatse-all-the-time projections or all manner of other offensive, hateful, disgusting things <i>in your living room</i>.<p>I&#x27;m sure many will disagree with me.  If you do, please engage me in discussion in addition to taking other action -- both of which (and thank you HN for making that possible) are your free expression.')
