The most basic is the immediate feeling of pleasure, like what you get from having sex or watching a sunset. I think you&#x27;re right that some people naively think work should be like that day to day and their own intellectual stimulation is a primary concern for anyone else.<p>But there are also other forms of happiness. One is a generalized sense of well-being. Another is a sense of growth or flourishing and fulfilling one&#x27;s potential. I think it&#x27;s sort of natural that people associate these things with their careers (especially the latter). And I understand why it&#x27;s disheartening to feel that at the end of the day you&#x27;re a cog in a machine, that your work may actually be damaging to your well-being and distracting or sucking away time and energy from things that would allow you to flourish. Worst of all for many people in tech, you may feel that the work you do is actually net harmful to not just yourself but to your coworkers and your users.<p>I think you&#x27;re right to call out people to take responsibility for themselves and to realize the world doesn&#x27;t owe them anything, but I also think it&#x27;s a more nuanced issue and there are some easy traps to fall into out there.')
