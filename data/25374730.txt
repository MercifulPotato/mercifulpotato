What Russia correctly worked out is that, if you can create the requisite content, you WILL get people to watch it, just statistically. And because you&#x27;re (indirectly) feeding it with a coherent, directed intention, including specific elements like &#x27;the Russian Bots people are talking about don&#x27;t exist and anybody saying so is a loony&#x27;, you can get your bubble of alternate information to grow and serve useful purposes (useful to you: NOT necessarily useful to the people you&#x27;re using to fill your bubble)<p>You absolutely can make people watch it, even side with it passionately to where they&#x27;ll burn through their friends requiring loyalty to the information bubble. It&#x27;s a matter of statistics, and directing the contents of the information bubble with reasonable effectiveness. It&#x27;s a bit like nuclear fusion: sort of &#x27;wait, these lumps of metal do THAT?!?&#x27;<p>Yes, in fact they do. And, yes, you can direct HUMANITY to whatever ends you like, including &#x27;The USA should be torn to bits by civil war please, so it is no longer a rival superpower&#x27;. Plenty of people out there would find that useful, wouldn&#x27;t even have to be exceptionally short-sighted. Mind you, it&#x27;s still damn reckless even if it is not absolutely short-sighted.')
