I mean the literal definition of a conspiracy is people conspiring to do something. Every revolution that has happened at some point was a conspiracy, but people will take the very strange circumstances that circle around this man and say that there is no conspiracy to look into. That is the point we don&#x27;t know if there was one or not, but no one is interested in looking under the covers.')
