At least for me, disconnect from other people&#x2F;society doesn’t play a role (plenty of connections, happily married, etc.).<p>In my case, pharma pretty much works, non-pharma hasn’t. This doesn’t exclude non-pharma therapies’ being effective - for example, they may modulate underlying biochem to good effect in some- but only that such treatments haven’t worked for me.<p>I’m following the pscilocybin work closely. So far, it’s encouraging. I plan to experiment in 2021.')
