But extrapolating that example of government influence over culture to the premise &quot;media is 100% under the control and direction of the government&quot; or, furthermore, a hidden or shadow government... is stretching well beyond a logical conclusion. (It would have to be a shadow government, because mainstream media and social media were not going along with the Republicans led by Trump, when they were in power over several branches of the U.S. government.)<p>You need a lot more evidence to dispel the notion that this is &quot;not a conspiracy.&quot;')
