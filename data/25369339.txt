In one of the first test stand videos of a raptor run you can see a little bit of green and I think Musk even tweeted it was running &quot;a little engine rich&quot;. the first time I watched a night flight of a falcon9 there was a green glow right at ignition which caused me to hold my breath but that was the hypergolic ignition fluids which also burn green. Raptor uses a torch ignition so any green from a Raptor is very bad news.')
