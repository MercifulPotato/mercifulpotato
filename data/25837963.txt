Any radio store will sell those, IDK why the rioters skimped on that.<p>Key distribution.<p>Encrypted radios are useless if no one knows what key to use, and equally useless if everyone knows what key to use. Sharing encryption keys with people you&#x27;ve never met on an open forum is equivalent to giving everyone the keys, just like sharing encryption keys with random people you&#x27;ve never met at public riot is equally equivalent to giving everyone the keys. One of those people you share with will be on the other side, at which point it&#x27;s game over for your encryption. That said, given the brain trust that invaded the capitol building, I guess you&#x27;re right, it is surprising they didn&#x27;t have that added layer of security theater in the form of useless encryption everyone in DC could have been listening to.')
