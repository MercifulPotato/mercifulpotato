Firstly, a 1-2% rent decrease on the short term for a 10% increase in a supply at 500m?? This is pretty ridiculously low, if this is the best that can be done it&#x27;s barely worth mentioning.<p>The important thing here is that people leaving a city due to unavailability of housing thus stopping the growth in the price of housing is something that we only just see happen, it&#x27;s a lot less delocalized and it&#x27;s a long term process, so I really don&#x27;t see how the real world effect of zero from increased supply is supposed to counteract this second order effect.<p>The second issue is that while in theory neoliberal YIMBYs are often for public housing, when their plans are put into practice this part is completely ignored. If you see a crucial aspect of your plan being ignored, which is also by far the hardest to implement, and yet don&#x27;t put it front and center to stop this, it&#x27;s clear that you&#x27;re okay for trading that off. Which means that the real world effect is for rent to just keep on increasing.<p>Whereas cities with progressive solutions (which also include increasing supply, but fittingly with the weakness of the effect don&#x27;t make it completely central, often seen much more than 0-2% temporary decreases.')
