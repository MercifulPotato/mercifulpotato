I did live sound engineering when I was younger, and worked in some studio recordings, and the conventional wisdom of the field is that musicians will begin to get distracted by latency greater than 10ms (which you have to care about when sending foldback to a musician, even when all of your equipment is in the same room).<p>10ms only gets light 2&#x2F;3rds of the straight line distance between LA and NY. After you start accounting latency in infrastructure components, round trips, and the fact that cables aren&#x27;t laid in straight lines between two users, the idea of live musical collaboration over even short distances starts to seem implausible.')
