What the hell is he talking about? Didn&#x27;t he see the pictures? Oh, alternative facts.. LOL. Well, good thing they&#x27;re incompetent and not dangerous.&quot;<p>Now the lies are dangerous. So many were complaining 4 years ago because this arc seemed inevitable. Let someone lie and verbally attack anyone who slightly disagrees with them without repercussion and they&#x27;ll keep pushing to see where the line is.<p>So many thought: &quot;I&#x27;m sure he&#x27;s learned his lesson this time!&quot; In reality, you&#x27;d have to be blinded by naivet√© or something worse to think he was going to change or moderate his behavior or tactics.<p>It&#x27;s not that people are scared that a few hundred people storming the capital will actually overturn our almost 250 year old democracy. It&#x27;s that if we don&#x27;t respond with intense rejection of this behavior, this behavior could easily become an existential threat to the republic. What&#x27;s to stop the next President from bringing an armed secret service or a willing FBI SWAT team into a Senate proceeding?<p>The line should have been drawn long before this incident. But now, for sure, if you violently attack the halls of democracy you should be banned from far more than a few private digital platforms.')
