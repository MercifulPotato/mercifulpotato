You can actually reduce it by adding features in some cases.<p>For example, I believe that adding Sum Types would actually simplify most class-based languages, because it would mean that you can use a straightforward tool with a 1:1 mapping from real-world concept to language concept for representing &quot;or&quot; (a very fundamentally logical construct!). As-is you have to use an awkward inheritance pattern with classes. Or use a union and keep track of the tag manually. There&#x27;s an extra feature, but the usages of the feature become straightforward. It&#x27;s the same principle as writing longer but more straightforward code rather than a gnarly one-liner.')
