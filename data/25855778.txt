Compare the concept of time travel to something like &#x27;smell travel&#x27;. Is it really that different? We are conditioned to know what smell is because our body has a mechanism to &quot;interpret&quot; particles and send signals to our brain which we &#x27;remember&#x27;... How do we know that Time is any different? Perhaps travelling back in time is a flawed concept in itself, in the same way that &quot;travel back in hearing&quot; or &quot;travel back in smell&quot; makes little sense at all because we&#x27;re just describing an effect or mechanism of our biology, rather than an effect or mechanism of the universe.')
