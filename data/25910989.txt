Download a tarball and then compile make install without needing to install a bunch of dependencies just for the build system. You can also trust that standard command line flags like --prefix and so on will be there, and do what you expect.<p>However, from the point of view of a developer, autotools are way too much for my brain. The m4 macros are inscrutable and I never felt like I had any hope of actually undesrtanding how they work. It&#x27;s one of those technologies that I my only hope of getting work done is by copy pasting snippets of code I got from other people.<p>Anyway, does anyone know if there are alternative build systems that follow the same paradigm as autotools, but more pleasant to use as a developer?')
