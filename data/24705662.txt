I hated memorising formulae and theorems as I always thought if I can derive them then why bother. But the cognitive load when working on more complex problems and having to think about the problem at hand as well as the tools used to solve it just doesn&#x27;t scale well enough and it limited me until I accepted that a large part of mathematical intuition involves having these as a part of my memory.\nOf course, this doesn&#x27;t need to(and shouldn&#x27;t need to) happen through rote-learning but rather through a large number of problems that it happens naturally.')
