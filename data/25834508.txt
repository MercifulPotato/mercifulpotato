We have shown we can find a way to do it. We even work with other parts of Amazon. We are always open to doing that; it just needs to be OK.<p>I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m reading too much into this but it sort of feels like they don&#x27;t want&#x2F;expect to keep offering the proper AWS integration that their elastic.co product has now. I know at work we have something hosted by them in AWS and I assume that&#x27;s inside our VPC and we&#x27;d need that feature to keep using them.<p>If they do still think that feature is important then saying they &quot;work with other parts of Amazon&quot; feels like it&#x27;s really under-selling that collaboration&#x2F;integration with AWS.')
