What is the difference between a &quot;webview-based&quot; browser and a browser?<p>If you&#x27;re on macOS, sure, it&#x27;s pretty obvious what&#x27;s a WebView, because Apple explicitly uses the term, and it&#x27;s their OS. The distinction is one of language rather than technology, but it&#x27;s a valid distinction nonetheless.<p>On Linux, I don&#x27;t think the distinction exists. Webkit-GTK is the Linux port of Webkit, and it can be used for anything.')
