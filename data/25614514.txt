Surely a coincidence.<p>I agree that Tether itself is a risky proposition - in my opinion. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it.<p>But prove what you said about &#x27;fake dollars&#x27;. And then prove the connection to the Bitcoin price rise that you implied by &#x27;a coincidence&#x27;.<p>I don&#x27;t believe you can prove this. Because if you could prove it, you would have already done so.<p>Edit: And I would hope we could correct the title of this post. It&#x27;s not truly about &#x27;Bitcoin <i>value</i> surges past $30K&#x27;, it is about &#x27;Bitcoin <i>price</i> passed $30K&#x27;')
