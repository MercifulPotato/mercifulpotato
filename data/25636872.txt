It&#x27;s not about good vs. bad government, it&#x27;s about no government.<p>Certainly not.  As I keep telling people here, cryptos are <i>property</i>, not <i>currency</i>.  Why should governments be in the business of telling people what type of property they can and can&#x27;t own?<p>A coin is nothing but a couple of large numbers that are easy to multiply together but very difficult to factor...that&#x27;s it.  If the people of earth want to assign large fiat currency values to complicated key-pairs, then why shouldn&#x27;t they have the right to do that?<p>Of course crypto-traders need government...like we need libraries and schools and police and all that, just like everyone else, right?')
