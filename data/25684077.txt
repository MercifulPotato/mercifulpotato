We do have competitors like Twitter, Telegram, Signal but none of them are from Google or Apple. If we had we could have kept Facebook in check.<p>Have they given up on network effect of Facebook&#x27;s platforms? If they can&#x27;t solve network effect problem then I wonder how much hope there is for apps like Matrix or Signal.<p>P.s. We do have YouTube from Google but that&#x27;s an entirely different story.')
