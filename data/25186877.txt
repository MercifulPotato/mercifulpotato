I do see Thorrez&#x27;s point now.<p>If we consider an iteration to be complete when i-- (the iteration expression) has been completed execution, then yes, the value of the variable i is decremented to -6 when the 6th iteration completes.<p>In fact, the value of the variable i is decremented to -7 when the 7th iteration completes. The language used in this blog post regarding the iterations (which is also quoted by Thorrez) is indeed sloppy. I will update it soon and fix it. Thank you, jonsen and Thorrez, for paying attention to the details!')
