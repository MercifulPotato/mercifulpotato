I think I paid 4$ once, and that&#x27;s it. I&#x27;ve played thousands of games for that 4$. It is not going to win any design awards, but it is good enough. More importantly, it is dependable and just works. I&#x27;ve soundly beaten some beginners and have been beaten beyond recognition by experts. It has tons of users - from beginners to very, very strong players and everyone in between.<p>Not sure who owns wordfeud, hopefully not EA, it would break my heart :(')
