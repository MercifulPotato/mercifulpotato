Not every decision is rooted in trying to satisfy the machine.  But speaking of machines, on that note...<p>If you ever have to write any tooling for HTML processing, you&#x27;ll realize that they can be useful for machines, too.  If your team doesn&#x27;t make use of any of these &quot;features&quot; that trigger corner cases in the spec, then you can adopt an XML-like parsing strategy (where these aren&#x27;t optional) and your parser can be simpler than if you were to implement the entirety of the HTML5 parsing algorithm.  You don&#x27;t need any notion of void elements, and your parser doesn&#x27;t need hardcoded lists of which elements are among them.  You can write a &quot;dumb&quot; parser that can derive the node structure without needing any intimate knowledge of HTML.  It&#x27;s like the difference between parsing S-expressions and parsing an ALGOL-like language.')
