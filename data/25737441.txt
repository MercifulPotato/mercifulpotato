FC3 has clearly influenced other games that came out since.  Production value is high, graphics are great, they run fine on 5+ year old computers and the stories are fun.  I&#x27;m neither bored nor overly frustrated.<p>Really my only issue is the lack of non-lethal play options, but you can play stealth most of the time and it&#x27;s a good challenge for me.  Not a shill or anything, I was just surprised to be enjoying them.')
