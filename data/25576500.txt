Clearly those assumptions won&#x27;t hold if we have much larger blocks.<p>There is a lot of head room. Anyone can see this. Ten years of transactions has taken up $6 of hard drive space TOTAL while the average fee PER TRANSACTION is almost $9 right now.<p>&gt; Sounds like you&#x27;re not denying the anti-decentralization aspect at all, but rather arguing that it doesn&#x27;t matter.<p>That&#x27;s ridiculous.  Decentralization is important and none of this has much effect on decentralization at all.  You haven&#x27;t actually explained why there would be any problem with decentralization because you can&#x27;t.  There is no barrier to entry for anyone who wants to sync with any chain so they can mine it or accept it.<p>&gt; Specifically &quot;Assume good faith&quot;.<p>Say something reasonable that isn&#x27;t contradicted by grade school math. You haven&#x27;t backed up anything you have said with anything that makes sense.<p>&gt; I don&#x27;t get it which numbers are made up?<p>Correct, you don&#x27;t get it.  Your idea that someone has to spend $450 on what would be 24TB is nonsense.<p>Why don&#x27;t you explain to me what exactly you think will happen if throughput is more than a few transactions per second? Ethereum already exceeds bitcoin&#x27;s volume.  Bitcoin Cash tested huge blocks years ago, what exactly do you think will happen and why?  Maybe you just don&#x27;t want people to realize that there is no systemic reason for bitcoin being capped, because if they do it will become a relic.')
