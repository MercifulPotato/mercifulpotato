Yes, that includes all the other Kubernetes clients in github.com&#x2F;kubernetes-client like Python and .Net too.<p>See <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Arnavion&#x2F;k8s-openapi&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;README.md" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Arnavion&#x2F;k8s-openapi&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;README.m...</a> for a full description.<p>I also confirm that I keep it up-to-date with Kubernetes releases and have been doing so for the ~3 years that it&#x27;s been around.
