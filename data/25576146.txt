Maybe you could argue if COVID popped up in US first it would have been the same.<p>But if the tables were turned I don&#x27;t believe there would be any attempts to hide facts and not offer support beyond Trump&#x27;s own incompetence and pathological personality disorder wishing it would &#x27;magically go away&#x27; so he could get elected again.<p>--<p>And to the parent parent there are plenty of facts both ways but it&#x27;s impossible to separate effects of policy from the HUGE negative pain caused by Trump&#x27;s abdication of responsibility. Trump has undeniably left us in a horrible place, far greater than any gains from policy.')
