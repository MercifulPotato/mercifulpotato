Item(by='acituan', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607185248, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25315327, text='&gt; as top ethics talent will certainly avoid working for Google, and prefer academic freedom elsewhere<p>I wouldn&#x27;t be that sure. I know the &quot;headline narrative&quot; is invested in painting Google as evil (and they don&#x27;t tend to be that wrong in many instances), but the actual sentiment among the general talent pool is very divided in this instance. There is a sizeable percentage who are relieved to see activist pressure being resisted in a corporation and would be inclined to make a pick on that basis. We all know corporate pressure is not the only threat to academic&#x2F;intellectual freedom.')
