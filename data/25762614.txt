Get customers early. Have a short feedback loop to your customers. And not the least: Make sure you start with an experienced founder.<p>The last part resonated the most. Are there experienced founders in The Netherlands looking for new ventures to start and grow?<p>Let me know! I’m very interested and would love to explore together.<p>-----<p>As ideas are a dime a dozen, I’ll share one of mine. Put as many holes in here as you’d like :) But if there’s any part of the idea which tickles your enthusiasm also do not hesitate to tell us!:<p>A car sharing service. There always is a vehicle within 5 to 10 minutes from your location. Subscriptions for 300 euros per month will allow (fair) unlimited use of relatively premium vehicles. (Tesla 3 which will also allow important future autonomous abilities)<p>- Initial market: The top n cities + their suburbs. The Netherlands. Late Generation Y early Z with a median+ income.<p>- Car ownership in NL is expensive and costs about 250-700 euros&#x2F;month all in for a cheap to mid range vehicle.<p>- Cars are generally used for less than one hour per day.<p>- Generation Y and Z are less into ownership and status, more into “unlimited” and ease of use subscription services.<p>- The trend of (large) companies going towards 2-3 on premise working days and 2-3 WFH days per week will reduce rush-hour load. Companies going for a “only be at the office when necessary&#x2F;for social cohesion reasons” solution will further reduce load.<p>- Autonomous driving is key in the near future. Initially we would need to figure out how to overcome this. Ideally the vehicle drives itself to our customers doorstep when requested.<p>-----<p>As with any idea, there are lots of pro’s&#x2F;cons to this.
