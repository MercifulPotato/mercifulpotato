There can be serious developmental consequences to this, some of which were showing early signs.<p>The specialist diagnosed his tonsil enlargement as grade 3 (4 maximum) and recommended tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy. This is recommended in grade 3s with his symptoms; strongly advised in grade 4s. But the specialist gave them thorough context that led them to go against his advice. Children go through 2 growth spurts of the neck around ages 5-7 and ages 10-12. After these growth spurts the ratio of tonsil mass to neck cavity decreases, giving even large tonsils more room -- possibly enough to no longer require surgery.<p>They pursued simpler treatments like saline sprays before bed to make nose breathing easier, which greatly reduced snoring. Developmental delays were caught up, and now at 6 years old they are glad they avoided the surgery, though admit it wasn&#x27;t necessarily bad advice and were prepared to reconsider it if no progress was shown in 6 or so months.')
