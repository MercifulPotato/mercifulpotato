Given the software stack described there is a realistic chance of this happening implicitly due to ORM mappers.<p>But then the way tables don&#x27;t map well to 1-to-many mappings and joins still returning data in tables this can also be a problem. Especially if a large field get duplicated a lot. RDBMS really should go from 2d-Tables to proper nested types for <i>results</i> IMHO.')
