While I think our interests are aligned, I&#x27;ll let you be the judge. What would be good <i>for me</i> as a curious developer interested in the language, and who has had a years-long low-level FOMO about it, I would like to be able to wade in and <i>do something</i> with it, like I did with Clojure and Erlang, confident that I could, in the end, make it <i>do stuff</i> (since others had already made it <i>do stuff</i>, first).<p>I do really honestly believe that Haskell needs a &quot;paragon project&quot; like Matrix or Jepsen that has proven itself useful to the world without respect to its Haskellness, and then show that this solution was much easier in Haskell.<p>I keep getting down-voted on this thread, and I expect it to continue. Friends thought I was nuts to give up on Lost after season 1, or The Hobbit after movie 1, or the GoT books after book 3. After years of hearing much talk and seeing no walk, I&#x27;m giving up on Haskell. More than that, I&#x27;m going to call out anyone talking it up to give specifics because literally everyone I&#x27;ve every spoken to about it gives it a very high regard, but have never, ever written a line of it.')
