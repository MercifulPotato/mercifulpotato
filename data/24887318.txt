If anything, it seems like more of an intrusion into my time or nuisance when I&#x27;m trying to finish work for the day.<p>We have also tried team &quot;catch-ups&quot; where our team gets on a call and tries to talk about non work things, but there&#x27;s always one employee who&#x27;s a bit too political that just derails the whole thing into political nonsense (I don&#x27;t really identify with either party but to be transparent these are left leaning co-workers who feel it&#x27;s necessary to complain about trump or how evil his supporters are).<p>Quite frankly, as someone who used to like being in an office, I&#x27;m starting to adapt to remote work and prefer it because I don&#x27;t have to deal with social BS during the work day.')
