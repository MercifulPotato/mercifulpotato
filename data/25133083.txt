It&#x27;s very easy to slap a price tag on something &#x27;wrong&#x27; and then complain it doesn&#x27;t do the right thing ;-)<p>A PC with $4k worth of PCIe storage but no video output or networking would be very expensive but not very good at games.<p>A Mac with a reasonable video card (say, an RX580 or better) and a general i5-level CPU would run Windows and most games just fine. Won&#x27;t be a 144Hz 4k party, but 1440&#x2F;1080 for recent games on decent settings and at least 60FPS will work. But that&#x27;s not a lot of difference to any other computer...<p>Difference would be what you start off with. If you buy any $1000 laptop that only has a CPU-integrated GPU but does have Thunderbolt 3, you can add an eGPU for that GPU power that you need and you&#x27;d be good to go.<p>If you buy a cheaper laptop that happens to have some sort of 1050 in it, it would be cheaper, but it probably won&#x27;t have Thunderbolt 3 and then you&#x27;d be stuck with a GPU that will be a bottleneck faster than your CPU.<p>The biggest problem I&#x27;d see is that most Macs don&#x27;t come with dedicate GPUs, and when they do it&#x27;s a midrange AMD or workstation type GPU, neither of which are great for games (regardless of what computer you stick those in). The higher tier AMD GPUs did come to later Macs, but at that point (the 5000 series) it wasn&#x27;t really all that good. Too bad with the 6000 series we don&#x27;t know if Apple will even add any third party GPU anymore. Also too bad that they got in a fight with nvidia over their crap QA years ago and never got back together. Could have been great...')
