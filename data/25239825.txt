Over here the law limits both the amount of sugar and salt that products can have, so sure, I can make tastier things at home by just using the &quot;proper&quot; sugar and salt amounts. In fact most store bought things are hugely improved by just adding a bit of salt, since they are not allowed to salt them more by law. Most likely not the healthiest thing to do but that&#x27;s where the taste difference comes from for me.')
