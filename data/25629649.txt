If you had &quot;spent&quot; that very limited motivation-time-runway more sparingly on a more-minimal-MVP, perhaps it would have been sufficient.<p>I.e. I&#x27;d suggest looking at the constraints the entirely opposite way around than &quot;weren&#x27;t ready to invest the required time&#x2F;energy&quot; - in this equation, you can (and must) change the &quot;requirements&quot; for time&#x2F;energy, as the time&#x2F;energy available for the project is your core limitation that you should treat (in the short run) as out of your control, especially as it concerns the time&#x2F;energy of others before funding. From the classic project management tradeoffs, this is a &quot;limited budget - adjust scope to match&quot; scenario, not &quot;fixed scope - let&#x27;s see what the budget will be&quot; one.')
