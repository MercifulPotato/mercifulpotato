This restores my faith in tech. I believe that the spirit of innovation and diversity of thought still has a chance to prevail if people embrace the philosophy behind Mission Protocol. If employees want to be activists, then they should either pursue activism in their free-time, change their career to further the cause full-time, or create a company with a mission that furthers their agenda. There&#x27;s no judgement. However, hijacking the mission of large, powerful companies to serve near-sighted political agendas is socially destructive and morally reprehensible.')
