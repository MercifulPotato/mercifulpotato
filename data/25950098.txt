I&#x27;m far enough out of the city that I&#x27;m essentially in a rural area. I like being close enough to a major city that I can go in for theater and things like that in normal times (and access to a major airport).<p>Certainly I could live wherever in the country I wanted to--though western US starts to become more difficult because of timezone differences to Europe--but no interest in moving at this point.')
