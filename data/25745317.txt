Wokeness is not usually a thing in companies which have a competitive edge and a real product people buy because their revenue isn&#x27;t entirely dependent on public opinion and their competitive edge means it&#x27;s hard&#x2F;impossible to replace their product with a competitor&#x27;s (assuming there are competitors even).')
