In Fort Worth, I&#x27;ve seen night shift &quot;supervisors&quot; for the convenience store where I usually stop for gas being offered $18-$22, starting salary. With 1 year experience. Yes, that&#x27;s a shitty job, on a shitty shift, and the pay is nothing to write home about at $36,000 - $44,000 a year, but for someone with nothing more than a high school degree, and clearly a tremendous lack of applicable skills, it isn&#x27;t terrible.<p>If these women want to do porn instead of slaving away at Walmart, hey, more power to them. I don&#x27;t begrudge you your choice, but don&#x27;t act like there&#x27;s no alternative. Entirely too many people make the claim that &quot;there are no jobs for me!&quot; when what they mean is, &quot;There aren&#x27;t any jobs that I want to do, I&#x27;m not supposed to be a janitor, I&#x27;m supposed to be a TikTok star!!&quot;<p>That&#x27;s the big fucking lie our society has told people for the past 40+ years. Most of us, even most of us in high positions in respected companies, are easily replaceable cogs.<p>A lot of people were very concerned about Apple&#x27;s future when Steve Jobs died. Looking at the M1 chip, it seems like Tim Cook and Apple will be just fine.')
