I&#x27;m not sure why it says they &quot;still collect data&quot;. Pretty sure OsmAnd and Maps.ME are not collecting data in any surprising&#x2F;evil ways (particularly as they can work entirely offline!)<p>The article says they &quot;just arenâ€™t as good&quot; which obviously isn&#x27;t very specific, but if you live in an area where the map detail doesn&#x27;t seem so good, then you&#x27;re in luck. Adding details of your neighbourhood to OpenStreetMap is a lot of fun! Might seem like on odd way of looking at things, but seriously. You should try it.
