Think like very old applications (like Control Panel) on Windows 10. I use Firefox so it doesn&#x27;t bother me that much. There&#x27;s a issue in Chromium bug tracker following this, but I can&#x27;t find it right now.<p>* Screen sharing full screen or other windows than browser tabs doesn&#x27;t work on Google Meet &#x2F; MS Teams. This is and has been an issue in Wayland since forever.')
