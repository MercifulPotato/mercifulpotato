So it&#x27;s not like Ancient Greece was all about this philosophy stuff and we can just go blame the Christians ...<p>I don&#x27;t know why we saw an &#x27;end&#x27; to the golden age of ancient Greek philosophy. BUT .... the Greeks were conquered by the Romans. Christianity developed in the Holy Land and spread through Rome. Early Christianity was <i>highly</i> influenced by Platonism (Plato). So in some ways Christianity is an <i>outgrowth</i> of Greek Philosophy. Or at least not orthogonal to it. And if anything, maybe blame the Romans for the end of Greek philosophy? Though the<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ancient_Greek_philosophy#Hellenistic_philosophy" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ancient_Greek_philosophy#Helle...</a><p>&gt; It was philosophers that got us out of that Dark Ages mess, and no small number of them lost their lives in doing so.<p>The Dark Ages weren&#x27;t really &quot;dark&quot;<p>&quot;As the accomplishments of the era came to be better understood in the 19th and 20th centuries, scholars began restricting the &quot;Dark Ages&quot; appellation to the Early Middle Ages (c. 5thâ€“10th century),[3][7][8] and now scholars also reject its usage in this period.[9] The majority of modern scholars avoid the term altogether due to its negative connotations, finding it misleading and inaccurate.[10][11][12] Petrarch&#x27;s pejorative meaning remains in use,[1][2][13] typically in popular culture which often mischaracterises the Middle Ages as a time of violence and backwardness.&quot;<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Dark_Ages_(historiography)" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Dark_Ages_(historiography)</a><p>Since Steve&#x27;s article uses this history as an analogy for the state of Computer Science &#x2F; Programming, and then draws on it as an argument for why we need &quot;philosophers&quot; (IMHO philosophers of computer science might well do something completely unexpected and not what is suggested here), I think it&#x27;s important to address the historical inaccuracies.<p>If anything I think more Science &amp; Technology Studies folks &#x2F; Philosophy <i>of</i> Computer Science, or anthropology folks studying the culture and implicit biases of computer scientists and software engineers would be useful &amp; kinda awesome.')
