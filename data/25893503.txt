Why don&#x27;t you compare the US to countries that aren&#x27;t island nations or quasi-island nations, like the EU?<p>Do you think the EU doesn&#x27;t believe in science?<p>You also ignore the fact that the majority of public health governance in the US, by a wide margin, is at state and local level.  I voted for Obama, twice.  I volunteered for his campaign.  And I don&#x27;t think his administration handled the Swine Flu well at all.  I had a toddler at the time with asthma, who was in a category of vulnerable people.  Folks like you didn&#x27;t care about Swine Flu, but for those of us who did, it was unpleasant.  I rode a subway to work daily at the time, and it was widespread and completely uncontained.  I&#x27;m not a partisan.  I don&#x27;t think the Trump administration handled the virus well at all.  I also don&#x27;t think the Obama administration would have handled it well.  Better?  Likely.  But they wouldn&#x27;t have done a good job.  If you think the US government does a good job at anything other than warfare, you haven&#x27;t worked with the US government on much.<p>Your comparisons of the US vs. island nations (SK is not able to be accessed from the north, as you damned well know) with fractions of the population of the US is ridiculous, and betrays a partisan bias that believes that the Federal government in the US is supremely capable, as long as my preferred candidate runs it.  Obama, who again, I voted for and campaigned for, couldn&#x27;t handle launching a website for his flagship legislation.  Because the US Federal Government is broken and can&#x27;t execute on shit.  And because of partisans, who truly believe the government magically becomes competent when the leader changes, it won&#x27;t get fixed.  Never mind that over 90% of the personnel of any agency remain no matter who is president.  No, this time, they&#x27;ll get the (funding|scientific backing|whatever) they didn&#x27;t get from the previous person in the other party.  What a load of tripe.')
