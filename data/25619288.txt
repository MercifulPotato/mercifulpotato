Instead, they’re all reactions to what his argument is presumed to imply.<p>This other article [1] has what is purportedly a related, direct quote: “In all of these circumstances, he [Kareem] is not even the only person present, much less is there anything to suggest that he’s actually the target of any of those specific attacks.”.<p>So yeah, I’d agree that even the original sources are likely flamebait for what a real headline should be “DOJ Lawyer: national security precludes disclosing who is on kill list, including Americans” (at trial).<p>It’s not clear to me that this argument holds (it’s close enough to “we are going to imprison you, but we can’t tell you why”, violating habeus corpus), but at least it’s clear that this is the argument they’re making.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wsws.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;18&#x2F;kill-n18.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wsws.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;18&#x2F;kill-n18.html</a>')
