As a result, documentation in some repositories link to a gliffy diagram and some include a png.<p>Neither are ideal:<p>- Gliffy diagrams outside of the repo are not versioned with the documentation and are not immediately visible in PRs so we risk the diagrams becoming out of date<p>- PNGs require a lot of effort and unless we include an editable file to spit out a png, devs will have to manipulate the existing PNG which becomes a bit messy - if we do include an editable file, it would mean an additional large file living alongside the code and PRs would be messy everytime it was updated.<p>I&#x27;m assuming we can&#x27;t be the only organisation who has encountered this issue. Are there any tools&#x2F;processes you could recommend? I&#x27;d be interested in hearing anyone&#x27;s approach to technical documentation. Are we just approaching technical documentation in the wrong way?<p>Cheers')
