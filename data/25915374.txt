All of us even slightly aware of the security problems of browsing the web have something (for myself I immediately thought, I should add those domain names to my PiHole, just to be safe), but that&#x27;s the problem with asymmetry: it costs you a lot to defend against <i>everything</i>; it costs a determined attacker very little in a marginal cost sense to spread their efforts across threat vectors. You&#x27;re pretty sure disabling JS makes things safe. Do you allow CSS? That&#x27;s another vector. What about all those cool new HTML5 apis we have now? Heck, it&#x27;s tough to get developers to think at all about accessibility, what are the odds the developers who have to support that under-appreciated field put in a ton of extra time to make sure the features are fuzz tested? Anyone tested what you can do with the subtitle track to an HTML5 video player?<p>I bought a copy of The Tangled Web a decade ago and never finished it because the whole thing was just too depressing to really come to grips with and instead I too have uBlock, a PiHole, some other Chrome extensions and a Mac as a sort of double-condom to make me feel safe without making me much safer. We are all the US military, happily stockpiling the wrong assets to fight the last war.')
