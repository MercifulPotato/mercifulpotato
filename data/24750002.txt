You have no clue about what his family situation was like, but you&#x27;re squinting your eyes at the shadows on the wall to draw your own narrative about a mother left alone with bills and groceries while he&#x27;s out backstroking in the ocean, and then wringing your hands over your own invention.<p>It&#x27;s HN&#x27;s god of the gaps. Except god, it&#x27;s some awful, unredeemable character trait that someone else must have that explains the bit that we see.<p>Let&#x27;s even assume for a second you&#x27;re right. He saddled his wife with everything while he stalked a common octopus. Now let&#x27;s assume he&#x27;s honest in the movie and he indeed came to understand his place in life and became a better dad and husband than he would have ever been. So what?<p>Someone in this thread calls the movie &quot;wealthy adventure porn&quot;, but this thread is aspersion porn. Just like if I decided to lambast you for spending your precious time on this earth judging some guy from the HN comment section instead of being the man that you and your family deserve (to be clear, I think such a judgement is ridiculous).')
