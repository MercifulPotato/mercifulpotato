Finding anything about how these items will fail is an exercise in frustration since model numbers are frequently shuffled around year to year for minor&#x2F;non-existant feature &quot;upgrades&quot;.<p>I actually don&#x27;t care all that much about how great a washer or whatever is at cleaning so much as I care that I never have to think about servicing&#x2F;replacing it.')
