They will each have different skins (and t-shirts), but all be identical under the hood. The Rebel Browser will allow you to consent to accessing porn, and when the Smart Browser reports that it is the Smart Browser to sites its users visit, they will only be served articles, ads and search results that make them feel smarter than everyone else. The Safe Browser will have an &quot;Important Business&quot; mode that will allow you to consent to accessing porn, but it will examine your face first to ostensibly determine if you&#x27;re a serious adult. The Rebel browser will also silently examine your face, and for the same reason - to track your porn preferences.<p>The day it will be feature-complete is when sites get an API for bricking your computer, which is routed through an algorithmic federal judge.')
