Item(by='root_axis', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610744215, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25794086, text='&gt; <i>We have generally acknowledged that things that are important to everyone and are monopolized need to be regulated.</i><p>Social media is not important, it&#x27;s an entertainment triviality on par with online gaming. Further, big tech does not monopolize online communication by <i>any</i> definition of the word, twitter and facebook are one of many thousands of ways to communicate online, and most internet users use a variety of platforms as using one does not preclude the ability to use another. Additionally, I&#x27;m not saying these companies shouldn&#x27;t be regulated, check my reply in the sibling thread, what I&#x27;m opposed to is the violation of property and first amendment rights by forcing these companies to pay for hosting content they disagree with.<p>&gt;<i>Social media is practically the only effective way to participate in the global community</i><p>Totally false. The &quot;global community&quot; such that it exists on the internet is spread across many hundreds of thousands of applications, sites, and communities.<p>&gt; <i>they now have to deal with the implications of being the keepers of public discourse,</i><p>No, your reasoning here is completely backwards. The fraction of people who willingly choose to participate in public discourse on these sites have to deal with the implications of choosing to use such sites. There are many alternative options available.<p>&gt; <i>It&#x27;s a little ironic to argue that booting people off of their platform increases competition and then mention their new competitor that was immediately wiped off the face of the internet.</i><p>No. Parler moved to a new hosting platform called Epik the same one that hosts Gab and others, this is a business opportunity for Epik created by the fact that AWS did not want to do business with Parler, this <i>reduces</i> AWS&#x27;s dominance in the market.<p>&gt; <i>it&#x27;s also a reflection that Twitter has so dominated the marketplace that your only customers as a new social media site are going to be nutjobs.</i><p>Not true. The reason that Parler attracts extremists is because it was designed to attract them. There are many other platforms that don&#x27;t have this issue<p>&gt; <i>The community is a huge part of a social media site</i><p>Social media sites do not own the community, they can visit as few or as many different social media sites as they want and its trivial for them to do so.<p>&gt; <i>Because there is no meaningful competitor.</i><p>Totally false. Discord, tiktok, mastadon, pinterest, twitch, vimeo, tumblr, irc, medium, soundcloud, wordpress, blogger ete and that&#x27;s just off the top of my head.<p>&gt; <i>Because your friends and family want to use Twitter, and probably won&#x27;t switch, so you have to use Twitter and Facebook.</i><p>That doesn&#x27;t matter. If your friends use a platform that you want to use then follow the rules of the platform and you&#x27;ll have no problem. A lot of my friends communicate over Steam chat, that doesn&#x27;t mean Valve owes me anything - it&#x27;s an entertainment triviality.<p>&gt; <i>Because Facebook and Twitter have spent so long maximizing engagement that people barely bother looking for other sources of news and information.</i><p>This is false, but even if it were true, anyone who gets their information exclusively from social media is to blame for their own media consumption habits.')
