(Note: it has a weird scp url syntax you have to look up.) Coupled with a fancy ~&#x2F;.ssh&#x2F;config that sets per-host ProxyCommands and such, now I always edit locally.<p>Correspondingly, I have a lot of cool plugins in my .vimrc now, and my editor works better.<p>Bonus: no remote echo typing lag!
