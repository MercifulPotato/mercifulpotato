We&#x27;re thinking about setting aside a few PoPs where a group of people can pool money to purchase one. Would love to hear your thoughts on that.<p>I think the biggest question for the casual retail investor would be how well will a given PoP perform. If there is high revenue variability between PoPs due to housing density, per capita income, etc., you will start facing disgruntled investors pretty soon. The other issue with smaller investment size is that the &quot;management fees&quot; are likely to be higher - you need to address more questions and concerns from individuals about your product. Pooling PoPs might solve both of these issues elegantly with a more complicated financial instrument.<p>Edit: I also noticed you used the term &quot;franchisee&quot; agreement. I think this might be slightly misleading to investors because franchise owners generally have a lot of control over aspects of the business, whereas what you&#x27;re selling is a more traditional financial instrument.')
