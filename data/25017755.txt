Item(by='slg', descendants=None, kids=[25019049], score=None, time=1604776276, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25017469, text='&gt;First at this point I don&#x27;t trust many of the groups and institutions<p>The Trump Administration itself couldn&#x27;t find evidence of widespread voter fraud.[1]<p>&gt;Also I don&#x27;t know anyone that is claiming &quot;widespread&quot; voter fraud, no one believes there was &quot;widespread&quot; voter fraud in this election it was targeted specific voter fraud at particular places and counties is the contention. Everyone knew going into this what states needed to be won for biden to win. Many of these states were decided by less than 10,000 votes.<p>The 2016 election was one of the closest elections we have ever had and it still would have required roughly 100k votes changed to change the result.  This election is even less close.  Biden is winning PA by 30k, MI by 150k, and WI by 20k.  That alone wins it. You can ignore the close states like GA, NV, or AZ and Biden still wins.  This would have needed widespread fraud in order to switch a true Trump win to a Biden win.<p>&gt;The fact of the matter is that the more room for error in the voting process the less likely people are to trust the outcome.<p>This flows the other direction too.  Voting being suppressed makes people trust the outcome less too.  How can an election have integrity if people who want to vote can&#x27;t?  If that is the outcome of strict voting laws, shouldn&#x27;t we require some higher level of evidence of voter fraud in order to justify this cost of people losing their vote?<p>[1] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apnews.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;f5f6a73b2af546ee97816bb35e82c18d" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apnews.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;f5f6a73b2af546ee97816bb35e82c18d</a>')
