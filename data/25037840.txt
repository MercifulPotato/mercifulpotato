For most people I wouldn’t recommend taking on deadlifts or squats without a trainer or a buddy to spot proper form.<p>This advice comes from myself who in the past dove into numerous exercises after watching 1 video, had crappy form, and had pain as a result. Slow and steady with proper form is definitely the name of the game.')
