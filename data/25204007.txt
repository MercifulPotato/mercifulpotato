There&#x27;s something morally repugnant about them even if logically they are moral.<p>From your wording and most of the responses I assume you hold a, but the tone and comparisons to indulgences, etc. make me think you actually (also?) hold b?<p>I personally hold the contrary opinion to b, but I&#x27;m not sure about a) so I&#x27;m always a little skeptical of the companies claiming to use carbon offsets. But the problem is definitely one of technology (measuring and holding people accountable to the offsetting) rather than an inherent philosophical contradiction in the concept of offsets.')
