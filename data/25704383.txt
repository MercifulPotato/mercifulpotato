Apple changed the pistol to a water gun (mentioned in the article and at [0]), and now all the big emoji sets from Google&#x2F;MS&#x2F;FB&#x2F;Twtr&#x2F;etc. also have a water gun instead of a pistol.<p>Apple also succeeded at preventing the rifle emoji and the Modern Pentathlon emoji (which contained a rifle) from being included, apparently with support from MS.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.emojipedia.org&#x2F;apple-and-the-gun-emoji&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.emojipedia.org&#x2F;apple-and-the-gun-emoji&#x2F;</a>\n[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;technology&#x2F;2016&#x2F;jun&#x2F;20&#x2F;apple-rifle-emoji-phones-unicode" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;technology&#x2F;2016&#x2F;jun&#x2F;20&#x2F;apple-rif...</a><p>It&#x27;s pretty stupid how every other big tech company follows every single bad decision that Apple makes.

Some platforms like Slack&#x2F;Discord allow for adding your own emoji which is nice. Language should not be controlled by a single entity.')
