It included what was called the &quot;obnoxious advertising clause&quot;.<p>&gt; <i>3. All advertising materials mentioning features or use of this software must display the following acknowledgement: This product includes software developed by the &lt;organization&gt;.</i><p>There&#x27;s a good reason why we no longer use BSD-4 anymore.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gnu.org&#x2F;licenses&#x2F;bsd.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gnu.org&#x2F;licenses&#x2F;bsd.html</a><p>&gt;  The result is a plethora of licenses, requiring a plethora of different sentences. When people put many such programs together in an operating system, the result is a serious problem. Imagine if a software system required 75 different sentences, each one naming a different author or group of authors. To advertise that, you would need a full-page ad. This might seem like extrapolation ad absurdum, but it is actual fact. In a 1997 version of NetBSD, I counted 75 of these sentences. (Fortunately NetBSD has decided to stop adding them, and to remove those it could.)')
