I have been looking for such a platform for a long time but couldn&#x27;t find one. Therefore, I developed a quick solution for myself some years ago:  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;constructeev.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;constructeev.com&#x2F;</a> \nI used it for many use cases (for my students, team, workshops).
