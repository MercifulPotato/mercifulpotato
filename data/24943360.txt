I&#x27;m a shy past 24, and I came to the same conclusion. Nothing matters, we&#x27;re all small and insignificant-pale-blue-dot-and-all-that. I also lose interest once the shininess and allure wears off. This mindset can be freeing; nothing matters so do what makes you happy. The closest answer I&#x27;ve got is to work a basic job at Costco&#x2F;Trader Joe&#x27;s&#x2F;etc. and chill through life, while focusing on simple pleasures like drinks with friends, etc.')
