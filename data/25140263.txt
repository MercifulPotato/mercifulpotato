Item(by='RHSeeger', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605723456, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25139995, text='&gt; choosing who gets to live and who doesn&#x27;t<p>It&#x27;s worth noting that, to many people, someone that isn&#x27;t born yet isn&#x27;t a &quot;who&quot; at all yet. That is, in my opinion, why we see such a large gap in opinion between &quot;pro life&quot; and &quot;pro choice&quot;; (many of) the former think of it as killing, (many of) the later don&#x27;t see the unborn as a distinct life, just another part of the mother. That disconnect leads to a lot of talking past each other.')
