Item(by='cyxxon', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612202794, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25990400, text='&gt; On a social network, however, nothing is that self-contained. Any time you see something that looks like a name or a picture, you expect to be able to click on it and go see that user, their profile, and their posts. A TV show application doesn’t work that way. If you’re on season 1 episode 1 of Babylon 5, you don’t expect to be able to click through to season 1 episode 1 of General Hospital.<p>That is exactly what I&#x27;d expect, and that is how small websites like IMDB work. I am on the page for a General Hospital episode, and via the actors in the episode or whatever other part I can click through to Babylon 5, or the other way around, or anywhere else.')
