Item(by='gopalv', descendants=None, kids=[24824113], score=None, time=1603093322, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24800322, text='&gt; Their cars have a reputation of being reliable and their spares are cheap.<p>It is hard to quantify how big a leap Maruti was in the 80s and early 90s for the Indian middle class.<p>The reliability jump from a Fiat rebadged as a Premier Padmini(&quot;If there&#x27;s no oil under it, there&#x27;s no oil in it&quot;) to a Maruti 800 was world changing. The Ambassador was reliable, but maintenance heavy &amp; the Contessa was ridiculously expensive to maintain. Plus they were the first cars to come out with the &quot;normal stick shift&quot; with synchromesh instead of the steering shift bar which required way more delicate balancing of the throttle.<p>Also the service center distribution along with the dead simple 3-cylinder configuration meant that every bike or truck mechanic had enough tools to &quot;fix it up&quot; to drive to the nearest service station. And the parts were cheap because everyone bought one (the monsoon season was different from a car, than a rain-coat on a bajaj).<p>The entirety of the scenes playing around me those years was literally identical - went from Bajaj Chetak to a Maruti 800, then an additional Kinetic Honda for the wife and the kids buying a Scooty or a Pulsar.')
