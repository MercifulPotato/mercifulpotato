Or is that the usage when playing them for a period of time (i.e., downloading assets on the fly)?  And I thought that DVD games were huge (4.5 - 8 GB), but I haven&#x27;t really kept up with current trends.<p>Edit -- just did some quick searches, it appears some games require 50 - 100 GB minimum storage -- is that what is downloaded, or do they generate game assets from compressed data after installation?')
