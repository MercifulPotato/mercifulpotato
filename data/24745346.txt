I think I might after reading this article, but not in the comments. Maybe I will write about it on my future blog.<p>I worked with an artist called DMX Krew, in the UK a lot. He is like an old school(not so much to me, as I am 35) electro music producer&#x2F;performer. And when my tracks with Kreayshawn popped off I had different fun opportunities for a bit. VIce Italy flew me to Milan to DJ a party for 400 euros, and the  marketing was that I was DMX&#x27;s producer (like the rapper DMX), which I was not.. But I just sort of pretended to be, and I during my set I would randomly drop in songs by DMX just to get people excited.')
