I run it on Ubuntu 20.04 in a virtualbox VM running on Ubuntu 20.04 as I keep my work stuff in a VM.  Audio and video work fine, although I generally use phone audio because my bluetooth doesn&#x27;t seem to work in the VM.  It works fine on the host OS though.  Also, I can use phone audio with the USB webcam on the PC providing the video and it works great.')
