With the proper set and setting, dying will feel normal, as it is, just another part of life. Yoga, meditation and breathing are also great ways to achieve that kind of consciousness state.<p>By the way, probably the biggest issue with dying is that in most western cultures it has become a huge taboo, which is kind of ridiculous given we all are going to die at some point. Death should be something that we accept and welcome, not something that we fear and reject. That doesn&#x27;t mean we should seek death, just that it is one of the most natural things in life.')
