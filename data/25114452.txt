It&#x27;s pretty obvious that Yelp wouldn&#x27;t do this if their contracts didn&#x27;t cover it.  The question is whether the contracts and sales language being used are worded to mislead the restaurant owner.  I see no reference to contract language or sales language anywhere in the article or this thread.')
