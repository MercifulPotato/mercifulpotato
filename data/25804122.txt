Online dating is filled with sugar babies, catfishes, or doctored up photos beyond belief. Also it instigates a relationship to be solely through text. I mean jesus dating is about vetting and days or weeks of texting before actually meeting one another nowadays. Nobody wants to do anything physically anymore unless they&#x27;ve actually met you. It&#x27;s to the point that it&#x27;s almost a waste of time. COVID restrictions certainly haven&#x27;t helped either.<p>I wonder if US culture will ever revert. I think it&#x27;s gone down a very dangerous path for the middle class. It will be only a matter of a few decades before we adopt the Japanese strategy of paying women to retire and have families instead of advancing their careers because of major population decline.')
