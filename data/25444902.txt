I mean, you can try that, but it is a bit awkward. The usecase is mostly &quot;I&#x27;ve got some matrices and I want to try some things with them before writing a couple thousand lines of FORTRAN with a bunch of ugly BLAS calls.&quot;<p>Most programming languages are tools for making tools. Matlab is the tool itself.<p>I&#x27;ve seen scripts where you have to set up your matrices, manually put them in particular named variables, and run them through a script that was basically a bunch of matlab shell commands listed one after another. That&#x27;s not scalable of course, but if elderly professors were willing to mess around with makefiles, dependencies, interfaces, and importing stuff then grad students would all find themselves unemployed.')
