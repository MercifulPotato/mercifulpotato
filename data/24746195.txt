Live and Learn!<p>-<p>To be “thrown for a loop” or “knocked for a loop” refers to being bewildered, dazzled, disoriented and shocked by some event (“AT&amp;T and T-Mobile were thrown for a loop last week when the Department of Justice sued to block AT&amp;T’s planned acquisition of T-Mobile,” CNET, 9&#x2F;5&#x2F;11). The phrase first appeared in print in the 1920s, and comes from what the Oxford English Dictionary terms “a centrifugal railway,” but which is, no doubt, better known as a “roller coaster.” The “loop” on roller coaster runs is the point where the coaster arcs upward through a complete circle, leaving passengers upside down at its apex. The term was initially used in the literal roller coaster sense and then to describe aerobatic maneuvers by pilots “looping the loop,” and finally in boxing to mean a powerful punch that downed an opponent, before acquiring its modern “OMG!” usage.<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.word-detective.com&#x2F;2012&#x2F;04&#x2F;knock-for-a-loop-knock-someones-socks-off&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.word-detective.com&#x2F;2012&#x2F;04&#x2F;knock-for-a-loop-knock...</a>')
