It&#x27;s always been design-by-committee languages. As a consequence, since I began, we&#x27;ve always had coding standards that limited what portions we could use for which projects (usually with options to try out novel parts of the language&#x2F;standard library with extra reviews). And this is even true with C, though the restrictions weren&#x27;t as severe (working in embedded, typically mandating no&#x2F;limited use of malloc&#x2F;free and no recursion, direct or indirect).')
