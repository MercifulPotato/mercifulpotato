Or that it was area the people were allowed to be in, hence the other non cops in the area and so it’s not a problem that they were let it. Not that the cops were just abandoning there job and letting people into an area they shouldn’t have.<p>I have no context for where this is and if it’s true but I think you are misrepresenting the above comment.')
