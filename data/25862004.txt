It&#x27;s not farfetched to see that certain government organizations would want to disrupt that, or at a minimum gain control over the founder to be able to direct things how they please.<p>Regardless, intelligence community subpoint aside, I think the fact that third-party criminals would want to kidnap him and force the transfer of his bitcoin mega-fortune is very plausible, even if you don&#x27;t see governments as a possible threat vector.<p>I do agree in general that maintaining pseudonomynity helped keep the focus on the project and not the person(s). But I think it&#x27;s undeniable that being publicly known as a figure with billions of dollars of value stored in their brain puts a target on one&#x27;s head. And it puts a target in a way that being a normal fiat billionaire does not, because you can&#x27;t just wire a billion dollars to another country without having the transfer stopped, whereas with bitcoin once they force him to transfer Bitcoin (if he caved to torture etc) it&#x27;s irreversible.')
