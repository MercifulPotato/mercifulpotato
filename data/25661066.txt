Given that she was homeless, trans, and talked pretty openly open her internal and external struggles, I have my suspicions about what happened.<p>I feel pretty gutted because I support a couple of people on Patreon, and if I had come across her Twitter six months ago and saw the state she was in, I would have jumped at the opportunity to became a Patron to try to help her get back on her feet.<p>Not much of a point here, other than to try and pay attention to people a little bit more, and help out where you can.')
