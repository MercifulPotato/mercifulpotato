So far as protesters were engaged in crimes worthy of arrest the FBI is within it&#x27;s pervue.<p>That said: if arrests were made outside of criminal investigation we would hope the data collected was not retained.<p>Understood that the portland protests are a politically sensitive topic... But the fact the FBI was using all of its capabilities in a situation that seems to have the hallmarks of one interesting to federal prosecutors is not surprising (to me).<p>Hope the downvoters can see my point.......')
