I see a site that is (in)famous for being full of self-proclaimed right-wing &quot;patriots&quot; who are calling for violence against people due to political beliefs.<p>Someone then decide to associate with these people by joining the site.  They may not personally post messages calling for violence, but are now associated with them.  And the response is: well sure I&#x27;m in the group but I don&#x27;t actually agree with any of this.<p>Then my question is: why did you join in the first place?  If you don&#x27;t agree with the most vocal 1% (I SERIOUSLY doubt that number after spending time perusing the site), and you don&#x27;t denounce what they&#x27;re saying, what do you expect others to think?  We&#x27;re supposed to read your mind that you&#x27;re part of a &quot;silent dissent&quot; and just joined the site because...?<p>People were banned from facebook and twitter for calling for violence, if you switched sites specifically to follow that person I have a REAL tough time believing you don&#x27;t support them.')
