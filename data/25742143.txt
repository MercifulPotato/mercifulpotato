The model is switching between windows, each of which can have some layout of panes.  This is approximately never what I want for a long-running thing I can detach from and reattach to, from a different terminal with different connections.  Further, it supports multiple attachments by each having them see the same exact thing.  For terminals that are different sizes, it shoves everything into an area the minimum height and width of all attached clients, and displays everything outside that as a field of periods.<p>I really prefer screen&#x27;s functionality, instead.  \nEach pane can be independently switched to any of the pool of underlying ptys being managed.\nThe exact layout of panes is more of an ephemeral thing.  On wide terminals I can split side-by-side, on narrow ones I can split top-above-bottom (and these can even be different for different clients connected to the server).
