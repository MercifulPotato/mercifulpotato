Item(by='black_puppydog', descendants=None, kids=[24933958], score=None, time=1603993579, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24932794, text='&quot;Copycat&quot; in this context didn&#x27;t mean literally copying TPB (although that did happen and was actually made possible by them dumping their DB at some point IIRC).<p>Most torrent sites do seem to have an own code base. It&#x27;s not like they run the same software (or at least they have different themes, I never actually checked).<p>It is also neither surprising nor bad that the sites still have the same goals&#x2F;design basics. They all solve the same problem, so they will end up looking similar overall. No problem with that.<p>What <i>is</i> being criticized here (by me, I don&#x27;t wanna put words into Warg&#x27;s mouth since it&#x27;s an old, probably misremembered interview) is that the way that they deliver that &quot;product&quot; (in this context: the torrent website itself, not the hosted torrents&#x27; contents!) in an unimaginative way without taking into account the changing battlefield.<p>Fully i2p torrent sites? Niche.<p>Local DHT scraping with an overlay net of torrent index exchange Ã  la yacy or magnetico? Niche.<p>And apparently: hosting anywhere that is not immediately susceptible to direct US influence, i.e. NOT on namecheap+cloudflare? Still <i>kind of</i> niche. Wtf?')
