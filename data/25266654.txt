You still have the same amount of time, just shifted to a different end, and maybe you&#x27;re a bit better off that way, but it&#x27;s still the minority of the day.<p>The real solution is to figure out how to love a larger percentage of your day. A lot of this has to do with cultivating the right attitude and not getting exploited by others. At work, don&#x27;t allow your employer to work you to the bone; work at a steady and enjoyable pace, take lots of breaks to socialize with colleagues, get coffee, go for walks, eat a long lunch in the park, etc.<p>I get that some of you have draconian bosses and this won&#x27;t work, but there are many on here that it will work for that aren&#x27;t taking advantage of it. I also bet you might find that you start doing better work, because you feel better and have more creative energy and mental stamina. Now, you have to figure out how to enjoy other parts of your day too. What about that crappy commute, can you move closer and bike or walk in?<p>I&#x27;ve lived the majority of my life (mid 30s now) waiting for &quot;my time&quot;. I remember growing up I just loved to lay in bed at night and think. This was well before smartphones, I&#x27;d literally just lay there and think for hours, because that was the most &quot;my time&quot; of the whole day and I loved it. But as I&#x27;ve gotten older I&#x27;ve realized the entire day is my time and it&#x27;s my responsibility to make it as enjoyable as I can.')
