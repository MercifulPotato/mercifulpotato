I&#x27;ve mistakenly thought that for years (more vitamin D, &quot;it&#x27;s S.A.D&quot;, no coffee for months, more exercise, etc etc), but I had to hit a wall hard before I encountered the help that I realized I needed my whole life.<p>This is actually what I&#x27;m afraid of. I haven&#x27;t confirmed it yet, I&#x27;m still on my medication now. I might be developing some kidney problems (VPA is hard on kidneys and liver), so who knows. Based on your experience, and what others have mentioned, I might look for a psychiatrist I trust as an out-patient and see what my options are. I&#x27;m still not convinced the medication is stopping any psychosis either, but I&#x27;d rather not find that out the hard way.')
