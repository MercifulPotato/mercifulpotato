It was a alternative to spending 5.5 hours in the train during the day, or flying. (then this service stopped)\nOne thing that is missing is the possibility to take a shower before leaving. I don&#x27;t think there is any public shower in train stations in France any more. Same problem with night coaches: after having walked in a city the whole day, I don&#x27;t want to make the experience bad for the other travellers.')
