Again, citation please.<p>&gt;the author of a book titled “In Defense of Looting” being interviewed uncritically on NPR<p>That&#x27;s what NPR does, they attempt to give a platform without injecting their own opinions into the interview.  Regardless, I&#x27;d again say: citation, I even took the liberty this time for you:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npr.org&#x2F;sections&#x2F;codeswitch&#x2F;2020&#x2F;08&#x2F;27&#x2F;906642178&#x2F;one-authors-argument-in-defense-of-looting" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npr.org&#x2F;sections&#x2F;codeswitch&#x2F;2020&#x2F;08&#x2F;27&#x2F;906642178...</a><p>&gt;Chris Cuomo on CNN rhetorically asking why protesters need to be peaceful<p>It&#x27;s great to take a part of a clip out of context.  If you listen to the FULL clip - he&#x27;s referring to protestors yelling and being angry and not following curfew (which he says they&#x27;ll justifiably arrested for).  In the very same clip he literally says<p>&quot;Looting, arson, violence, now that’s something else. Don’t confuse that with protest or the people doing it with protesters&quot;<p>So yes, taken out of context you can pretend that Cuomo was supporting violence.<p>Citation?  Did I say that yet?<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=_1z0ekwqQX4&amp;feature=emb_title" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=_1z0ekwqQX4&amp;feature=emb_titl...</a>')
