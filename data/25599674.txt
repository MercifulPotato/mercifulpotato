I have a lot of friends from all over the world, that live in the UK.

I was living in UK during the Polish influx, and what I observed was that British people would prefer to use Polish builders as they were doing better work and got things done faster. My landlord was complaining that she was unable to book her favorite Polish builder for some work in the house.<p>Not saying that this is always the case and there weren&#x27;t people who arrived to UK to take advantage of the better social services, but that&#x27;s what my experience was, and maybe it&#x27;s because of the specific bubble I live in.')
