So here&#x27;s our situation.<p>* We&#x27;re getting hit with a huge DDoS attack, repeatedly over 3 weeks, with no sign of stopping<p>* With zero access logs, there was no way to find patterns in the attack, and we had no way to block it<p>* Our service was going offline during these attacks<p>* We introduced access logs that are auto-deleted after 24 hours. We redacted all information about the site&#x2F;page&#x2F;activity etc. but keep IP &amp; User Agent for pattern matching<p>* We were then able to identify a pattern and block the attack on Saturday<p>* Without access logs (even redacted ones), this wasn&#x27;t possible<p>I was hoping a more senior engineer on Hacker News would comment and I can&#x27;t wait to hear how you&#x27;d do it. I have no experience in DDoS protection at all, and this seems like the only possible way. Even rate limiting requires storing IP addresses. But if you know a more privacy-focused way to block these attacks, I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll buy you a few beers when we hang out.')
