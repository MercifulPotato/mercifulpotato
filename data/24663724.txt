It&#x27;s a cultural thing here, too. Just imagine everyone around you constantly trying to pinch every last penny off your purse, in any way they can think of.<p>Or, look at the way the Brexit campaign convinced half of the UK citizens to vote for Brexit with unsubstantiated claims like &quot;350 million to the NHS&quot; or &quot;Millions of migrants from Turkey coming over&quot; etc.<p>In general, I think both OP and you are making the same mistake: assuming that because we&#x27;re citizens of once or currently very poor countries, we&#x27;re doing something different than the more affluent countries, or are somehow backwards, more corrupt, etc.<p>Far as I can tell, rich countries are rich because they&#x27;re better at this game of taking as much as they can from everyone they can anyway they can, than we are.<p>Just think of who is associated with &quot;move fast and break stuff&quot;.
