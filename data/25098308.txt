My career decision method (disclaimer: it might not work for you) boils down to this:<p>1. Estimate $X: how much $$$ investment do I need in order for my family to live off interest for Y years so I never work again? For me right now, $X is 5M and Y is 40 years.<p>2. What do I need to do right now in order to get closer to $X? Maybe it&#x27;s &quot;study computer engineering&quot;. Maybe it&#x27;s &quot;get a job in tech&quot;. Maybe it&#x27;s &quot;apply for a FAANG company&quot;. Maybe it&#x27;s &quot;Go for promo&quot;. Maybe it&#x27;s &quot;Add more to my retirement savings&quot;. Maybe it&#x27;s even &quot;Change my entire fucking career, I&#x27;m at a dead end.&quot; Whatever it is will be different for whatever stage of life I&#x27;m at.<p>3. If not at $X, GOTO 1.<p>4. Retire and do whatever I really want to do with my life.<p>That&#x27;s pretty much it for my state machine. I wish I figured this out in my 20s--if I did, I&#x27;d be much closer to step 4 than I am now in my 40s.')
