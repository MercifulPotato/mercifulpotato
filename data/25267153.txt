For example on Android for VR you can have the sensor data stored in a chunk of memory that can also be read by the GPU, so your last-second time warp can have that smidge less latency by sampling the latest sensor data as hot off the sensor as it gets, without even bouncing off of the CPU.

At some point the slight efficiency wins of UMA are trumped by just the raw horsepower you get from multiple big dies.')
