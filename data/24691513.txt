This comment was written under the assumption that it doesn&#x27;t.)<p>Not if it was a bug in the code. 65k sounds suspiciously close to the limit of 16 bit unsigned int.<p>I&#x27;m guessing the exporter looked roughly like:<p><pre><code>  int exportRow( ... ) {\n    if( &#x2F;* can&#x27;t export or no more rows *&#x2F; ) {\n      return 0;\n    }\n    &#x2F;* export row *&#x2F;\n    return ++someInternalCounter;\n  }\n\n  void export( ... ) {\n    unsigned short nextRow = 0;\n    do {\n      nextRow = exportRow(...);\n    } while(nextRow &gt; 0);\n  }\n</code></pre>\nIn the above example, the export would silently stop after 65k entries.<p>The way people write C in the wild, this wouldn&#x27;t surprise me in the slightest. And with Microsoft being all about backwards compatibility, Excel probably defers to some ancient and long forgotten code when exporting to XLS.')
