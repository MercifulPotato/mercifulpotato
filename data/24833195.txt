I have a background in medicine and it will definitely be more difficult to get anything decent without a formal background in the field. Only because the risks associated are typically higher, so this is almost always a requirement for every decent job&#x2F;career in that space. I saw that you mentioned you were in a bit of a situation, but I&#x27;d say try to do everything you can before eventually deciding whether or not to give up. It&#x27;ll be difficult, but definitely not impossible. Your previous experiences might help you go through the courses a bit easier')
