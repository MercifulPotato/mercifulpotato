On this one...<p>&gt; Nobody can walk upto me and yell &quot;Hey, got 2 mins?&quot; and expect me to attend to them or take offense if I don&#x27;t.<p>Learn to say &quot;No&quot; to this one.  You have to do it politely, of course, but it works.  Wedge in an apology, an explanation, and a counter-offer.  Make the other person feel bad for assuming they were entitled to interrupt you and then steal your time.  Something like, &quot;No, sorry, I really don&#x27;t right now.  I am SLAMMED and have to finish XYZ before noon.  Could you come back at 1:30?&quot;  If they push, just repeat it.')
