This was in the days before the Internet, so I didn&#x27;t know it was only open for visitors on certain days. So, I only got to the front gates. But years later I was watching an X-files episode where they had to go to the telescope. In the episode they were shown driving through a thick jungle over rutted dirt roads. Um... huh, either things had really deteriorated since I had visited or Hollywood takes a lot more artistic license than I would have assumed with something like this.<p>Now that it is being dismantled, I&#x27;m sorry I didn&#x27;t get to see it that day.')
