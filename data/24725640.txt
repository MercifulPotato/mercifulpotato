I have wrote a NNTP server software, although it may help to implement some other things to go with it, such as: federation with other NNTP services (which might or might not use the same software; the protocol is the same regardless of what software it is using), web interface (I have some requirements, such as requiring the NNTP server information and message ID to be displayed even if scripts&#x2F;CSS is disabled), email subscriptions (many people prefer mailing lists, and this is a way to make such a thing to work), etc.')
