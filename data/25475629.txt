Low earth orbit where most satellites hang out doesn&#x27;t have much radiation anyways.<p>The cost savings from using regular chips is so high that I bet SpaceX will continue to use them even in deep space. Just surround them with sheilding. When a $400 desktop cpu is 500X faster than a $40,000 space rated one a couple pounds of shielding is well worth it')
