The employees who work on those people are more akin to what is called &quot;social workers&quot; in US. They are institutionalized to have a budget to pay for food and training costs and the work to look out for job opportunities for these people (frankly the factory owners generally don&#x27;t want to employee these people). These employees make a government salary. The factory owners get frankly sloppy workers they don&#x27;t like but have to cooperate with the government. But this type of work eventually pays off to society when many of these people get out of their old life tracks by having a job and skill where they can stop being beggars or thieves.')
