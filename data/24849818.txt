In the 1950s almost everyone believed in and accepted science—even though this was the time of the A-Bomb and bomb development, back then, people could still differentiate science </i>per se* from the bad applications of science.<p>Now, 60 or 70 years later, I know scientists who, when, say, they go to a party, will disguise their real professions, so bad is Science&#x27;s PR.  (I&#x27;m even in that league but I&#x27;m less sensitive about it than some.)<p>Anyway, I&#x27;d suggest to you that in comparison with these professionals, my hyperbole pails into insignificance.<p>Ha, so you reckon my hyperbole is dramatic and done only to fish for points. That implies you actually think about such matters and consider points important (most of my posts never make it even to two).  Franky, these post would altogether be much better of without them.  For the record, your assertion isn&#x27;t true (not that I expect you to believe what I&#x27;ve said).')
