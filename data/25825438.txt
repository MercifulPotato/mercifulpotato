Do the savings come to you?<p>Some of it, perhaps.  But it&#x27;s likely not that much and only under some circumstances.<p>E.g., if you are just faced w&#x2F; a copay on a visit, your copay is going to be the same at two facilities.<p>Coinsurance is different - there you may realize some savings.   IF you are below your deductible for the year that is also different.  You may realize savings and care.<p>But there are a decent number of patients who for most of their visits will not see much incentive to search.<p>Also... it is possible for these releases to help hospitals coordinate on prices in a way which they currently do not.  (<i>Tacit</i> collusion, not explicit, back-room, definitely-illegal collusion.)<p>Hospital A now knows exactly what Hospital B gets from Aetna, so Hospital A may realize it can hold out for more w&#x2F; Aetna b&#x2F;c Aetna is willing to pay their competitor more for the same procedure.<p>Both of these questions are <i>above all</i> empirical questions and one to which we do not yet know the answer.  I would be wary of confident predictions.')
