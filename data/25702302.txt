I believe that there are hundreds (or thousands?) of engineers working for Apple full time. And I can see that just keeping linux at my home computer updated needs combined efforts of hundreds of people at very least. So it seems very unlikely to me that R&amp;D costs for newer iPhones are negligible. Am I right?')
