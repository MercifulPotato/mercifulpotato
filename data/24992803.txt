We have already seen a few comments about the USB ports being on the left side of the unit, and the fact that this makes the mouse cable cross over for most right-handed users. The PCB shape had to be defined early on so that the industrial designers could get on with the housing design, and I then stared endlessly at the PCB layout, trying to get one of the USB ports to route to the right side without wrecking the signal integrity of the memory or the HDMI; I could not find a way to do this. Left-handed folks and Bluetooth mouse-owners will be happy at least!<p>Ha! I questioned this in an earlier thread (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24980083" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24980083</a>)<p>It&#x27;s really great to see a response that highlights the reasons (and an acknowledgement that it was something they truly did try to address!).<p>But, my comment on the promo photo layouts still stand - having the mouse on the left side just for the clean shot must have just stood out for a lot of people. They should just lampshade it - say they&#x27;re satisfying the lefties for once!')
