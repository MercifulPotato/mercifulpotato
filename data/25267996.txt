If you&#x27;re running for 10 seconds a day, a Lambda is cheaper than owning your own hardware.<p>Similarly, if a car rental costs $20&#x2F;day, it would be silly to say that that&#x27;s expensive because it will cost you $73,000 after 10 years. The needs of a car rental and car ownership are different.')
