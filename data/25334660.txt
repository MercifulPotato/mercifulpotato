Yes, literal language of several allows for 3 or more but we&#x27;d use few then. And it&#x27;s clearly not many - which I put in the 10+ bucket typically.<p>In my opinion, several years in this context between two companies would be at least 7 years total - however, I think 4-5+ years at one company is a sign of complacency or you got lucky. So, I&#x27;d think spending 10 years at two companies very much a sign of complacency or luckiness. I can&#x27;t imagine doing it unless I got really lucky. Great managers, great organization, great team, decent work, and, of course, great pay... but that is incredibly rare as far as the social circle I&#x27;m involved in goes. So, chase the pay at least.')
