By the time the image downloaded I had read some of the documentation about 66, I am a little familiar with s6 and its advantages (I don&#x27;t think any other system makes better use of the kernel than s6) and I was happy to see a simple way to make s6 work.<p>This is really what makes s6 hard and less known, it is missing what 66 provides to average user.<p>I haven&#x27;t used systemd for more than a few times testing distros, and the difference on machines that are older is HUGE.  Anything with systemd on old machinery is like a messed up windows installation dragging its feet to do any little thing.  I can&#x27;t understand how can so many people defend it WHEN THEY HAVEN&#x27;T TRIED ANYTHING ELSE.  It is obvious they haven&#x27;t.<p>I use void and runit and I run a very simple system, so s6&#x2F;66 is a ton of luxury, and between a minimalist runit system and an s6 system there is little performance difference.  But after seeing Obarun I am ready to try 66 on Void.')
