It worked okay-ish, but everything was maxed out all the time and the fans were always spinning. Battery was being drained even when on the charger. Pycharm would lag for a second or two here and there.<p>Now switched jobs and was issued a 2018 MBP with only 16GB RAM and the 2.2GHz i7.  I have gone to the trouble to run everything locally (A single 200MB Python repo + Spark). I don&#x27;t see the same power drain but Pycharm lags VERY hard on its indexing and code insight... sometimes 5-10 seconds.')
