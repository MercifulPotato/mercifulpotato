Some quick googling says that Intel maintains a gross margin of 50% or more, so manufacturing cost is $100 or less, and that doesn&#x27;t include R&amp;D work. This is all just napkin math, but I don&#x27;t see how the M1 would allow Apple to shave more than $50 or so off their prices, which still gets them nowhere near Dell&#x2F;Lenovo&#x2F;HP territory. Apple laptops have substantially better screens than your average &quot;I just want to use the internet&quot; machine, better sound, mic and camera, better hard drive and an aluminium body, all of which has to be paid for somehow.')
