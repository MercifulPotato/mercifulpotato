Do yourself a favor, come visit Italy one day and go the museum or two. See whole range of stuff from stone age, to etruscan art, to roman, to early medieval. It&#x27;s not like it was buried only in one particular place, and period attribution isn&#x27;t that hard and very visible from the art style. Italy is a giant museum under the open sky, some buildings are still standing, rebuilt and repurposed multiple times.')
