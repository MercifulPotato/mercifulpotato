Off the range of my multimeter, I bet. You just see the Miller capacitance and with the grid-plate somewhere around 1.6pF and maybe 20dB gain, it’s not a lot. The input impedance of the guitar amp is usually dominated by the 1 MΩ resistor to ground, and the tube barely registers because the input impedance of a preamp tube is so high. This is usually considered “high impedance” (as opposed to “ultra high” like you see in a piezo amp, which might run 10 MΩ).<p>It is <i>very</i> common to see solid-state equipment with lower input impedances, especially guitar pedals.<p>There’s a lot of weird voodoo electronics repeated around guitarist’s forums so you got to watch out. Just quick fact check: small tubes = high impedance input, in most normal configurations, normal operating conditions (cathode is positive relative to grid).<p>Just as another point of reference—this is why you hear about “tube microphones”. These microphones have a vacuum tube inside them as a preamp &#x2F; buffer, and the reason you might want to use a tube for these applications is precisely because the input impedance is so high. When they moved away from tube mics what you see replacing them is something like a FET, possibly bootstrapped, to try and replicate the naturally high impedance of a tube.')
