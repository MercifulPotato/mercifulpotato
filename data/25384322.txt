There is a development behind that (the development of the city), but you can&#x27;t blame anyone involved. Permanent residents want to live rather cheaper, outside of the city, greener, calmer, etc. Temporary residents require easier access and closer proximity to their (daily&#x2F;vacation&#x2F;business) needs, since they are not familiar with the area. There is disruption of an old industry (hotels) and you can be against that, try to stop it and maybe also successfully stop it. But I am not sure about how much sense this makes. Times change 1. the city and 2. the businesses.')
