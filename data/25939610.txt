Cranking a diesel in -30C weather is ... not a fun experience. Petrol engines are a bit better, but the 5W40 oil is like syrup and the sound the engine makes is not pleasant to hear.<p>With an electric car I can just jump in, press a button and it&#x27;ll just start. In -27C a few weeks ago I timed it and it started blowing in warm air in 3 minutes, in 8 minutes the internal temperature was around 20C. Yes, it affects the range, but I don&#x27;t drive hundreds of km a day, so the convenience and comfort trumps range for me every day.<p>If my car was less shit (Hyundai limiting app availability per country ffs) I could heat up my car with my phone and jump in when it&#x27;s nice and toasty.')
