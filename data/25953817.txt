To quote the inimitable Matt Levine:<p>&gt; Nobody owns stock. What you own is an entitlement to stock held for you by your broker. But your broker doesn&#x27;t own the stock either. What your broker owns is an entitlement to stock held for it by Cede &amp; Co., which is a nominee of the Depository Trust Company, which is a company that is in the business of owning everyone&#x27;s stock for them. This system sounds convoluted but actually makes it easy to keep track of things: If I sell stock to you, I don&#x27;t have to courier over a paper share certificate, or call up the company and have it change its shareholder register. Our brokers just change some electronic entries at their DTC accounts and everything is cool.<p>That simplifies things a bit, but basically yes, no paper transfers ever. There&#x27;s a warehouse somewhere with all the paper certificates in it, they all technically belong to Cede &amp; Co, and when (say) dividends are paid out, they all go to Cede &amp; Co, who transfers the correct amounts to the various brokerages, who transfer the correct amount to their customers.<p>There&#x27;s a hilarious story (by Matt Levine, from which that quote is from) about some of the quirks in the system here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bloomberg.com&#x2F;opinion&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2015-07-14&#x2F;banks-forgot-who-was-supposed-to-own-dell-shares#footnote-1436883540292" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bloomberg.com&#x2F;opinion&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2015-07-14&#x2F;banks-...</a><p>(Although it should be noted, it works fine for an absurdly large volume of transactions; the story is interesting because it is unusual, not because it reveals any deep flaws in the system.)')
