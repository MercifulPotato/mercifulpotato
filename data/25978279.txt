But that&#x27;s the whole point. The app however is scaling at 2&#x2F;3 within that window box and that&#x27;s actually what you want because it gives better results. There&#x27;s nothing special about scaling the whole screen that you can&#x27;t do by scaling each individual window after first snapping all windows to integer sizes.')
