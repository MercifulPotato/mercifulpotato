He already managed a Venture Capital at that time, and I assume had other businesses around. fwiw Canonical might as well be all lost money (millions of revenue, but how about profits?).<p>No idea about Suse.<p>In any case, even if they are great success examples, these can be counted on the fingers of one hand... so I&#x27;d say the sample size is not precisely &quot;enough&quot;, not at least to prove a point.<p>EDIT: (reply to an edited part of the comment)<p>&gt; what it sounds like is we&#x27;re talking about people who want to write OSS but also want ownership and exclusive rights to make money off of it<p>I agree. On the other hand, most of the OSS that exists is created by such people, and what do we prefer? Idealistic but non-existing OSS software? or compromised but existing and useful OSS software? That&#x27;s the question that I feel is behind all the conversations about this topic.')
