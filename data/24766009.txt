I recently signed up for HBO Max thinking it would run on my Roku, because why wouldn&#x27;t it? Turns out that HBO can&#x27;t have more than one paid service streaming to Roku devices at a time per Roku&#x27;s TOS, so they&#x27;re favoring customers that are still running the now-deprecated HBO service.
