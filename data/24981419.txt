But compared to a profits tax, money spent on company purchases also never makes it into the profit column. But money the company later spends on salaries, is taxed by VAT.<p>There&#x27;s an argument that VAT is regressive but this isn&#x27;t it. Who effectively pays (meaning economic incidence) is complicated. But sometimes it works out that poorer people pay a larger proportion of their income in VAT than do richer people. It seems entirely OK to have a mixture of regressive and progressive taxes.<p>And sure, not completely free within the EU, but the range of acceptable rates is pretty wide, maybe 17-27 exist today? I haven&#x27;t done the numbers but France could surely raise an order of magnitude more money from VAT than they collect from corporate profits, if they wished.')
