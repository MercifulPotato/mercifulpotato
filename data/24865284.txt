Item(by='danans', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603417981, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24864816, text='&gt; Why would Uber: 1. need to send messages through text instead of in the app<p>SMS is still the most attention getting messaging medium.  When these messages are in an SMS it looks more like it&#x27;s coming from the driver&#x27;s personal number.  If it were instead sent through the app, people are far more likely to ignore it as a broadcast corporate marketing message.<p>&gt; 2. message only this one user instead of everyone else who also has registered like me (and probably you too)?<p>I got the same sort of message purportedly from an Uber driver, but enough people had reported that number as a source of SPAM by than that my phone automatically marked the message as spam.<p>Therefore, it sure seems like the same numbers are being reused via an SMS proxy service of some kind - or drivers are being provided a list of numbers by Uber to send the same form message.<p>It&#x27;s really no different in that way from all the political text messages that have flooded our phones of late.')
