With &quot;sealed sender&quot;, they don&#x27;t even know who&#x27;s talking to whom: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;signal.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;sealed-sender&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;signal.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;sealed-sender&#x2F;</a><p>There&#x27;s the possibility that Signal could ship a different app in the Play store, but that would require active malice to do in a way that would not be trivial to discover[0], and at some point you do have to trust someone. It&#x27;s not impossible, but it&#x27;s hard to imagine a world in which Signal is compromised but other links in the chain aren&#x27;t, because quite frankly, there are far more easily corruptible or hackable links in the hardware&#x2F;software stack that you use, so Signal would make a pretty inefficient target for someone who wants monetizeable data.<p>[0] ie, an accidental divergence between the two would be more conspicuous')
