Non founder, non board member, non shareholder, just a valuable employee.<p>Did you know all the terms behind the clause? How messy is it to negotiate a comp package in that position? Would the deal have been at stake had you left right after M&amp;A?<p>For founders and key executives who have put key employees under these agreements, would you let those employees know?
