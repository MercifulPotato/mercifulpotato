Even you yourself are using the term &quot;pirate&quot;, which implies stealing.<p>You talk as if &quot;POTENTIAL revenue&quot; is equal to zero, but if you studied economics you would realize that there is such a thing called opportunity cost. It doesn&#x27;t matter if it&#x27;s just &quot;potential&quot; revenue, what you are essentially stealing is someone else&#x27;s opportunity cost.<p>This is a different story if this person created music and gave it away for free intentionally (because he&#x2F;she doesn&#x27;t care, or in an effort to get more audience to monetize in other ways), but if Alice is providing X in exchange for Y, and you take X without giving Alice Y, then it is stealing. Your logic is &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t have consumed X in the first place if it was not free&quot;, and you are right. But at the same time, that does not change the fact that what you did there at the end of the day, no matter how NOT-valuable you see the product, is stealing.<p>For example, this is like drinking a lemonade from a kid&#x27;s lemonade stand without paying the $1 price, and saying &quot;You know what, you should be thankful that I even consumed what you created. I would have never drank this worthless beverage for $1, therefore what I just did is not stealing&quot;')
