Coins, then notes were created because walking around with gold is inconvenient, to say the least.<p>There&#x27;s no reason why these everyday purchases shouldn&#x27;t continue to be done using dollars or another fiat currency. It makes more sense to use the continuously inflated dollars which will are losing purchasing power the longer I hold on to them.<p>Bitcoin is expected to continue rising in value… for example, it doubled ($20k to $40k) is 3-weeks. So the $5 worth of BTC I spent on coffee last month would be worth $10 today and probably a lot more in a few months. Why would I do that?<p>Sure, it&#x27;s been 12 years but in terms of being a monetary good, bitcoin is brand new. It&#x27;s going to be a while before there&#x27;s enough people who own bitcoin to make payments make sense. Lightning Network is great, but it&#x27;s still essentially a beta product and some of the UI&#x2F;UX issues are still being worked.<p>Lightning is where the internet was back in the 90&#x27;s before Netscape and broadband networking were available. Early adopters were fine but it wasn&#x27;t a mainstream thing just yet.')
