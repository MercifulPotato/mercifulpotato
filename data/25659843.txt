Google has infected the whole manufacturing world with their own Android HAL &amp; specific drivers and now it&#x27;s impossible to find any competitive modern SOC running standard Linux decently (with GPU, Linux drivers, etc.). Which is why PinePhone has an old crappy chip and Purism took an automobile chip for their phone. And even that might disappear as IoT&#x2F;Cars&#x2F;Planes&#x2F;etc. are using more&amp;more Android instead of Linux. Even Microsoft is moving to their own chip.<p>The situation is very sad and extremely anti-competitive, but soon, the only way to run your own platform on some modern hardware might be reverse Eng (if that&#x27;s even still legal by then)')
