It&#x27;s in a government&#x27;s interests to encourage companies to compete with each other, and to prevent a single or a handful of companies explicitly or implicitly agreeing to control market pricing to the detriment of consumers.<p>In this case, both Google and Apple set the same 30% pricing, and clearly neither have any incentive to rock the boat and compete with each other, and every incentive to dissuade or prevent other companies from creating competing app stores. When competition in a market fails, it&#x27;s up to the courts or government to step in.<p><i>&quot;I find irony in many people who get probably so knee-jerk opposed to Google&#x2F;Apple and &quot;on Epic&#x27;s side&quot; will find themselves justifying why they should be free to set their own prices when they launch their next product.&quot;</i><p>Its not hypocritical (or even ironic) to say that there should be different rules for companies operating as part of an oligopoly, compared to small business competing in a crowded marketplace.')
