Until we rm -rf&#x27;d the config directory and deleted host root in the process.<p>In our case, fortunately the consequences were minimal as all workloads were stateless. The container scheduler moved all the workloads to other hosts and the host scheduler noticed this VM wasn&#x27;t responding any more and rolled a new one. The whole thing resolved itself in about 5 minutes with no interaction from us - so that was pretty neat.')
