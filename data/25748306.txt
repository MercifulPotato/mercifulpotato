Item(by='lotsofpulp', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610466172, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25748210, text='The issue is the taxes voted on aren’t enough to pay for the item being voted on.  The pensions aren’t getting properly funded, and the amortized cost of the road and accompanying infrastructure isn’t being saved for with taxes collected today.<p>Also, Colorado is expecting one of the biggest economic and population booms in America, so people’s incomes are going up and thinks are looking pretty good.  Try the same in states with stagnant economies and job markets, and even schools won’t get the votes for tax increases.<p>And the nuance of the statement, of course, is people won’t vote for tax increases for things that won’t benefit them.  Roads benefit all car owners, so car owners don’t mind voting for roads.  But taxes for public transportation won’t be voted in.  And people will vote to increase taxes for their own school district.  But not to help subsidize other cities’ schools.')
