Still, more people using ARM software will certainly result in better tested libraries and tools. Intel got where it is now by having a machine on pretty much every developer&#x27;s desk (it can be said that SPARC and MIPS got where they are now by having an x86 on every developer&#x27;s desk too). When a lot of developers have ARM boxes on their desks, a lot of software will be written for ARM first and ported to x86 as an afterthought - or, more accurately as Apple&#x27;s tooling goes, built for ARM and x86 but only tested on ARM.')
