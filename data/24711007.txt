Most of the tools for trying to extract information about people by how they write is helpful. An example from the list is &quot;Gender Detection from Names&quot; under the &quot;Discrimination&quot; heading.<p>And then I gave several examples and an explanation. But to reiterate, tools that help us increase our understand of society are helpful, and can be used for good.<p>The list assumes that a tool that can help discern someone&#x27;s gender will and can only be used to treat someone unfairly. But a researcher could just as well use exactly the same tools to analyze the gender composition of a set of people, for the purposes of advocating for them.<p>FOR EXAMPLE, in this repo:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;waterdatacollaborative&#x2F;Get-the-Lead-Out" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;waterdatacollaborative&#x2F;Get-the-Lead-Out</a><p>What if a researcher were to use data mining tools to find out more information about the children most impacted by lead in the water, for the purposes of helping them.
