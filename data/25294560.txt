Not more as it tends to increase eye fatigue and neck pain. If you follow that recommendation, what matters is the definition (the number of pixels), not the resolution in DPI.<p>So, let&#x27;s run a few calculations. The &quot;retina&quot; resolution is based on a pixel size of 1 arc-minute, that&#x27;s 20&#x2F;20 vision, at 30 degrees, that&#x27;s 1800 pixels. 4k is 2160 vertical, so that&#x27;s about the limit of human vision. So, basically, 4k is what you want at any size.<p>8k is not useless but you are pushing the boundaries here. In order to notice it, you need perfect, over 20&#x2F;20 vision, high luminosity and high contrast. Beyond 8k, you enter superhuman territory, with an exception: you can notice discontinuities at a much higher resolution (vernier resolution), but it only matters if you don&#x27;t have anti-aliasing. And of course, high contrast, luminosity and perfect vision.<p>There are exception. For example there is a limit on how close a screen can be, so having 4k on a tiny smartphone screen is mostly useless. The other end of the spectrum would be VR, with fields of view over 100 degrees, 8k per eye is considered a minimum for an immersive experience.')
