Want just the printer driver?  10 mb.  Want linux drivers?  Here&#x27;s CUPS drivers.  They sell you a printer, here&#x27;s drivers that work, end of story.<p>I adore (and have always adored) my Brother B+W lasers and am thinking about one of the color lasers one of these days, especially now that I am living at home instead of having access to a Xerox network copier at work (we are allowed reasonable personal usage of office supplies, no worries).<p>The Brother fan club is loud and for very good reason.<p>In contrast (I had a brother B+W at home) I owned an HP color laser for my office at school, and nope, never again, the driver package was fucking terrible and while I could usually get it to work after some finangling, it was constantly a pain.  Literally threw it in the trash and got a B+W brother MFC instead even though that was a &quot;step down&quot;.')
