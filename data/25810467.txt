Most complaints were about base PS4. This is how it runs on base PS4, those are the &quot;mayor&quot; game breaking bugs people are crying about: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.twitch.tv&#x2F;videos&#x2F;854702029?t=00h45m00s" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.twitch.tv&#x2F;videos&#x2F;854702029?t=00h45m00s</a> [1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.twitch.tv&#x2F;videos&#x2F;857020318?t=01h09m53s" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.twitch.tv&#x2F;videos&#x2F;857020318?t=01h09m53s</a> [2]<p>TLDR:<p>- 30fps with drops to 20.

Not a game breaking problem since it auto saves often. Saving game is one of the fastest of any games I played, its instant, no slowdowns when autosaving.<p>- has problems with streaming game assets on time (geometry[1], animations[2]).

The rest of the game works exactly as on other platforms, including random animation glitches.')
