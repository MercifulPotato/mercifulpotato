With the ordering keys feature, there&#x27;s no need to specify the number or ID of the ordering keys ahead of time (as one may need to do for traditional message queue partitions). In general, there&#x27;s no provisioning ahead of time, so topics&#x2F;subscriptions will scale as your usage grows. These are a few of the properties Cloud Pub&#x2F;Sub offers compared to traditional self-hosted message queues.<p>Disclaimer: I work on the Cloud Pub&#x2F;Sub team, but this explanation is my own.')
