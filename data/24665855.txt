It could be higher, but there&#x27;s no information to suggest that to be case.<p>&gt; given the economic stagnation of many rural areas that depended on one or a handful of manufacturing or natural resource extraction facilities, I imagine many people can see and feel it.<p>Rural areas have almost never been economically dynamic, in any society (outside of agriculture, at least). Nobody is arguing that one ought to live in a rural town â€” but there are a ton of tier-2 and tier-3 cities, and suburbs of tier-1 cities where gainful employment is within reach, especially for wage earners in the bottom 3 quintiles. This includes Pittsburgh, Atlanta, Omaha, Little Rock, St. Louis, Milwaukee, Madison, Nashville, Salt Lake City, Minneapolis, Philadelphia, etc etc etc. Even Chicago, a tier-1 city went from having an income-to-home-price multiple of 2.45x in 1984, to 3.55x in 2017.')
