Even for a somewhat experienced home cook, it would be quicker to eyeball, and it would remove confusion for beginners.<p>I was going to say I&#x27;m just going to try this out on one of the recipes I&#x27;ve recently used, but someone did that already:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20170420110020&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.matthewwettergreen.com&#x2F;2010&#x2F;01&#x2F;05&#x2F;how-to-cook-like-an-engineer&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20170420110020&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.matthe...</a><p>How is that not strictly superior to traditional &quot;word-problem&quot; recipes?<p>--<p>Also, one thing that I hate about recipes, as a person who cooks only occasionally, is the &quot;to taste&quot; direction. I know what to do when I&#x27;ve done a given dish 10 times. But the first time around? Why no recipes ever provide any kinds of bounds? &quot;Add to taste; between 0.5 and 5 tsp, 2tsp is typical&quot;.<p>(Truly, cooking is what happens to process chemistry when you care so little about the quality of the outcome that you can wing every part of the process.)')
