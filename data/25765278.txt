Apple is about profitability and control. Their move to own silicon is driven by improvements in the reliability of their build pipeline (no more waiting for tic-tocs and whatnot) and tighter control &#x2F; integration of their whole stack (same arch on phones and pc). That these chips happen to perform so well that they are potential market-growers, is a welcome coincidence.')
