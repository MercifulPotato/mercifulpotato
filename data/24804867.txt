As soon as you make it mandatory, and the companies are paying for it, the audit becomes de rigueur; more of a formality than a search for truth. I don&#x27;t think regulators are part of the solution here.<p>I think that having &#x27;crowdfunded&#x27; audits by shareholders would work much better, but it probably won&#x27;t happen while audits are required for all public companies. You&#x27;d have to put the onus of auditing back on the shareholders, and expect that some results will go un-audited.')
