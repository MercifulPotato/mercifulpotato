Item(by='eloff', descendants=None, kids=[25730205], score=None, time=1610318643, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25720070, text='Are you the OP posting under a different account?<p>&gt; Given its size, configuration, and geopolitical contexts, the US has few comparable nations against which we can test.<p>Why does country size affect academic performance of students?<p>Russia, China, India, and Mexico are not developed nations. I wouldn&#x27;t compare their educational results with the US. I&#x27;d be more interested in Canada, South Korea, Japan, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, and the European nations. The USA compares near the bottom of this list.<p>&gt; No, it isn&#x27;t. The other nations I just listed by comparison churn out very few humanities degrees.<p>You used humanities degrees as a strawman argument in the OP. You asserting you did not do that is just a waste of effort. Perhaps you need to look up what a strawman argument is?')
