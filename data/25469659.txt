Item(by='w3clan', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608313198, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25466416, text='&gt; Google’s thesis is that the mobile-web is dying and people prefer to use apps – therefore making the web faster and more app-like will retain users.<p>I am not sure, if this is your opinion about Google&#x27;s view on AMP or is exactly the Google view on AMP, but, Whatever it be, I almost died laughing - what&#x27;s wrong with these people(Google)?<p>Either Google is assuming,<p>- people would only need 1-2 digit numbers of app in their device and rest all of the websites&#x2F;platform are just hawkers on the street.<p>OR,<p>- world is going to be exploded with extreme scalable storage system on mobile&#x2F;user&#x27;s devices where people would be able to store hundreds of apps.<p>The only reason PEOPLE PREFER TO USE APPS in most of the case is the ability of OFFLINE USE CASE for FREQUENTLY used apps, and we know FREQUENT uses are for limited numbers of apps.<p>Such thesis that people &quot;prefer to use apps&quot; requires citation and contradicts Google&#x27;s own &quot;search engine&quot; which helps people to explore the world for data. Is that a reason? google prefers to steal the data from various website and show the results in their search engine result page?')
