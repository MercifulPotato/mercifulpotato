Item(by='Animats', descendants=None, kids=[25768423], score=None, time=1610573880, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25766736, text='A big problem is that nobody seems to be monitoring Covid antibodies in a large-scale, consistent way. Here&#x27;s the CDC&#x27;s &quot;COVID-19 Serology Surveillance Strategy&quot; [1] They have a few tools. One is a blood donor test, where donated blood is tested for antibodies.  Another is random sampling of blood tests taken for other medical reasons. Those establish bounds - blood donors are healthier than average, and people getting blood tests for medical reasons are less healthy than average.<p>The results, though, are very spotty. The most recent US data published seems to be from September 2020.[2] &quot;In this repeated, cross-sectional study of 177 919 residual clinical specimens, the estimated percentage of persons in a jurisdiction with detectable SARS-CoV-2 antibodies ranged from fewer than 1% to 23%. Over 4 sampling periods in 42 of 49 jurisdictions with calculated estimates, fewer than 10% of people had detectable SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. ... Samples were obtained during 4 collection periods: July 27 to August 13, August 10 to August 27, August 24 to September 10, and September 7 to September 24, 2020.&quot;[3] Those are from anonymous random blood samples taken from people who had a lab test for something else.<p>For blood donors, there&#x27;s this data.[3] &quot;Data from the American Red Cross, which is providing serosurveillance data as part of the MASS study, indicated that 8.4 percent of U.S. blood donors it tested in a week in late November carried antibodies to Covid-19 in their blood.&quot;<p>So that&#x27;s the US situation from November. Those set upper and lower bounds on how many people in the US have had Covid-19. Those are actuals, not estimates. One would expect this would be tracked and updated weekly, but if it is, the data isn&#x27;t widely available.  The main thing one can conclude from this is that it&#x27;s nowhere near &quot;herd immunity&quot;. That would require 7x-10x as many people showing antibodies.<p>The CDC&#x27;s estimates based on a flu-based estimate of how many people need medical attention per infection seem inconsistent with that actual data.<p>As for the &quot;Ireland event&quot;, here it is on the Financial Times graph with other countries.[4] From 5 cases per 100K to 130 cases per 100K. For comparison, California is now around 105 cases per 100K.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;coronavirus&#x2F;2019-ncov&#x2F;covid-data&#x2F;serology-surveillance&#x2F;index.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;coronavirus&#x2F;2019-ncov&#x2F;covid-data&#x2F;serolog...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jamanetwork.com&#x2F;journals&#x2F;jamainternalmedicine&#x2F;fullarticle&#x2F;2773576" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jamanetwork.com&#x2F;journals&#x2F;jamainternalmedicine&#x2F;fullar...</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.medscape.com&#x2F;viewarticle&#x2F;944035#vp_2" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.medscape.com&#x2F;viewarticle&#x2F;944035#vp_2</a><p>[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ig.ft.com&#x2F;coronavirus-chart&#x2F;?areas=eur&amp;areas=usa&amp;areas=gbr&amp;areas=irl&amp;areasRegional=usny&amp;areasRegional=usnj&amp;areasRegional=usia&amp;areasRegional=usca&amp;areasRegional=usnd&amp;areasRegional=ussd&amp;cumulative=0&amp;logScale=0&amp;per100K=1&amp;startDate=2020-09-01&amp;values=cases" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ig.ft.com&#x2F;coronavirus-chart&#x2F;?areas=eur&amp;areas=usa&amp;are...</a>')
