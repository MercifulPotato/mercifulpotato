Donald Trump&#x27;s election was a big &quot;fuck you&quot; to the system. They absolutely want to upend the system. The system isn&#x27;t working for them, and they know it.<p>If the system was working, wages wouldn&#x27;t be stagnant for 50 years. Housing prices wouldn&#x27;t have nearly quadrupled. College education prices wouldn&#x27;t have nearly... you know what, I don&#x27;t even know the correct modifier... gone up by 5000%. In 1971, CEO pay was <i>at best</i> 30-40 times the median salary of an employee at a company. If you made $10,000 a year, the CEO <i>might</i> make $300,000-400,000. The very best CEOs rarely made multi-millions.<p>This is not a sustainable system.<p>The problem is, these people don&#x27;t really have the education to know how to attack the system to correctly dismantle it (in fact, it might not even be possible to dismantle it from a non-violent &#x2F; institutional standpoint, but that&#x27;s another conversation), so they instead riot and install Viking Pepe as their leader.')
