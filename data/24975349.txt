The Haskell posts&#x2F;community vibe that I see is very heavy on the “ideas of computing research” and I’ve always thought Ocaml was a more “get things done” language because I only ever really hear about it from JaneStreet or ReasonML angle which is very much on the side of “get things done”. That’s a pity.')
