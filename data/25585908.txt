How do we know they are valid?<p>It&#x27;s a new study, so no-one had the opportunity to reproduce their findings yet.  Generally in the scientific community, one tries to find the flaw in their argument&#x2F;methods, rather then presuming them to be faulty.<p>It doesn&#x27;t seem like a very complicated, time consuming or costly experiment (compared with e.g. the search for the higgs boson), so I&#x27;d think it&#x27;s reasonable to expect another team to reproduce the results in the near future, if there is sufficient interest.')
