Item(by='skissane', descendants=None, kids=[25902251], score=None, time=1611569693, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25901469, text='&gt; as I remember IBM mainframes have had support for Aix&#x2F;Linux guests for a while now<p>IBM VM has supported Linux guests ever since Linux was first ported to IBM mainframes, circa 1999-2000. Indeed, it is quite likely the initial port was done using VM.<p>IBM offered two versions of AIX on mainframes, AIX&#x2F;370 in 1998 and AIX&#x2F;ESA in 1991. However, how much code did these have in common with AIX on RS&#x2F;6000? In the later case, very little – AIX&#x2F;ESA is actually a port of the Mach kernel based OSF&#x2F;1 to IBM mainframes, with little or no code shared with RS&#x2F;6000 AIX (which contemporary AIX descends from). It actually had more in common with Digital&#x2F;Compaq&#x2F;HP&#x27;s discontinued Tru64 UNIX (which is another OSF&#x2F;1 derivative) than with AIX on RT-PC &#x2F; POWER. I get the impression that AIX&#x2F;370 had little or no code in common with RS&#x2F;6000 AIX either – it was developed by Locus Computer Corporation – but I don&#x27;t know enough about it to be sure about that. Neither AIX&#x2F;370 or AIX&#x2F;ESA ever saw any great adoption – both were discontinued in the 1990s, they were replaced by MVS OpenEdition (later OS&#x2F;390 OpenEdition, and now z&#x2F;OS Unix System Services) and also later on also by Linux.')
