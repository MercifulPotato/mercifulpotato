I often work on small projects for mildly decentralized &#x2F; storage stuff. Often i have the need to encrypt this stuff in various ways and i am disappointed by the tools available to me.<p>I feel like i have so many tools for amazing feats of engineering with minimal understanding required <i>(which may not be a good thing lol)</i>, but Crypto tools and&#x2F;or advice always seems to suggest you shouldn&#x27;t use crypto at all if you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re doing.<p>Eg if i write some storage application that fits my needs, and i want to add encryption for the data at rest - i often find the environment <i>(crypto tooling and communities)</i> hostile. Hostile to encrypting something without knowing enough to be competent.<p>I get why crypto communities&#x2F;tooling are afraid of informed-idiots <i>(as i self describe)</i>, but i view it as a failing of the environment not the informed-idiot.<p>Do you see your angle on this as something that could lower the barrier to entry for informed idiots just wanting to _use_ crypto? Ie the fact that Crypto Wallets&#x2F;Coins have standardized and simplified a lot Crypto-related UXs, do you see that impacting common software usecases for encryption &#x2F; signing?')
