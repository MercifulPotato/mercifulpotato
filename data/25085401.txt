Frivolous suits are not legal, the courts have identified and nullified all frivolous lawsuit attempts so far, and they have signaled that they will not be tolerated. If Trump wants to bring frivolous suits then it only makes him look less legitimate in the eyes of everyone and bolsters the case for forced removal if need be. These events really don&#x27;t pose any danger to our democracy. The danger to our democracy occurs when you allow one side to build a narrative that the election isn&#x27;t legitimate and that one side (the left) is refusing to even hear out the right when they claim a lack of legitimacy.<p>Give them their time and then we can all move on.')
