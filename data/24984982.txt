But I don’t have time to self host any open source tools. Nor my colleagues do. We must write code and design electronics around FPGAs. My manager will never pay for time spend with open source products. Big Corp I work for has a dedicated team with direct contact to Xilinx support if something goes badly. Next thing is legacy designs of the Big Corp. If it was Virtex-6, the next one will be Virtex-7. If it was Spartan-6, next one will be Spartan-7. Even if Altera&#x2F;Intel or Lattice or some cool startup could offer similar chips for 60% the Xilinx’s price we would stay with Xilinx because of the codebase. And don’t forget supply chain, as Big Corp buys tons of chips from single vendor the price is unbeatable. Changing vendor and starting with clean account doesn’t make sense financially. And I am sure, that this single Big Corp makes more money for Xilinx than all the hobbyist worldwide. Honestly I can’t see a reason why Xilinx should open source anything.')
