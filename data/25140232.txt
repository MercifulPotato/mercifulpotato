So I believed in AMD and supported them for years (and actually made nice profit on their shares growth).<p>To be honest I don&#x27;t really need compute all that much other than for my own hobby projects. And for gaming I only play few games what suite my taste as well as tons of older or indie games that would work on any GPU. So why not, AMD open source drivers are decent anyway.<p>Unfortunately it&#x27;s hard to really recommend AMD GPUs when it&#x27;s come to the real world experience. Modern gamers actually want all these lock-in features even if Nvidia gonna abandon them in couple of years. Then people who need compute for their work just want their software to work and it&#x27;s simply too much of mess on non-Nvidia hardware.')
