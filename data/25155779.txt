It only prohibited him from issuing EOs that do what was in dispute in the case, specifically, using the Emergency Services Act as a basis for any order which &quot;amends, alters, or changes existing statutory law or makes new statutory law or legislative policy.&quot; EOs which don&#x27;t do that, which is the case for most EOs, are not in dispute and future EOs that don&#x27;t do that are unaffected.<p>&gt; Please link me your &quot;correct&quot; sources.<p>The actual order: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.suttercourts.com&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;press_releases&#x2F;Gallagher%20and%20Kiley%20v.%20Newsom.pdf?fbclid=IwAR2uvK7IgwBFlzRurE_XuyNbjg2lBrWJBItB491qbSCU6rUupx0ZxB3Qqds" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.suttercourts.com&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;press_relea...</a>')
