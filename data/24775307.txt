Just sitting in one is fine. Although the internal compass isn’t going to work great.<p>Also people significantly overestimate the amount of current a normal (something you’re gonna encounter in day-to-day life) magnetic field can induce in a wire. There’s a good reason motors are packed with so many windings, you either need an incredibly large magnetic field, or a crap ton of wire, to get an interesting amount of current.')
