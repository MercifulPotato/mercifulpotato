Probably call it “Silicon Valley style” and disregard it.<p>The Hollywood model spends most of that money on ppl and marketing, little on tech. K has no tech experience and W only a smidgeon despite her exec jobs (eBay &amp; HP). So I would be shocked if they spent more than $25MM on their stack which is mostly conventional.  I’m sure the rest was blown on marketing, high salaries, consultants, offices, and deals with actors.')
