It&#x27;s an incredibly impressive project, but I found that the cognitive overhead of manipulating the stack stubbornly failed to go away over time. I say this as someone who is reasonably comfortable writing moderately complex Haskell code, so it&#x27;s not that I&#x27;m unable to adjust to unusual programming paradigms. I think naming local variables just turns out to be an <i>incredibly</i> good idea.<p>That said, I do appreciate the conceptual simplicity and ease of implementation of concatenative languages. They certainly have their place.<p>In case there are any Factor evangelists out there, let me add in fairness that the language makes it easy to use named variables if you want to.')
