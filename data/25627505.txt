Item(by='forelle2', descendants=None, kids=[25628170], score=None, time=1609728991, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25625195, text='Mari was designed in production at Weta, based off the lessons learned from, well, everything that Weta does.<p>Take for example, a large hero asset like King Kong.<p>Kong look development started many months before a script was locked down. Kong is 60ft tall, our leading lady is 5’2”.<p>We <i>think</i> we need shots where she’ll be standing in Kong’s hands, feet, be lifted up to his face, nose etc.<p>So we need fingers prints that will stand up at 4K renders, tear ducts, pores on the inside on the nose, etc etc but we don’t know. All of which will have to match shot plates in detail.<p>We <i>could</i> address each of these as the shots turn up and tell the director (who owns the company) he needs to wait a few days for his new shot, or you can break Kong into 500 patches and create a texture for each of the diffuse, 3 spec, 3 subsurface, 4 bump, dirt, blood, dust, scratch, fur, flow etc etc inputs to our shaders.<p>Let’s says we have 500 UDIM patches for Kong so we can sit our leading lady on the finger tips, and 20 channels to drive our shaders and effects systems.<p>When working the artist uses 6 paint layers for each channel ( 6 is a massive underestimate for most interesting texture work).<p>So we have 500 patches * 20 channels * 6 layers which gives us 60k images. Not all of these will need be at 4K however.<p>For Kong replace any hero asset where shots will be more placed “in and on” the asset rather than “at”. Heli carriers, oil rigs, elven great halls, space ships, giant robots.... The line between asset and environment is blurred at that point and maybe think “set” rather than “asset”')
