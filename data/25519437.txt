I run ethereum bots, IMO that is not HFT and Robinhood should at minimum have account representatives to manage client relations to be allowed to operate.<p>But they don&#x27;t, because of everything that you said. They are lightweight by design, they are not for large investors, they are made for the retail space.<p>You can see this echoed in their featureset - for example, no historical date on options prior to purchase date, and only visible once you&#x27;ve purchased the contract. With Etrade or other institutional brokerages, you have access to full historical data for any contract or stock you are looking into. You are able to educate yourself and make much smarter decisions, without leaving their app.<p>Granted, the Robinhood app is much smoother. They dont&#x27; have an iPad app though, which was another big con for me.')
