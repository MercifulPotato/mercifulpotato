It&#x27;s unfortunately relatively common to just throw away plastic bottles after use, as well as when eating candy. Those are the two most common pieces of litter I see everywhere. Go have a look at a pile of litter somewhere and try to estimate the percentage of masks among the plastic. That was the point I was trying to make.<p>For the two latter reasons (mismanagement of waste) the end result would probably be more or less the same regardless of the type.<p>Ultimately the real percentage of facemasks depends on the ratio between these &quot;means of loss&quot;. And even though from my (western) perspective trash doesn&#x27;t end up in the sea when thrown away, there are countries like India and other developing or poor countries that might make the littering statistic insignificant. On the other hand they are also unlikely to use masks to the same extent as in the western world...')
