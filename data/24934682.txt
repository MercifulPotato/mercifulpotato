If I am, then death is not. If Death is, then I am not.&quot;<p>Besides, we all already have died in one way or another. I&#x27;m 24 year old, is my 15 year old self still alive, is my 5 year old self still alive? Nope. Even if I make it to my 40s, I will become a different person by then - the person that is me will die in some form.<p>Now imagine if you lived 500 - 1000 years. There are few this could go:<p>1.You will be fairly active your entire life, thus experience many of these &quot;personality deaths&quot; - so what difference does it make if you finally die for real<p>2.You will grow old mentally and stagnate. Chances are you will want to die anyway because you can&#x27;t take it anymore.<p>3.You will achieve some degree of &quot;enlightment&quot; - and the forementioned quote will probably make even more sense than we can intellectually imagine')
