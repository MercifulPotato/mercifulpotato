From what I&#x27;ve seen none of his posts or comments were at all encouraging or even insinuating that others should follow his lead. His YouTube channel even has a disclaimer video. In an ideal world he&#x27;d include that disclaimer at the beginning and end of every video but the fact that he has one at all at least demonstrates he&#x27;s thought about the potential market implications and taken steps to make sure his followers don&#x27;t take his commentary the wrong way. I&#x27;m actually a bit curious if DFV will be hired as a PM by a hedge fund when the dust settles. I don&#x27;t think GME is the first time his thesis has paid off.<p>But the people saying things like &quot;buy GME and call your broker to instruct them not to lend your shares&quot; or encouraging people to go &quot;all in&quot; and the comments specifically encouraging others to buy GME to screw $hedgeFund have left a pretty clear paper trail of their intent to induce others to purchase and manipulate the market.')
