That way you end up with more global state, with all its consequences.<p>As you point out, the lack of properties solves that. The use of a singleton probably relates to the identity issue<p>&gt; at this point you may just as well skip the entire object part as I don&#x27;t see why exactly it&#x27;s needed for an identity check.<p>PHP only has 8 types (string, int, bool, float, array, null, resource, object) and they&#x27;re not likely to be added to (resource is largely deprecated).<p>Given that, object is the only one that&#x27;s not likely to be abused by relying on the actual scalar value. Keeping it as a singleton ensures that === will still work (it requires &#x27;same instance&#x27;)')
