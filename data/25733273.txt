Like, a person suffering from a schizophrenic break could reasonably use that as a defense (not to avoid all treatment&#x2F;punishment, but as a mitigating factor or to have the consequences moved from prison time to a medical facility) for a crime committed during that break (a sincere belief that they&#x27;re in danger or that someone was the devil leading them to commit an assault or worse). Depression <i>could</i> similarly be used in a defense like that as depression (in severe cases) can similarly cause breaks with reality or reduced capacity for self-control.<p>But <i>having</i> severe depression or <i>being</i> schizophrenic, on its own, is not a good justification for changing&#x2F;reducing charges and consequences (sadly, consequences in the US are <i>punishments</i> as there&#x27;s little focus on rehabilitation). If anything, it could reasonably affect the sentencing to account for the riskier consequences of placing a person with that mental condition into a medium or high security prison or general population, but not the selection of charges by the prosecutor.')
