And personally I find it incredibly annoying when I&#x27;m in something vim-like enough to establish &quot;I&#x27;m in vim&quot; expectations and not meet them once I start trying to use the thing like vim without restraint.  I&#x27;m then put into this constant second guessing mode of &quot;if this <i>really</i> were vim I&#x27;d do so and so, but should I just try it?  maybe it&#x27;ll do something really unexpected, time to RTFM? sigh.&quot;  which is really unproductive and psychologically awful.<p>Especially when we&#x27;re talking about dev tools like git integration, where the mental state is already going to be steeped well into text editor land, all the familiar vimisms are going to be hot in the habitual cache.<p>Does anyone know of anything tig-like that&#x27;s implemented as a vim plugin one interacts with through regular vim windows?  I wouldn&#x27;t mind having an interactive list interface for tagging files to include in a `git commit -p` for instance, without leaving the editor.')
