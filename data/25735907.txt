At best they hit a capacity factor of 11.6% in 2018.  By comparison the US had a capacity factor of 28% for utility-sized PV plants in 2015, but it’s dropped as less efficient locations have been added.<p><i>A square meter of PV panels produces around 150W,</i> that’s some low efficiency panels, you can easily hit 200+W&#x2F;M2 using a high efficiency panel like SunPower Maxeon 3.<p>Solar isn’t a great fit everywhere.  So, people really can see wildly different outputs from the same setup based on location.  At 28% capacity factor averaging 60+W&#x2F;M is very possible.')
