It&#x27;s everytime I want to do anything with Julia, I need to wait <i>upto</i> a minute or two. Gadfly takes ages to pre-compile.<p>Closed your terminal session? You&#x27;re outta luck. Wait 2 mins please. Launch a notebook and want to start working on something? Wait 40 seconds. Wanna check something quick in Julia REPL session? Wait 7 seconds. Let me run this Julia script, wait 55 seconds.<p>I feel like the entire community should stop doing what they&#x27;re doing and fix this issue.
