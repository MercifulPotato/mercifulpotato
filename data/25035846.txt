I live in the bluest of blue states, which in the other comments here, in that narrative, you expect cooperation and all this stuff.  A false media narrative, if I do say so, but that&#x27;s not the point - the point is no one trusts the folks behind the technology, nor do we trust random phone numbers.<p>So the Citizen App has contact tracing.  But you have to check into the app, and furthermore, do you trust some private company with the information?  About you?  Your location and all this ?  And contact tracing via government calling you - do you trust random numbers calling you and asking you questions?  No one knows when Silicon Valley (in the case of the app) wants to steal some more of your private data, and no one knows when some phisher is phishing as opposed to some volunteer calling you up for contact tracing.<p>There&#x27;s a breakdown of trust.<p>Oh, and saying, &#x27;maybe this administration&#x27; is further evidence of that.  I live in a blue state, and your perceptions are, I believe, wrong, about the magic around that or the cooperation of the citizenry.')
