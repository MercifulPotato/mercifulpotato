Actually, I can&#x27;t help but feel that <i>a lot</i> of the classes I am taking are wasting my time.<p>I would consider myself one of the lucky ones in the fact that I never had to touch anything calculus related. My school tested having students take AP Statistics instead of Pre-Calculus (a decision they have now reversed after seeing that only 3 kids passed the AP stats exam) and I avoided taking Calculus for my senior year because I am taking a math class at a local college instead.<p>I am also quite disappointed that my college Algebra class feels like the same pump and dump memory game all over again. Then again, it&#x27;s all online due to Covid so I can only hope that the real college experience is more interesting.<p>I really wish high schools would stop emphasizing on the &quot;common curriculum&quot; and start giving students more freedom to choose what they want to learn. I also think that there should be a highschool class that teaches you <i>how</i> to think instead of <i>what</i> to think.')
