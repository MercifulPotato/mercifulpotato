In France, we don&#x27;t actually know the cost of that initial roll out.  In the US, nuclear construction routinely overran budgets, often by large factors.   When PURPA subjected US power markets to more market discipline nuclear construction evaporated.  This should tell you that it was never a low cost source.<p>Today, even the construction that occurred then is not possible.   The nuclear supply chain is atrophied, especially without nuclear weapons programs to provide support.   Attempts to repeat the past glories have gone even more disastrously wrong than they did then.<p>The best people know not to go into nuclear now, so the expectation of its failure is self-reinforcing.   Nuclear programs at universities are closing for lack of interest.  Hell, even steam turbines (!) risk becoming a marginalized (and perhaps, eventually, forgotten) technology.<p>&gt; What will be the cost of scaling this up to the hours or days required to make intermittent sources viable?<p>It will almost certainly be much cheaper than building nuclear reactors, and by a very large margin.   But if it&#x27;s not,  no big deal.  We could build reactors later if by some miracle it turns out they&#x27;re needed.  I think the best you can expect now is a dribble of seed money to keep the nuclear industry from disappearing entirely, just to keep some level of expertise around as an insurance policy.   But if and when renewables prove themselves to a point even you cannot deny, even that could dry up.')
