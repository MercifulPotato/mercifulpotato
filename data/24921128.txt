Typically RF modules like that are intended to be placed overhanging the edge of the board, or abutting the edge with a large copper-free area to the left and right of the antenna.<p>I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s indicative of an unfixable issue per se, but it&#x27;s not a great look in the promo photo.')
