I didn&#x27;t get anything to type&#x2F;check&#x2F;approve anywhere); on the other hand by using the option to use emoji (compare a series of emoji between devices and then confirm) was very simple.<p>As well finding the link to a group-chat that I just created was not simple (or at least the place where to find it was not obvious).<p>&gt; <i>That being said it is the the best long term option in my opinion and I am donating to the organization. Hopefully they can work on polishing the e2e UX.</i><p>Same here &amp; I agree.')
