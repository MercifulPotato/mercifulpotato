This is our &#x27;engraving release&#x27;, which addresses many of the biggest issues affecting the layout and appearance of your sheet music and is the result of a massive collaboration between our community and internal team. It is the first big step towards the type of world-beating engraving capability that we aim to achieve in the future.<p>Two of the most notable additions in this release are Leland, our new notation font and Edwin, our new typeface. Leland is a highly sophisticated notation style created by our head of product, Martin Keary and our engraving expert, Simon Smith. The aim of Leland is to provide a classic notation style that feels &#x27;just right&#x27; with a balanced, consistent weight and a finessed appearance that avoids overly stylised quirks. We will be releasing a video about how (and why) Leland was created to coincide with the official launch of 3.6. Our new typeface, Edwin, is based on New Century Schoolbook, which has long been the typeface of choice by some of the world&#x27;s leading publishers, chosen specifically as a complimentary companion to Leland. In addition, we have provided new default style settings (margins, line thickness, etc) to compliment Leland and Edwin, which match conventions used by the world&#x27;s leading publishing houses.<p>Full release notes are available here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;musescore.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;3.6" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;musescore.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;3.6</a>')
