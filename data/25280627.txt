HP&#x2F;Dell&#x2F;Acer all have products sitting on the shelves at best buy, walmart, etc. These are the mid-tier AMD products, but they are extremely well placed when compared with the vast majority of the intel product lines they are sitting next to. In many cases the $600-700 those products are selling for best pretty much all the intel products priced below $1200 or so.<p>(HP, which I don&#x27;t recommend, was selling a 4700U based product starting at $400 on black Friday on their web site)<p>edit: Heck just checked there are loaded Asus ROG G14&#x27;s in stock at a local retailer for under $1200 (that is 4900HS+RTX 2060). Pretty much one of the fastest laptops out there.')
