No, fascists didn&#x27;t come up with certain techniques, like military parades.  But those same techniques seem to be particularly effective when employed as tools of the fascist state in service of the fascist agenda. Can you separate the cultural relevance those techniques have <i>for us</i> from the work they have done in a fascist context? I don&#x27;t know, but I don&#x27;t think anyone is trying to &quot;cancel&quot; anything.')
