She would be wholly incapable of doing anything remotely mentally challenging. But with this, she can take some of the burden off her family to care for her, she can have something of her own going on in her life, and she is a human being and I&#x27;m sure feels from time to time like she is a burden and gets down about it, so she probably gets some dignity from it. She would probably be out of a job if minimum wage got raised to 15 an hour. She would be priced out of the job market and that job would not be worth paying anyone to perform.<p>You&#x27;ll notice that when wages are artificially increased, unemployment rises. Which jobs do you think were destroyed? Which workers do you think were let go? It is self evident. When wages are raised by decree, some jobs and some people are priced out of a labor market. Just because there are still low skill jobs and low skilled workers does not mean there was not a reduction in those jobs.')
