If you don&#x27;t &quot;sugar coat&quot; it, how do you expect that the right symbols will be interpreted by the receiver? It is part of the test to use the appropriate language to ensure the best understanding of what you are saying. Nonviolent communication tries to do exactly that and is essential to this end.<p>You can argue that since the professor understood what was being said, the language shouldn&#x27;t matter, but it does. If again you don&#x27;t use the correct language you risk offending the listener so much he can&#x27;t get past that. After all you are dealing with humans, not machines, and in either case you are responsible for clear communication.')
