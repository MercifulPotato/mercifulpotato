If they are better predictors then use that algorithm.  Until then, accurate algorithms should be used - whether they determine that Republicans or race X are more likely to do y.<p>Donâ€™t get me wrong - You have a duty to get the best models possible, and you should try variables that generalize at higher levels - income instead of race) for example and always be testing.<p>I heard a story about a particular parole board trying to use an algorithm to predict recidivism rates.  It often predicted one race more likely to do so. There is some argument that each case should be looked at individually.  I agree.  But should we avoid addressing the issue if the algorithm is explainable and a good predictor?  Instead we should use it to help lower reoffender rates NOT by denying parole but perhaps assigning additional resources to those more likely to offend once we have already granted parole.')
