I&#x27;m happy to see they&#x27;re working on it, but uBlock-enabled web browsing has been a gamechanger for me, and it&#x27;d be hard to give that up to use a browser akin to Tridactyl++.<p>The second that qutebrowser (or any Webkit&#x2F;Webengine vim-like browser) gets good adblock&#x2F;cosmetic filtering support, I&#x27;ll switch in a heartbeat.')
