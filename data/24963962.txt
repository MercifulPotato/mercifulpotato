The state has too much power, and it abuses it to curtail the liberties of its citizens and enforce a crony-capitalist structure.  But his solutions are wrong, and furthermore, beyond small critiques of his policies, I take broad issue with his vision.  The world which he imagines - a world in which everyone is more or less equal, with some a little richer but not too much so, is not one in which I want to live.  He also seems to enumerate the many wrongs of state force, then conveniently omit the sort of force that would be necessary to seize all this property.  He mentions that all land would be held in common - this wouldn&#x27;t just be taking the wealth of a few billionaires and giving everyone a few extra bucks.  I am glad we do not live in such as society, and hope America will never head in such a direction.')
