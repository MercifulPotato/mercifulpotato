Many of them acquired from cheap bookstores. I used to go to all kinds of book stores and walked out with at least a couple of them each visit. The problem was that my ability to read them was nowhere near my desire to buy them.<p>I wound up putting my books in storage for years, then taking them with me whenever I moved. I eventually sold all but a hundred of the best books, as I couldn&#x27;t part with those. But I still only read a tiny fraction. Most of the time they sat unused.<p>I eventually sold or donated the remainder, as I didn&#x27;t want to move them again.<p>I&#x27;ve long since stopped trying to buy physical books, and get them from the library as much as possible. If there is a book I have the desire to read or someone recommends them, I put it on hold in my library. If I really read it (most of the time I don&#x27;t) or want to read it again, I just buy a copy on my Kindle. If I can&#x27;t find it in the library, I will buy it on my Kindle. At least this way I don&#x27;t have to carry them around wherever I go.')
