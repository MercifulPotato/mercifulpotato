Item(by='andrewmcwatters', descendants=None, kids=[25210534], score=None, time=1606317995, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25209514, text='Yeah, I think you hit the nail on the head.<p>I think the biggest thing I&#x27;m worried about from my end is I just work with so much C and C++ I can&#x27;t attempt to do programming that takes away from being productive. I don&#x27;t have the hours for it. I don&#x27;t recall the Rusts docs yelling out to me, &quot;Don&#x27;t forget! C FFI bindings can be generated!&quot; But at least Steve was able to point out some libs to me that would help with my work.<p>I&#x27;m OK with a small productivity hit because learning something new will always entail that, but the long term benefits need to be there. I&#x27;m almost always more worried about shipping than I am about anything technical.<p>That being said I think I can see some benefits over the horizon. In C and C++ land, there are a lot of people who don&#x27;t use std or boost for one reason or another, and I&#x27;ve worked in circles where I had exposure to that type of programming. Honestly, just the fact that I might be able to rely on Rust&#x27;s libraries OOTB could be a productivity gain right there.<p>I have the &quot;Hello, World!&quot; rust app on my workstation, so I&#x27;ve given it a small try. I&#x27;d be curious to see how other powerful concepts like threading work in Rust, but that&#x27;s reading I&#x27;ve got to do.<p>It&#x27;s difficult trying to sort out threading concerns from Lua, another language I use frequently, since the most common distributions aren&#x27;t thread-safe without some work. I&#x27;d be interested in seeing what a Rust + Lua software integration could look like, since that might be a successor to the C work I do now.')
