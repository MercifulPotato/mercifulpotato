These parts are distinct processes, but also complementary. Both are important for science to be practical and useful. It is always important to be explicit which part of scientific method is under focus, as human minds can only focus one thing at a time.<p>If elements of the universe have probabilistic distributions until observed, you have also a dualism there: 1) the observable element 2) the probabilistic structure surrounding it. Both are mystical and interdependent.<p>Maybe the particle and observation seems more real, but they both adhere to structure that surrounds and shapes them fully too. What we observe though is not particles themselves, but after-effects of the fleeting mirage. So everything is a copy, thus holographic nature.')
