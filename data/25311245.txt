Item(by='itsmemattchung', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607136704, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25288535, text='I 100% agree with the blog post, that everyone should collect a journal of bugs. However, looking at the author&#x27;s example, I can&#x27;t help but think that the &quot;fix&quot; for the bug is really just a good intention. More specifically, they were bitten by a bug where an environment variable wasn&#x27;t set in production. Checking that the environment variable, in the future, is set is a nice next step however, I would say, another take away would be to encode that intention in the code directly: throw an error, emit a metric, log an error (that hopefully gets monitored).')
