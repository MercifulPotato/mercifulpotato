Let&#x27;s take a look at the study, because my mental reserve of scientific attention is still O.K. (under-tapped, if anything.)<p>Here&#x27;s the retraction letter written by the authors themselves:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;s41467-020-20617-y" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;s41467-020-20617-y</a><p>They write,<p>&gt; <i>The three independent experts commented on the validity of the approaches and the soundness of the interpretation in the Article. They supported previous criticisms in relation to the use of co-authorship as a measure of mentorship. Thus, any conclusions that might be drawn on the basis of co-authorship may not be automatically extended to mentorship. The experts also noted that the operationalisation of mentorship quality was not validated in the paper.</i><p>I think they&#x27;re saying that co-authorship does not imply mentorship. That sounds reasonable on its face to me, and I wonder why they didn&#x27;t notice that disconnection before publishing. I had to look up the word &quot;Operationalization,&quot; apparently it is a social science term for the way in which researchers choose to measure something. (An example of operationalization would be, &quot;let us use citation count as an operationalization of career success.&quot;)<p>Now, let&#x27;s take a look at the original paper to decide if the coauthorship=mentorship thing was really as straightforward as the notice makes it sound.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;s41467-020-19723-8" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;s41467-020-19723-8</a><p>&gt;<i>For any given scientist, we consider the first 7 years of their career to be their junior years, and the ones after that to be their senior years. Whenever a junior scientist publishes a paper with a senior scientist, we consider the former to be a protégé, and the latter to be a mentor, as long as they coauthored at least one paper with 20 or less co-authors and share the same discipline and US-based affiliation; see Supplementary Note 3 for more details.</i><p>It does look like their measure was a little more sophisticated than coauthorship alone, but it also appears that they never checked to see whether their measure worked. Nowhere in the study did they, say, ask a bunch of coauthors if they really were in a mentor-mentee relationship. Curiously, they <i>did</i> survey pairs to ask other questions.<p>Here is where it gets more interesting. From their paper, they write:<p>&gt;<i>To verify whether this is the case, we sampled 2000 scientists whom we identified as protégés, to ask them about their relationship with their mentors. [...] Out of those 2000 scientists, 167 completed the survey; see Supplementary Note 4 for more details.</i><p>The many non-respondents could easily be a set that contains their mis-identified pairs. A scientist who is not actually in a mentor-mentee relationship would be unlikely to respond to a survey asking them about their relationship. The number of non-respondents is more than ten times the number of respondents.<p>It&#x27;s conceivable that coauthorship is correlated with mentorship, but the authors skipped a big step in their chain of deduction.')
