What I don&#x27;t support is endorsing one side, and then demonizing the other. Objectively, more police and citizens were killed in BLM riots. Tens of active shooter situations, vehicles used as weapons, billions in property damage. Storming the capitol is also bad, but demonizing it more so is asking for extremist trouble.')
