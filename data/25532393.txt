Governments. If we are talking “societal-scale medical system” a majority of people would want that publicly owned and operated and universally accessible.<p>We’ve already seen in industry that the incentives are to massively in favour of creating walled-gardens that lock in users and thus profits. No societal-wide system should work like our social media ecosystem (FB, Snapchat, TikTok). The dominant profit incentives are also not “human-centric”, as Jordan constantly emphasises. Well, they’re only so if we assume profit-making activity is tightly aligned with “human-centric” concerns. Some will say yes, but to me our climate disaster and the USA mass incarceration system are strong enough evidence that the answer is no.<p>I think some wealthy Northern European countries are setup well enough to produce “Intelligent Infrastructure”, except for the fact that most of the talent is in the USA.')
