I&#x27;m 49, so I&#x27;m from the pre-sat-nav generation, and I will generally not use one [x] until I get to the city in question, or traffic&#x2F;isues necessitate it, so I&#x27;ll navigate from major town to major town to get where I&#x27;m going.<p>I don&#x27;t find that they will generally disappear from signs (unless you&#x27;re past them), and I find the system used in the UK very logical.<p>Also, I don&#x27;t find the lack of reflectors at the edge of country roads to be an issue - most are delineated by white lines, which means it&#x27;s easy to see the edges at night.  This is not the case in most African countries, and I found driving through Africa at night a challenging, tiring experience because of this, but maybe if you&#x27;re used to reflectors, it&#x27;s the same situation just at a different level.<p>x - I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s good to be babied and feel you need a sat nav for every journey.  Since ditching mine (I was a keen user until maybe 3-4 years ago), I&#x27;ve felt much more independent and capable, and happy to drive wherever.  I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be in the minority in this opinion, though.')
