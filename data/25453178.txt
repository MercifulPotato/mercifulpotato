It essentially computes the average values (plus a multiplicative constant). So this value would be high for audio signal segments with lots of bass.<p>2) This is incorrect. The value in 1) is the amplitude of low frequency signals. Increasing the amplitude of this would <i>probably</i> result in emphasizing the bass.<p>3) Smaller rectangular functions are low pass filters with different cutoffs, so effect would be similar as 1).<p>My guess is that the audio will end up having its bass region boosted, depending on the size of the rectangular windowing functions.')
