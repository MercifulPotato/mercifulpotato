Spotify has been a terrible experience, but for the sake of my teenage son, we decided to get a family account. Spotify is too obsessed with telling me how to consume music, I don’t need an album shuffled by default, the artist picked the track listing for a reason. The way Spotify cues music is bizarre. Their user interfaces are confusing and clunky. For a platform trying to go all in on podcast it’s near impossible to know when new episodes are released (unless I’m missing something). I don’t need something to spy on my mood and suggest music, I’ve figured that out - Dub techno while working Ambient while reading HipHop when hanging with the homies and Slayer when I’m working in the garage!')
