AIM or other Pidgin-based alternatives wouldn&#x27;t be too bad either, if you had your own private server with everything logged.<p><i>Edit, because I&#x27;m a really shitty commentator, apparently, who isn&#x27;t allowed to post any more today:</i><p>No, <i>your</i> comment was completely tangential to the content of <i>my</i> post.<p>&quot;Live chat&quot; as it&#x27;s currently implemented and widely used, a la IRC, Slack, etc, certainly has its downfalls, much of which can be mitigated however by logging to disk, with a quality search engine to index it.<p>Look at all the &quot;alternatives&quot; this guy is suggesting. \n It&#x27;s basically &quot;switch to a forum instead of chat.&quot; Most of the suggestions are proprietary, closed junk. Not exactly a smart formula for long data retention.<p>He lists all these advantages of forums, and yet seems to have overlooked the advantage of chat, which is precisely that it gives a direct connection to someone, rather than having to wait a day or a week for a response.<p>Better advice would be to use IRC (or other locallly hosted, open source alternative) for your team, but use discipline in your conversations so that you don&#x27;t bloat the chat log with a bunch of chatter that makes searching it harder. Then perhaps designate certain persons to organize and summarize the proceedings so they are more easily referenced.<p>There certainly can be better improvements in chat, but &quot;just switch to a forum&quot; isn&#x27;t it.')
