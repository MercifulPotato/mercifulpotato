They guarantee a 99.99% uptime (max downtime of 4 min&#x2F;22 seconds per month) and give 10x credits for any downtime.<p>Granted, there&#x27;s probably not many businesses that are losing major revenue because slack&#x27;s down for half an hour, but it&#x27;s nice to at least see them acknowledge that 1 minute down deserves more than 1 minute of refunds!<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;slack.com&#x2F;terms&#x2F;service-level-agreement" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;slack.com&#x2F;terms&#x2F;service-level-agreement</a>')
