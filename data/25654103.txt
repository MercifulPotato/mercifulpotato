It is no secret that Americans really don&#x27;t like the Russian government, and there is precedence for APT groups associated with the Russian government attacking the US. I agree though that there is no publicly available data to support the assertion that Russia is responsible for this at this time. My earlier post was simply pointing out the low likelihood of an individual or independent group performing this attack. The high level of sophistication combined with their risky target selection suggests it is a nation state.')
