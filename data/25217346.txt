Item(by='drewbug01', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606371104, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25217088, text='&gt; I wouldn&#x27;t ever use the words truth and NYT - especially when it comes to cultural topics. And also geopolitical topics. Or anything of national significance. Or war. You get the idea.<p>Can you expand on that? It feels like you’re saying that the NYT lies (to greatly and possibly incorrectly paraphrase). But I don’t generally believe that to be true; and I haven’t seen much evidence to indicate they’ve been engaged in that kind of behavior. Certainly not often, if at all.<p>&gt; Why is the NYT writing a hit piece on coinbase?\n&gt; When it comes to propaganda, it always helps to get out in front of the &quot;story&quot;. I&#x27;m guessing that&#x27;s what coinbase is doing.<p>Did the NYT write a hit piece on Coinbase? I haven’t read the article yet, since it hasn’t been published. No one has.<p>What I believe to be absolutely true is this: Coinbase desperately wants everyone to believe that it’s a hit piece. That’s obvious from the timing, tone, and things they actually wrote in the letter.<p>But at least in theory, the NYT higher goals and aspirations in life - to uncover and publish truth.<p>Coinbase doesn’t, and they live and die entirely by customers choosing to trust them with their business. They have every rational incentive to fight for you to trust them regardless of whether the NYT piece is true or not.<p>And what if it is true? Whatever it turns out to be (again: it’s not published).<p>To me, when a company launches into this kind of PR Hail Mary, it’s not a sign of integrity.')
