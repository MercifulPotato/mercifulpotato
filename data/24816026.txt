Item(by='grimli333', descendants=None, kids=[24816032], score=None, time=1603004352, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24815952, text='It took me five minutes to verify this information about Oregon is not factual. You can see someoneâ€™s address with name and date of birth, but the site makes it clear if you register with this system that info will not be confidential.  You cannot register or change address without an Oregon DMV number.  I have not verified additional states.\nEDIT: To clarify, I only mention registration and change of address because these are the only features I can find that resemble the report in any way.  There is no way to request a replacement.  You can very very easily test this yourself.')
