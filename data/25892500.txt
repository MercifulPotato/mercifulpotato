Woman means &quot;ones spouse&quot;, used to be used by anybody? Or do I have that wrong.<p>&#x27;Man&#x27; still means in some languages what &quot;one&quot; means in English in the sense of &quot;one&#x27;s friends are important&quot;. A person. Not a male.<p>But it isn&#x27;t complicated. Today in English &#x27;man&#x27; means a male. All the obfuscation using etymology and history are meaningless to a modern young person who knows what they&#x27;re saying and what they&#x27;re hearing.')
