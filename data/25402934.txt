To be honest, I never thought of it as one, but the reality is that users post content, and other users interact with that content. So it does act like a social network in that sense.<p>It&#x27;s probably my personal situation that blocked the idea of it being a social network from my head, but I think of it as a &quot;public place&quot; - no private interaction for me on there, no interactions with people I know on there. Just interactions with strangers that create&#x2F;share content.')
