A while back, when I used to read and reply to a few comments on the topic, I reckoned there was a bit of a pattern to voting - non-believer comments would turn light gray almost instantly, but then get well into the black over time, like there was a small but very quick and fanatical group on the believer side trying to eliminate any dissent, but a much larger and slower group of non-believers who reign out in the long term. That was a while ago, so I don&#x27;t know if it is the same now. These days I treat blockchain and cryptocurrencies like politics and religion - best not talk about them in polite company.')
