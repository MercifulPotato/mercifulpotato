Item(by='cactus2093', descendants=None, kids=[25950221, 25950665], score=None, time=1611871547, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25949861, text='&gt; there are not many guarantees in trading, but that is a guarantee to lose money.<p>What? This is not at all a guarantee. Even if there were a guarantee that it will come back down eventually (which seems highly likely but that&#x27;s still not a guarantee), that doesn&#x27;t mean it will go down today or tomorrow or next week. For all we know there is still lots of time for new investors to get in, make money, and then get out before the price crashes.<p>The particular absurdity of your claim here is that if it were true, we could not possibly have ended up in this place. That&#x27;s exactly how we got here, people who &quot;knew better&quot; knew that of course this stock was going down and shorted it. Then it went up a little and people shorted it even more and it went up even more, and on and on as this played out over the past few weeks.')
