Data is &quot;already decentralized&quot;, but HTTP requests are not because their context is always dependent on the service provider&#x27;s intent. Given an HTTP request like:<p>&quot;PUT &#x2F;posts&#x2F;1&#x2F;update &lt;body&gt;&quot;<p>Vapor stores the entire serialized HTTP request instead of just the &quot;&lt;body&gt;&quot; part and double signs \n both on the user side and the service provider side. And this transaction can be trustlessly relayed to 3rd party nodes as well as returned back to the user as a receipt for evidence, because the raw transaction is self-validatable complete with the enclosed public key against which to check the signature, as well as the Bitcoin transaction ID acting as the checksum for raw transactions being synchronized.<p>You ask who owns the data, but it can be structured so that every user stores every single transaction on their wallet or local storage, not to mention 3rd party nodes that can act as insurance.')
