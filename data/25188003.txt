This time from Germany!<p>It&#x27;s pretty cool that there&#x27;s so much going on in this space, but is it really wise going into the market with seemingly the exact same features that Plausible, Simple Analytics, Fathom, etc. offer? Even Cloudflare recently entered the privacy-friendly analytics market with a free product, so it seems that market is getting really crowded. Then again, every (commercial) website probably needs such a solution, so maybe the market is big enough.<p>I wonder though if these cookie-less solutions can give people the insights they need? You can do only very simple overall statistics and funnel analyses with this approach. Maybe that&#x27;s enough for most websites though?')
