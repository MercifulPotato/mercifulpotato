By day 3 all of my muscles and joints ache terribly. During sleep your body is clearing itself of waste and healing. So not only are you a miserable zombie, your body itself is falling apart! I have enormous empathy for anyone who suffers from mental health issues.<p>I take Lexapro daily, have a low-dose benzo for situational anxiety that I try never to take except it true emergencies, practice mindfulness &#x2F; meditation, see a therapist off and on. You get better at managing it but it&#x27;s a problem that never truly goes away.')
