I was serious that this feels like it was churned out at pace.<p>I can&#x27;t see a way to interpret this that doesn&#x27;t come back to, fix passwords and stop bothering with this other stuff. In some forms (e.g. satire) you are supposed to sneak in an actual point you wanted to make (e.g. Swift&#x27;s &quot;Modest Proposal&quot; lists the things Swift thinks would actually work, pretending to dismiss them as inferior to eating babies). But I believe in Burlesque it is considered satisfactory just to point and laugh. I didn&#x27;t laugh, maybe that&#x27;s on me.')
