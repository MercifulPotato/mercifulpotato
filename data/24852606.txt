As for travel inside of country, most of the passengers are travelling for work and normally employers pay for travel costs and if not it would be tax deductible, so they would naturally take trains. A lot of lines are already at maximum capacity during rush hour. As for travel to outside of the country, trains move a lot more passengers than Flixbus. Cheap train tickets are always bought early for holiday season.<p>I find public transport more expensive compared to minimum wage keeping other countries that I lived before, but the quality is high.<p>Trains are fast and reliable here and there&#x27;s continuous improvements on the trains and their tracks. Every year they would announce that decrease in travel time due to improved tracks or higher frequency for some routes.<p>The only problem is that when something goes wrong extreme weather, signal failure, problem on the tracks in the rush hour, then that route stops working and all neighbouring routes become delayed or overcrowded. Luckily I only experience it every few months.')
