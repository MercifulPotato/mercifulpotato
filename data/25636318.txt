There is nothing necessary about 10,000 4k maps and definitely nothing typical. Workflows trade a certain amount of optimization for consistency, but not like this.<p>&gt; patronizing who actually works in the industry.<p>I don&#x27;t think I was patronizing.  This person is valuable in that they are trying to make completely excessive situations work. Telling people (or demonstrating to them) they are being ridiculous is not his responsibility and is a tight rope to walk in his position.<p>&gt; Also speaking as an authority that knows best<p>If I said that 2 + 2 = 4 would you ask about a math degree? This is an exercise in appeal to authority.  This person and myself aren&#x27;t even contradicting each other very much.<p>He is saying the extremes that he has seen, I&#x27;m saying that 10,000 pixels of texture data for each pixel in a frame is enormous excess.<p>The only contradiction is that he seems to think that because someone did it, it must be a neccesity.<p>Instead of confronting what I&#x27;m actually saying, you are trying to rationalize why you don&#x27;t need to.')
