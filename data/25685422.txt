A CEO with a product background may make the companies customer&#x27;s&#x2F;product&#x2F;team more valuable to an acquirer.<p>The M&amp;A culture of the 80s was pretty toxic, businesses that financed their own expansion&#x2F;revamp in lean times were looted for their bank accounts during deep recessions.  The &quot;survivors&quot; now run with only a few months in the bank, making the whole economy more dependent on financial liquidity.
