We allow thirty minutes for live pairing on a pretty generic task. Candidates are using their own device, so whatever OS; IDE etc they like, with desktop shared by video. The idea is to match the work environment as closely as possible, so all resources are available to them- Google; stack overflow; other people&#x27;s public projects etc. We don&#x27;t expect candidates to complete the exercise in the time available but we do see how they tackle it')
