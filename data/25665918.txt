Item(by='hansvm', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609982382, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25661629, text='&gt; Are there people here on HN that believe the election was stolen?<p>Not me, but plenty of friends and family have such views. Every argument voiced to me so far from those sources has been some variant of the following two arguments:<p>1) &lt;ludicrous thing&gt; happened, therefore the election was rigged<p>2) &lt;ludicrous thing&gt; happened, therefore &lt;verifiably false thing&gt; happened, therefore the election was rigged<p>Elaborating slightly, &lt;ludicrous thing&gt; is defined here to be something designed to appeal to your common sense -- something that without close inspection would be plainly incompatible with a non-rigged election to any reasonable person. That&#x27;s probably ordinarily a fine enough chain of reasoning, but all the instances I bothered to examine had the property that reality directly contradicted one&#x27;s gut reaction; they seemed cherry-picked to be easy to believe and repeat while also being false (not to assume malice, I think that&#x27;s exactly the kind of reasoning you&#x27;d expect if you went fishing for evidence to support a theory you believe to be true).<p>As a specific example, one argument was that the exact vote tallies for Biden and Trump were the same across many voting locations, therefore a computer program must have generated the result. This sounds reasonable on the surface because it seems unlikely that if you drew vote counts out of a hat they would coincide, and most people aren&#x27;t equipped to be able to analyze such a statement further -- it&#x27;s &quot;ludicrous&quot; to imagine that in a fair election that kind of anomaly would happen by accident. In practice though, combining the facts that most combinations of votes are comparatively unlikely (few locales would have a 0&#x2F;N split for example) with the large number of voting locations and a healthy dose of the birthday paradox, many repeated vote tallies are _exactly_ what one would expect from a fair election. Their absence would in fact be a suspicious property indicating some kind of large-scale fraud.<p>Anywho, I didn&#x27;t investigate every theory (there were a lot), but I did check out the first 10 or so which came my way and a randomly selected 5 or so (till I grew tired or bored) from each subsequent batch. There might be a valid argument in there somewhere (and independently of their ability to come up with a valid argument there _might_ have been some kind of massive fraud), but the best evidence I&#x27;ve seen is pretty shoddy.')
