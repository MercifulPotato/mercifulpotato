There was progress towards smartphones starting halfway the 90s, then somewhere around 2000 there was internet access and the first devices with mail&#x2F;GPS maps etc came out. Then the first iPhone came, and indeed it was a big step, but cdefinitely not out of nowhere: most or all of the tech itself was already there. Just less polished and not always all of it in the same device.')
