Serverless doesn&#x27;t abscond you from defining what infrastructure you want to create, it just reduces the management overhead once you have created it.<p>For example, you can both create a lambda and EC2 infrastructure using Terraform. However, once you have created a lambda function, little maintenance is required going forward, unlike EC2. EC2 instances require continuous patching of the operating system, managing disk space (&#x2F;tmp filling up over time), and you have to plan for an EC2 instance to be taken out of service if it starts failing health checks.')
