You can create a lambda or EC2 infrastructure using Terraform. Once you have created a lambda function, no further maintenance is required, unlike EC2. EC2 instances require continuous patching of the operating system, managing disk space (&#x2F;tmp filling up over time), and you have to plan for an EC2 instance to be taken out of service if it starts failing health checks.')
