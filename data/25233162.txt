I can’t think of a time on earth that hasn’t happened, implicitly or explicitly.  (Depending on your definition of “tribe”...tribe of one?). The exceptions don’t last long:  Nazi Germany, Mao’s China (Xi’s?), Stalin’s Soviet Union...<p>Never has it been easier to see this clearly, though, than in the current era of instant access and sharing of information and opinion.<p>But in the US, individuals thinking on their own is almost a core cultural value.  Although more honor&#x27;d in the breach than in the observance in some circles.<p>Not just because the founding of the US was based upon a break with convention of colonization and an hereditary royalist system.  Most immigrants (at least before the age of air travel) made a radical permanent individual decision to leave the Old World and come to the Americas, when most around them were staying.  So it is in the DNA, so to speak.<p>Still a core value to most in the US, I would venture to say.  We honor self-reliance and unconventionality when we read Emerson, Thoreau and Whitman for example.  Might be a more significant core value for the heartland of the US than the coastals.  Farming will do that to a person.<p>You folks are still reading Emerson and the like, right?')
