The idea is that user will download it and may use in the command line so they don&#x27;t have to share their personal data on the web.<p>It will be both interactive and batch oriented. In batch oriented method, the program will generate templates based on a brief description of user&#x27;s situation and user can fill up the values in this template and feed it to the program. Program will fill up appropriate forms and produce PDFs.<p>A later version will be able to interact with the IRS API so that the tax could be filed directly from the command line.')
