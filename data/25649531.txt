A 12-nt insertion at S1&#x2F;S2 in the spike coding sequence yields a furin cleavage site, which raised controversy views on origin of the virus. Here we analyzed the phylogenetic relationships of coronavirus spike proteins and mapped furin recognition motif on the tree. Furin cleavage sites occurred independently for multiple times in the evolution of the coronavirus family, supporting the natural occurring hypothesis of SARS-CoV-2.<p>Not &quot;just plain luck&quot; but a relatively rare recombination event that can occur in nature with co-infection. I have no problem with the lab hypothesis but I expect to see clear signs of a recent lineage recombination in the full SARS-CoV-2 genome. The lab theory requires not only a lab leak but the active suppression of the sequence(s) of the viral isolate(s) used in the hypothetical gain-of-function experiment.<p>Wuhan is no more unlikely than the mainland near Hong Kong where SARS-1 emerged. Any major city center in China that is accessible from Kunming, Yunnan [2] is a likely outbreak hotspot.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedirect.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;article&#x2F;pii&#x2F;S1873506120304165" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedirect.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;article&#x2F;pii&#x2F;S187350612...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Kunming#Transport" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Kunming#Transport</a>')
