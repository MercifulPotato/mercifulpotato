Just how well you can articulate your vision is honestly convincing me to just fully embrace tailwind. It‘s something every developer from every framework or guard of web development can get on board with.<p>I‘m happy you are putting the recommendation to use components or partials front and center over @apply. In my experience @apply has the power to negate the wins from tailwind. Maybe v3 can drop it?<p>One small thing: maybe you already discussed it but I would just drop the word gag reflex from the landing page. It‘s just... unpleasant.')
