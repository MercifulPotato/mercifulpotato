I would be very interested in this evidence if you can provide a link&#x2F;citation, if they provide counter-evidence to the specific claims being made in the document.<p>&gt; Funny how Texas, which has historically been so concerned about &quot;States Rights&quot; (a euphemistic dog whistle for the right to own slaves)<p>I am a Texan and a supporter of states rights.  More specifically, I am a supporter of individual rights.  I believe that the federal government has too much power and this power should be returned to either the states, counties, or individuals.<p>I can tell you, that my personal support of states rights, has absolutely nothing to do with racism.')
