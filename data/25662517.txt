The configuration program was included on a cd-rom (one of those weird miniature ones). I had to find a USB-serial adapter as well as an external USB cd-rom drive in order to make it all work. I also had to install Windows XP into a virtual machine.<p>No idea if a simple web page using WebUSB would have worked better for me, the original manufacturer seems to have folded up over 10 years ago and their website no longer resolves.')
