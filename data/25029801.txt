The decrypted text is a different matter. It&#x27;s supposed to be protected. So you are saying, eventually, if I may interpret it that way, that speech which is protected from the authorities including the courts is not in fact protected from the courts.<p>Oh, ok, that&#x27;s not even illogic, just paradox.<p>Problematicly, if you consider the abstract danger of a key cypher pair a threat, the same goes for the legislatator court partnership. The courts aren&#x27;t a threat as long as there&#x27;s no legislation that opens them up to it. So, clearly, the legislation is key to the infringement. This means that legislation has to act in accordance with legislation, which is as difficult to understand for regular joe as function pointer semantics in C++. So it appears to say, simply, that legislation has to act...<p>That&#x27;s you and me. Actually though, the law is accordingly a huge tower of abstraction. The moment you try to dereference &quot;the law&quot; it blows up into your face, a group of skilled experts has to drop into debugging mode and, eventually, has to decide if they want to have their access limited even in debugging mode. Well, the system was designed for the hypervisor kernel to access all areas, this seems to be a problem of the virtual OS handling the capabilities for userspace incorrectly.<p>Bug closed: won&#x27;t fix.')
