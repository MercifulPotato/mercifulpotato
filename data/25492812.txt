That could block some of the island’s 2 million penguins – including King penguins, Gentoos, Macaronis and Chinstraps – from reaching the waters to feed their young. The melting freshwater could also make the waters inhospitable for phytoplankton and other sea creatures that are crucial\n parts of the food chain.<p>Melting away isn&#x27;t what is expected, is what turns this into a localised disaster.')
