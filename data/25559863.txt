I don&#x27;t know if anyone&#x27;s been fired yet for saying &quot;master bedroom&quot; specifically, but people have been fired for even more innocuous things than that. Like that professor in the UK who was fired for expressing his admiration of the competence of the Jewish people.<p>Of course anyone can get fired for saying &quot;master bedroom&quot; or absolutely anything else if it&#x27;s said to be racist. I could agree with your take if the dialogue around those terms was that they were merely harmless. But that is not the dialogue. They are being labeled racist, and being racist naturally implies that they must be stamped out along with the people that say &quot;racist&quot; things. The entire point of labeling things &quot;racist&quot; rather than &quot;tactless&quot; is so that the dogma of the week can be enforced with actual consequences. You can&#x27;t get a Twitter mob together for someone being tactless, but you can absolutely do it to someone that&#x27;s &quot;racist&quot;.')
