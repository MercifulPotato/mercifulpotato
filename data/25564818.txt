The solution to this problem is to better secure the rights of people accused of crimes.<p>We need to ensure that people accused do not lose their jobs and homes. That they have fair opportunity to communicate with counsel and family (both are often needlessly limited by DoC). And the state must be responsible to mitigate its mistakes.<p>Bail requirements are too often granted as par for the course and need a &quot;burden of proof&quot; type rethinking. Holding people at home should be required before incarceration. Lastly we need to remove the power of the legislatures to unequally empower prosecutors and public defense attorneys.')
