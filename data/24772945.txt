But I wanted to mention, that on my block (a mixed income neighborhood in Boston) has 1 guy who fixes almost all our cars.  He doesn&#x27;t own a shop, he just brings his tools and fixes your box on the street.  Every time he&#x27;s out there he acquires a new customer.  We all love him.  His work is great, and his prices are so low my wife has to argue with him to take more.  Without him, there&#x27;s a lot of people where I live who would be in a tough spot.')
