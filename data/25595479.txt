Item(by='Noos', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609439420, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25595016, text='There have been modern kids authors that focus on boys: Darren Shan&#x27;s vampire series, Anthony Horowitz&#x27;s Alex Rider books, Rick Riordan, the Artemis Fowl series, etc. Jon Scieszka did his Time Warp Trio books for example. Dav Pilkey did Captain Underpants and various other series. There&#x27;s the Diary of a Wimpy Kid series, and more.<p>However, the massive bulk of the market ends up being targeted towards women. It&#x27;s something where you&#x27;d need to actually look on shelves for, as there&#x27;s a weird dynamic where in female-dominated markets or places, you have male &quot;figurehead&quot; things while the rest of the market is dominated by and caters to women.<p>I noticed this in Christian fiction ironically. You will see a big author like Ted Dekker doing his spiritual action adventure&#x2F;fantasy&#x2F;mild horror for a wide audience, but the huge bulk of the books are historical&#x2F;amish&#x2F;mystery romance aimed at women, to the point where no male alternatives exist. Even the small religious science fiction market is female dominated soft romantic sf.<p>In this case it&#x27;s milking established demographics, as the religion itself has a mild demographics issue (not enough men.) But go look at a young adult shelf sometime; even superhero books feature women protagonists and are targeted to them now.')
