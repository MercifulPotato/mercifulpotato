Totally happy with the visuals: TV big and close enough to fill my vision. But the sound over streaming is compressed shite. Even when they say &quot;Dolby Atmos&quot;, it&#x27;s a thin Atmos layer over the compressed signal DD+, not Atmos over True HD lossless audio. I suppose, from their perspective, it makes sure I also buy the 4K disk after paying for the movie on streaming.')
