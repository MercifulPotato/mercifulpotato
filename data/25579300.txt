The engineer with ties to Wyoming is used to making $50,000 per year. You offer him $60,000 – a substantial pay bump – and he&#x27;s over the moon, ready to jump ship from his current job. Why pay the former SV engineer who moved to Wyoming $200,000 when you can get the same thing for $60,000?<p>When we used to think being in an office in the heart of the Valley was important, $200,000 was the cost of getting someone into the office. But now that we&#x27;ve decided the office wasn&#x27;t all that important after all, the rest of the country (and world) are ready to moderate things.')
