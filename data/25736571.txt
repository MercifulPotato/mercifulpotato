Technically, there&#x27;s no central authority that can moderate Signal, so you can&#x27;t have the moral obligation there.<p>I don&#x27;t think there would be a significant proportion of people that would advocate for Signal to become centralized so it would allow moderation by a central authority.<p>Another perhaps more cynical take is that even if there is hate-speech and other undesirable communication in Signal, it&#x27;s not seen so people aren&#x27;t concerned about it. As they say, &quot;out of sight, out of mind.&quot; That makes me wonder if expectations would change if people started publishing screenshots of Signal groups with hate-speech. I think they&#x27;d be pretty limited to small sizes, so perhaps they wouldn&#x27;t be as concerning.')
