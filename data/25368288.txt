From here you move on to the classics - Dickens, Twain, Tolstoy, Fitzgerald. If a book bores you, drop it. After enough years, inevitably, you reach a point where you&#x27;re ready for real literature - Dostoevsky, Proust, Moli√®re, Kant - the greats.<p>Some books can&#x27;t be summarized (poetry and real literature), some can be compressed to about ten pages and the majority to 0 pages.')
