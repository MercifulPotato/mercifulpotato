People are often selected on their frontend portfolio but they did &#x27;a bit of backend&#x27; as well and thus they are &#x27;fullstack&#x27;.<p>The end result is systems that are completely lob sided; nice frontends in the latest tech with insecure, slow, badly created backends that crumble under load. But it doesn&#x27;t matter because you can get better performance throwing money at it in a pretty simple straightforward way, while hiring other programmers, refactoring etc are very unsure endeavors(it could end up worse, deadlines aren&#x27;t made etc).<p>I have said it here many times before here; a lot of funded startups (especially) simply prefer to burn investor money rather than do things properly. I see aws&#x2F;gcp bills of 20-100k per month that can be below 10k with a few weeks (sometimes even days) of effort from someone who knows what they are doing, but nope, not happening. Automatically resolvable mistakes like having no (!!) indexes in a mysql database and so running $8k&#x2F;month db bills to keep it performant (multiple times often) is becoming a little be too normal for my taste.')
