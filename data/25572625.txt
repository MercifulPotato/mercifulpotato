As others have pointed out, the maximum fine (250k) is publicly available to look up, and was most likely also in the letters he received from the FCC. This didn&#x27;t come out of nowhere.<p>Think of it another way, imagine if the cops kept pulling you over for speeding. The first time you just got a warning, but they told you next time it&#x27;d be a $500 fine. Then you get caught again and they said &quot;Ok we&#x27;ll give you ONE more warning, but if you keep doing this, it&#x27;s a $500 fine&quot;. Then the third time you get caught, when they give you a $350 fine you can&#x27;t be all surprised pikachu at them. This guy knew the stakes (and was repeatedly reminded of them, by the enforcing body, who told him they would enforce the law if he didn&#x27;t stop) and he kept on breaking the law anyway. They need to send a clear message that this is NOT acceptable behavior. This is closer to driving on the runway at an active airport than it is to an everyday traffic violation.<p>In terms of the magnitude of the fine - he was putting people&#x27;s lives in danger, which I think justifies the amount. You also have to keep in mind that drones are an expensive hobby, it&#x27;s not uncommon for people to spend over $3k on drone equipment. Many popular drone pilots on instagram etc are incredibly wealthy and drive crazy sports cars and the like. They regularly fly $1000+ drones inches from water &#x2F; through forests etc, and they can afford to lose a few of them.<p>Put another way - if the normal response to breaking these laws was 2 warnings and a $10k fine over 2 years of publicly posting widely watched videos of yourself breaking the law, it wouldn&#x27;t be enough to stop a lot of these people.')
