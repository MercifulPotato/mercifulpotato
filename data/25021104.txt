It could be more if the new stuff was added in, or it could be the same amount if it replaces something else. The total amount of education isn&#x27;t super relevant, and it&#x27;s a bit misleading up claim that teaching anything other than what is already part of a medical school curriculum means you&#x27;re requiring students to learn &quot;more than a doctor&quot;.<p>For a more concrete example, I have never gone to graduate school; my education ended after finishing my undergrad. By any reasonable measure, I received &quot;less&quot; education than a doctor, who presumably completed an undergrad like me but also medical school afterwards. However, I almost certainly learned certain things that most doctors didn&#x27;t in my computer science education, like how a compiler or operating system is written. If instead of those computer science courses I took courses dealing with media literacy and how to recognize bias, I still would have &quot;less&quot; education than a doctor.')
