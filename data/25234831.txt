It&#x27;s just that text mode was long ago standardised with the use of ascii and the corresponding cga&#x2F;ega&#x2F;vga drivers.<p>&gt; <i>Before 1963, computer manufacturers had over sixty different ways of representing characters in computers. Machines could not communicate with one another</i> [0]<p>There were some wild inconsistencies with the different display drivers back in early days. It&#x27;s just that no one seemed to want to standardise on renderable gui elements afaik. Every platform  has redesigned the wheel, so to speak, giving us the mess we&#x27;ve always had.<p>It&#x27;d be interesting to see hardware level support for UI elements, but as you suggest,  we&#x27;re probably too far down the road for anyone to give up their niche GUI library.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ethw.org&#x2F;ASCII" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ethw.org&#x2F;ASCII</a>')
