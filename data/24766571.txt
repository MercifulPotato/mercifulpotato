These are two very poor examples of countries where mask-wearing is prioritized and accepted.<p>The Dutch government only a week or two ago &quot;urgently advised&quot; wearing masks indoors, and even with that advice in my own experience a majority of people are not wearing one. Before that, hardly anyone wore a mask indoors. I&#x27;ve traveled to Antwerp a few times for work in the past few months, and the prevalence of masks there compared to NL is striking.<p>And Sweden generally has been quite averse to wearing masks in public...it&#x27;s not ever been mandated anywhere, not even on transit like in NL.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thelocal.se&#x2F;20200831&#x2F;sweden-remains-an-outlier-despite-nordic-u-turn-on-face-masks" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thelocal.se&#x2F;20200831&#x2F;sweden-remains-an-outlier-d...</a>')
