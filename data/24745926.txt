If I recall correctly there are failures as well. The book walks through how to read annual reports so hopefully the reader isn&#x27;t picking totally fake companies.<p>I guess, the gist is, if all trades are just coin flips, it won&#x27;t matter anyway. But if you&#x27;re really committed to investing in a single stock (and you probably shouldn&#x27;t), have yourself a reason to think you have an edge. maybe the whole sector is growing, pep boys, auto zone, o&#x27;rielly and you can&#x27;t really go wrong.<p>If you&#x27;re going to the casino anyway, play a game where you at least understand the rules.')
