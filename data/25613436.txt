Item(by='sbarre', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609601488, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25609771, text='&gt; It&#x27;s ridiculous to even try to say that a home owner will not weigh 50 different factors, and have to tolerate 10 things they do NOT want because they come packaged with 40 other things they either want or absolutely need.<p>You make it sound like there&#x27;s a lack of options for homeowners when you say this.  Where I live (Toronto) that is not the case.<p>Of course there is no perfect deal, there will always be things that aren&#x27;t ideal but I don&#x27;t know anyone (and I&#x27;m old enough to know lots of home owners) who has ever bought a house that had some kind of feature or clause they absolutely hated or didn&#x27;t want.<p>If it&#x27;s that bad, you don&#x27;t buy that house, and you find one that better suits your needs.<p>Otherwise, you&#x27;re understanding and accepting the terms, and you&#x27;re willing to live with them.<p>I hate the argument that &quot;people&quot; are too stupid&#x2F;naive&#x2F;stuck to understand or avoid the terms of an agreement they&#x27;re entering into.. except for the narrator who sees themselves as the smart person who is yelling about it from the mountaintop.')
