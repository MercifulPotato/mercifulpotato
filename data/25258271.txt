If M2 has 32gb support I&#x27;ll buy one immediately.  For now, I&#x27;ll be sticking to my &quot;never buy gen 1 of any technology&quot; rule.  Right along side my, &quot;use tech until it breaks&quot; rule, however if you incentivize yourself to be a &quot;power user&quot; meeting the latter rule is far easier than the former ;) .')
