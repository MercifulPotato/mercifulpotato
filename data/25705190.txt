It&#x27;s very hard to get back.<p>You could have chosen another profession, but perhaps you&#x27;d have trouble with your knees then.<p>I had perfect vision for years, but a few years ago, things started to get blurry. Now I have to stop working after some hours because I just can&#x27;t see the screen anymore, which would have been unthinkable a few years back.
