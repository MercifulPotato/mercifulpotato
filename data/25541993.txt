He&#x27;s debugging zig, but his issues are with the <i>ux</i> and iirc he mentions few zig-specific bugs. I have been through the same ordeals while debugging C++ on Linux. In the end, there&#x27;s only gdb with a command line interface. Couldn&#x27;t get any nice IDE with watch, memory view or even simple breakpoints to work. Some have a few of those features but none has all of them working. Eg. if you have a working breakpoint it&#x27;ll fail to properly inspect STL containers etc.<p>I&#x27;m sure there are many people saying &quot;works on my machine&quot;, but it never worked on any of mine, sadly. Visual Studio simply works and has a nice, intuitive interface. Pressing F10 to step over will always be better than typing something in the gdb command line and hitting Enter.')
