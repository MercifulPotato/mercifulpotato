Most list apps tend to focus on productivity, I wanted a list app that focused on sharing and making lists that anyone could find useful.<p>Solution: a social list sharing site<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;listifi.app" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;listifi.app</a><p>I&#x27;ve tried adding enough social features to make the website feel a little more alive. When creating a list, there are four social features that I think are interesting:<p>- Explorable: lists with this setting are showcased on our explore page\n- Likeable: lists can be &quot;starred,&quot; similar to github and are saved on the user&#x27;s profile\n- Voting: allows users to vote on individual list items\n- Suggestions: allows users to write in suggestions that the owner of the list can approve&#x2F;reject<p>I plan to add more social features to increase engagement, but I&#x27;m at the point where I&#x27;ve got a functional app and really just need some feedback on how useful the website is to people.<p>Here&#x27;s a short video of creating a list: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;storage.googleapis.com&#x2F;listifi-assets&#x2F;listifi_create.mov" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;storage.googleapis.com&#x2F;listifi-assets&#x2F;listifi_create...</a><p>I created a feature wishlist for listifi to showcase some of the plugins I&#x27;ve built to supercharge lists:<p>- <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;listifi.app&#x2F;u&#x2F;erock&#x2F;listifi-feature-wishlist" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;listifi.app&#x2F;u&#x2F;erock&#x2F;listifi-feature-wishlist</a><p>The questions I&#x27;m asking myself are:<p>- Is this site useful to people?\n- Is there some other spin I can put on a list sharing website to drive engagement?\n- Is it fun and engaging to create lists on this website?<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance!')
