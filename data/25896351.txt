Any commercial business uses money as a means of getkeeping what it uses (buys).  This works well to reduce and so control the purchases of chairs, desks, external consultancies and proprietary software.<p>We all know the horrors and pain of trying to raise a PO to get a license for a really useful &#x2F; necessary piece of software.<p>I fundamentally guarantee that if React needed a 0.01 cent license for every internal and external installation it would have four users globally.<p>FOSS short circuits this gatekeeping function - and it is only popular because it is hard to keep track of and easy to load up npm and grab 900 libraries.<p>Imagine there was a FOSS plug-in everyone used, call it <i>mothership</i> that on every install (and indeed invocation) it routed back a simple packet to say &quot;i am alive and used on this machine in this domain in this company&quot; (let&#x27;s call it a common piece of config like git email config)<p>Immediately every legal department would soil their pants and internal software development would grind to a halt - or FOSS developers would be able to charge decent value for their work - or some ecosystem of foss-aggregators would spring up providing licensed, limited installs and support and legal protection.<p>Personally I am in favour of the  last option - for each product a series of (local) companies could club together and provide support for each other&#x27;s code bases, (if you use my react-foobar I will license company X to indemnify you - sort of approved  vendors schemes)<p>I struggle to see many better ways<p>Edit:<p>Andressen was slightly wrong - FOSS is going to eat the world.  And as such it&#x27;s production will be a public good - paid for out of taxpayer money and directed as such - either as a utility through regulation or as science through funding only the brightest.<p>And the big question remains - if we could see the whole stack easily, and if it all was priced at the minimum wage for every developer in the stack how much would it be?<p>Would anyone pay it? Or worse, would they realise they did not need all those in-house developers anymore as they are all running &quot;libBusiness.py&quot; and it all kind of fits together.<p>Or as is more likely - will we see lots of companies like redhat, that produce a &quot;bank&#x2F;airline&#x2F;retailer in a box&quot; - and the internal teams are focused on that 5% of USP?<p>I am not sure I understand that world - but I also do not think I currently could select correctly all the FOSS packages needed to build that stack that can just run a business.<p>Trust me it does not look like the openERP style stacks. at all.')
