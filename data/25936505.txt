The facility will fill vials of sterile injectable medicine. Those tend to be the drugs which are most affected by shortages and price gouging overall. The facility will just do finished drug products.<p>Our initial drugs are supplied on &quot;private label&quot; arrangements where other companies actually do the manufacturing, and we just add our labels and our own NDC code so we can set the price. Since we don&#x27;t go through middlemen, that price can often times be a lot lower.<p>We&#x27;ll have to source API (active pharmaceutical ingredients) elsewhere for now. At some point, would like to completely internalize our supply chain, but one step at a time. :-)')
