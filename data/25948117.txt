People like to complain that RH gets payment for order flow, but they just <i>knowingly cut off that order flow</i>.<p>It feels like Occam&#x27;s Razor should apply here. Either:<p>1. Robinhood felt that it&#x27;s long term prospects were better if it&#x27;s users weren&#x27;t able to gamble and most likely lose all of their money, thus being scared away from the stock market forever.<p>2. There is a secret cobal that Robinhood, who was previous the &quot;bad guy&quot; of the financial world, is now in and tricked it&#x27;s users into buying a stock that would be worthless just so that Robinhood could shut of trading at the peak, and let their secret hedge-fund buddies make a ton of money.<p>I&#x27;m not inclined to believe the conspiracy theory when there is a more more reasonable option.')
