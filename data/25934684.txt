Market cap is meaningless for companies with a lot of debt (industrial companies typically).  And if you don&#x27;t understand that you will make a lot of meaningless comparisons.<p>Also, if you believe in efficient markets (and lets admit this is a hard week to do that) then you know that companies are valued based on future profits, not future revenues.  Google and Ford had very similar revenue in say, 2019.  But there enterprise values were completely different because of gross margins and profits.')
