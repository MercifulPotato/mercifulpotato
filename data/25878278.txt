Do architects not read the news?<p>Neither the architect, nor the developer, nor the landlord are the beneficiaries of charger infrastructure. They aren&#x27;t going to spend money on it until they absolutely have to.<p>Given the decade of record-low vacancy rates in coastal metros, if a lack of an electric charger is a deal-breaker for you, they will shrug their shoulders, and move on to the next applicant. To them, you are the product, not the customer - the customer is the bank that underwrites their loans, that they use to buy&#x2F;build more properties, backed by cashflow from tenants.<p>They certainly aren&#x27;t going to put dollars down today, to meet demand that will come a decade from now. The entire business model of being a residential landlord is spending every penny you have on acquiring more property to lease - not making long-term investments into existing property.<p>If you&#x27;re looking for someone to blame, blame cheap availability of credit, or your local municipality for not updating their building codes to require electric chargers [1].<p>[1] The reason they haven&#x27;t updated their building codes is because in my experience, 8 times out of 10, municipal politics is completely dominated by landlords and developers. Those groups of people are the most affected by municipal law, so they have a huge vested interest in making sure government is looking out for their financial interests.')
