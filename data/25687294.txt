Item(by='VikingCoder', descendants=None, kids=[25689413], score=None, time=1610127505, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25686938, text='I do not trust an accountant who makes blatant accounting mistakes.<p>I do not trust the testimony of someone who has falsified evidence, or processed it incorrectly.<p>Neither of those are an ad hominem attack of a factual claim.  They show that someone is incapable or unwilling to provide evidence that should be considered.  Extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof, and if the evidence presented makes demonstrably false claims, then we&#x27;re done with that evidence, and should frown upon the person who presented it.  They should lose credibility.<p>If you want to find another accountant, offer up someone else&#x27;s testimony, show an untainted evidentiary chain, in support of a factual claim, I will gladly consider it.<p>I am not either &quot;Group&quot; in your scenario, by the way.<p>I accept that the Constitution of the United States enacts Laws, and Checks and Balances.  I accept that we have Courts to make determinations of fact.  We are a nation of laws.<p>I am not in and of myself rejecting claims, and satisfied with that as the conclusion of my interest in the matter.<p>I am informing you, I will accept the outcomes of the courts.  I accepted them when I disagreed with their outcomes in the past, and I expect others to do likewise.  Not that I think each outcome is Just, but that the long arm of history bends towards Justice.  When I am upset enough, I petition my representatives to change the law, or to impeach officers of government.  We are a nation of laws.<p>WHY would Georgia order a forensic analysis of counting machines, when a hand recount has agreed, within a reasonable degree?   It&#x27;s nonsense.<p>Is there a paper trail for voting machines?  Yes.  Voters are responsible for checking the paper record.  The paper record has been checked against the electronic record.  Aren&#x27;t we done?')
