I was just experimenting with SQLite as we speak! While I like Cayley so far, I&#x27;m already hitting some performance issues when doing full text search&#x2F;queries that need regex matching on large datasets. Given that HTTP request logging is perfectly suitable for a non-graph database, SQLite is probably more pragmatic. Also, I&#x27;m hoping that using a SQLite3 extension for regex (C) will be more performant than using Go&#x27;s `regexp` package. And of course there&#x27;s the added benefit you mentioned of a widely used DB with lots of (external) tooling.<p>The only downsides I see so far are that the project will need cgo, and thus cross compilation is a bit trickier for doing releases on GitHub. But already found a possible tool for making it easier: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;troian&#x2F;golang-cross" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;troian&#x2F;golang-cross</a>')
