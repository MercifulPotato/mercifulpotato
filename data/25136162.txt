The equivalent simile here would be if unleaded was going to be made mandatory in a year and basically 3 petrol stations in the UK stocked it.<p>The govt are going to make these cars mandatory soon. London is the ideal place to do this due to infra + rich people with EVs (more than you might think, far from &#x27;almost nobody&#x27;), yet I don&#x27;t see any street that has charges along it.<p>My point is that it&#x27;s not easy. Having to upgrade the grid and dig up tons of roads is simply not easy no matter how much people want it to be.')
