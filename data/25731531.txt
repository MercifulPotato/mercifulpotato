Item(by='rwcarlsen', descendants=None, kids=[25731753], score=None, time=1610383619, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25731117, text='This is a great quote and I think is very relevant to what&#x27;s been happening over the last few weeks.  I&#x27;m no Trump fan - nor a fan of the actions of people at the capitol.  But trump never asked for anyone to be violent or occupy the capitol.  But he and related organizations (i.e. parler) are being treated as such.  Seems a bit disturbing to me.  The arguments used to try to shut up MLK Jr. in the 60s are the same arguments being used to shut up Trump.  Heaven knows we don&#x27;t need to hear more of what he has to say.  But I&#x27;ll defend his right to say it.  And nobody needs to rehash &quot;but these are private companies&quot; crap.  Their doing this to appease the full-stack blue fed gov&#x27;t coming in.  So, in a way, it kind of is government motivated censorship.')
