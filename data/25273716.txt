See some comments below regarding various things I saw in this thread.<p>Stability:\nBeen running it for 2+ years now (or is it 3+ already?), no problems whatsoever. I update when the mood strikes - never had to roll back because something wasn&#x27;t working.<p>Why:\nAs someone who considers himself terrible at remembering things, this little piece of software made all the difference re keeping up with people. The e-mail notifications is a killer feature - so simple, yet I&#x27;ve never done it before in my personal inbox.<p>I think the fact that it&#x27;s an external service and not inside your inbox matters from a UX perspective. I have this other place where I define the logic, and then receive it in the screen I look at every morning.<p>Originally came to know of the project years back through <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sive.rs&#x2F;hundreds" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sive.rs&#x2F;hundreds</a>, and while he&#x27;s a bit better (a lot better) at it than I am, I can confidently say I&#x27;ve stayed in touch with dozens of people thanks to Monica. His notion of &quot;ranked lists&quot; also makes sense, at least to me, as a mental framework for managing personal contacts.<p>Shameless plug (for the creators!):\nI 100% recommend Monica, have contributed to it, and am a big big supporter of <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;djaiss" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;djaiss</a> (Regis), <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;asbiin" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;asbiin</a> (Alexis), et al.<p>They&#x27;re actively working on something new now, so if that helps them somehow - link incoming:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.officelife.io&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.officelife.io&#x2F;</a><p>A personal comment:\nThere&#x27;s a (repeating) notion in this thread that keeping up with people is somehow linked to how much you care about them. I care deeply about many people I meet, personally, but I don&#x27;t think the two are necessarily correlated.<p>Example: Say I met someone years ago at school, and I thought she was pretty cool. I added her to Monica and I reach out to her once in a while to see what&#x27;s up. We talk about work, exchange some personal stories, and go our separate ways. I might not think about her for months at a time, but then - quite intentionally - I think about her when the email notification comes up. It makes me happy that this person is somehow in my life.<p>Is that impersonal? Is it wrong in some way? It&#x27;s my own very, very private way of keeping people in my life. I don&#x27;t see it as not genuine or fake.<p>If it works, right?')
