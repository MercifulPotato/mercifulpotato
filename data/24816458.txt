Really good one, it builds zk-SNARK understanding step by step. Sometimes though it possibly goes to deep in explaining basic concepts - I&#x27;m not sure if someone who didn&#x27;t have experience with modular arithmetic would be able to get to understand it in a way that would be enough for the whole concept. Assuming basic mathematics knowledge as modular arithmetic, polynomials, interpolation, etc. might be a better approach in my feeling, but YMMV.')
