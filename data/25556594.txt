The suggestion isn’t to create configurable anc headphones but instead to create a device that is able to cancel out the sound of your voice from the ears of other people around you so you can speak in public privately.<p>The problem is you can’t possibly work out exactly how and when the sound will hit each set of ears around you to be able to direct a beam of sound to their ears (assuming it’s even possible to have such directional sound)<p>The problem is significantly easier with headphones. You have a headphone and speaker in between your ears and the sound. The distance between the microphone and your ears is constant so you can perfectly time the negative sounds.')
