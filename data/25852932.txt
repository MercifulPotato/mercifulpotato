We had basically just a fileserver, FTP box, and a couple VMs for some time clock, wiki, and building security systems, so nothing we were running yet was CentOS specific.<p>But in case it can be useful to you, please share with your team that the writing they&#x27;re putting on the wall looks pretty bad. Knowing I&#x27;d have to update eventually, I just took the safe option, <i>which is no longer any distro controlled by Red Hat.</i> I didn&#x27;t want to leave our server in a state where we could be building dependencies on a platform that was likely to be pulled out from under us, and while RHEL isn&#x27;t too expensive to just buy for one server, and we might have qualified for something free or something you&#x27;ve not yet announced, my test was surprisingly painless and the migration was easier than I anticipated.')
