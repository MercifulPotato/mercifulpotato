Please read the history of China it has more revolutions than USA. CCP cannot function without the support of majority of people like a democratic system. It just works in a different way probably watch the video in the link it’s a good explanation [1].<p>Chinese system is different politically and it’s hard to say it’s good or bad for its people, given on the ground it has proved good for majority with suppression of minority (see the same happening in any democracy too, tyranny of majority). So unless democratic system can really save its minority they can’t be on higher ground. Also if one needs over a billon dollar to fight election and win top positions there are favours to be done, like what happens in two largest democracies of India and USA. So every system has its positive and negative.<p>If you want to bring about change in China then may be go there do something great for the people and if they find it better than existing system for their livelihood and better life they will change.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ted.com&#x2F;talks&#x2F;eric_x_li_a_tale_of_two_political_systems" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ted.com&#x2F;talks&#x2F;eric_x_li_a_tale_of_two_political_...</a>')
