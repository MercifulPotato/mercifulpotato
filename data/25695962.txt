It&#x27;s easier out here in europe, we&#x27;ve been lucky enough not to suffer too much from the awful american media diet.<p>I live in the U.S. and stay away from the media. I recommend it. I used to think it was important to stay abreast of all of the comings and goings, but that was B.S. It&#x27;s a stressful waste of time for me. I don&#x27;t really get into sports either.<p>&gt; There&#x27;s a lot of propaganda in your country. I sympathize with you, truly; it&#x27;s difficult to tell what&#x27;s real and what isn&#x27;t when you&#x27;ve been gaslit for years.<p>What you say is true about it being difficult to tell what is real. But, the only people that I spoken with that know what it&#x27;s like in America are those that have lived here recently for a year or more, and preferably those that have moved around some. It&#x27;s a large country, with different cultures; I don&#x27;t even know them all. A lot of it is annoying (the parts of the country where people act really fake and the parts where people seem nice but are passive aggressive isolating backstabbers), and a lot more of it is honest, loud, quiet, funny, and cool.<p>I sometimes act as if I understand the people of this or that country, because I work with people of different countries each day at work, so I know I act the same way; I don&#x27;t really know what it&#x27;s like either.')
