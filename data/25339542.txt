There&#x27;s no supported way to use DirectX (or Direct 2D or DXGI or ...) from .NET. They know there&#x27;s relatively large demand for it, but the .NET team says &quot;I&#x27;ll forward that to the DirectX team&quot; and the DirectX team says &quot;we just do C++ over here.&quot; The default response to cross-cutting concerns should be that <i>both</i> teams take responsibility but right now <i>neither</i> team will take responsibility. Another corollary to Conway&#x27;s Law.')
