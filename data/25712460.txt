Item(by='davesque', descendants=None, kids=[25712516], score=None, time=1610268426, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25706993, text='Part of what makes this situation interesting&#x2F;concerning is that it&#x27;s not hard to imagine that censoring unwanted or problematic speech might become technically infeasible at some point in the not so distant future.<p>I&#x27;m not at all a crypto maximalist.  However, let&#x27;s assume that the technical questions about the viability of large-scale, highly performant distributed apps running on blockchains get worked out.  Assuming we eventually do have something like a de-centralized Facebook running on something like Ethereum, how could we ever expect to avert situations like this in the future by moderating content?  If that content was stored on an immutable blockchain, it might be <i>impossible</i> to moderate.  The only solution would be to somehow take down the entire blockchain network.<p>Related to this, there seems to be something important about the interactivity and responsiveness of a social media platform that&#x27;s connected with how useful it could be to organize movements like this.  Maybe, if it turns out that blockchain-based solutions can&#x27;t get around having the built-in latency of something like a block time, then dapps will never be viable alternatives to centralized social media platforms.')
