Item(by='shubik22', descendants=0, kids=None, score=1, time=1612203838, title='Ask HN: Advice on Incorporation (Stripe Atlas vs. Clerky)', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='Hi HN,<p>I recently left my job to focus on a company I&#x27;m starting, and I&#x27;m thinking about incorporating.  I&#x27;m trying to decide how to go about doing this and was hoping to get some advice from others who have gone through this experience.<p>I don&#x27;t have any cofounders, but I&#x27;m planning on incorporating with a Delaware C corporation because I&#x27;m expecting to have paying customers soon, and though I don&#x27;t have any immediate fundraising plans, I want to leave open that possibility in the future.  Am I correct that it makes sense for me to incorporate now?<p>Secondly, I&#x27;m trying to understand the differences between Clerky and Stripe Atlas, the two services I&#x27;m considering.  I&#x27;ve ready the Satchel guide (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;satchel.com&#x2F;incorporation&#x2F;), but the issues they ding Stripe Atlas for don&#x27;t seem like a huge deal to me.  I also like that Stripe Atlas would be integrated with Stripe and would open a bank account for me, as I&#x27;m planning on using Stripe to accept payments.  On the other hand, I&#x27;ve seen pretty universally positive reviews from people who have used Clerky.  Any have any opinions on which one is better?<p>Lastly, I&#x27;m pretty confused by Clerky&#x27;s product offerings (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.clerky.com&#x2F;pricing).  They have a &quot;Company Lifetime Package&quot; for $799, and then a bunch of different &quot;Pay Per Use&quot; items (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.clerky.com&#x2F;pricing#pay-per-use) that you can buy separately.  The formation pay per use items include Incorporation (which I know is necessary), as well as &quot;Post-Incorporation Setup&quot; and &quot;Foreign Qualification&quot;.  Does anyone know which of these are actually necessary for me?<p>I&#x27;m leaning towards Stripe Atlas, as it only has a single offering.  Everyone seems to like Clerky, but I&#x27;m concerned about either overpaying for services I don&#x27;t need, or neglecting to choose some item that I&#x27;ll later find out I needed.<p>Thanks in advance for the help!\n- Sam')
