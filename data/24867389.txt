In fact, in my opinion it gets to the root of why humanity is what it is.<p>This lady is writing about writing.  This is recursive.  Humanity has the ability to think conceptually and recursively about things - this is thinking about thinking.  This act opens the world to creativity in a way that is not possible for other creatures.<p>Eg we can think about a table as a concept - it brings to mind something like &quot;Four legs, a flat solid top&quot;.  As a concept though, we can take those bits out it and ask things like &#x27;What would a table be with no legs?&#x27; or &#x27;what would a table be without a solid top&#x27;.<p>This is how easy it is for us to play with concepts - thinking about thinking.  And then write about it.')
