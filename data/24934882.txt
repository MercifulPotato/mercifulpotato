What kind of products could exist that simply can out today?<p>This[0] article puts it into perspective just how much metals exist out there.<p>Seems like most of the precious metals we have access to are from previous asteroid collisions. There is a theory that the last age ~12k years ago was from an asteroid impact, and that it can be traced due to changes in platinum levels.<p>Whoever figures out how to mine metals from space rocks is going to have an interest problem to face. They can&#x27;t just dump it all onto the market -- they&#x27;ll have to pull a move similar to the diamond industry.
