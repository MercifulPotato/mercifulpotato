In SimCity and its ilk, time handling is really simplistic. Even huge infrastructure projects finish pretty much instantly so making dramatic changes is not that disruptive, and there is nothing to simulate the changing of eras so your cities end up having fairly monotonous texture.<p>What if as your city evolves it would change from old-town narrow cobbled streets and weirdly shaped buildings to early modern brickwork, then brutalist concrete monsters, and finally modern sky scrapers and suburbs, or whatever, so different neighborhoods end up feeling different based on the era they were built. And if&#x2F;when you need to remodel&#x2F;improve the area, you&#x27;d have to take the existing stuff more into account and plan for the potentially multi-year construction project with the construction traffic and potential street blockage etc.')
