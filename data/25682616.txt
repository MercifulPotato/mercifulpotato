To satisfy that demand, content providers are encouraged to generate the maximal outrage and foment fear. Social media platforms are incentivised to direct people towards that content, because they make more money that way.<p>The end result: social media platforms automate pile-on and radicalisation at the speed of lies, at global scale. Not because they are inherently evil, but because they are making money off of people being inherently terrible.<p>ß: The real meat of the book is in the first two chapters, as far as I&#x27;m concerned. Everything else in there is just repeating the arguments.')
