Item(by='codetrotter', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602460086, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24749864, text='I think what OP meant when speaking about sides was this:<p>If I show you a video today, where in the video I am holding the newspaper from 1 year ago, then (excluding any video manipulation) you can be reasonably sure that I did not record the video <i>prior</i> to 1 year ago because prior to that the newspaper for that day did not yet exist. So I have given reasonable proof for one direction in time; that it can’t have been further back in time than that.<p>But the other direction in time, and what I think they are referring to as “the other side”, is forward.<p>With the same video, you decide to trust that it wasn’t filmed prior, but it could have been filmed at any point in time since.<p>So what OP is asking for is for a way to prove that a message (text, video, or whatever else) was composed <i>no later</i> than some point t2 in time.<p>And for this the suggestions in this thread are good.<p>And if you combine techniques then you can to some extent prove that a message was composed between two specific points in time.<p>For example, by having the message reference a fact that was not known prior to point t1 in time and then having the message itself or a hash of the message notarized at point t2 in time in a medium that can be reasonably trusted.<p>But still it is challenging, with things like the possibility that you created and notarized separate messages for all possible outcomes for example and chose to divulge only the notarization of the outcome that actually happened after the outcome was known.')
