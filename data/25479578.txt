The problem with going after the rich is that it&#x27;s setting up a system for this type of control. Government leaders (especially the ones in CA) constantly abuse control, and giving them more points of control makes no sense. One year is a minority being targeted (just not if it&#x27;s racial, gender etc), the next it will be some large group of people, maybe middle class, maybe small business owners, and they will extend such nonsense to a larger group. These laws have to matter in principle because it is much easier to extend their power then to weaken them or even harder, undo them.')
