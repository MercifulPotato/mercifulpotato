Your built in emotions, hormones, drives, are still from your evolution. Yes, forwards humans might not evolve biologically. But you still evolved from systems dating hundreds of millions of years back.<p>You simply can&#x27;t just say these don&#x27;t matter any more, because it&#x27;s ignoring reality. Every time you&#x27;re turned on by someone attractive, its evolution thats doing that. And good luck thinking rationally when you are truly in love. (or to take a different example, when your body has a temperature in reaction to a disease. Good luck overriding your absolutely terrible mental state with rational human thought).')
