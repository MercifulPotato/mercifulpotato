While we do see the benefits of being able to offer multiple sources of satellite data (virtual constellations combining high-res, low-res, SAR, hyperspectral, etc.) we want to limit our attention to doing one thing extremely well: providing high-res visible imagery.<p>To your point of developing our own tech-stack for &quot;table stakes&quot; - we certainly hope so. Planet has done a lot of fantastic work here as far as developing robust imagery pipelines but stopped short of removing salespeople from the process. We&#x27;re hoping to take their approach a step further and remove that manual (human) component from both the sales process and delivery pipelines.<p>Hope that helps!')
