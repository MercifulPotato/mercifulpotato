Because he had the wit to do it, while others stood on the sidelines. Probably because he&#x27;d been actually trained in taking quick action, in leading by example. He was 16.<p>So I can see that folks may be paralyzed by indecision, even by the intensity of their feelings. Ok, &#x27;normal&#x27; people want to help but probably don&#x27;t because of a lifetime of holding back.')
