Aim for interdependence instead of dependence.<p>And for the love of heck don&#x27;t try and find a surrogate mom&#x2F;dad. Do your own housekeeping and maintenance, earn your own money, live your own life before sharing it with another. Especially in my parents&#x27; generation, a lot of people went from home to live with their SO. People like my dad who never learned to cook and only had to get to grips with it when my mom started to work evenings. Mind you, that&#x27;s also when I learned.<p>Anyway, modern day advice, try to live on your own for a while before living with someone else.')
