It’s deeply racist. Here is how every interaction i’ve had goes:<p>Checkpoint cop, looks at people in vehicle, sees they are all white, bored sounding asks “is everyone an american citizen?”<p>Driver: “no, some of us are american and some are canadian.”<p>Checkpoint cop, confused: “uhhh that’s alright, proceed”<p>There purpose is supposedly to check for illegal cross border activity in the US and yet a car full of canadians doesn’t even blip their radar because it’s not actually about nationality it’s about race.<p>Which is all to say that i believe your comment about that checkpoint being about contraband glosses over the real motivations. In the dozens of times i’ve been thru there all i’ve ever been asked about is citizenship, and it’s never mattered what the answer is because i am white.')
