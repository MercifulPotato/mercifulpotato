In other words, if there is some problem (real or perceived), the state can&#x27;t simply do nothing about it. And, the politicians of California are enthusiastic about creating new bureaucracy to enforce the newly minted laws. Which they usually pay for by creating some specific tax&#x2F;fee on some specific transaction or type of product, which then creates more complexity and bureaucracy.')
