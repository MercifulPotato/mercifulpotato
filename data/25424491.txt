For the same amount of insulation, the amount of heat lost is also dependent on temperature. Leaving the house at a lower temperature (but still heated, not off!) while you are absent for long periods of time _usually_ is a better approach. Because you are losing heat anyway, the question is just how much.<p>Sure, if you have really amazing insulation(outside of specially engineered buildings you probably don&#x27;t), the difference may not be significant and you would be right.')
