If you go into a doctor&#x27;s office or clinic, there&#x27;s rarely a phlebotomist on hand. Your blood is usually drawn by someone whose license allows them to do more than draw blood. We drive efficiency by ensuring that professionals are always operating at the &quot;top-of-license&quot;. I know from personal experience: my doctor gave me my flu shot, which can be done by an LVN making $40&#x2F;hr rather than a doctor making $150&#x2F;hr.<p>We also hope demand will drive an increase in the number of people who choose to enter these health professions, which pay decent wages. It takes about 6 months to become a phlebotomist, 12 months to become an MA, and 18 months to become an LVN. These professions are accessible from both a time and monetary standpoint.')
