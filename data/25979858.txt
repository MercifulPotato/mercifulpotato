For instance, you sell a 30 put when the market is at 45.  There is a great sell off, you are assigned when the underlying is trading at 25.  You own at 30 less whatever premium you received, likely above 25. Certainly not the end of the world, but investor psychology is such that some people will be upset after the fact if they are paying more than current market price.<p>However, if you are not assigned you&#x27;ll be pocketing those premiums as added income. But that is also another risk with naked puts - the market sells off but well before expiration and then rises again. You would miss the chance to buy unless you make the decision to take back the short puts at a loss and buy the cash at the now lower price.  Again, you&#x27;ll likely be paying net more than just having parked the cash and waited.<p>So naked puts may not be the best strategy if you know you absolutely positively will want to buy at a certain price, no matter what.')
