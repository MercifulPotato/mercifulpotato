If you want to be nude and pure then you go for the A72&#x2F;A53, well aware that you&#x27;re selling hardware that is almost a decade old and can&#x27;t be used as a daily driver today.<p>Otherwise, as unpleasant as it can be, you have to make a deal with Broadcom&#x2F;Qualcomm, or get some other vendors to license their ARM chipset to you.<p>The latter doesn&#x27;t seem like the end of the world to me TBH. Of course I&#x27;d love an ideal world where open architectures like RISC V have taken over and are actually usable, but until we get there usability remains more important than purity - unless you&#x27;re RMS of course - even if it involves a small &quot;deal with the devil&quot;.<p>I believe that most of the geeks out there love open-source products not much because they work daily with kernels and drivers (if that&#x27;s the case then the argument for a pure open hardware without hex bloats makes sense), but because of the flexibility that they offer. Because they can install anything that they want on them and aren&#x27;t prone to abandonware&#x2F;planned deprecation like many products powered by Google or Apple. But if you don&#x27;t give them products that they can use as main daily drivers, you&#x27;ll rarely get enough momentum outside of the small tinker-and-show-off circles.')
