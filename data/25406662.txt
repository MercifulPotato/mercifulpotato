What&#x27;s weird is that Google also started doing this to me too.<p>It gave me an idea.\nI call them canaryprofiles. Basically the same idea as creating fingerprints or initial seeds of a cold start engine. What you do is you create a bunch of accounts that are explicitly interested in certain topics and post specific content. Then you follow&#x2F;unfollow them to set a flavor for your timeline. It helps kick the recommendation engine out of feedback loops, I was stuck getting recommend only Billie Eilish content for like 3 months. (I was experimenting with what happens when you follow nobody and it seemed to permafrost my cold start recommendations, surprisingly every single post on my TL was Billie Eilish).<p>Zoomers do this too with pods, I think they all sign onto the same account so it can&#x27;t track them as effectively?')
