That&#x27;s a false economy.<p>That&#x27;s a <i>very</i> good point!<p>&quot;Put up with&quot; is an idiomatic expression that native speakers may take for granted -- but it must be learned, in the same way as &quot;tolerate&quot;.<p>In fact, it would be easier for half of the world to learn the word &quot;tolerate&quot;, from the Latin &quot;toleratus&quot;, than the expression &quot;put up with&quot;.<p>(For instance: we use the word &quot;tolerar&quot; in Porguese and Spanish.)')
