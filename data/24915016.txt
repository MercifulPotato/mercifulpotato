There were several factors to account for that scenario including fragility of the software product, fragility of the work requirements, challenge communicating tasks, and so forth. So I drove to work everyday and sat there, but because of the micromanagement I had to toggle the mouse all day to appear active on the computer.<p>Then COVID and I got to do the same from home. I missed my coworkers because the people I worked with were great, but considering the work I was actually doing it was better being at home. I could toggle the mouse while holding long conversations with the wife or do more entertaining things on my personal computer at the same time.<p>This left a lot of insecurity and depression about the employment. I never became a software developer for the money, but because I like to build things. I wasn’t doing anything enjoyable and felt the roof could cave in at any minute.<p>Now I am away on a military deployment where I am often very busy. I have a team to manage and a great many things to produce. I am away from the family for many months but this change of environment is so great for the mental health. I can directly and measurably see the results of my teams productivity.<p>Am I concerned though. Military deployments are temporary. I will have to go back to that which was so depressing. I have been building a side project. I am thinking of turning this into a business when I return, which is scary. I am a developer, not a business person.')
