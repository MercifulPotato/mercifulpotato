To me it was eye opening to see some masters keep investigating problems without getting emotional. I learned how not to care about the time it takes to figure things out, but to start and carry on. This way given enough time, almost all problems are solvable. The time pressure doesn&#x27;t change this fact.<p>In case of a time pressure, I just focus on workarounds instead of analysis. Once the problem is no longer burning, it&#x27;s up to the project priorities to investigate the root cause.<p>I also learned that panic never solved any of my problems, so when I notice that I am moving into panic mode, I stop for a minute and cool down. This is a skill that can be learned.')
