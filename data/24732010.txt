There is an ever expanding list of things that can be reasonably faked, but high definition turbulent flows for example are not one of them.<p>Now you personally may simply not know where that line is, but that doesn’t mean nobody does.  Which is my point, your personal level of ignorance isn’t universal.  Science is still surprisingly accessible, learning and verifying say thermodynamics can give you more confidence about say global warming than simple blind trust.<p>The same is true of a great many spurious claims from say kickstarts that can’t work as advertised.  Which means a slick video on it’s own isn’t enough.<p>PS: I don’t mean for this as a personal attack, more a suggestion that if you find separating fact from fiction difficult there is a path forward.')
