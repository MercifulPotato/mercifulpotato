No visiting each other&#x27;s homes. It&#x27;s been this way in most parts of the country for months. Same in Ireland<p>In France there is a curfew from 8pm-6am and restaurants cannot open. There have been rules preventing meeting others at home, can&#x27;t tell if they&#x27;re active right now.<p>In Germany one person not of that household may visit another household, but only one. This is also true in Belgium.<p>Some areas of Spain are not allowing meeting in others homes at all.<p>So ... YMMV.')
