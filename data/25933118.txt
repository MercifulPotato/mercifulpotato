You are probably right that most don&#x27;t, they should in my opinion. Of course you are also right that good teams will work together on this. I think the best designers have an understanding of HTML&#x2F;CSS or the native toolkits if they work on Android&#x2F;iOS. They know when the <i>user experience</i> will be signficantly improved by a custom component and work with their team to make it accessible and good in those case. They also know when not to reinvent a select to make it look slightly better.<p>This subthread is about why divs are used for buttons and why developers reimplement existing HTML components poorly. Good designers help their teams avoid this, good engineers work with their designers to avoid it.<p>0: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gov.uk&#x2F;government&#x2F;organisations&#x2F;government-digital-service" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gov.uk&#x2F;government&#x2F;organisations&#x2F;government-digit...</a>')
