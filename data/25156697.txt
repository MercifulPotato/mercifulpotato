I probably logged thousands of hours in script builders. My life definitely turned out very different thanks to Roblox.<p>For those not in the know, script builders were places that were just an empty map, but that allowed anyone in the server to load in their own scripts - so people would create and run custom weapons, power armor, admin commands, etc. and play around with each other. There was a very dedicated community of programmers that played them for years, and I&#x27;m still friends with some people I met through them like 7 years ago.<p>I think as a genre they&#x27;re pretty dead, though - Roblox tightened security around loading arbitrary scripts that broke all the script builders several times, and now had replication filtering so that client-side scripts can&#x27;t set properties. You probably could still make cool swords, but they&#x27;d need to use proper RemoteFunctions for client-server RPC, meaning all the old scripts are broken.')
