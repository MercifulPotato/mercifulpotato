Do you want the US to be totally apathetic? Never to comment on the erosion of democracy in China and Russia?<p>The US certainly doesn&#x27;t have moral high-ground on many issues, but I still want our officials to recognize and speak out against human rights abuses and authoritarianism.<p>If there are always authoritarians in power, then, yes, the US should always have an enemy regime to speak out against.<p>&gt; <i>Everything China is being accused of is and has been done by the US as well</i><p>I&#x27;m so sick of this &quot;both sides are equally guilty&quot; nonsense. It&#x27;s not always easy to say one country&#x27;s regime has done worse things than another, but this isn&#x27;t one of those times.<p>It is absolutely inarguable that US has <i>never</i> done the worst things that Xi has been credibly accused of.<p>The CCP&#x27;s treatment of Uyghur&#x27;s is, even at its mildest, <i>much worse</i> than anything the US has done since slavery ended in 1865. Even the Vietnam War is unlikely to have killed more innocent civilians than China&#x27;s Uyghur concentration camps are likely to have killed.')
