It&#x27;s original design was primarily around Programming Language Theory education - formerly it was PLT Scheme.  Much of it was designed for educational uses, but it&#x27;s a really well-rounded system with plenty of packages, a decent package management system, better performance than most interpreted languages.  It comes with an IDE easier to pick up for newbies than Emacs (the usual Lisp&#x2F;Scheme environment), but also runs fine as a command line REPL and compiler.<p>It&#x27;s kind of an oddball.  While the development focus is mostly educational, specifically Programming Language theory, it&#x27;s also very usable in the real world.  There&#x27;s a few tutorials on writing your own domain specific language in it.  You can specify a language other than the default Racket, so one compiler&#x2F;interpreter environment actually supports many Lisps and DSLs.<p>I&#x27;m a long time dev who recently picked up SICP to learn why everyone says learning Lisp&#x2F;Scheme will make you a better programmer, and Racket is by far the most interesting environment I&#x27;ve worked in.  I haven&#x27;t even touched Python, which was my money-maker, in months.')
