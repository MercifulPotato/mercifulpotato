You&#x27;ve gotta think about the context and not just post technically correct contrarian stuff.<p>There&#x27;s no excuse for bad testing demographics. If only whites are tested then we&#x27;d only find out in the wild if it works on non-whites or has adverse effects on non-whites, which is obviously hideous.<p>We&#x27;d also flat out reject a vaccine that only works on non-whites because we&#x27;d never know it.<p>It&#x27;s fine to say that a vaccine that only works on some known part of the population is a good thing. It&#x27;s better than no vaccine. But we have to know who it works on. That&#x27;s what testing does, and that&#x27;s what&#x27;s being discussed.')
