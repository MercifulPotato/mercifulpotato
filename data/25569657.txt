Item(by='tyingq', descendants=None, kids=[25571007, 25573986, 25570453], score=None, time=1609249564, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25569604, text='Ah, thanks.  Though the slides talk about, for example, the Spartan 6, which is on the larger board and seems factory looking.<p>That white connector on the little tap board appears to plug into J4 on this board: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;buggedplanet.info&#x2F;lost+found&#x2F;20180323&#x2F;Images&#x2F;18.jpg" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;buggedplanet.info&#x2F;lost+found&#x2F;20180323&#x2F;Images&#x2F;18.jpg</a><p>So that larger board would have to be part of the conspiracy.  It&#x27;s the one with the 2 FPGAs, NAND memory, board trace antenna, etc.  That board is obviously custom fit for this specific phone, with passthrough cutouts for the LCD ribbon cable, mounting screws, etc.<p>Edit: Actually, I can make out a chip in the top left of that larger board linked above that says SX1231 on it, which is a Semtech UHF transceiver.  The QFN24 packaging matches as well. Small excerpt from the data sheet:<p><i>&quot;The SX1231 is a highly integrated RF transceiver capable of operation over a wide frequency range, including the 433, 868 and 915 MHz license-free ISM (Industry Scientific and Medical) frequency bands.&quot;</i><p>Which is a pretty fishy chip to be in a desk VOIP phone.  Interesting that someone might have made a custom fit, nicely silkscreened and barcode part-labeled bug for one specific model of voip phone.')
