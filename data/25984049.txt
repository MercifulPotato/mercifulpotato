Item(by='vkou', descendants=None, kids=[25985303], score=None, time=1612138322, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25983690, text='&gt; Whether the shorts were naked or not before this started, the shorts are unquestionably bankrupt with GME at or above $300.<p>That is not correct.<p>You have no idea whether or not the shorts currently open, as of today, were opened when GME was worth $12, $50, or $400.<p>It&#x27;s entirely possible that many of the $12 shorts closed when the stock first rallied.<p>&gt; Thatâ€™s when you have massive failure to deliver and the whole corrupt organism goes into CYA mode and tries to shut down buying and bring the stock price back in-line with their models.<p>The reason trading on shitty retail brokerages like RobinHood was shut down was because the clearinghouse collateral requirements went through the roof, and shitty retail brokerages like RobinHood weren&#x27;t able to instantly come up with a couple of billion dollars to wire to the clearinghouses. (They did, eventually, which is why buys resumed on Friday.)<p>You get what you pay for with brokerages. They are an abstraction layer over a highly technical, 19th-century layer of physical settlement of stocks. When the market isn&#x27;t going crazy, this abstraction works, with minimum collateral requirements. When the market is going crazy, this abstraction stops working, and their counterparties start demanding billions of dollars in collateral.')
