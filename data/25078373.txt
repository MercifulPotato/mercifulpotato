There is no back door.  The article is lying.<p>On the other hand it’s true that iCloud backups are not encrypted.  That’s a major problem.  Worse in many ways since all your private documents, tax returns etc, are in there too.<p>But let’s not lie about iMessage not being end to end encrypted.  It certainly is.<p>The problem is that the end is then backed up to an unencrypted disk.<p>These two things are not equivalent.  In one instance Apple can be compelled to provide access.  In the other instance <i>any man in the middle</i> can intercept.<p>Please - there are real problems to criticize Apple for.  Let’s not muddy the water with lies.')
