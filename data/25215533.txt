Also testing your software under real usability also helps understand the performance.<p>Story time: I got hit by performance these very days. The app I&#x27;m developing for one of my clients has to process images from an USB camera. Under my development everything is dandy. Works like a charm, images gets processed and when the user hits the on-screen button that image gets stored in database as part of the entire process. Neath, yeah?<p>Well, it turns out my client is using a cheap from last decade tablet (I&#x27;m a purist so this decade will end on 31st Dec 2020) that due to processing 30 frames each second from USB camera, has little time for actual GUI responsiveness. And the app feels sluggish, with 1 second delay between my tap and the combobox firing up. Turns out, it didn&#x27;t need to actually process all those 30 frames each second. On per second will suffice, hence I&#x27;ve implemented to only process on frame every second. More than enough for customer&#x27;s needs and now the app is also flying on that old hardware.<p>My 2 cents.')
