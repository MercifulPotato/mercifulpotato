Unfortunately I’m eating into savings enough that I really need to start looking soon, even though I don’t feel entirely ready.<p>For me I don’t think it’s necessarily that WFH was the primary factor. I’ve worked remote most of my career. But I do think <i>everyone</i> being remote had a big impact, as it made communication more challenging for team members and management who don’t usually prefer remote. This heightened stress for all involved, and drove increased pressure to overwork.<p>That said, a few months off has <i>definitely</i> helped. If you can afford to take some time off, I highly recommend it.')
