Nonetheless, I do feel that many of these items (few standards, little interchange, often old tech, data decentralization) are primarily problems because the vendors and hospitals don’t really have strong incentive to solve them. I do appreciate that the problem is non-trivial, but I don’t think that the problem would be unsolvable should the appropriate incentives be put into place.')
