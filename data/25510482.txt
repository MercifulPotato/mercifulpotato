Item(by='earwaxauditor', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608667207, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25510228, text='&gt; I think it’s one of the only ways to change society but it should be done with a light touch.<p>Why is it only one of the ways?  Apparently we are unable to see that people have made a lot of money by selling tobacco.  Is that not a perverse incentive?  But alas, all the liberal can propose is to “change hearts and minds”.<p>Edward Barnays managed to start selling cigarettes to women by appealing to their suffragette sensibilities: they were called Freedom Sticks.<p>I would suggest that you try to shame Barnays, but (1) he’s dead and (2) he probably had no shame, anyway.')
