When homework due to Corona first started, one of the first things I did was to buy a proper Herman-Miller office chair for myself. He immediately wanted one too, but splurging $1000 on a fancy chair for my son was a bit much, so instead he got a much cheaper gaming chair, and he now considers it a better chair than mine.<p>I&#x27;m totally aware it lacks the range of motion my chair has, though.')
