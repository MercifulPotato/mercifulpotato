Well done. Game on etc.<p>Elastic is a 15 billion dollar MONSTER of a publicly traded company doing hundred+ million revenue per quarter. By market cap they&#x27;d be a ~top-20 biggest company overall and contender if not title-holder for the biggest tech company in the UK, Australia, and most other non-US countries. They are not some plucky feel-good startup fighting the good fight against nasty&#x2F;unfair big-corps that are drinking their milkshake.<p>That multi-billion dollar corporation does not own ElasticSearch 7.10 any more than Amazon does. Elastic have taken 7.10 and released it under a new license that prevents others from doing stuff with it. That&#x27;s allowed. You could do that too. It&#x27;s allowed. And some plucky startup in a garage (or say, Google, or MS, or Amazon) could decide they&#x27;ll make changes to 7.10 and release it open source. All fine. All allowed.<p>If your argument is that AWS is a form of mono&#x2F;duo&#x2F;oligo-poly and there are antitrust matters at play due to distorted market power being used illegally to crush a competitor... great make that argument.<p>Most of the other arguments boil down to variations on an anti-capitalist theme.')
