I think very little.<p>In some cases we&#x27;d probably even benefit, because the news sites will stop being ranked higher than the primary sources themselves. Quite often when I Google the release of a new product or some new government policy the highest ranked results are all news articles. They bury the actual press release that the government or company themselves posted.')
