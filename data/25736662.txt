The answer must be yes, then the question is if containment is the problem and the conclusion is that it cannot be contained, then what we should be making right now is a super intelligence whose sole job in life is to contain superintelligences. Which sounds problematic because containment could result in physical destruction to create the containment. Hmm... superintelligence feels an awful lot like the worst case definition of pandora&#x27;s box..')
