Even recently (in the past two weeks) Coinbase is still having periodic outages where they cannot process orders and where orders get executed silently and fail to show up in the balances and failures to be able to withdraw funds. While of course their status page shows no outages (or in this recent one blames Amazon connectivity for your orders executing in the background and withdrawal page spewing errors). Several years on you’d think they’d have fixed this.')
