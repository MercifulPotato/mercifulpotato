I think they benefit from interleaving zero+pole stages as well.<p>You can even ask MATLAB to generate the (z,p,k) form directly rather than (b,a) form when using its filter-design functions, saving a step (just ask for a three-argument result instead of a two-argument result).<p>(I am not an expert but I just so happened to have run across this feature and explanation last week, after vaguely remembering from college that biquad sections are &quot;better&quot; for some reason.)')
