Item(by='chordalkeyboard', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606267677, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25183183, text='&gt; If the adult they are crossing with is trying to sell the child in the US, then having the adult and child detained together still prevents this.<p>Until the detention is over and then you release them together?<p>One threat model is child abuse. Detaining them together enables abuse. Another threat model is <i>deceiving the government about the child trafficking.</i> Separating the child and the adult allows investigators to question them separately without the adult coaching the child when investigators are not present.<p>&gt; Also, at $250 for a paternity test, wouldn&#x27;t a cost-benefit analysis make it rational to do that rather than risk the (more expensive) harm of separating a child from their parent?<p>This is a good point but not all children are biological offspring of their legal parents. When you suspect trafficking and the adult claims the child is adopted what do you do?')
