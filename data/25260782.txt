Have also had the pleasure of teaching ray tracing to sort of everyone who&#x27;ll listen (some went on to do PhDs, one became a lead gfx programmer on GTA 5, the 3rd most recent was 12 years old, ...), it&#x27;s like a nerdy Jehovah&#x27;s Witness &#x2F; Monte Carlo Methodist Church.<p>It&#x27;s been pretty great; realtime rendering gets all the hype, but offline rendering is where realtime is headed and this is a super exciting time with all this parallel computation around.')
