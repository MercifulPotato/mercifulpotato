Item(by='kortex', descendants=None, kids=[25220969], score=None, time=1606400881, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25218987, text='As someone who&#x27;s studied the topic quite heavily, here&#x27;s my issue with no-holds-barred legalization (I consider &quot;legal&quot; to mean &quot;can manufacture and distribute&quot; in this regard, like tobacco). Drugs that couple very tightly to the VTA (brain&#x27;s behavior-reward circuit) actually can lead to lasting changes after few or single exposures. This is amplified by rapid absorption routes - injection, insufflation and inhalation. The main players here are heroin (DEA sched 1), meth (2), cocaine (2), GHB&#x2F;Xyrem (3), some benzos (4), tobacco (legal), and analogs therein. It&#x27;s hard to have a casual habit with these drugs, as they manipulate the brain&#x27;s behavioral calculus itself.<p>Note that the DEA schedules are all over the board. The current schedule system has barely any correlation with harm (see work by David Nutt). \nBut we are also in a weird place where access to two of the most destructive drugs in real measurable effects - alcohol and tobacco - are legal.<p>At bare minimum we need to overhaul the schedule system, legalize drugs with low&#x2F;moderate addiction potential (weed, psychedelics, ketamine, phenethylamines, the Shulginoids), and legalize everything in personal possession quantities, and for scientific&#x2F;medical research.<p>High-addiction drugs should probably be medically gated in some way.')
