Item(by='dvt', descendants=None, kids=[24713547], score=None, time=1602102375, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24710496, text='I&#x27;m a bit of a late bloomer, and had my first &quot;quarter life crisis&quot; at 30. I&#x27;d like to think this means I&#x27;ll live to be 120 :) I remember it was my 30th birthday in 2016 and I was taking an airplane to be at a conference I didn&#x27;t care about in a city I didn&#x27;t like. &quot;Is this all?&quot; I asked myself. As it turns out, it wasn&#x27;t.<p>I quit that job, worked on a startup for 9 months. It failed. I got another job. Soon I&#x27;m going to start working on another startup. I started taking my social and dating life more seriously. Like <i>much</i> more seriously. In my 20s, I&#x27;d be lucky to get invited to do stuff every couple of months. My weekends are full of stuff these days. I rarely dated, but over the past few years I&#x27;ve rejected women, I&#x27;ve been rejected by women. I&#x27;m still not where I want to be: I&#x27;d like to build a successful startup, I&#x27;d like to have a solid long-term relationship and family, I want to leave my mark on this world.<p>But honestly -- as someone that&#x27;s hyper-competitive -- competition isn&#x27;t healthy. It makes me an asshole and even though, frankly, I do win a lot, it&#x27;s not as fulfilling as a night out on a great date. Or chatting with friends about the meaning of life. Or enjoying the best damn crème brûlée you&#x27;ve ever had. Winning comes at a cost. Compartmentalizing competition is probably one of the most important character milestones I&#x27;ve achieved yet.')
