Item(by='fossuser', descendants=None, kids=[25757290], score=None, time=1610503600, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25745304, text='Facebook did the right thing here by booting trump off the platform and Mark Zuckerberg’s statement was good.<p>They didn’t change their policy, the context changed and Zuckerberg said as much.<p>Wouldn&#x27;t the illegal state action here be forcing facebook or twitter to keep trump on their site? That seems like a violation of twitter&#x27;s speech and their first amendment rights. IANAL, but I don&#x27;t think private companies are forced to provide access - they are allowed ToS and allowed to ban.<p>FB, Twitter, etc. were bending over backwards to allow speech in violation of their policies because they thought that public access to the speech of elected politicians in rule of law democracies was important. With rule of law in question and direct incitement of violence they&#x27;ve changed tact (clearly within their legal right as I understand it). [0]<p>There&#x27;s a quiet irony here that the same ideology that argues it&#x27;s right for a private business to refuse to bake a cake for a gay couple in violation of a protected characteristic, is okay with forcing a private company to provide service to those aligned with their interests. Inciting insurrection is not a protected characteristic.<p>The fact employees have to be cautious about wearing the brand is because the faction that carried out the attack is dangerous, not because what Facebook did was wrong.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;zalberico.com&#x2F;essay&#x2F;2020&#x2F;06&#x2F;16&#x2F;mark-zuckerberg-and-free-speech.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;zalberico.com&#x2F;essay&#x2F;2020&#x2F;06&#x2F;16&#x2F;mark-zuckerberg-and-f...</a>')
