Faustus and False Lights are another couple of bands that fit into a similar sound&#x2F;style category which also have some good rurally-sourced songs. All those up-tempo bands are so much fun to see live.<p>Solo singer-wise there&#x27;s some great material to be found with current singers like Chris Wood or Nick Hart. And if you go back a bit there&#x27;s some really interesting songs from people like Tony Hall (lots of Norfolk oddities) and Dick Gaughan (Scotland. Kist O&#x27; Gold is a great album).<p>I tend to know more about tune history than songs but songs do give you a lot of scope for reviving old music. I know Faustus, for example, take old lyrics and write new tunes for them to change the sound. It&#x27;s a really exciting way of keeping the stories alive and maintaining their relevance for new generations.')
