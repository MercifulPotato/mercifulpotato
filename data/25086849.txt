You never know when they&#x27;ll come or go online, and it&#x27;s a nice momento to have from &quot;a place and time&quot;.<p>As a musician myself, I just last night recorded on cassette using a 1970&#x27;s Magnavox personal recorder I have.  I do modern recording techniques too, but for B sides or just a novelty, it is so nice to just press a button and record.  No DAW, interfaces, amps.  Just a cheap mic in a 1&#x2F;8&quot; port, play until you run out of tape.')
