I also think there&#x27;s another aspect that the article leaves out: what is the definition of &quot;solving the problem&quot;?<p>For example, another recent pg article that was on the HN front page was the one about the founders of AirBnB. Although pg didn&#x27;t use them as a specific example of &quot;earnestness&quot;, I suspect he would describe them that way. But AirBnB, at scale, has created a lot of negative externalities (and much of the HN discussion of the article was focused on that). It doesn&#x27;t seem to me like dealing with those negative externalities was part of the problem the AirBnB founders were earnest about solving.<p>And that, to me, is what we computer nerds call a security hole. If it&#x27;s better to have earnest people trying to solve hard problems, then startup founders are not the only people that need to be selected for earnestness; the people that are going to <i>run</i> the company at scale and deal with the negative externalities it creates at scale also need to be. But <i>those</i> people are <i>not</i> being selected for earnestness at all; in fact earnestness in those positions, I would argue, is selected strongly <i>against</i>.')
