Compression and bitrate matters as well. No $100 Camera is able to handle that bitrate. Raw 8k results in 2.6 Gbps. That is not something that a small and low prower CPU can process. And thats what causing the heat.<p>I checked for a 100â‚¬ 4k action cam and tried to find out the bitrate they use. I found none where it was specified but  this one <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.goxtreme-action-cams.com&#x2F;de&#x2F;goxtreme-manta-4k&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.goxtreme-action-cams.com&#x2F;de&#x2F;goxtreme-manta-4k&#x2F;</a> requires at least a U3 class SD card. That means 30MB&#x2F;s so 240mbps. And thats what causing the heat. \nCanon could of course but a better cooler into the camera but that was either a economic decision to protect their professional camera gear, a a design decision to keep the case small or a mix of both.')
