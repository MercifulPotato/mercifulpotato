Sometimes the thoughts are not good, but most of the times its just about something that&#x27;s been troubling me and I haven&#x27;t figured out what the solution is. When I was in education I had to take a 1 hour bus each way for 8 years, before we had the whole internet in our pockets, so maybe thats why.<p>I do actually meditate as well, but the meditation I do is where you try to be thoughtless, not to ponder whatever thoughts are on your mind.')
