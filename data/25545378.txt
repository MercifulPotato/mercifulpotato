I found the language theory + compilers sequence to be one of the most practically useful parts of the entire major. in two semesters, I went from helpless googling to actually understanding compiler errors. I&#x27;ll concede that the typical &quot;toy compiler&quot; projects are maybe not the best use of time for someone who wants to be a software engineer, but understanding PDAs and context-free languages is super helpful when you don&#x27;t have the luxury of using a friendly compiler. most of the value is front-loaded in language theory, but a compilers course really drives the concepts home.')
