Since this is written in Python it would be pretty easy to write a script to batch process most formats. Feel free to make a GitHub issue for Qt translation files (or other formats) and I may try to add support at some point. Qt translation files would be a good one too because currently the GUI has no localization which isn&#x27;t ideal for a translation application. Also if you write your own script please share there is the scripts&#x2F; directory in the code where we could put scripts others might find useful.')
