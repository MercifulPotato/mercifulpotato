And for three times that price you can get 144-count which isn&#x27;t even remotely an option for subsea cables.<p>Source: I lease aerial dark fiber, included some that was constructed at my request.<p>&gt; Subsea cable system costs are about 30k$ to 50k$ per kilometer.<p>Including repeaters&#x2F;amplifiers and power delivery?  Yeah right.<p>&gt; you can and do have subsea cables with 216 or other high count strand numbers<p>Show me a 216-count subsea cable long enough to need repeaters&#x2F;amplifiers.')
