Item(by='octoberfranklin', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604889851, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25024968, text='&gt; This is about the same cost as aerial construction,<p>Not even close.  12-count ADSS cable costs $3,000 per km, one tenth of your low-end.  And for three times that price you can get 144-count which isn&#x27;t even remotely an option for subsea cables.<p>I used to buy from FS.com, but they&#x27;ve stopped shipping large spools due to the COVID shipping disaster situation, and took the pricing down off their website.  Here&#x27;s another company (never dealt with them) charging $1,400 per km:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;multicomstore.com&#x2F;ofs-f12smadss350f-fiber-optic-cable-adss-aerial-12-count-singlemode-sold-by-350-meters-1-000-feet.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;multicomstore.com&#x2F;ofs-f12smadss350f-fiber-optic-cabl...</a><p>Source: I lease aerial dark fiber, included some that was constructed at my request.<p>&gt; Subsea cable system costs are about 30k$ to 50k$ per kilometer.<p>Including repeaters&#x2F;amplifiers and power delivery?  Yeah right.  Link?<p>&gt; you can and do have subsea cables with 216 or other high count strand numbers<p>Show me a 216-count subsea cable long enough to need repeaters&#x2F;amplifiers.')
