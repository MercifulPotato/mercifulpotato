Anything that is very rigid and heavy doesn&#x27;t vibrate enough when we play sound near it. I would say it&#x27;s more about the thickness and weight of the target object than the material itself. For example, a very thin piece of wood would work much better than a wooden table leg. In the paper we actually test against ten different objects that are likely to be within reach of the robot vacuum cleaner.<p>The difficulty with masking this attack is that you need audio playing at a comparable volume near to the legitimate speech sources, which might be pretty disruptive. In the case of background white noise generators, for legitimate audio playing at around 70 dB SPL, we don&#x27;t lose much accuracy until the background white noise exceeds 75 dB SPL.')
