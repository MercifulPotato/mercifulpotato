Item(by='Bresenhams_Line', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607792562, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25398429, text='&gt; Reporters literally can&#x27;t believe it when founders making piles of money say that they started their companies to make the world better. The situation seems made for mockery. How can these founders be so naive as not to realize how implausible they sound?<p>I can&#x27;t speak for someone like Kara Swisher, but attempting to channel her, I don&#x27;t think she would think it is beyond belief that some hacker teenager who dropped out of a good college to work on X was earnest that they were trying to make the world better.<p>The mockery over naivete and implausibility comes from that those teenagers will walk into a VC office on Sand Hill Road, where they will sign over various rights for the future. They will then form a Delaware corporation. With plans to raise more VC, after that an IPO, and finally dividends. Which means what?  What came from those who did this in the past?<p>- The Steve Jobs orchestrated formerly secret cabal, that included Eric Schmidt and others, to drive down engineer salaries in the Bay.<p>- Social networks amplifying traffic saying Covid is a hoax, and here we are with 3000 dying of Covid in the US on Wednesday.<p>- The widespread spying and surveillance of people that almost all these companies have a hand in - even Adobe has become a surveillance company.<p>It&#x27;s the thinking that the corporations that will be the IBMs, Oracles and Microsofts of the future are there to &quot;make the world better&quot;.  It is risible.')
