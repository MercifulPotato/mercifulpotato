I mean, that is quite the extreme claim.<p>I hope you have some evidence for me that there was no way that these could get any economic advantage in their lives without basically pissing their money away pumping a stock up way above any value that makes sense in a game of hot potato where someone is going to lose out because the price just makes no sense. I will be waiting.<p>I mean some might say having the money to pull this in the first place is some manner of economic advantage. But I guess not the kind of people who think they are entitled to be wealthy in a reality where being destitute and improvised is the normal state in nature if you have more than 7 billion people, and anything else took thousands of years of human development.')
