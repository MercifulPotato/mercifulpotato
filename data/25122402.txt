How is that their fault?<p>&quot;In the end git is not in production, it&#x27;s just a tool to manage code, I&#x27;d rather be an expert on the code than the coding tool.&quot;<p>That&#x27;s a very short-sighted attitude. It&#x27;s like saying, &quot;I don&#x27;t want to learn how to operate a bulldozer, because I&#x27;d rather be an expert on dirt rather than the tools to move dirt.&quot;')
