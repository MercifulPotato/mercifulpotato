By definition, the Electoral College is undemocratic in that for a choice of a national leader, people in smaller population states have a greater say than those in larger states.<p>You can argue that as the United <i>States</i> of America, that is a majority of the <i>States</i> that get to vote for the President, but not even the original writers of the Constitution thought that. The reason for the Electoral College was to put a break on the possibility of a <i>populist</i> being elected.<p>So the original purpose has proven to be unachieved, the argument that States should vote for the President instead of people is completely undemocratic.')
