So, in the past, you got CentOS 7.1, then 7.2, etc., with streams, you get CentOS 8.x.<p>Saying that this is moving away from RHEL stability sounds highly disingenuous. Are you saying you&#x27;ve seen RHEL 7.X to break as opposed to 7.(X-1) version, and your solution was to wait for RHEL 7.(X+1)?')
