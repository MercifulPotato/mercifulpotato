The legitimacy of the right in the U.S. is an open question when they participate in direct voter suppression, gerrymandering, continually lose popular votes but still gain controlling power of the strongest apparatus of the government, have used that power to appoint (shortly) 16 of the last 20 SCOTUS Justices going back to 1969 using rules they are quite literally making up on the spot. &quot;Consent of the governed&quot; is a valid question under these scenarios.<p>But you need to provide some very strong evidence &quot;they [the left] do not believe non-leftists should be allowed to exist.&quot; You&#x27;re using some very strong language based on very weak arguments.<p>The fact you, presumably, pass off things such as Russian interference in fair and free elections as &quot;conspiracy theories&quot; should, god willing, be absolutely damning to your credibility. Or that &quot;herd immunity strategies,&quot; as mentioned in the tweet you link, should be presented as a valid and equal alternative strategy to <i>NOT LETTING PEOPLE DIE</i>; you&#x27;re arguing flat-earthers should be given equal footing in a debate with NASA.')
