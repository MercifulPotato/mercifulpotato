Item(by='Razengan', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605071353, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25051698, text='&gt; <i>I don&#x27;t think hn is more broken than America or the Internet or whatever.</i><p>But HN <i>wants</i> to be different, with its quirky rules like not being allowed to downvote posts and replies, or needing a certain amount of karma to be able to downvote comments, and the time limits on edits etc., instead of just following the basic Reddit model.<p>So clearly someone at HN thought that a simple free-for-all system wasn&#x27;t good enough, prone to abuse, and decided to make some changes, but HN isn&#x27;t good enough either; it&#x27;s still too easy for 3-4 downvoters to prevent thousands of people from seeing a comment they don&#x27;t want to be seen.<p>It&#x27;s too easy to <i>suppress</i> a side or view with fewer supporters here.<p>One thing HN should have borrowed is how some subreddits don&#x27;t show a post&#x2F;comment&#x27;s score until N hours have passed.<p>If votes don&#x27;t affect a comment&#x27;s visibility for a while then everybody may have a chance to be heard.
