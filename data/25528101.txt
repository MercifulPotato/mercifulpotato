His sound quality (there is probably a more precise word for this) is appalling. A lot of the music in Interstellar is too loud while the dialogue is hard to make out. Same with Dunkirk - the gunfire in the opening had me cover my ears in the cinema to protect my hearing and throughout the rest of film I was wishing there were subtitles.')
