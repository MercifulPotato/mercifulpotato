He conducted laboratory tests to determine why chicken soup might help colds, beginning with his wife’s homemade recipe, handed down by her Lithuanian grandmother. Using blood samples from volunteers, he showed that the soup inhibited the movement of neutrophils, the most common type of white blood cell that defends against infection. Dr. Rennard theorizes that by inhibiting the migration of these infection-fighting cells in the body, chicken soup essentially helps reduce upper respiratory cold symptoms. The researchers couldn’t identify the exact ingredient or ingredients in the soup that made it effective against colds.</i><p>The idea that we understand and have catalogued all the compounds in meats (or vegetables) and fully understand how they improve our health is far, far from true.<p>I&#x27;m not talking about &quot;magic&quot; compounds or anything... but just that our body functions optimally on a wide variety of nutrients, of which we study only a relative handful.<p>Even for things we <i>know</i> of, like how important the iron in beef is -- would lab-grown beef contain it as well? Would it come &quot;by default&quot; or would it have to be specifically included?<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;well.blogs.nytimes.com&#x2F;2007&#x2F;10&#x2F;12&#x2F;the-science-of-chicken-soup&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;well.blogs.nytimes.com&#x2F;2007&#x2F;10&#x2F;12&#x2F;the-science-of-chi...</a>')
