More and more the holodeck seems plausible as a system of nets upon nets upon nets. Nets for generating models, nets for generating stories...<p>1: In this case the meshes are not polygons, but rather signed distance fields. Metaballs are commonly made with this technique.<p>Edit: thanks for catching the spelling mistake. Metaballs misspelled as Meatballs is a plague that continues for over two decades. Usually I try to avoid the trap altogether and say Implicit Surfaces :)')
