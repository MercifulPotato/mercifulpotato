I can already log in to any server with my custom configs; Ansible is what configures my user already, so I just have it dump out my configs. If I can access it, it has my configs.<p>Admittedly, it does get annoying when I&#x27;m sudo-ed to another user, but it&#x27;s vanishingly rare for me that I am both sudo-ed to another user, and doing enough editing that I really want those configs. Usually a sudo-ed vi for me is just updating a couple lines in a config, I don&#x27;t need a full config for that')
