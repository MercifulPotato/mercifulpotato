Yes, I want color printing. Why wouldn’t I want color printing?<p>I feel like the “black and white brother laser” attitude is like buying a car with no air conditioning because you’ll save five hundred bucks off the sticker price.<p>The reason to choose inkjet:<p>1. Black and white sucks<p>2. Color lasers are huge and don’t really save money on toner vs. ink for typical home users.<p>My current printer is an HP OfficeJet 9015, which has been excellent. Zero software needed for Windows 10, iOS (AirPrint), macOS.<p>Another thing those cheap brother laser printers don’t give you is, you know, features. My inkjet printer has a scanner, auto document feeder with auto duplex, and auto duplex printing.<p>If you want all that with a color laser you end up with a monstrosity in your house.')
