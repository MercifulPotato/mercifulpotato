I wish their desktop version had more options regarding appearance, for one. Honestly, it would not take much to implement giving us, users the choice to change a couple of things.<p>I hate it how I cannot make the left bar less wide, for example, and there are a couple of more complains, all of which have been reported a long time ago. They are easy to add&#x2F;fix!<p>I also wish the desktop version supported sending audio messages just like the Android version does, similarly to WhatsApp. No need for these fancy audio filters, just let me record and send an audio message from the desktop version!')
