I doubt you&#x27;ll able to detect is a vm or not based on that. In addition, resistfingerprinting (on firefox) hides this kind of stuff.<p>&gt;- How much graphics RAM is there?<p>vmware workstation has vram selectable from 32MB all the way to 8GB, so that covers the entire range of plausible vram sizes.<p>&gt;- Timing-based methods<p>what else can you test that is both accessible via browser api and would yield big differences between a vm and a slow computer?<p>&gt;It&#x27;s a bit like detecting private&#x2F;incognito mode in a browser. Everything worked great, until websites realised there are ways to detect it, then became a game of cat and mouse.<p>not really, it&#x27;s a solved problem: make a new browser profile and then delete it after you&#x27;re done. I&#x27;ve seen a few HN commenters post their (relatively short) scripts to make a new firefox&#x2F;chromium, start it, and then automatically delete it once it exits.')
