Your boss wants to see you put the needs of the team above your own, so look for opportunities in which you can increase team productivity, reduce risk, and help grow your team in terms of headcount and knowledge.<p>Also, try not to compare yourself to others, although I know it&#x27;s easier said than done. Figure out what your goals are and do everything you need to in order to achieve them. Who cares how quickly others progress? Focus on yourself and your own success.')
