If you say that EVERYTHING is culturally relative, you are making the case that every culture should be okay with anything that any other culture does, and that respect for other cultures is more important than human rights.<p>If you take a more practical view and say that SOME things are culturally relative and others apply universally, I would argue that the government dictating human reproductive practices violates many human rights.<p>IMO governments should not control the production of humans.<p>Either way, I respect your view on this, just happen to disagree.')
