Rendering objections moot.\n The ultimate blame lays with the deceiver. Even though representatives of all parties votes for the invasion, they acted in a reality manufactured by lies and they represented the will of their supposed voters.\nYou may accuse them as spineless, but there&#x27;s still magnitude difference between deceiving the public, and failing to convince the public it&#x27;s all lies.\nLosing this distinction just makes the crooks stronger.')
