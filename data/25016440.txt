I&#x27;ve sat in on court sessions, and towns and cities pull in a lot of revenue through low-level drug offenses, and cops spend a significant amount of their time investigating and arresting kids for drug offenses.<p>The criminalization of drugs, especially low-level offenses, are revenue generators for municipalities, and jobs programs for law enforcement.<p>There is a lot of money, and plenty of high-paying jobs with full pensions, that are kept afloat by the criminalization of drugs.')
