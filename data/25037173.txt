Item(by='curryst', descendants=None, kids=[25037244, 25038477], score=None, time=1604943021, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25035751, text='&gt; It seems to me like people are willing to jump to the opposite conclusion simply because he&#x27;s &quot;one of us&quot;.<p>Because many of us have our own collection of weird oddities.  I literally have cannon fuse sitting on the shelf behind me, that I got to make my own smoke bombs&#x2F;devices (just sugar and potassium nitrate, nothing insane or dangerous).  I would take a hard look at the worst thing someone could accuse you of building using the materials you have in your house.  If you have any metal piping sitting around, and a nail or screw, that  could be turned into a primitive gun.  If you have metal piping and anything that burns very quickly like gunpowder, that&#x27;s a pipe bomb (or pressure cooker).  If you have a propane grill and a gun (or anything that could be used as a detonator), that propane tank could cause some serious damage.<p>I&#x27;ll grant you, ammonium nitrate isn&#x27;t a terribly common substance to have around an apartment.  I still don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s very compelling evidence that he was building a bomb, and weaker evidence that if he was building a bomb, it was to hurt people.  Maybe he was just trying to make his own fireworks.  He shouldn&#x27;t be doing that in an apartment, cuz risk of accidental explosions, but it seems hasty to start painting him as a domestic terrorist.')
