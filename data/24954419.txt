However, someone starting from scratch - and especially starting with a FPGA - would need a lot of analog design experience. Analog <i>silicon</i> design is an even more rare skill (we are, I think, hiring if you have this).<p>What we are generally doing is support features; headphone detect, power management, power <i>amplification</i> (built-in boost converters etc), as well as post-processing and EQ. You can use EQ to compensate for the nonlinear response of tiny speakers in mobile phones.<p>(An odd side effect of the hardware pipeline and my role in software support is that anything you can actually see on the public website is very out of date compared to what&#x27;s in development and heavily NDAd)<p>I&#x27;m still not clear why the OP wanted an open source DAC.')
