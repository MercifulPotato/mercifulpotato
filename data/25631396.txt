If their labor produces capital which produces profits, why are those profits not fair game to bargain over?<p>In your example, it wouldn&#x27;t make sense to pay the one remaining employee all of the profits, but it would have made perfect sense for all the employees who produced the perfectly automated factory to negotiate for a share of the profits.')
