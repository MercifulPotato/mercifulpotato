Like.... Ok, it will generate getters and setters, so can any IDE.<p>Lombok actually makes writing and refactoring concise java code way easier. Eg: Macro like @builder allow to introduce immutability instantly. Notation of the form Dog.Builder().size(5).name(&quot;fido&quot;) are accessible for &#x27;free&#x27; and are pretty reliable. ( read : you can tweak them if needed without looking a de-compiled code to understand what went wrong )<p>So, as much as I dislike Java and Spring. I think you are correct. A CRUD microservice can be expressed in reasonably concise way with the method you describe. ( and it&#x27;s still plain old boring java code running on regular JVM )')
