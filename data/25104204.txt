Think of how much goodwill Microsoft has built up for their backwards compatibility. Heck, the story of the version of Doom that runs on DOS-&gt;Win3.1-&gt;Windows 10 hit the front page today! Now think of how little goodwill Google has, due to their pernicious habit of killing off popular products that don&#x27;t meet their very high standards for revenue production.<p>Why does Microsoft dominate the enterprise and not Google? I think the above has almost everything to do with it.<p>Apple has kind of walked the middle road between Microsoft&#x27;s extreme backward compatibility and Google&#x27;s &quot;kill off everything that doesn&#x27;t earn at least a billion&quot;. They support old hardware a lot longer than Google, but they also break a lot of things with their OS updates. Apple also has a pretty legendary track record of successfully shifting CPU architectures without breaking popular apps at the time, something that&#x27;s pretty much unheard of elsewhere.')
