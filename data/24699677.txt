The woman who was interviewed on that podcast raised quail on both a farm and privately in her own space. She did try to let the quail free range first, and that was a disaster. She tried to make the coop area more open, and they became too nervous to lay. She eventually created a space that lets them feel safer from predators. She was also talking about a specific breed of domesticated quail. I don’t think she was trying to justify anything. Are we talking about the same things here?<p>Maybe the missing information is just how big of a cage we are talking about. What are you envisioning when you say that? Are you saying that, if a cage is made to allow them to do that, it would still be too big for a typical sized apartment?<p>I used to live somewhere where I can see wild quail running around the house every day. I remembered that they liked to hide in shrubs and overhanging trees. The mother might peak out and then run out from one cover to another, with a string of chicks following right a long. I rarely remember them flying out in the open.')
