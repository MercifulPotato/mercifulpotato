Learn to say no. If your illness has a predictable progression, start now in trying to redesign your work and hobbies to still be things you can do in ten years.<p>I can no longer do karate, my main hobby for over a decade and in which I have a second degree black belt. This is among my greatest regrets as I partially picked it because I thought I&#x27;d be able to do it until I was in my 70s. No such luck, alas, life is unpredictable.<p>I can no longer always work a full day, so I started a consulting company to be able to work at home on a schedule that aligns with my health rather than a clock.<p>I can no longer play the piano, give massages, do origami, or use a mouse comfortably. The primary emotion at losing these things is often grief. Acknowledge that and be okay with being sad about it but get therapy if you need someone to talk to.<p>There&#x27;s no shame in it and it took me easily two years to learn to forgive myself for turning down invitations from friends to do things.')
