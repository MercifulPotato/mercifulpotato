Novel viruses have more opportunity to jump species since the animals are often sourced from diverse wild populations, and many animals and humans are present together.<p>A septic system is used predominantly by one species - humans - that are already in close contact. They may aid the fecal-oral transmission route for an existing disease or be a breeding ground for bacteria, but I wouldn&#x27;t expect novel viruses to arise here.<p>Edit : I might have misread the intent of your question. I wouldn&#x27;t have expected these sources to generate novel viral diseases in the time in which they were used.<p>If you&#x27;re wondering whether they sequester diseases that have been forgotten by the immune systems of people alive today, that seems quite possible. We&#x27;re finding all sorts of interesting things in peat bogs and permafrost. If this environment adequately preserves bacteria or viruses, we might find something. I honestly have no idea about this kind of preservation, though.')
