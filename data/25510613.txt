He started the company with a friend. The company pivoted to a completely different direction and the friend left because it was outside his expertise. My professor wanted to &quot;do the right thing&quot; and preserve their friendship, so he let the friend keep all the equity. In the end, the friend ended up getting millions of dollars despite producing 0 value to the company.<p>There has to be some middle ground here, like offering options to the company to buy back OP&#x27;s shares at the current valuation plus interest. If company still can&#x27;t afford a buyback a few years later, then they didn&#x27;t grow the company enough to deserve to own those shares anyways.')
