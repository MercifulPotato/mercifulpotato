However for calls and sending files it&#x27;s currently not as good as Signal. I quite often have an issue with calls connecting (need several tries) while I hardly ever see this with signal. Similarly, sometimes I get failed sending of files (especially if they are big) and they somehow stay as a failed message in your chat afterwards, which is really annoying.')
