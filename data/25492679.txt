So, other researchers asked: What was the long-term outcome with those patients supposedly engaging on “controlled drinking”?<p>So this research team including one Pendery asked Sobell for the list of patients so they could perform a proper follow-up.  The Sobell researchers refused to provide the list.  The Pendery team managed to get the list anyway.  The Sobells then sued Pendary and their team to stop them from using the list.<p>After some litigation, the Pendary team got the Sobell lawsuit dismissed and then followed up with those supposedly moderate drinking patients.<p>Out of the 20 patients the Sobell study claimed were moderately drinking, only one arguably was still moderately drinking a decade later.  Four of those “moderate drinkers” died from drinking too much.  Eight were engaging in out of control drinking.  Six were completely abstinent from alcohol.  And one could not be found, but appeared to be “gravely disabled”.<p>No wonder the Sobells tried to block the follow up study with lawsuits: Because it showed that those “moderate drinkers” were no longer moderately drinking.<p>After a lot of effort, the Sobell lawsuit(s) were dismissed and the truth won.<p>References: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;1982&#x2F;11&#x2F;02&#x2F;science&#x2F;showdown-nears-in-feud-over-alcohol-studies.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;1982&#x2F;11&#x2F;02&#x2F;science&#x2F;showdown-nears-in...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;1982&#x2F;06&#x2F;28&#x2F;us&#x2F;alcholism-study-under-new-attack.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;1982&#x2F;06&#x2F;28&#x2F;us&#x2F;alcholism-study-under-...</a>')
