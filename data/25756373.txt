There are, right now, 5-6 cold viruses in common circulation. There is one SARS-CoV2 virus.<p>Yes you were.  In your first comment you said &quot;Nearly all of us catch at least one cold a year, mostly during the winter months. There are, quite literally, hundreds of millions of colds a year.&quot;  Those are numbers in a normal cold year.  This isn&#x27;t a normal cold year.<p>&gt;Nothing we are doing would be expected to suppress other respiratory viruses, but not this one.<p>I&#x27;m not sure where this line of argument came from as no one was arguing against it.  The assumption is that these COVID precautions are equally effective against the cold, flu, COVID, and other similar respiratory diseases.  This will lead to a huge drop in those non-COVID diseases as the precautions we are taking are so drastic compared to a normal year.')
