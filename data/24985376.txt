It took me a little over a month to adapt and develop ways to manage all of the threads (prs, community, dev work) without feeling burnt out.<p>Fortunately I&#x27;ve largely sorted out a workflow that works for my mental health, (i think) works for the community, and still leaves me plenty of time to do dev work. It helps that I can make this my full time job thanks to all of my awesome sponsors.<p>I am currently the only member of the Bevy organization that can merge prs, but a number of people have stepped up to review prs which helps a lot.<p>Eventually I do want to grant more people merge rights, but I&#x27;m holding off for as long as possible because I think having a single filter that ensures a cohesive vision is valuable.')
