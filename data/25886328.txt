Software guy that does firmware, HDL, disassembly RE, some board design and layout, and have done a he high level, react frontend connected to a modern distributed backend with all the kubernetea and what have you<p>I enjoy the low-level work more, but that&#x27;s more of a personal preference.<p>You can for sure solve high-level problems easier, being below it on the abstraction hierarchy, but your work just comes with new problems.  I have never beat my head harder against the wall the trying to figure out something that was a chip bug that eventually becomes new errata (if you&#x27;re lucky enough for the chip vendor to answer your emails in the first placeti get the errata reported).<p>It doesn&#x27;t really protect you from politics unless you&#x27;re the only low-level person in your shop and no one understands what you do, in which case you just stagnate instead.  If you&#x27;re not careful you tend to get paid less too since high-level folk tend to be closer to the flow of money.<p>I like the work, and wouldn&#x27;t trade it, but it&#x27;s not a panacea to engineering org issues in your career.')
