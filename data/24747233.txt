Item(by='quickthrowman', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602435732, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24745754, text='&gt; The same has happened with whitetail in the eastern US, and a lot of people around here are still foolish enough to get upset with the DNR when they do a cull.<p>These people don’t understand that we have to manage the environment we created (removal of predatory animals that eat deer) and part of that is harvesting deer to prevent mass starvation from lack of winter food. I’d bet if you showed them footage of a deer starving to death in winter, they’d agree herd culling is more humane.')
