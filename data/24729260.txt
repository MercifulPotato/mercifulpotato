Xilinx&#x27;s latest Versal device added AI engines to accelerate ML further.  In a situation where AMD owns Xilinx, I would think they execs would decide not to add those types of features to FPGAs to not compete against their own product.<p>Edit: Actually I&#x27;m thinking of Nvidia, with their ML supported by TensorFlow.  AMD is lacking here.')
