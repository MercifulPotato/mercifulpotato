It&#x27;s an excellent distillation of the physics of cameras.<p>My one minor nit-pick would be introducing the wave nature of light so early--to motivate Snell&#x27;s law and total internal reflection, but without discussing diffraction until well later and only in passing.<p>Snell&#x27;s law can be motivated from a purely classical particle-based model as:<p>1. Light travels slower through media other than vacuum (This is mentioned, but hand-waved as boundary conditions, which probably isn&#x27;t meaningful to the intended audience).\n2. Light takes the shortest (in time) path between two points. (Light... finds a way).<p>Either way, the audience might find the obvious &quot;why&quot; for the first point more satisfactorily addressed with a short sidebar on permittivity and permeability of materials (their electrical properties, effectively the capacitance and inductance &quot;density&quot;).<p>That can also lead to an interesting discussion of why conductors are usually not optically transparent and insulators are.')
