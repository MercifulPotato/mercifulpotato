But aren&#x27;t JSON arrays a pretty wasteful encoding?<p>Since this is an opaque serialization of an instruction set, why not try to encode more bits per number (JSON floats support lossless integers of many more bits), and moving the &quot;symbol table&quot; (string data) to the end?<p>This way you could also compress redundant symbols into single strings.')
