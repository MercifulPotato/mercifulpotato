Some communities can be clique-y and unwelcoming.<p>And to your first point, I think people use services like Discord because it&#x27;s the only thing available.  If Discord added a few more discussion formats other than just chronological chat log, people could choose the right tool for the job.  Right now it&#x27;s too hard to sync content&#x2F;users&#x2F;permissions between Discord and other services like Notion or Google Docs, so people just keep using Discord for their info dumps even if it&#x27;s not entirely suitable.<p>Already, certain servers I&#x27;m in have entire channels dedicated to FAQs, but they&#x27;re extremely difficult to maintain &#x2F; edit &#x2F; comment on, especially if the original maintainer loses interest.<p>I&#x27;d love to see some kind of Q+A system built-in, so you can skip all the fluff and meming that can happen between the good bits of conversation.  Something like StackExchange but a little more casual and well-integrated with something like Discord.  (although ideally it would be an open-source solution not tied to any one chat platform)')
