Garnett&#x27;s level of Russian competence was solidly journeyman level work. In the original Russian, Chekhov is much more vibrant and colorful than Garnett&#x27;s dickensian translation. At best, passable.<p>That said, she did the world a huge service. It was her work largely that brought Chekhov to the attention of the english-speaking world, but their are better options now. Check out Pevear and Volokhonsky, I find them much closer to the soul of Chekhov&#x27;s writing.')
