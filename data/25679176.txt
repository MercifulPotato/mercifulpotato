It is exactly &quot;perfection is the enemy of the good.&quot; There&#x27;s 3 solutions to climate that we have right now (and we should be betting on all 3. 1) Fission 2) a miracle in fusion research, 3) a miracle in battery storage. We needed to act 20 years ago (really 50). While we don&#x27;t act we are still polluting with coal and oil. But I think people are ignoring point #3 and I don&#x27;t think this is necessarily the fault of the average person because there&#x27;s an inaccurate representation in the media about the progress and how far we still have to go. Fission is the compromise we make for not having acted 50 years ago. It is a much smaller problem for future generations to deal with than that of climate change. So at this point it is your choice: nuclear waste for the future or climate catastrophe. (Not to mention all the other waste and stuff but that&#x27;s another discussion)')
