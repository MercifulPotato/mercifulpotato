I would caution against the approach for anything larger.<p>In my experience, well-behaved colleagues will be considerate of my preferences. If I would prefer they change in some way, it&#x27;s easy enough to have a quick conversation about how _they_ prefer to be contacted&#x2F;scheduled and then, in turn, communicate my preferences as well. I&#x27;m sure they would read and follow my user guide, but I&#x27;d rather take the opportunity to spend a few minutes of facetime to build the relationship.<p>For poorly-behaved colleagues, I can&#x27;t imagine them reading a user guide like this. If they don&#x27;t care for my preferences, why would they spend time reading my user guide? They have already established that they are less considerate of my preferences. In that case, I&#x27;ve had success giving them a firm but very polite &quot;no&quot;.')
