They did something in their CPU to double the speed of reference counting.<p>What the hell does that even mean ?<p>Disregarding the nonsensical attribution of magic to Swift vs Java, if &quot;reference counting&quot; on translated x86 code is faster, then I suppose M1 does &quot;lock add &#x2F; cmpxchng&quot; or whatever faster than X86.<p>I would love to know how. Other than just as a side-effect of a SoC, UMA architecture.')
