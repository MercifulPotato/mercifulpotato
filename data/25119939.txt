Putting my manager hat on, I ask: Can I replace 10 of my average engineers with this one person? The answer is never &quot;yes&quot;.<p>That&#x27;s because a team does more than just technical stuff. There&#x27;s documentation, dealing with customers, bureaucratic stuff, etc. If you don&#x27;t do these well, much of your brilliant engineering gains will go to waste. A brilliant engineer may be harder to <i>replace</i> than the average, but he&#x2F;she is not a 10x engineer. Perhaps a 2x.')
