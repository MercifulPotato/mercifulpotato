Item(by='root_axis', descendants=None, kids=[25146275], score=None, time=1605726260, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25135092, text='&gt; <i>Just as with literary or media genres, &quot;social media&quot; as a classification mostly exists as a marketing term, not science.</i><p>I agree there. I disagree with the idea that the incremental integration of &quot;social media features&quot; necessarily makes something a &quot;social media&quot; platform, and I think the semantic distinctions are important because there is a lot of discussion about the societal harms of &quot;social media&quot; and the types of laws that should apply to &quot;social media&quot;, but I don&#x27;t think a site like e.g. HN or pornhub are the types of sites people are talking about when they refer to those problems.')
