As it does seem like not the way I would act, it does seem like something surprising.<p>I would not jump to conclusions about being sympathetic or not without knowing more about what is behind people acting this way though.<p>One guess I&#x27;d have is... well, the people entangled in the criminal justice system are largely an overrepresented subset of our population, the poor, who usually haven&#x27;t just had ONE interaction with the criminal justice system. I&#x27;d guess that they may kind of give up and think no matter what they do they are screwed, it&#x27;s all so incomprehensible and beurocratic anyway, the amount of effort they put in in the past (or have seen their peers put in) doesn&#x27;t seem to be correlated to liklihood of good outcomes, and poor people are actually usually <i>really busy</i> trying to stay housed&#x2F;fed&#x2F;employed&#x2F;sane&#x2F;alive.<p>The way to find out, of course, is not guessing but talking to some people with court dates and people who have missed court dates.')
