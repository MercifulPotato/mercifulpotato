Item(by='dang', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612221473, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25982574, text='&gt; <i>addressing their extreme rhetoric, not them. How they come across is different than who they are. Every statement was a &quot;swipe&quot; at their disrespectful and unreasonable arguments, not them as a person.</i><p>That&#x27;s not how internet comments work. If you tell someone they sound like a zealot, you&#x27;re calling names. If you then say &quot;I didn&#x27;t mean it about you, only about how you sound&quot;, that&#x27;s a distinction that makes no difference to the receiver, with whom your comment has already landed like a punch.<p>I&#x27;m afraid the problem is that your comments aren&#x27;t as respectful as you think they are. This is a common problem, as I tried to explain above. Swipes that feel harmless or perfectly kosher to the commenter can easily land with readers, and especially with whomever they&#x27;re replying to, as aggressive.<p>Because of this asymmetry, it&#x27;s easy to end up with a flamewar in which all parties feel aggrieved, like they&#x27;re the innocent one who did nothing, while the others are the ones who behaved badly and escalated. Everyone ends up feeling like they&#x27;re just defending themselves from unprovoked attack. In reality we&#x27;re all subject to this cognitive bias, and if we&#x27;re to avoid having this place go into a downward spiral and burn itself to a crisp, we all need to be extra careful to err on the side of being respectful and editing swipes out of our posts here.<p>I was writing about this in another context, in case or anyone wants more information: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25995375" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25995375</a>.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newsguidelines.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newsguidelines.html</a>')
