It&#x27;s a condenser microphone. Condenser microphones generally are more sensitive to quiet sounds and pick up range a bit better, but that means they also pick up _everything_ else much better. That&#x27;s great if you&#x27;re in a sound studio, but most of us are not.<p>You&#x27;ll make your life easiest if you get clean audio in _before_ you start trying to do further processing to clean it up.<p>I already had the Yeti on hand, and it was a couple days of tweaking and tuning to get to the point where it will pick up my voice from 6-8&quot; away clearly (so it&#x27;s not directly in front of my face on camera) but not also transmitting the pitter-patter of every raindrop on the sidewalk outside.<p>If you&#x27;re looking for a mic just for audio&#x2F;video calls, I&#x27;d look towards a dynamic mic. Something like the Audio-Technica AT2005 ($80) is generally pretty well reviewed, is 2&#x2F;3 the price of the Yeti, and still includes a built-in ADC so you can just plug it in via USB and call the job done (don&#x27;t need to add a bunch of input boxes&#x2F;etc).')
