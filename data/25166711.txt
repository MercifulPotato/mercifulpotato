While they&#x27;re not (yet) building their own world&#x2F;games, they play lots of games where you build &amp; customize something. One of my kids will spend hours designing clothes, or decorating a house, truly creative activities that simply happen to be mediated by a screen.<p>What I absolutely hate about Roblox are the micro-transactions, which frequently are not very micro at all.  It&#x27;s not at all uncommon to see mini &quot;empire building&quot; games where you make money, expand your base to make more money, and that&#x27;s the play loop as you design your &lt;whatever&gt;. But there&#x27;ll be intrusive micro transaction popups just for walking over a tile, that will ask for $5 worth of Robux for an amount of in-game $$$ you could earn by playing for 5 minutes. It took months of gentle denials to my kids &amp; constant explanations about the relative value of spending their week&#x27;s allowance on something that will save them 10 minutes to finally convince them these things aren&#x27;t worth it.')
