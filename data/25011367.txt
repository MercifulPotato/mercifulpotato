The cretaor was the eternal (Ayamictlán), but the imperishable continued to be fire (matter). The gods are the four material beings, the four stars: Tonacatecuhtli, Tonacacíhuatl, Quetzalcoatl and Tezcatlipoca. They deified the rains in Tlaloc and the sea in Chalchiuhtlicue, these deities also being material. To explain the appearance of men, they resorted to the action of fire on earth (matter again), the marriage between Tonacatecuhtli and Tonacacíhuatl. The idea of   a spiritual being was not perceived.<p>The Nahuas were not deists, nor can it be said that their philosophy was Asian-pantheism. It was materialism based on the eternity of matter. Their religion was the Sabaeism of the four stars, and like their philosophy, it was also materialistic.')
