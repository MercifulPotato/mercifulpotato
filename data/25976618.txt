Newest models, inluding all Kobo readers, have a <i>soldered</i> SD memory card. And it&#x27;s not just cutting costs. They&#x27;re deeply bothered by your ability to copy books and various text files to the device you paid for. Memory cards fail. eReaders are now essentially hardware Steam browsers, or book consoles. You can only load books from a store.<p>I was holding off from buying one to get a more open device, but the tendency is to become LESS open and featured, not more. I could buy an old device, but they&#x27;re by definition not supported.')
