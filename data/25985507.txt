There are things you can do, if you have an external Thunderbolt 3 drive (USB-C isn&#x27;t sufficient), but even that won&#x27;t work if the internal drive is dead.<p>I’m trying to understand the impact of the internal drive dying in the last fragment here. Since these Macs have soldered-on-the-board SSD internal storage, wouldn’t the drive dying require a complete logic board replacement in the first place, which means this condition is not salvageable for an end user without professional repair service anyway? It’s not like an end user could replace it like with Macs of the past (or is it?).<p>On a general note, it’s extremely irritating when Apple drops macOS support for some Macs every year while the latest version still has several limitations and bugs. Anyone who gets on to the latest and greatest version of macOS with hardware that’s older than five years would be taking big risks. In general (with several exceptions), the longevity of the hardware was one of the attractive factors while paying a premium for Macs (also lesser e-waste is a bonus). But deeper problems in macOS could more than offset such benefits (resulting in more cries about planned obsolescence).')
