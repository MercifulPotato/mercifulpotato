First, not every difference counts as oppression. What does, that depends on... what the woke people agree on today (which may differ from what they agreed on yesterday or tomorrow). Race, gender, sexual orientation = yes. Being left-handed, or being poor = no. Being a demisexual, or otherkin = depends on whom you ask; probably yes in college, but no anywhere else. Disability = generally yes, but not autism, because reasons. It&#x27;s complicated.<p>So there are N categories, and 2^N groups. Within each group, people are considered the same. For example, all black straight able-bodied etc women, whether they are millionaires or homeless, are considered to have the same experience.')
