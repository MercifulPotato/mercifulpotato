However, the power supply uses a more complicated design to provide electrical isolation between the spacecraft and the clock. I&#x27;m not sure, though, why isolation was necessary.<p>A reason very simple, you don&#x27;t want a short through the clock to set your space, or aircraft on fire!<p>A big reason why a lot of avionics still works on HF AC power, and not DC is that it makes isolation, and providing arbitrary voltages very easy.')
