Those interruptions as often as not are not only taking you away from your tasks, they are also your notice that your tasks need to change.<p>Note that I used the word &quot;tasks&quot; not &quot;goals&quot;! They are NOT the same and I suspect you have mixed them up. Tasks are what you do to meet your goals, and can be interrupted. Goals are where you want to be, not the tasks you do to accomplish them. Goals can be accomplished in many different ways, and often take years.<p>I have a goal to help people out. I have another goal to see if we can port some of our software to a cheaper&#x2F;slower CPU. The second goal might or might not be worth doing this year - CPU prices are coming down (as always), and there is a cost to inventory of the slower parts so I need to always keep my ear open to the possibility I should give up on the second goal because it no longer makes sense.  However helping out other people in my company is generally good, so it is the more important goal in general even if the cheaper CPU might - if it works out - be what it takes to stay ahead of competition.')
