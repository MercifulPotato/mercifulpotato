You pay for the heat energy contained in the gas, not for the net volume. The compensated heat energy is calculated based on consumption profile of the consumer class (cooking only, cooking and heating, business etc) and temperature profile of the location (pretty fine grained temperature regions).<p>But yes, you can still trick the meter by cooling the input medium.')
