The only meaningful argument is what Twitter (for example) CAN do (legally), and what they SHOULD do (morally).<p>Clearly, Twitter is legally in the right to suppress this information, because it&#x27;s their platform. They can set the content rules as they like, as arbitrarily and capriciously as they like.<p>More of a judgment call, but I would argue that Twitter is morally in the right as well. This is obviously a case of carefully engineering disinformation, using America&#x27;s value of freedom of speech against us. If they don&#x27;t suppress it, Twitter is actively aiding bad actors, with very serious consequences. Twitter does not want to be in the business of content moderation, but in this case the information is question is so obviously falsified; it is spread so obviously in bad faith; and its consequences are so obviously dangerous to the nation, that they are justified in taking a moral stand against it.')
