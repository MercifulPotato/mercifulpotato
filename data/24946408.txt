I am responding to the claim that we should get rid of CoCs, which I disagree with. I am not arguing that CoCs are perfect, or that we don&#x27;t need checks. In this case, it seems that the CoC was pretty poorly written, and the team didn&#x27;t even follow their own procedure. I think we should fix those problems rather than throw the whole thing out.')
