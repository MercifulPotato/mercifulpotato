Item(by='EvanAnderson', descendants=None, kids=[25475362], score=None, time=1608348987, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25474191, text='But how will we incentivize Dr. Seuss or Gene Roddenberry to create new works if we don&#x27;t &quot;protect&quot; their current works? &#x2F;s<p>(Don&#x27;t even get me started about companies whose entire business is built on &quot;monetizing&quot; the public domain and locking it in a &quot;vault&quot;... &gt;sigh&lt;)<p>Edit: I&#x27;m not anti-copyright. Egregious length of copyright term is my main beef. I think limited time monopolies (patents and copyrights) can produce a lot of good for society. The contract has to be favorable to both parties, though. Letting those who &quot;own&quot; items of &quot;intellectual property&quot; starve the public domain for too long, particularly when so many works end up being orphaned (and effectively unusable for anyone), is what I have a problem with. Right now the contract for copyright is too stilted in favor of the &quot;owners&quot;, to my mind.')
