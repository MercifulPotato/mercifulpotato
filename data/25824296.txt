You cited Germany as an example, but Germany doesn&#x27;t have a single payer system, it has a public-private mix. It&#x27;s a universal multi-payer system. Netherlands has a purely private universal healthcare system, Switzerland has a purely private universal healthcare system, Australia has a public-private mix (44% choose private), Singapore has universal catastrophic coverage but everything else is driven by savings accounts and private insurance among the upper-middle class, etc etc — Belgium, South Korea (technically &quot;single payer&quot; but only covers 60% of costs, private insurance fills in the gaps), Japan, etc.<p>From where I sit, the most apples-to-apples A&#x2F;B test of single-public-payer vs private insurance is actually being run in the US, as we speak. When you turn 65, you have the option to enroll either in &quot;Original Medicare&quot;, which is what we usually think of when we talk about &quot;single payer healthcare in America&quot;, or you can enroll in Medicare Advantage (aka Medicare &quot;Part C&quot;), where the premiums that would go to the CMS instead go to private insurers like Humana, United, Oscar Health, Aetna, Clover, etc. These plans replace Original Medicare, also cover Part D prescription drug benefits, and often include supplemental benefits that Original Medicare doesn&#x27;t already cover. There are some interesting findings so far:<p>- 39% of Medicare beneficiaries are on private Medicare Advantage plans instead of the public &quot;Original Medicare&quot;. Because everyone is entitled to &quot;Original Medicare&quot;, this is purely voluntary. This number has been growing so rapidly, that we expect by 2025, more seniors to be on a private plan than the public one. There&#x27;s also great variance by State. In Florida, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, Minnesota, Oregon, Alabama, Hawaii, and Connecticut — nearly 50% of beneficiaries are on Medicare Advantage. By 2022, we expect more seniors in those States to be on a private plan than a public one. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kff.org&#x2F;medicare&#x2F;issue-brief&#x2F;a-dozen-facts-about-medicare-advantage-in-2020&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kff.org&#x2F;medicare&#x2F;issue-brief&#x2F;a-dozen-facts-about...</a><p>- For most beneficiaries, Medicare Advantage costs about 39% less than Original Medicare. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;healthpayerintelligence.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;medicare-advantage-costs-40-less-than-fee-for-service-medicare" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;healthpayerintelligence.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;medicare-advantage-...</a><p>- Medicare Advantage plans are, on average, of higher quality than the public &quot;Original Medicare&quot; \n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;healthpayerintelligence.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;medicare-advantage-enrollment-quality-continue-upward-trend" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;healthpayerintelligence.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;medicare-advantage-...</a><p>- In Urban areas, Medicare Advantage costs less per capita to administer than Medicare — and that&#x27;s not including the extra Medicare Part D insurance that you would have to buy if you&#x27;re on the Original Medicare plan. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.commonwealthfund.org&#x2F;publications&#x2F;issue-briefs&#x2F;2016&#x2F;jan&#x2F;does-medicare-advantage-cost-less-traditional-medicare" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.commonwealthfund.org&#x2F;publications&#x2F;issue-briefs&#x2F;2...</a> From this same research, public &quot;Original Medicare&quot; is still cheaper in rural areas, but not by a whole lot.<p>So to make things more complicated, we&#x27;re not just talking about whether &quot;Medicare For All&quot; is better than the status quo, we also need to litigate if private-insurance driven &quot;Medicare Advantage For All&quot;, is even better.')
