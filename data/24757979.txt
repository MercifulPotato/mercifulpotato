Item(by='hinkley', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602528673, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24755147, text='Smaller memory footprints can make code faster, but making code faster often creates a bigger memory footprint.<p>For instance, pipelining an operation to allow multiple CPUs to work on a problem at once can reduce the pressure on the tall tent pole, be it IO bottlenecks or one phase. Time is still dictated by the tallest tent poles, but not also by the fourth through tenth tallest poles.<p>But now everything is happening at once, which means all of the temporary data structures exist in memory in parallel, instead of sequentially.<p>Heavily paraphrasing someone else: The simple things get taken care of early. If we&#x27;re standing around talking about problems in a successful tool, they&#x27;re complicated. Although I disagree with that person on one point: we can also be talking about problems that were complicated to diagnose (but straightforward to fix).')
