But for complex assemblies, making idealized representations is typically worthwhile (and typically necessary if anything is e.g. bolted together). Can you even mix different types of 3D elements (e.g. tets&#x2F;pyramids&#x2F;wedges&#x2F;hexs).<p>The future of finite element modeling is probably is nurbs-enhanced or IGES-enhanced. Why are you building the past&#x2F;current instead of the future?<p>Can your solvers do HP-refinement? Or even just H refinement.<p>Can you do glued contacts?<p>How much do I have to know about the time stepping scheme, or does your software work that out for you.<p>If I am doing thermal control or dynamic control can you handle that (I like that it interfaces with matlab so I can plug it into simulink--you should hammer on that in your copy--that is a really nice differentiating factor for people who would use FEA to drive control e.g. smart materials people, active optics, aerodynamic control people).<p>How easy is it to do optimizations?  For instance (at home) I keep thinking about wanting to optimize a piezoelectric diagram fan like GE uses in their lights but for computers, how much easier is that going to be than just figuring out an open source software on my own.<p>Why FENICS and not DEAL.II or MOOSE (I don&#x27;t know, I am just curious.  I used to use FENICs but got frustrated because their input syntax kept changing on me.<p>Also really cool.<p>I have been thinking about writing software in this space but more nichy for about the past year and am beginning to get started, any interest in collaboration?<p>Also if you want to ask me questions about my thinking as a user who thinks a lot in these problems space, feel free to email me (I will want it to move to a phone call, but don&#x27;t want to post my phone number on hacker news).')
