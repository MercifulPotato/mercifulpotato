If everyone in Tajikistan has $5 except the president, Emomali Rahmon, is inequality not low?<p>I suspect you are looking for a pairing of HDI and Gini, which factors in both the development (and hence the standard of living) and the inequality.<p>Sweden: (Gini: 0.25, HDI: 0.933), France: (Gini: 0.31, HDI: 0.901), Canada: (Gini: 0.33, HDI: 0.926), USA: (Gini: 0.48, HDI: 0.924), South Africa: (Gini: 0.65, HDI: 0.709).<p>Now, Tajikistan has an HDI of 0.66 (&quot;medium&quot;), and Azerbaijan 0.756 (&quot;high&quot;).<p>Kazakhstan might surprise you, the HDI is 0.817 (&quot;very high&quot;). The standard of living there is actually good, in spite of what you may have seen on Borat - incidentally filmed in Romania.
