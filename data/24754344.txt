From your comments you said you went to NC state, i remember that one of the founders of cockroachdb also went there, it certainly didn&#x27;t stop him from doing great things. What i do know for a fact, is that your negative, self pitying approach to life will do you much much more harm than where you work or where u went to school, and i suggest you reflect hard on that or get professional help.')
