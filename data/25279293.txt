They also generally have ways to control your phone such as the ability to lock down or completely wipe your phone. I have heard there are more advanced MDMs that can get more detailed information such as contacts and usage information about messages, but I think it is still impossible to get the messages themselves.<p>I have also had to install MDM software in the past at companies with BYOD policies in order to get access to company email or corporate networks so the &quot;they own the device&quot; answer isn&#x27;t always valid.')
