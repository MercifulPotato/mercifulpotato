We&#x27;ve known about long-wavelength radio emission from Jupiter for ages. Astronomers have been looking for the same thing in exoplanet systems probably since shortly after their discovery! But because they are so far away, the emission is faint and hard to detect. This is also very long wavelength radio (in the tens of megahertz) which is a difficult portion of the spectrum to work in.<p>I suppose it is less spectacular if one makes the immediate connection &quot;radio &lt;-&gt; techno-signature&quot;, but that&#x27;s unwarranted and not a fault of the press release or the author, in my opinion. Jupiter&#x27;s auroral emissions are mainly caused by volcano&#x27;s on Io, so it&#x27;s not unrealistic to think we can learn a lot about planetary mass objects (the moons) from observations like these.')
