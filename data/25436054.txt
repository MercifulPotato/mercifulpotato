Any benefit of the telegram desktop app seems like a marginal one when the signal one works and signal do encryption well, properly and honestly. (Maybe telegram are catching up to this now, not sure, Moxie has always been solid and has forced the entire feature set of messaging to end-to-end encryption for which he&#x27;s going straight to heaven).<p>My own irc client I wrote when learning C and then re-wrote learning GTK+ is better than any of them in terms of doing what I want non-bloated as a client. But it doesn&#x27;t quite match the whole signal thing somehow. :)<p>Signal is excellent software. Game changing stuff. Telegram (indirectly), Whatsapp (directly) owe signal a great debt. The reverse doesn&#x27;t seem to be true.<p>End to end ecryption for the masses is a huge, huge win that Moxie can take a vast amount of credit for making happen, then improving and increasing. So there&#x27;s a little hero-worship for Moxie, a man with whom politically I probably have very, very little in common. It&#x27;s a good feeling when you can do that.')
