A star is smaller than an arc minute.  A light viewed from space is smaller than an arc minute.  But either way, that &quot;point source&quot; has to be bright enough to light up the entire arc minute to stand out from its surroundings.<p>The only thing your eye perceives is the total light coming from that arc minute.  Which is the same as saying you have to bring up the average brightness of that arc minute.<p>And an arc minute&#x27;s area, viewed from low orbit, is somewhat bigger than a football field.<p>&gt; Pretty sure you can do that with just a few watts laser with size measured in millimeters, if you focus it well enough onto the ISS.<p>Yeah but that&#x27;s a laser.  This is a white light.  Much more difficult and impressive.')
