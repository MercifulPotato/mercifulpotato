New Mexico in particular with out of state plates I&#x27;ve been pulled over 3 times for little to nothing.<p>Then I moved to NM and have lived here for over a decade (with NM plates) and have been pulled over once and let go with a warning.<p>I have to back OP up on the little towns, rapidly dropping speed limits and desire for revenue because it matches my experience completely.<p>Interstates are a different situation so maybe that&#x27;s the difference in perception. Or maybe I just got unlucky. There were no dogs in any of the pull overs although in one case they did want to look through the car.')
