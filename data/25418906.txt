Is the divergence of the vector field of knowledge positive at the Greeks? Do they pump out more than they ingested from their prior generations? Indeed a lot of the heavy lifting is done by later generations in picking out the good stuff from everything, and we know &quot;90% of everything is crap&quot;.<p>Aristotle was right and influential because we the later generations pick him of all his contemporaries because <i>we</i> evaluate his ideas to be good. And we discard a lot of bullshit where he was wrong and made up things without any basis.<p>Is my analysis here original? Surely not. We all stand on the shoulders of giants etc. But the point is precisely this, that we propagate the best ideas forward, in a discourse, and this is an active process and requires our judgment. Sure this idea itself is also not my radically novel insight. But I wouldn&#x27;t count on seeing absolutely novel insight in all HN comments.')
