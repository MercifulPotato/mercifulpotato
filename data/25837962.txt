Many other of the &quot;ecosystem&quot; tools they sell have other, established commercial or open-source options (e.g. Splunk vs SIEM, Jaeger&#x2F;OpenTracing vs APM), and these options won&#x27;t tie you into the Elastic environment.<p>&gt; I think that this attempt to take a popular open-source project proprietary is going to blow up in their faces. Users will flock to OpenDistro and this will be the beginning of the end of Elastic unless they reverse this decision.<p>100% agree. We&#x27;re going to see an open-source fork, whether from Open Distro (which may have too much baggage) or a new, rebranded project, and many users who don&#x27;t need Elastic&#x27;s value-adds will flock there.<p>^1: Admittedly everything tech is severely overpriced right now.')
