Recursion, REPL and even conditionals all came from Lisp (FORTRAN had a conditional entity at the time, but not what we&#x27;d recognise as a conditional today and I believe they later adopted Lisp-style conditionals anyway). IIRC, Lisp could be expressed in 5 small base functions defined in assembly, from which the entire language could be defined in turn, making it outrageously portable.<p>It&#x27;s hard to understate how seminal Lisp was.')
