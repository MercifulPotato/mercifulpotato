How are the ads paid for though - is it billed per click or per impression, or is it billed per an approximate amount of time the ad will be displayed for?<p>The problem with charging per click or impression is that you&#x27;re vulnerable to fraud which means you either lose money&#x2F;trust or you have to do invasive tracking to detect &amp; prevent fraud (which you&#x27;ll be unlikely to achieve as well as the big players - Google &amp; Facebook - do). Charging per amount of time (regardless of actual impressions or clicks) doesn&#x27;t have that problem.')
