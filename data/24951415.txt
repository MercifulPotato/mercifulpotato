If I claimed I knew who went extreme first, it wouldn&#x27;t matter and only lead to arguments without furthering the discussion. I will say though, that I think the left feels pushed to more extremes by how SCOTUS has gone down since 2015.<p>&gt; Notably, if Iâ€™m right about the dynamics, the best way to combat the far right is by moderating the left.<p>I agree, but I also understand when the left claims their moderation has let them get run over.<p>I don&#x27;t know what the fix is, but I&#x27;ve watched family and friendships torn apart over this. It&#x27;s a very sad situation.')
