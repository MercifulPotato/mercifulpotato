One, good luck convincing politicians to sacrifice their projects to make room for #3. I understand the carbon tax would be more efficient, but in the short term there would a be a revenue loss, and most politicians would only care about that. Two, Without #3, the whole thing is a non-starter. It&#x27;s a lofty academic idea that fits well into a forum like this; but without #3 happening, it boils down to &quot;give me more of your money and I promise we&#x27;ll fix it!&quot;, which is an unacceptable argument for lots of Americans (myself included, to be frank).<p>I personally hold that the best and most realistic solution is a headfirst, committed dive into nuclear energy.')
