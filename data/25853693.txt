Sure, some implementations might not have implemented all the XEPs, but the XEPs they do implement (assuming they&#x27;re not buggy) will work reliably with any other client or server out there.<p>I&#x27;ll like Matrix when it can replace XMPP. Dendrite sounds like a step in that direction when it&#x27;s mature.<p>Please stop spreading FUD about XMPP.')
