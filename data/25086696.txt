I have been playing a game called Dual Universe and I think it fits this exact crowd.  It has a heavy industry component where you can build a simple amount of machines or hundreds of them.  More so I think the folks of this site would enjoy some of the realism of space flight.  While some rules are bent, you need to do actual physics calcs to get your ship flying into space to escape gravity depending on weight etc.  Still in beta but reminds me a lot of factorio and I think it will move closer and closer towards it.  Warning that if you are into sci-fi and problem solving that Dual Universe will be a time sink.')
