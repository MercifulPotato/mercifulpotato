Many sikhs here support Trump. Mostly who are here since ages, &amp; are businessman, does not pay minimum wage, employ &amp; exploit asylum seekers. And I am also sikh, although does not wear any sikh symbols like Hair Turban.<p>No where I said we need congress government. Modi dictator need to go away. India was progressing way way more in Manmohans rule (yes, there were million bad issues were too, no denial). But Modi&#x27;s rule is dictatorship.<p>Delhi 1984 need to be punished, by Singh&#x27;s or by Government, or by people. Yes, that includes Rajiv, Indiara, Kamal Math, Everybody who was involved. #NeverForget1984<p>You can&#x27;t even compare Biden Support to modi Supporters. Biden won fair &amp; square. The greatest president has world&#x27;s most secure elections under his rule, &amp; fraud happened? No, he lost it. Simple. I am Democrat pro, want Sanders, but will work with Biden, because the other option was Twice Impeached Orange. Never. A lesser evil is better than bigger one.<p>RSS has a MBA Think Tank in Nagpur, thinking over every next move to keep the power clutched in their bloody hands forever. Its a rouse that winning every election will seem sus, so lets lose some smaller ones.<p>Serving in military does not give one a certificate of something. Its a profession. Nobody is forced. Its for money, just like any other profession. Teachers, Cashiers, Servers, Firefighters are equally important. Nothing morally special about being you or family in military. Millions of racist bigots work in every country&#x27;s military, thinking themselves as Patriots, but infact are just racist.')
