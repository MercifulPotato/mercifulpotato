CEOs at these companies don&#x27;t want a situation like this, as it damages the company&#x27;s reputation, CEO of Tilray has talked about it when Tilray got squeezed for two months.<p>He said something interesting “My advice to those CEOs would be that, at times like this, your company is not your stock and your stock is not your company”.<p>Another things we need to realize is that there are people who will be losing their life savings or getting into debt. It doesn&#x27;t matter if someone with high networth loses 1% of their wealth, but it does matter if someone in middle class loses 100% of their savings or worse bought these stocks with debt and now need to pay high interest on the losses. There have been painful situations where losses like these have caused people to have heart attacks, mental health issues and suicide.<p>Brokers, apps, platforms don&#x27;t want their names associated with such painful situations.')
