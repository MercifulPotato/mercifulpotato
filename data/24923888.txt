Zcoin is actually considering moving away from it, but mainly because the proof size of 200kb is prohibitive, which is less of a concern for a captcha system: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.zcoin.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;should-we-change-pow-algorithm&#x2F;477" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.zcoin.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;should-we-change-pow-algorithm&#x2F;477</a><p><i>I&#x27;m not surprised to see someone ripping apart a different captcha system</i><p>I really don&#x27;t mean to rip it apart. I just wanted to see some discussion, any discussion, of the well-known flaws with the idea and what ideas OP has to address them.')
