She understood publish in the academic sense, while Google views sending the paper out for conference review as publishing. The paper ends up failing internal review, so per policy it must be promptly retracted. This is confusing to the academic who expects to get access to the raw review responses so that the paper can be fixed. After all in her mind it is not published yet, and updates can be submitted to the conference to fix the issues.<p>The underlying reason for the paper failing internal review looks to be that it basically condemns Google&#x27;s whole approach to AI (big models) while failing to take into account some relevant research that may favor google&#x27;s approach. (I have no way of guessing if it would have passed review if it did take into account those, but still condemned the approach).<p>The massive amount of miscommunication makes her feel like she was being oppressed, due to race and or gender. Hence her aggressive tone in her emails and ultimatum.<p>Looks like a fairly classic case of a major blowup due to poor communication.')
