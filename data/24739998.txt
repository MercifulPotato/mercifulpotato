For the first five or six iterations of the iPhone it really did feel like the new model instantly made the old model feel old. Ever since around iPhone 7 or so I don&#x27;t get that impression any more. It&#x27;s a mature product and the new one is faster and takes better pictures but, frankly, the last one was fast enough and it&#x27;s camera was great too.<p>If your phone is how you spend your free time, then it&#x27;s essentially your hobby and from that point of view spending a couple of thousand dollars on your hobby isn&#x27;t absurd at all. It probably works out to about $5 per day which is something lots of people can afford.')
