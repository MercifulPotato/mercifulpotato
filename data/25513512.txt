I support protests and lawful demonstrations. People and journalists aren&#x27;t being arrested for that. This was stated in the comment I linked, so I&#x27;m not sure how you reached the conclusion that I oppose these protests.<p>What I do oppose are people violating curfews or orders to disperse and falsely claiming that they were arrested for journalistic activity while omitting the fact that non-journalists in the same area were also arrested.')
