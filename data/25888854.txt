The basic idea is that when you upvote someone&#x27;s comment or post, the author goes to your list of &quot;favorite authors&quot; and the personalized feed is based on that list. Comments could be ordered with that list as well. You still need the general &quot;news&quot; feed for discovery.<p>This would solve the problem of echo chambers. I often notice how interesting discussions get buried quickly because a few users flag them. It seems just wrong that someone can decide for me that I shouldn&#x27;t be able to read something.<p>Thoughts?')
