If the emperor shows his weakness, the empire could collapse. If you have followed the story, China has been asking Hong Kong to implement Basic Law 23 from 2008, it was a guarantee for no independence movement, and they couldn&#x27;t do it until 2020, the National Security law was basically forced on Hong Kong because its inability to implement it. China was hoping to continue the original strategy but the movement has been used as evidence that the original strategy will not work. Also you have to know, there are so much wealth from Chinese officials and elite family are in Hong Kong, there would be strong power within the party to keep Hong Kong as it is, unfortunately they are losing ground because of whats happening on TV. You don&#x27;t have to mention that Hong Kong was set to be a model for the one country two systems example, China has all the reasons to make it work as much as possible. Okay, I just wanted to analyze what&#x27;s happened in my way of thinking, not trying to play the judge.')
