Not everyone in the world is obsessed with the latest drama in the US.<p>I&#x27;ve done many torchwalks with scouts. In fact, they&#x27;re used to celebrate the end of the Nazi occupation in my home town every single year on Sept 18th. Should we stop doing this because some yahoos on the other side of the world used some torches in some far-right march? This is &quot;Hitler has a moustache, you have a moustache, ergo you must be a Nazi&quot;-kind of logic.<p>&gt; 2) They&#x27;re adapting Nazi slogans as hostnames<p>A private server belonging to a single person, not the project. I have asked him plainly and directly about that and he avoided the question. I am also not impressed by this, but that doesn&#x27;t make him a Nazi, and it certainly doesn&#x27;t make everyone involved in the project a Nazi.<p>&gt; 3) They&#x27;re denigrating &quot;Cultural Marxism&quot;.<p>A single person is (same one as the hostname). And like I said, there is a lot more to that conversation than the screenshot makes it out to be as there was a lot of confusion about what&#x27;s intended with &quot;cultural marxism&quot;. I really recommend you read the entire conversation in full, and while I don&#x27;t personally agree with their take, it&#x27;s also really not that bad.')
