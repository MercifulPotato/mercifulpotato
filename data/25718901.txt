The trick of course is in trying to estimate what they will be.<p>But using off-the-shelf software that you simply install is certainly one form of &quot;using code written by other people.&quot; If it is popular software offered by a stable company, I would always estimate it&#x27;s likely future cost as less than <i>anything</i> written in-house. (Which doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s risk free, the software <i>can</i> become unsupported or change in backwards incompat ways incurring costs. You can get unlucky. But I&#x27;m almost always going to advise that it&#x27;s the safer choice with regard to future costs than in-house development).<p>If we&#x27;re talking about in-house software projects to begin with, as you probably intended, but evaluating using a third-party dependency vs writing the functionality in-house, figuring out which of those paths will be likely to end up lower-cost is not at all easy to do, and dependent on a lot of context.<p>But certainly in <i>all</i> cases, <i>not having any software</i> will be lower-maintenance-cost than having any software. Well, at least lower <i>software</i> maintenance cost. :)')
