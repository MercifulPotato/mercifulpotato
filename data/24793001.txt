Item(by='jfengel', descendants=None, kids=[24794695], score=None, time=1602791483, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24789293, text='The slogan &quot;the network is the computer&quot;, prominently marked as (R), struck me, because that was Sun Microsystem&#x27;s slogan. So I checked the TESS database, and things got weird. Nobody bothered to record it until Oracle did, in 2009:<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tmsearch.uspto.gov&#x2F;bin&#x2F;showfield?f=doc&amp;state=4802:6jrw1o.2.2" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tmsearch.uspto.gov&#x2F;bin&#x2F;showfield?f=doc&amp;state=4802:6jr...</a><p>but it&#x27;s also marked DEAD as of 2011, without any indicator as to why. There is a live trademark, created 2018, and it does indeed belong to Cloudflare:<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tmsearch.uspto.gov&#x2F;bin&#x2F;showfield?f=doc&amp;state=4802:6jrw1o.2.1" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tmsearch.uspto.gov&#x2F;bin&#x2F;showfield?f=doc&amp;state=4802:6jr...</a><p>I suppose Oracle doesn&#x27;t really see itself as taking on the Sun mantle there, but I&#x27;m surprised they&#x27;d abandon a catchy slogan. Surely they&#x27;d find some reason to use it? How long would they have to ignore it before it got marked dead; is it really just two years? Why bother to file for it in the first place?')
