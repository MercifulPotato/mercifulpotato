My teachers considered me to be very talented and were grooming me for the elite schools for said field. However, the more research I did the more I realized how much hot air was being blown and how much ego was involved. I chose to not add my own ego and voice to that self inflated hall and instead taught myself to code (painfully and reluctantly).<p>Coding isn’t my passion and I still <i>love</i> that field. However, I just couldn’t in good conscience participate in it as I knew my ego would drive me far too much.<p>Coding isn’t particularly pleasant, isn’t something I would do in my free time, but it is interesting, keeps me humble, and pays the bills.')
