Wilson became a Harvard professor.  He grew up in the age of an expanding faculty, not competing with the entire world for a professorship, and let&#x27;s just say... a world interested in the lives of ants.<p>Not to cast any doubt whatsoever on his impressive scholarship and advances for the public good of science at all, but the environment he succeeded in is not the same world that today&#x27;s young professors face.<p>You should do all the things he suggests.  But don&#x27;t expect that that alone will lead to greatness without a lot of luck too.')
