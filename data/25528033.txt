Having said that, perhaps it&#x27;s a combination of my own personal trauma from originally being taught in a very rote way and thousands of hours of helping students learn to read, but I have an aversion to not knowing what you are doing. I remember looking at stacks of chords 3-6-9 to 7-3-5, or even trying to read a basic root position C7 chord with the RH doing stuff on top and feeling really hopeless to get my LH to fall into those shapes. I&#x27;ve also seen this with many students. Chords are hard if you don&#x27;t see them as words and try to look at every note every time. ¯\\_(ツ)_&#x2F;¯')
