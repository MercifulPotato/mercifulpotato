So that places the Apple system on a 25-36% better battery range, instead of 80-100%.<p>And still, there are more catches: Apple is probably driving the screen at 60Hz instead of 120Hz for the G14, and the screen tends to be one of the main drivers of battery life.<p>What I&#x27;m trying to say is that the talks revolve around the M1 vs x86 for battery consumption, but the big savings can probably come from other components in the system.')
