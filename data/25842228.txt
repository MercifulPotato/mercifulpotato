Significant enough to assume they&#x27;re not well-situated other-configs? Probably not. Even the most VIM- and CLI-oriented devs I know still prefer a familiar GUI for normal day to day work. Are they all going Ubuntu? Or Elementary? I mean, I welcome any migration that doesn&#x27;t fracture the universe. But I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s likely.')
