Despite having never done so, I have recurring dream trope where I&#x27;ve naively driven a car into some place it was easy enough to enter, only to realize it was quite inappropriate.<p>FWIW, a few years ago Google Maps also gave me wildly inappropriate directions on the way to Yosemite (i.e., in Google&#x27;s ~back-yard).
