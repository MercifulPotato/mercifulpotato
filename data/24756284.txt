What do you want to be able to customize perfectly to <i>your</i> needs?<p>As an example of the latter: I&#x27;ve tried bikeshares but they just made me long for my own bike: they&#x27;re all too low for me, they usually have three gears at best, they have hard-to-move solid tires, the cargo area is usually in the front instead of my preference of the back. The cheap, beat-up seven-speed I own is a lot more <i>fun</i> to ride on.')
