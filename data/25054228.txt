The Japanese (and probably many Chinese) cuisines certainly fall into the micronutrient-rich category (with seaweed, fish, etc.), have seemingly been tested for centuries and are awesome. Difficult to have these diets in the Western world though.<p>As for the science factor, I am a bit suspicious of people who have made nutrition their life topic. I get vibes of eating disorders or very controlling food choices. Like the formerly obese or anorexic person who becomes a dietitian because they did not manage to get rid of the cognitive addiction (they chose a profession where they can talk about food all the time). This might explain the tendency for these research areas to go with diet fads, or promote food very poor in nutrients like lettuce while rarely talking dangers like pesticides or issues how you should even come close to the daily recommended values with modern-grown veggies.<p>Also, there are some shoddy science practices in highly promoted studies. They often seem\nto work with mindless questionnaires („how many grams of potato did you eat last week?“). Then there is a huge correlation vs. causation problem. In some countries only rich  and educated people have time and money to cook or even think about their food choices.')
