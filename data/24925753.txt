We had configurations with dual joysticks (Robotron, Battlezone), single stick and buttons (Defender), trackball and buttons (Missile Command), spinner and buttons (Tempest), all buttons (Asteroids) and probably a few more that I don&#x27;t remember.   My only complaint is that makes it really hard to build a cabinet with all of those combinations in the present day.')
