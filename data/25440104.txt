Haven&#x27;t played it yet.<p>See what I did there? Compare GTA and W3? Because to me, they are similar. I mean, you can&#x27;t kill random people in W3, but the &quot;go where you want and collect and build&quot; seems the same.<p>If you&#x27;re telling me 2077 is not open world, I&#x27;ll be disappointed.')
