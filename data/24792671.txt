Item(by='TaylorAlexander', descendants=None, kids=[24796271], score=None, time=1602789648, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24790116, text='They sell printers which “solve” that problem by locking you in to one type of filament.<p>I would love to see automatic print failure detection (with a camera, even a micro camera at the nozzle).<p>Figuring out the correct settings for unknown plastic seems like it would be hard to solve, but perhaps there’s some base material properties that could be determined automatically which might help. I’ve noticed that the Prusa 3D printer software has a sizable database of filament brands in its material settings section. I’d be curious how foolproof those settings all are for each brand of filament. But of course a manufacturer could change formulation at any time...<p>I solve this problem by only buying one of two brands and keeping custom settings for them.<p>I started my career in CNC machining. People always thought that meant software did everything for me, but no I had to choose tool sizes, spindle RPM, feed rates, depth of cut, etc. The CNC is not a magic machine that makes parts for you, it’s a tool. So I guess I’m a bit biased for thinking that current 3D printers are super useful tools that require a certain amount of operator competency. You cannot put any random filament in and expect good results, and actually that might be a hard problem to solve on the back end. Much easier to pay attention to what brand you order and feed in good quality stuff.<p>But idk. You’re right that they’re fiddly AF and I’m just used to it. If they could solve those problems it would surely help adoption.')
