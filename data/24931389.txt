I just wrapped up an interview 5 minutes ago for a job that I will not get. I had a shot at it, but I&#x27;m rusty on some specifics they need. It was a great learning experience, and because I was a &quot;close&quot; candidate, I don&#x27;t feel guilty about wasting their time. Just not a fit.<p>Tomorrow, I&#x27;ll apply for other similar roles and I&#x27;ll interview again and again until something sticks.')
