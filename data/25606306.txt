There is a named molecule called &quot;amphetamine&quot; short for  alpha-methylphenethylamine, it has a unique IUPAC name ((RS)-1-phenylpropan-2-amine).<p>Methamphetamine is a derivative in the class of amphetamines (amphetamines being the family that was originally established by amphetamine).  I know that&#x27;s confusing.  But, it has its own chemical structure, N-methylamphetamine, which is chemically distinct (yet extremely similar).<p>If your point is &#x27;meth is an amphetamine&#x27;, that&#x27;s fine but it doesn&#x27;t strengthen your arguments.')
