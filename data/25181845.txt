In fact, I&#x27;m unsure if I&#x27;ve ever started one.<p>Unfortunately however, HN provides a lot of comments that requires a response because they&#x27;re either just vile, pure propaganda, or entirely false. And given the demographics of this site they are rarely, if ever, shunned if they just meet two criteria: they&#x27;re somewhat articulate and they hold a good tone (bonus points if they contain links to vaguely associated &quot;sources&quot;).<p>So you want to dog-whistle racism on HN without any particular reaction? Don&#x27;t write something stupid and blatant, pick one of these options instead:<p>* &quot;Well, your country is much more homogeneous.&quot;<p>* &quot;Inequality is unfortunate but remember that IQ is very much determined by genes and that IQ is the strongest determining factor for future income so it is what it is.&quot;<p>etc etc.<p>I can&#x27;t just ignore such bullshit, especially when it&#x27;s left without any reaction.')
