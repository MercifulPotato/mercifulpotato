You identify yourself within the app with your login.<p>&gt; It says Imessage can link to your device id<p>While iMessage is vulnerable to (certain) MiTM attacks, and storing your message archive in iCloud is (was ?) unencrypted, iMessage is surprisingly resilient to attacks (on the protocol itself).<p>Every iOS&#x2F;Mac device generates it&#x27;s own key and uploads the public certificate to Apple&#x27;s keyserver, this is why they need your device id.<p>When you send messages with iMessage, your device then contacts Apple&#x27;s keyservers, gets ALL public certificates for the recipient, and encrypts the message once for every key, and sends an encrypted message per device.<p>Attachments are handled a bit different. Insted of encrypting the attachment n times, a new key is generated, which is then used to encrypt the attachement, the encrypted attachment is uploaded to Apple, and the key is sent using normal iMessage messages (encrypted)<p>Your private keys NEVER leave your device, so iMessage is end to end encrypted as long as you don&#x27;t enable iMessage in iCloud.<p>I said that iMessage was vulnerable to MiTM attacks, which it is. There&#x27;s nothing stopping Apple from adding a &quot;shadow&quot; device to your list of devices with it&#x27;s own set of keys, which would then receive a copy of every message sent to you, and that&#x27;s probably how iMessage in iCloud works, but they have no way of retrieving your message history from before the shadow device was added.<p>There&#x27;s a somewhat recent (2016) paper on it here : <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cs.tufts.edu&#x2F;comp&#x2F;116&#x2F;archive&#x2F;fall2016&#x2F;xshi.pdf" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cs.tufts.edu&#x2F;comp&#x2F;116&#x2F;archive&#x2F;fall2016&#x2F;xshi.pdf</a>')
