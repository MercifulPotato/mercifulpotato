I would love to see a commercial off the shelf cathode ray tube (CRT) that could do 480 Hz, so please share with us a link if you can find it in your notes.<p>A CRT monitor, with a refresh rate of 480 Hz, allows just 2 mS (2.083333 mS to be precise) for excitation of the phosphor. As you know, (here is a similar explainer [2]) the phosphor is excited by the arrival of electrons which contribute their kinetic energy when they impact the phosphor to the electron energy of the particular phosphor. When the energy decays back to base level, it emits a photon at a frequency that is characteristic of the band gap between the excited and rest state of the electrons in the outer orbit of the crystal.<p>The more electrons you can get excited in the phosphor crystal, the brighter the display. But the more electrons in the beam gives the beam more inertia and so rapidly moving it from one side of the screen to the other requires higher voltage potential.<p>I haven&#x27;t seen any high refresh rate CRTs but back in college we had a device which was a &quot;flying spot&quot; scanner which had a very fast phosphor but it was enclosed in a black box and basically relied on photographic film for persistence (it was made by a company called &quot;Dicomed&quot;). The shorter the persistence of the phosphor gave it a very high dynamic range of brightness which allowed us to transfer digital photos with a high dynamic range to film without losing fidelity.<p>I haven&#x27;t really followed the evolution of cathode ray tubes post the Sony Trinitron era, I would really love to play with the tube you mention, or at a minimum get the engineers specification for it. I&#x27;m assuming it was full color? (the Dicomed&#x27;s screen was a sort of yellowish white and it had three filters that it would place over the screen to scan out a color image).<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nasa.gov&#x2F;centers&#x2F;dryden&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;87778main_H-609.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nasa.gov&#x2F;centers&#x2F;dryden&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;87778main_H-609.pdf</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.phosphor-technology.com&#x2F;how-do-phosphors-work&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.phosphor-technology.com&#x2F;how-do-phosphors-work&#x2F;</a>')
