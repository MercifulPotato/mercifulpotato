None of this really seems to be the case regardless of the utility.<p>* GameStop was being driven to bankruptcy by hedge funds shorting it. I&#x27;m not sure what the logic is here.<p>These narratives almost seemed designed to rationalize the manufacture of a short squeeze; something the SEC seemingly has some strong opinions about.')
