And downstream from a coral reef!  This is not about offshore oil platforms.  This is about oil from land wells pumped out for storage <i>at sea</i>.  This should be illegal at an international level.  Keep such oil on land where a spill is vastly less damaging and far easier to clean up.<p>This whole thing reads like a Captain Planet episode.')
