Item(by='ben509', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609785884, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25632892, text='The Fair Code site doesn&#x27;t really explain how it works, but the Commons Clause site[1] has an FAQ.<p>I agree about the problem: it&#x27;s hard to run a business supporting a project if a competitor can come along and resell their code without any compensation.<p>The commons clause says a company can&#x27;t sell &quot;a product or service whose value derives, entirely or substantially, from the functionality of the Software.&quot;<p>I like the idea that a company could create a plugin that works with existing open source software and then sell that. I like the idea of creating a framework that lots of people can add plugins for, because I could make my living offering a few handy plugins for it and I don&#x27;t have a problem if others are also making a living selling their own plugins. In principle, it makes a lot of sense.<p>I&#x27;m not clear if it&#x27;s kosher for me to write product X that&#x27;s using a lot of Apache licensed software, but to which I&#x27;ve added the Commons Clause.<p>And it generally seems problematic... Suppose a company sinks a decent amount of effort into some widgets they add to a commons clause licensed software, but only 10% of customers really use the widgets. Are they in violation of the license?<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;commonsclause.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;commonsclause.com&#x2F;</a><p>[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fosspost.org&#x2F;fair-code-open-source&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fosspost.org&#x2F;fair-code-open-source&#x2F;</a>')
