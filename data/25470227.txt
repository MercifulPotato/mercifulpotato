It turns out it&#x27;s nothing like that, it&#x27;s more like a new Deus Ex game.<p>I&#x27;m flabbergasted by this comment. CP2077 is way <i>more</i> of a cyberpunk-themed GTA5 than I expected or wanted. Admittedly I avoided reading pretty much anything about the game before release to avoid the insane and impossible to live up to hype, but I can hardly wrap my head around the idea that there were people who wanted it to be more like a Rockstar game.')
