NK nukes don&#x27;t really change SK&#x27;s MAD vulnerability calculus; it&#x27;s more of a factor for the US. I worked with a guy who was present in 2010 during that year&#x27;s Key Resolve....when the &quot;exercise&quot; suddenly became very real due to the sinking of the Cheonan.[1] He was dialed into the video teleconferences that were held by the ROK Joint Chiefs of Staff. He said the ROK military leadership was absolutely furious and was legitimately ready to basically re-start the war, and that it was the USFK Commander (the US military 4-star who would command the fight) who had to talk the ROK generals down from the ledge.<p>It came up in conversation I think during 2016&#x27;s Ulchi Freedom Guardian because the NKs were launching ballistic missiles during the exercise and we all experienced a &quot;pucker factor&quot; for a moment because we weren&#x27;t sure if they were escalating the conflict or not. Then the missile trajectories indicated they&#x27;d land in the ocean and we could breathe again. Fun times.<p>[1]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;ROKS_Cheonan_sinking" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;ROKS_Cheonan_sinking</a>')
