MySQL&#x27;s CLI is very easy to use, because it uses long commands that are consistent and easy to remember, e.g. SHOW CREATE TABLE blah or GRANT ALL ON foo, rather than the cryptic letters of psql. Maybe if you use it a lot then psql makes more sense - but if you&#x27;re directly connecting to the database that much, something&#x27;s gone wrong, IMO.')
