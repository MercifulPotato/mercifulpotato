If you give up on this requirement, which I believe is antiquated [0], you can easily come up with a system where most fraud could be fixed and punished. You can have reasonable privacy, but you have to have the ability to audit votes if need be.<p>A system in which all votes are fungible after a certain point only encourages fraud. As long as you execute it well you can have a high degree of certainty that you won&#x27;t be punished.<p>[0] First, behind this requirement is the premise that political repression is to be expected.
