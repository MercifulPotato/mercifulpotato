I just download it, unzip to Program Files, add the folder to my %PATH% and that&#x27;s about it. I didn&#x27;t find myself in a situation where I would need an Apache or other webserver, the built-in one is good enough. It also makes using different versions easy, no need to deal with Apache and CGI&#x2F;FPM. You just use other PHP executable.')
