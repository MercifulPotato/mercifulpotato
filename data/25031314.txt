Item(by='yingw787', descendants=0, kids=None, score=3, time=1604894189, title='Ask HN: Is YouTube slower on Firefox than Chrome?', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='I&#x27;m on Ubuntu 20.04.1 LTS using top-of-market, workstation-grade hardware, and when I&#x27;m watching YouTube on Firefox 82.0.2, the videos keep buffering. I have a 55 Mbps down Internet connection, and this didn&#x27;t happen before. I had a sneaking suspicion that YouTube would work better on Chrome, opened YouTube using `google-chrome-stable` 86.0.4240.183 and it worked beautifully.<p>It&#x27;s been frustrating this year because there&#x27;s a bunch of little changes made to Google apps in order to make it break on Firefox, like Google Sheets added an extra carriage return on Firefox that wasn&#x27;t present in Chrome, and Google Meet forcibly errors out with a &quot;network connection&quot; issue that requires Chrome. Also the `youtube-dl` ban thing, I&#x27;m using somebody&#x27;s fork right now but not sure how long that will last.<p>Just wondering if other people are experiencing these &quot;buffering&quot; errors.')
