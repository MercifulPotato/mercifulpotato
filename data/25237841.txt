Until a formalised model is built, there is no way to describe it&#x27;s behaviour that wouldn&#x27;t come down to writing down the implementation that&#x27;s currently in the compiler (apart from specifying it by example, which would be even more expansive).<p>It _might_ (don&#x27;t quote me on this) be possible to more easily formalize and standardize borrow checking if you leave out non-lexical lifetimes (which were added rather recently), but that&#x27;s a bad idea because you would lose a lot of functionality, and an alternative compiler with an incompatible implementation of NLLs could split the ecosystem, which obviously nobody wants.')
