Item(by='qayxc', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611233941, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25856888, text='&gt; There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.<p>Yeah, and then - as the language matures - so do its users.<p>It&#x27;s a common dilemma that cannot be fixed. You have the early adopters who grew up with the language and at some point got stuck in their ways (e.g. Python 2.x).<p>Replacing day-one features with new ones feels like using a new language to those who used the language for decades. The more mature (read: older and more widespread) a programming language becomes, the harder it is to introduce breaking changes.<p>String interpolation is one such area and due to the nature of the language such an important and integral part that it&#x27;s becomes almost impossible to change.<p>As someone who never touched Python until very recently, I never even considered using anything but f-string formatting; I acknowledge that other (legacy) options exist, but outside of reading other people&#x27;s code, I simply ignore them.<p>To new users who started with Python 3.x the obvious way to do it is f-strings and only language veterans switching to 3.x are affected by that feeling.<p>IMHO nothing changed. 2.x uses print without parentheses and the %-operator. 3.x requires parenthesis and prefers f-strings.')
