It is a losing strategy (you&#x27;d agree?) because... if the startup&#x27;s F&#x2F;OSS product is any popular and lots of users do use it, it is only inviting the likes of Amazon (and anyone with the chops to build a cloud offering, really) to package it as SaaS &#x2F; PaaS around it.<p>I&#x27;d like to see startups experiment SSPL &#x2F; CCPL &#x2F; Commons Clause licensing from day zero (like materialize.io) to see if they can still attract users or build mind share. I&#x27;d hate for them to instead release it under F&#x2F;OSS licenses (and CLA all contributions) to only conveniently turn hostile with super-strong copylefts like SSPL or non-Libre licenses like Commons Clause and BSL.')
