The TCP sequence numbers are random so if the fraudster spoofs their IP, they won&#x27;t get the return traffic and will be unable to complete the handshake and even establish a connection.<p>As the original poster noted, 15 requests from a single IP in a short amount of time should be an anomaly. There&#x27;s no real world scenario where 15 people behind one NAT show interest to a specific ad simultaneously.')
