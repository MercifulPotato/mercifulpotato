How do you ensure the state of your program is what you think it is.<p>E.g.: Imagine you&#x27;re in a breakloop as described in the article. You find that local variable X is 5 when it really should be 4, so you quickly set it to 4. You find function foo() is not defined, so you define it. You continue and your program works. Great!<p>At the end of the day, you quit your environment and shut down. How do you ensure your interactive work is not lost and the environment is still what you expect it to be when you start again the next day. How would you compile such a program?<p>Is there some command that dumps the whole environment to a file as source code? Would you save your REPL history? Would you manually copy&#x2F;paste relevant bits to s code file?<p>Also, if significant parts of the source code are written inside the REPL, wouldn&#x27;t the lack of modern IDE features be a hassle? No syntax highlighting, no code completion, no code inspections etc. Or are there tools that offer those?')
