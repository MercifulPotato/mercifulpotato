I had hoped that moving on from frame relay and ATM had killed this model but wireguard brings it right back. Then you also have to deal with complications of wireguard interfaces always being up. The two combined means doing anything but the most basic setups means more complicationd with more chance for incorrect configuration than an ipsec or openvpn alternative.<p>Then there is the whole troubleshooting problem. When it doesn&#x27;t work wireguard provides much less information to troubleshoot the issue than ipsec and openvpn.<p>Also there is the irritating lines of code comparison vs ipsec and openvpn when for the most part it is comparing apples to oranges since wireguard doesn&#x27;t include many of the features of either which are required for an enterprise site to site or road warrior VPN solution. Once the solutions are in place to provide comparable functionality the attack surface is likely to be pretty comparable.')
