Working with microframeworks or serverless is great at first but as soon as you need any more of the typical features that a webapp requires then you start pulling in dependencies or re-implementing half of Django yourself anyway.  First you just need a little url router to some basic views.  OK that&#x27;s great, anything can do that.  Now you need to validate some forms.  Now you need to manage some session cookies.  Now you need to let users reset their passwords.  Now you need to look at your data and maybe export a csv.  It just goes on and on.')
