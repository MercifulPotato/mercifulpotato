An ISP is like a post office, and people’s letters should not be meddled with (outside of violent threats or pursuant to a legal criminal investigation). In particular, ISPs are relevant to most individuals and ISPs (should) have respect for individual rights.<p>The post office also allows you to keep mail at the post office and in PO boxes, which are regulated roughly the same as mail destined for residences&#x2F;businesses - I would put anyone who runs a datacenter&#x2F;servers for other people in the &#x27;PO box provider&#x27; category, so I don&#x27;t think this analogy really works')
