Regulatory capture is real and it needs to be addressed always - and if you work from founding principles and are honest with yourself you&#x27;ll come to the conclusion that centralized organizations are a necessity to fighting &quot;evil&quot;&#x2F;bad behaviour with good, responsible, trustworthy people<p>The argument then goes into nuance of where the debate continues as to how conservative or liberal you are - how &quot;small&quot; or &quot;big&quot; the government is, e.g. what decision making power or function does or should government have, e.g. Universal Basic Income&#x2F;UBI - the Freedom Dividend as Andrew Yang calls it - would arguably be more of traditional Conservative&#x2F;Republican leaning - giving $1,000&#x2F;month to individuals for THEM TO DECIDE what to do with the money vs. some bureaucratic government agency spending that money themselves making broad-vague decisions, almost always influenced by regulatory capture and industrial complexes manipulating the system via influencing politicians and the population via propaganda of various forms: &quot;tobacco is good for you&quot; - says your doctor, &quot;fat is bad for you&quot; says the sugar and health industry, &quot;MDMA&#x2F;mushrooms are bad for you&quot; - says big pharma industry who can&#x27;t patent those medicines, etc.<p>Edit: LUL - imagine a person actually had to put the effort into writing a qualitative response instead of getting a dopamine hit from a single click to ignore&#x2F;avoid engaging.')
