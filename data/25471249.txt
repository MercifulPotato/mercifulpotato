I&#x27;m dealing with bugs in their refactoring engine almost every day (at least in Python and TypeScript); I need to invalidate the cache every other week because something something is not working; it&#x27;s 2020 and I still can&#x27;t configure my IDE deterministically through text files (which regularly results in situations where building the project works fine for colleague X but not for me, even though we seem to have the same config, so I end up having to delete the project and create it again). And don&#x27;t even get me started about CPU usage…<p>That&#x27;s not to say that Jetbrains IDEs don&#x27;t provide incredible value. They do. But I still think they leave a lot to be desired when it comes to stability.')
