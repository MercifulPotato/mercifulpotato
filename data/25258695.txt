You&#x27;ll be blundering and getting out-positioned regularly against legitimate players, so it&#x27;s hard to notice that for one game a cheater played a perfect game against you, because most likely you made clear mistakes in that game. This is different for experts because they mostly stop making minor mistakes, so they have cause for suspicion when they know they played a strong and consistent game but still got destroyed. You also won&#x27;t be strong enough to really recognize that some moves are &quot;inhuman&quot;, especially because you&#x27;ll be playing against folks who make weird&#x2F;wrong moves all the time, whereas experts can sometimes tell if moves are computer-like (typically because there is a natural and obvious move to make and the cheating move is marginally stronger but hard to find).<p>- Cheaters don&#x27;t stay in low ratings for long. If they aren&#x27;t detected, they&#x27;ll be out of your rating in no time, like in 2 or 3 wins. This reduces the chance you&#x27;ll encounter cheaters, because if a cheater plays 100 games but only 2 of them are in your rating bracket, you&#x27;re unlikely to ever match against them anyways.<p>Keeping those things in mind, and knowing that reaching expert level (~2000+ elo) takes many years and is unachievable for most adults, online cheating becomes a minor concern at best for anyone who&#x27;s picking it up as a hobby in adulthood.')
