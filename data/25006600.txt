Then at the end, almost as an afterthought, the teacher comes up with an assessment. This serves a bureaucratic purpose, the administration requires it. It also serves a motivational purpose &quot;Study the material or you will fail the test&quot;, which helps the teacher to actually get students to learn.<p>This does mean the test isn&#x27;t really focused on assessing how well the students have learned. But do we need more focus, in studying, on assessing how well someone has learned? I&#x27;d argue we need more focus on actually teaching well. Using tests to determine the quality of teaching seems quite fraught. Certainly the adversarial model of an assessment makes things harder.<p>To summarize, I think your solution would fall to Goodhart&#x27;s law:<p>&quot;When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.&quot;<p>Whilst also de-emphasizing the actual goal of teaching.')
