Dumbdown compliments existing solutions.<p>TDLR: Dictation, transcription of voice input.<p>First use case I thought of is voice transcription. Dictating HTML, markup, misc <i>sucks</i>. Dumbdown could make it practical.<p>Better dictation has been on my mind a lot recently. Once I got a dog, I got <i>A LOT</i> more interested in audio &amp; voice. Podcasts, audiobooks, voice commands.<p>Now diving into using Siri Shortcuts for transcribing my Quantified Self stuff. eg I speak my weight and blood pressure, which creates entries in Health.app. Neat, right?<p>Well, dictation of text messages truly sucks. No editing mode. There&#x27;s no vi style out of band meta language to munge stuff afterwards. At least none that I&#x27;ve found.<p>And Siri&#x27;s auto carrot truly pisses me off. Not the mistakes, that&#x27;s tolerable. What I can&#x27;t handle is editing and correcting pops me out of whatever task I&#x27;m doing.<p>For my Night Shift style ramblings, I now just use the voice recorder. Basically sending voice mails &#x2F; memos to my future self. I feel stupid doing it. Always reminds me of a boss (Peter) who&#x27;d do this. Very clever strategy. But omg his messages made us worker bees howl.  He&#x27;d call his home phone and say something &quot;Hi, this is Peter, remember to buy milk. Bye bye.&quot; Like he wouldn&#x27;t know it was himself calling. Gods, I still crack up thinking about it.<p>Any way...')
