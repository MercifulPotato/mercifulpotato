There&#x27;s a lot of different combinations of those peripherals on different parts, but there&#x27;s usually only two or three major revisions present of each peripheral across the entire product line, and they tend to follow a pretty consistent timeline. (That is, a newer part will usually use the newest version of each peripheral.)')
