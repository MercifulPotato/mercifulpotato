BSDiff is two steps, the first step is calculating the binary subtraction mappings, and then compressing these mappings with a compressor. Colin Percival used zlib compression in his original bsdiff paper, but the performance of zlib is not great.  If you really wanted to compare zstd deltas with bsdiff you need to replace zlib with a modern compressor like regular old zstd.')
