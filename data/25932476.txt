There are paper losses in the short term, but unless they&#x27;re forced to actually cover those shorts, they don&#x27;t materialize as real losses.<p>Are those losses occurring? Or is WSB just being self-congratulatory about how much of their own money they&#x27;re throwing away, and being ignored by the people they&#x27;re supposedly hurting?<p>(I genuinely don&#x27;t know; it&#x27;s hard to tell from the reporting. Nor am I an expert. I could imagine that some hedge fund is getting margin calls forcing them to cover shorts that would seem to be shaky. If that&#x27;s the case, I could imagine those rules getting rewritten.)')
