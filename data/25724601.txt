I&#x27;ve seen people talk about all this long-term post-trial monitoring that is getting skipped and then have people who&#x27;ve actually run studies comment and say that&#x27;s not something they&#x27;ve ever done.<p>Honestly, people skipping the vaccine don&#x27;t really &quot;matter&quot; in the near term. We have more than enough people willing to get the vaccine for many, many months, so if people want to risk reaching immunity the hard way that&#x27;s their choice.')
