Item(by='nwienert', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610813180, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25800326, text='Hooks are <i>not</i> something you instantiate and then just call later, the whole point is that they need to be able to chain&#x2F;compose with each other, and that has to happen during every render. I&#x27;d be really curious to see what your proposal is in concrete code, as on the surface it sounds like it either misses the point of hooks entirely, else it&#x27;s just a syntactical change that is more a surface-level critique than an actual criticism of the concept itself.<p>Also your subroutine comment makes little sense. A function that returns different values over time is just that, it need not output anything. In UI programming I guess you&#x27;d call <i>everything</i> a subroutine, as state is constantly changing and you&#x27;re always in need of outputting changing dates, inputs, etc.<p>The whole point of frontend is you have to accept that fact and find the best paradigm to deal with that constant change of state, and I&#x27;ll claim hooks do that better than anything before it. If you did have a better solution to hooks, that&#x27;d be a big deal, and many people would love to see a good example.')
