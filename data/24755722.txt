But that doesn&#x27;t mean free speech isn&#x27;t a principle that can, and should, be applied in other areas of life. When people say Facebook is violating free speech, that absolutely makes sense as a violation of a principle that many of us care strongly about, and that our society is to a great extent founded upon. Just because free speech as a right is enshrined in the first amendment doesn&#x27;t mean the first amendment is where the principle of free speech begins and ends.')
