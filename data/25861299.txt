A company will give a developer a low&#x2F;mid-range laptop&#x2F;desktop pinching every penny they can then turn around any pay them a huge salary... Like do they not understand that running into RAM&#x2F;CPU limits makes the developer less effective? I&#x27;ve had jobs where I&#x27;ve easily spent 10x the cost of the better components&#x2F;computer in time waiting on company-issued computer. Very penny wise and pound foolish.<p>EDIT:<p>Two stories that still annoy me to this day:<p>1. We had been complaining about our slow machines for a while and my PM told me to write up a proposal to send to his boss for new parts. Which, side note, was the last time I went out of my way to &#x2F;beg&#x2F; for equipment to do my job better. Anyway, I write up an email with the reasoning for why we needed new hard drives (SSD&#x27;s, we were still on spinning rust) and&#x2F;or more RAM (I think we had ~16GB but we were running VMs). I explained how each part would help and even found cheap versions of both online that would be sufficient for our needs (we are talking &lt;$1-2K total for all of it for the whole team of 4). I specifically said that if it had to come down to one or the other that the SSD would help more than the RAM (and it was cheaper). I never got a reply to the request and then a few weeks later we got new RAM... Like why even pay people with the knowledge&#x2F;skills if you aren&#x27;t even going to listen to them or even engage&#x2F;discuss it.<p>2. The company was going to buy the developers new machines (finally) and they were testing out various machines (with hardly any input from the developers). All of the developers (4, this wasn&#x27;t a huge company) had personal Macs they used for meetings&#x2F;WFH (we only had desktops from work) but the company refused to even consider buying Macs because someone up the chain had a vendetta against Macs. They were looking at crappy laptops that cost the same or more than the MBP&#x27;s we all wanted but it a complete no-go. This was also the company where I used my personal MBP for work (with begrudging approval) because it was way better than the Dell desktop they gave me (to run Linux on). What made it infuriating was we did cross-platform development (iOS&#x2F;Android) but I was the only team member who could build&#x2F;test the iOS builds because I had a Mac. The company provided an old cheese grater Mac Pro (pre-trashcan) that couldn&#x27;t even be updated to a new enough OS to build apps that could be submitted to Apple...')
