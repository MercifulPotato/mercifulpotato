Because everything in the dependencies file is listed as:\n   aaaaaaa==xy.z<p>You are guaranteed to have the exact same version.<p>We have all sorts of turf wars when someone wants to roll forward the version of a module, and, in the case of the big ones (Pandas) we sometimes hold off for 6-9 months before rolling it forward.<p>But there is <i>something</i> that Poetry is doing that is better than &quot;pip freeze&quot; - I think once I figure that out, I&#x27;ll have an &quot;aha&quot; moment and start evangelizing it.  I just haven&#x27;t got there yet.')
