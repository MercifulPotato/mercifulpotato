I guess it&#x27;s still too new. As I&#x27;ve seen many times before so much complexity is replicated in userspace to reproduce kernel behavior out of mmap or DIO&#x2F;AIO, in order to break the latency, caching, and prioritization into a micromanaged state tuned for a narrow set of applications... Then applied to database code used in a myriad of applications which violate those assumptions and have their own needs. io_uring can&#x27;t take over fast enough.')
