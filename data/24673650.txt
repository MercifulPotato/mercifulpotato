You&#x27;re assuming that the person is bleeding.  You&#x27;re assuming they&#x27;re trying to stop it.<p>If mjw1007 reports a bug in a piece of software that mjw1007 doesn&#x27;t even use, and the project maintainer responds as if mjw1007 is trying to get something from the maintainer, then in addition to it becoming clear that having taken the time to file the bug was a waste, the maintainer&#x27;s response is going to be <i>infuriating</i>.  I can corroborate with firsthand experience, and you should be able to agree just by considering the circumstancesâ€”which differ from your assumptions, and that&#x27;s the problem.<p>There&#x27;s a fundamental disconnect here between how you understand the bugtracker to be used versus how others are actually using it and what any given person expects to get out of it.  To repeat: that it&#x27;s possible for the maintainer (or one of the project&#x27;s fans) to give a response that gets mjw1007&#x27;s intention wrong is <i>only</i> possible because people are freely mixing bug reports with other types of feedback.  (The project doesn&#x27;t actually have a bugtracker at that point!)<p>Side note: it&#x27;s not useful to move from concrete to abstract by turning to a metaphor (&quot;bleeding&quot;); it makes it more difficult.<p>See also: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24311700" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24311700</a>')
