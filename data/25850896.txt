Always.<p>In a perfect world, we make software, or hardware, and it just works and people grok it.<p>In the one we live in, these are fantasies and we can choose to understand, recognize the value, or not and get the benefits or not.<p>The users, customers, move from role to role, and support often determines their willingness to use the product again.  That is straight up powerful marketing by referral.<p>Support often is the first to understand a user, customer needs an option too, or add on, replacement, preventative maintenance.  Done right, these leads into lean, consistent sales.<p>&quot;Cost center&quot; to me has always been a bit silly in this way.  There is opportunity to add value throughout the chain of people, process, machines, systems that are all necessary to properly conceive, realize and deliver something to others.<p>One thing often missed along with failing to understand value is failing to ask to be compensated for it.<p>Doing things in a robust, high value for the dollar way is not the cheapest way, in terms of raw product price, and depending, size of margin.<p>But, we do get what we pay for too, and the lowest price often comes with externalities paid by both the enterprise and its customers too.<p>Sometimes I see this all framed as a luxury.  That is just as much of an error, and does come with unnecessary costs and or poor alignment with actual value.')
