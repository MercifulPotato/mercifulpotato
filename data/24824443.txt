And like comments, they stagnate while the code they reference evolves.<p>Someone else reading this code in a few years time will need to look into the definitions of each of those method calls in order to understand the code, because names can&#x27;t be trusted. All the more so with instance methods, as they may access arbitrary instance state to do their work, so that non-local (to the calling point) state may influence meaning.<p>Single use small methods need to justify their existence to avoid being inlined; they need a smidgen more purpose than a comment, or they hurt readability long term more than they help.')
