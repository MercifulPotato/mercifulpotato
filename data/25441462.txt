Make sure the metal case is earthed, and the case is the only point where earth and internal grounds are connected.<p>Far field emissions rarely comes from pcb traces though. Memory (high speed) buses use amps of current on each transitions, and the return current create a significant (few mV) voltage drop on the internal ground and power planes. This results an AC voltage difference at the opposite ends of the bus on the same plane.<p>Take a look at the Raspberry Pi 3: it has a power usb connector at one corner, and the USB A connectors at the opposite corner. The memory&#x2F;cpu are inbetween. The shields of these connectors are connected, and are connected to the internal ground. When the device is operating, there is likely some switching noise between them. When you connect a USB cable, the shielding on that cable and the shielding in the power cable may act as a dipole antenna. This is the most likely source of emissions, and the metal casing does little to nothing to prevent it.')
