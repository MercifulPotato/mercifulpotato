It&#x27;s great that she landed a job. At the same time, it&#x27;s hard to not think about how many other folks won&#x27;t have the same happy chance of circumstances.<p>When I was 19 I went to federal prison for computer-related crimes. After I was released I tried getting &quot;normal&quot; jobs - Dominos, McDonalds, etc, but had less than stellar luck on that front. I started my own thing doing affiliate marketing and made enough to pay bill. Thankfully this was before I had a family.<p>Now I&#x27;ve been in the consulting and contracting space for  years, worked with&#x2F;at Fortune 10 companies, HIPAA and PCI regulated shops too. Recently, after a failed start up, I needed to get a &quot;real&quot; job. After the first two offers were pulled back, I changed my interview tactics.<p>Now, on the very first phone call with a human, I bring up my nearly 20 year old conviction. It&#x27;s never come up on a background check due to how the vast majority of commercial background checks work. My name, however, is quite unique and news articles are still some top ranking sites about me.<p>One of my pie-in-the-sky goals is to try my hand at another start up, and in the process build out a program to train other felons with how to program. With all the folks I&#x27;ve been around throughout my career, some of the smartest of them were people I met in prison. There&#x27;s so much wasted talent there.')
