Your loan of $3.50 might really mean something to the peasant who receives it. But it means nothing to you, and so microloans end up with no one vetting the borrower for creditworthiness or hassling them to collect. This incentive mismatch ends up spoiling the project; there&#x27;s no reason for someone not to take out a microloan, drink the money away, and default.<p>There&#x27;s a similar problem with your idea. You could buy a stretch of land in Brazil and bask in the glow of taking it off the market. But the problem you perceive with overuse of the Brazilian rainforest wouldn&#x27;t be solved; that land was mostly not on the market anyway. How would you stop farmers from encroaching on your land? A &quot;No Trespassing&quot; sign won&#x27;t do the job.<p>Buying land to prevent development will work better in the US, mostly because there&#x27;s no one in the US who lives off the land. You can&#x27;t stop small farmers from moving on to your unsupervised land. But you can easily stop giant logging or mining companies from doing it.')
