There is no switch career button. You just have to put in the hours to grow as a developer. You will spend the rest of your thirties just catching up with your peers. It&#x27;s for you to decide whether you have the patience to do that persistently.<p>Second, like any other white collar job, your earning potential is heavily backloaded. An early career software developer doesn&#x27;t really make a lot of money. Even assuming that you are good, you well be well into your forties before you start making the big bucks. In the meantime, you&#x27;ll be earning significantly less than your peers.<p>Third, you could really screw up your WLB if you don&#x27;t choose your employer right. People with non-traditional background often end up in terrible companies which use developers as expendable labor in stead of investing in their growth.<p>I highly recommend that you explore opportunities in software development, but be aware of the challenges.')
