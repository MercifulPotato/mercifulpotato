I think you&#x27;re generalizing an argument that wasn&#x27;t intended to be so. Here it is for ease:<p>&gt; Or the creator of Roko&#x27;s Baselisk openly stating recently on twitter that he wants &quot;Traditional Futurism&quot; (&quot;Traditional&quot; being a traditional (heh) dogwhistle for the alt-right [rational wiki article to dog whistles])<p>My post was talking about a very specific group of people (The Less Wrong community, and the Neo-Reactionary movement -- although in recent years Rationalist organizations and magazines like New Humanist have distanced themselves and placed themselves in opposition to those communities), and in the case of that specific quote I think it is clear that I was talking about the meaning of &quot;Traditional&quot; in the context of those tweets.<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a valid or accurate argument to generalize my call-out of the word &quot;traditional&quot;, within that to suddenly be about every single usage, ever, of the word &quot;traditional&quot; -- and in the process completely ignore the associations and context of that word.<p>Perhaps if I had known in advance that it would be mislead, I would have written:<p>&gt; &quot;Traditional&quot; in this case being a common dogwhistle used in neo-reactionary and pseudo-rationalist circles.<p>In addition, the point of dog whistles (if you read the Rational Wiki article) is that it is a signal that people outside of the culture will easily dismiss, or think benign. There is a reason that the Traditional Values Coalition[0] is called that, or the Traditional Britain Group[1] is named so. And likewise there is a reason that a major money fund in the anti-abortion movement is called &quot;Focus on the Family&quot;[2].<p>The point of using them is that they are brushed off, pushed aside, or excused in exactly the same way you are doing, by well-meaning folks who are not present in those cultures.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rationalwiki.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Traditional_Values_Coalition" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rationalwiki.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Traditional_Values_Coalition</a><p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rationalwiki.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Traditional_Britain_Group" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rationalwiki.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Traditional_Britain_Group</a><p>[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rationalwiki.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Focus_on_the_Family" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rationalwiki.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Focus_on_the_Family</a>')
