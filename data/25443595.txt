But they are too large or your administrator won&#x27;t let you transfer the files by email at all. ZendTo to the rescue!<p>Why ZendTo?<p>ZendTo is a completely free web-based system, which you can run on your own server with complete safety and security. It runs from any Linux &#x2F; Unix server or virtualisation system, there is no size limit and it will send files 50% faster than by email.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;zend.to&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;zend.to&#x2F;</a>')
