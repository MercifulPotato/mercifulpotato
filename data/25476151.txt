Like, how hard can it be to reimplement a system which you already had in the game before. Wouldn&#x27;t a game source code for a system like AI be orthogonal to the rest of the game code and easier to just port over to a new game. I cannot believe a game like Cyberpunk 2077 can not have driving AI in a 2020 game. It&#x27;s been done already with various success rates in 100s of games. How badly do you have to mismanage to have nothing after 5 years of development??<p>Assassins Creed Valhalla crashes for me every 15 minutes on rx480. I get that a game would lag, but how the hell can it crash? You have exceptions which you cannot handle on any layer of your code? The game lags when the map is open. What is happening in then code for the game to lag when a world map is open? And it doesn&#x27;t stop lagging as if it&#x27;s finished with calculating something unrelated. It just lags')
