There <i>is</i> a way to objectively measure your spiritual superiority, and that&#x27;s to examine the person and where they are, and what direction they are going- wrt their behavior. What are their qualities? Patient? Honest? Hard-working? Organized? Reliable? Easy-going? Empathic? Insightful? Generous? Good judgement? I think that you can&#x27;t be all of those things (all of which require emotional&#x2F;reactive control) without your spirituality (and physicality, it must be said) being in good order. And this is all observable.')
