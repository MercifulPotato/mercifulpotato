Disclaimer: I&#x27;ve only scrolled through it, but the code snippets are all small. It does show an admirable amount of Rust&#x27;s syntax, but it&#x27;s not very discoverable, whereas the book is reasonably well structured (although not for novices, who have forgotten a specific term). The link also doesn&#x27;t deal with larger programs: there&#x27;s not an Rc&lt;T&gt; on the page, let alone something like an Arena and unsafe code, and it&#x27;s really necessary for complex programs.<p>So, IMO: not better than the Rust book. It gives a first glance of Rust, something to accustom the eyes to a different syntax, but sidesteps the difficult bits, which can make transitioning so frustrating.')
