They use stopping as a default mitigation strategy when something unpredictable happens - this isn’t always a good solution especially when suddenly blocking transit (Crosswalks, bike paths, railways, traffic) instead of just crossing it.  This is a failure case humans can get cited for - I hit a car in the bike lane once when they did a left turn in front of me and it was legally the driver’s fault for blocking that path.<p>It is just another characteristic they need to figure out in a complex problem.')
