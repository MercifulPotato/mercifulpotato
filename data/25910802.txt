I don&#x27;t agree this is a goal. I&#x27;m not interested in a reduction of subjectivity in journalism. I&#x27;m interested in an increase in factual, expansive, multi-viewpoint reporting and analysis. If that comes with 3% journalistic opinion (whatever that means) or 83%, I&#x27;m fine with it.<p>What&#x27;s not ok is journalistic subjectivity filling in for factual, expansive, multi-viewpoint reporting. However, there are plenty of journalists who are clearly capable of avoiding this issue.')
