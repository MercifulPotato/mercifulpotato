Maybe even faster than children, since adults have more context to bind and commit new information to long-term memory.<p>As a kid, memorizing vocabulary words was a brute force task because I had no relevant context (Latin&#x2F;Greek, history, etc), but now I can pick up words, even foreign words pretty quickly because I have &quot;hooks&quot; in my mind to which I can attach them.')
