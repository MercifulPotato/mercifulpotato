Unions is often the subject but the damaged done to their reputation in the U.S. is irreversible. No highly paid professional wants to even talk about it.<p>With unions, an employee being treated unfairly has a place to complain. A place that will actually listen and side with her instead of the corporation. But non-union employees often think that HR is the exact equivalent. Unfortunately they almost always learned the hard way (me included).<p>If we want to make any dent in the system, HR is the place we want to reform.<p>The idea that I have started proposing is of a public HR. An hr department that reports back to the state government. The government may not be perfect, but it has a better record when it comes to employee protection.<p>Edit: previous discussion for more context <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25795851" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25795851</a>')
