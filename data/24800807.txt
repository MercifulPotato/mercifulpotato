We thought it would be a force for good and allow people to connect and talk.<p>What we as geeks actually invented were a bunch of brain washing machines that profit by selling the minds of their &quot;users&quot;.<p>I have an opinion about whether or not there was bias, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as important as the bigger question this story brings up.<p>We now, in this thread are fighting about how the brain washing machines are being used, instead of the IMHO, the more important topic of, how can we turn off the brain washing machines and put the genie back in the bottle?')
