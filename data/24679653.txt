I never had many friends in secondary school and my mom was always working, and I didn&#x27;t want to wander around town getting into trouble so I spent my teenage years alone working at the computer learning to sysadmin stuff.  I&#x27;m in uni now doing a compsci degree so I guess it all worked out right?  Still don&#x27;t know what there is for me in the fog of the future but hopefully when it clears I will bask in the light of the sun.')
