I&#x27;ve worked on a similar problem, giving users the tools they need to explore extremely large, dense connected graphs. When you go-to-definition, then show-references, then go to a usage from the first file, you don&#x27;t go back. You continue forward to the next column, even though the fourth column is identical to the first. The columnar navigation guides you towards tree-like exploration, which is necessary because the actual web of relationships is impossible to effectively visualize all at once. Trees make it manageable.<p>&gt; some panes may be just intermediaries you used to find the semantic units you were interested in.<p>That&#x27;s true, which is why dragging panes is important. You can explore down a path, find the pane you&#x27;re interested in, drag it over to the second column, then delete the cruft in one step. The problem with it now is that once you find the pane you like, you have to go back and manually delete every single node that you don&#x27;t care about.')
