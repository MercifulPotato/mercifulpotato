When somebody has adopted a irrational position on something, it&#x27;s not always possible to reason them out of it - especially when reason wasn&#x27;t the primary factor in adopting that position in the first place. People often believe in things because they have emotional ties to it, or because they think it&#x27;s just part of their self identify.<p>The real question is how to do we stop everyone else from piling on top of these people and turning them into high visibility punching bags (which in turn propagates the bad information further and actually makes some folks more sympathetic to the people who now appear to be bullying victims). And that&#x27;s not a question of intelligence, but one of morals and ethics.')
