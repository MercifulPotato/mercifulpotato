Let me explain why:<p>Most of the people in my extended family are right-wing Republican Mormons.<p>They believe that anything that could be labeled &quot;socialism&quot; is literally evil, and will literally lead to the &quot;destruction&quot; of our country, because Eisenhower&#x27;s Secretary of Agriculture said so, and they literally believe that man was a prophet of God.<p>I&#x27;m not exaggerating here.<p>A significant portion of these people get their news from Rush Limbaugh, Tucker Carlson, and Glen Beck. They might be a little wrong once in a while, but for the most part, these are &quot;smart men&quot; who &quot;know what&#x27;s going on behind the curtain&quot;.<p>A significant portion of those people actually believe QAnon. Hell, we have <i>congresspeople</i> who believe that conspiracy theory.<p>So how did they get there?<p>They are in a cult. I&#x27;m not going to pull any punches: Mormonism is thoroughly falsifiable. It insulates its members from the faith-destroying facts about its history.<p>Cults work. The belief these people have is so deeply heartfelt that they refuse to even <i>consider</i> the possibility they might be wrong.<p>Cult members have a <i>lot</i> of practice. If they can ignore reality to preserve their religious faith, they can reject reality to defend their political ideology.<p>Cult members are vulnerable. Anyone who convinces a cult member that they promote the cult can manipulate most cult members into supporting them.<p>I know my perspective is only a small part of America, but everything I know about Trump&#x27;s political base has the same hallmarks. Cults are not a small or isolated problem in America.<p>I have tried to appeal to them with the overtly socialist agenda of New Testament Jesus. That simply isn&#x27;t the deity they worship. Most American Christians worship Supply Side Jesus. Conservatism has become a deep-rooted part of their personal ideology.<p>There are no underlying facts. There is instead underlying fiction. There is no reasoning these people out of their delusion.')
