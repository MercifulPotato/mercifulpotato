Item(by='kergonath', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608164450, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25445898, text='Compared to CentOS, it is really easy to use common desktop environments. I can’t say about very niche ones, but I use XFCE, which works well out of the box. YaST is the convenient GUI where settings and some common tools are located. It is more than adequate: not perfect but much better than a myriad of small setup programs or the abomination that is whatever Windows does. The package manager (zypper in the command-line, or a YaST module for the GUI) is a bit different but not revolutionary and still RPM-based.<p>Compared to Ubuntu, it tends to be more conservative and better tested on server or workstation hardware. What finally drove me away from Ubuntu was a very painful episode when the SAS driver would freeze randomly about 4 times out of 10 when loading. It is also far less opinionated than Canonical regarding which desktop you should use. The main drawback is that OpenSUSE Leap is supported for 2 years, so no equivalent to Ubuntu’s LTS releases.<p>OpenSUSE also uses systemd, but this should not be a shock for someone coming from Red Hat. It works decently with nVidia’s proprietary driver. Well, as decently as this garbage can run, anyway. I haven’t tested Wayland, as AFAIK XFCE still requires X.')
