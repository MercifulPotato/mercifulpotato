Anything documentable will be kept to semi-acceptable levels.  The true (daily) abuse comes when they return to the classroom.  These folks need to prepare for some bullying.<p>Most teachers defying the union on this will not make it more than another year in that district once classrooms return would be my uninformed bet.  It will be a mission of every other union member at each school to make their everyday existence a living hell.<p>Yes, I have very poor taste in my mouth when it comes to my experiences with unions.  I certainly recognize what they&#x27;ve accomplished and could still accomplish; but until they stop existing as corrupt rackets to protect the lowest common denominator employee they are going to be a hard sell to much of the US who has dealt with such creatures.')
