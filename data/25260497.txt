(If you&#x27;re familiar with Java, Instants and Durations). Time references cannot be added nor subtracted, but you can add a time duration to a time reference (midnight + 45 minutes = 12:45 AM of the same day) and the difference of two absolute time references is well-defined, unique and is a duration (1 AM - 12 AM = 1 hour). Furthermore, durations satisfy the axioms of a vector space (trivially, just pick a canonical unit, e.g. 1 second, and measure everything as a multiple&#x2F;fraction of that).<p>The same holds with temperatures, with the unfortunate difference that we use the same notation for differences in temperatures (vectors of the affine space) and temperature references (base set of the affine space). For example, you can&#x27;t add 18 celsius and 20 celsius, but saying that the temperature of a room increased by 2 celsius is meaningful, because &quot;+2 celsius&quot; is actually a vector. You can also add vectors to points, if the temperature increased by 2 more celsius, it would be 22 celsius. This does even have a physical meaning, and is independent of the frame of reference you pick for temperatures: a difference of 2 celsius is the same as a difference of 2 kelvin. (the same reasoning holds when replacing &quot;celsius&quot; with &quot;fahrenheit&quot; and &quot;kelvin&quot; with &quot;rankine&quot;). It is equally easy to verify temperature differences satisfy the axioms of a vector space, with the same argument as before.')
