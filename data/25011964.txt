Luckily, this is a field which highly rewards specialization. They don&#x27;t need the breadth if they have depth in their particular areas.<p>My experience has been that in the vast majority of applied roles involving AI, there is not enough emphasis on the software engineering skills necessary for productizing the models, leading to situations like baron_harkonnens critique.')
