And Tesla has made some wild promises that they&#x27;ve taken payment for, but I really doubt they can fulfill.<p>That being said, one thing that I like about my spouses Tesla is that it reliably gets OTA updates that adds features and improves functionality. For example, they recently added a video feed from the blind spot cameras when I&#x27;m in reverse. I&#x27;m not sure of any other car brand that would do that. My experience with other brands is that, best case scenario, it would take a trip to the dealership and hundreds of dollars to add a feature like that. More likely they&#x27;d try to upsell me on a 2021 model. Meanwhile the Tesla adds that stuff on a regular cadence while I sleep.<p>I&#x27;d bet the 2018 Tesla they tested would perform competitively with todays models. And in two more years the 2018 model will compete well against 2022 models. CR shouldn&#x27;t speculate this way but it&#x27;s probably worth consideration if you&#x27;re looking for a new car.')
