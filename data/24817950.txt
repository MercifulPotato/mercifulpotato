Instead we’re seeing CPU designers go down the path of multiple different sized cores, with different speeds and power consumption.<p>So in this world more “efficient” task can be run on slower lower powered cores. Stuff that needs to happen as quick as possible is don’t on faster, higher powered cores.<p>When you can, you just turn off the bigger cores completely.<p>I don’t have benchmarks, but there must be some good power savings in it if ARM have built their BIG.little architecture around it, and Apple followed suit with their  processors.')
