There are private hospitals in the UK for example.<p>Single payer is about removing insurance companies from the process (saving money), standardising care (saving money, improving outcomes), collective bargaining for drugs (saving money), providing a base level of care to all (saving money and improving QOL). But it doesn&#x27;t usually forbid spending money on private care.<p>As a result single payer results in similar outcomes for vastly less public money, and almost zero private money spent on healthcare.')
