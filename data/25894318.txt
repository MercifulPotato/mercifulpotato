The hall monitor would check for well polished shoes(white canvas shoes on mondays, black leather&#x2F;faux leather rest of the days. The faux leather was a religious exemption, but they didn’t care as long as the girls wore Mary Jane type shoes. Boys had a different design), nails(no long untrimmed nails or polish).<p>Having said that..we had free rein over hair. As long as it was not loose and plaited neatly, any style is fine. We could wear flowers in our hair and earrings as this was in India and there were social&#x2F;cultural&#x2F;religious reasons for girls wearing jewelery, flowers and even henna on our hands.<p>Also: Fridays were non uniform days for grades 5 and lower. And you can wear anything you want on your birthday..all grades.<p>We still had to march to class and up the stairs from daily outdoor morning assembly(20-30 minutes or so) everyday to the music of a band! Prayer, reading of daily news, thought of the day, school announcements, school sports team announcements and national anthem before dispersing in ‘an orderly fashion’. And by that, I mean..we had to march to class in a line(class lines were in height order)<p>When I tell this to kids these days, they think I am pulling their legs. And I thought my school was being strict!!')
