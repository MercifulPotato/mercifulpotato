WTF!)<p>This is google forcing them to up their game if they want to keep playing.<p>Will google keep doing this? Probably not (IMO).  Rather, it&#x27;s likely just a demonstration of &quot;Hey, we don&#x27;t need you, so straighten up!&quot;<p>That being said, if Qualcomm ignores them (since Pixel isn&#x27;t a major player in the phone market) google may keep producing their own chips.<p>Another interesting aspect here is that Google may decide that they don&#x27;t want to keep paying for the ARM licenses.  This is an avenue for them to start getting RISC-V as a first class Android citizen.')
