The 777 was the harbinger of their doom, as it brought ETOPS with it.<p>Somewhat tangentially, there is a (strong) argument that twin-engine aircraft are actually safer than three or four engine aircraft. First, they are at lower risk of having an engine problem (as they have fewer engines). Second, the requirements all focus on having sufficient performance with a single engine out, which means that a twin engine aircraft normally has at least 200% of the power required to keep it aloft, whereas the four-engine aircraft only has 133% of what it needs. Given that many problems can be solved with a sufficient application of power, the twin-engine airplane is actually at an advantage!<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;ETOPS" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;ETOPS</a>')
