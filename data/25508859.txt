See WA and the Olympic committee&#x27;s rules[0][1]<p>So yeah, not a transmedicalist, just we have existing frameworks for how to balance inclusion and fairness; there&#x27;s no open question that needs debate around how trans people can compete in sports (unless you get all your cues from South Park i suppose).  The only real debate is around what the levels should be and how to avoid retroactively excluding cis women with hyperandrogenism or related conditions.<p>Also just as an aside, like a lot of hypotheticals that get forced onto trans people, there isn&#x27;t any evidence of this being an issue. Trans people just want to live their lives, medicinally transition if necessary, and exist as regular people. The number of people who both chose not to hormonally transition, and are competing in some kind of sporting event where that matters is small enough to be humanly addressed case by case (if there are any at all).<p>[0]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.worldathletics.org&#x2F;news&#x2F;press-release&#x2F;questions-answers-iaaf-female-eligibility-reg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.worldathletics.org&#x2F;news&#x2F;press-release&#x2F;questions-...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stillmed.olympic.org&#x2F;Documents&#x2F;Commissions_PDFfiles&#x2F;Medical_commission&#x2F;2015-11_ioc_consensus_meeting_on_sex_reassignment_and_hyperandrogenism-en.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stillmed.olympic.org&#x2F;Documents&#x2F;Commissions_PDFfiles&#x2F;...</a>')
