This strikes me as similar, potentially.  For those that weren&#x27;t around back in 2008, if memory serves CDPR earned a lot of good faith in the video game community by investing heavily into making an already released game (The Witcher) much, much better, and then releasing it for free to anyone who bought the original.<p>I know that AMP contains stories about how reviewers were misled, or duped into misleading prospective buyers of the game.  Maybe it&#x27;s true, but I take anything that shows up from AMP with a good pinch of salt.<p>All I&#x27;m trying to say is not to write it off yet.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to be an irrecoverable disaster, not that I have played it or will play it in the next decade, probably.')
