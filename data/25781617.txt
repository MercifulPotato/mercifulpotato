And before you say that the cases are different, my point is that it shouldn&#x27;t be up to Twitter to decide.<p>By supporting Trump&#x27;s ban, we support Twitter to be the arbitrator of free speech.<p>We either have to treat Twitter as a private company, they can do what even the fuck they want, and hence we shouldn&#x27;t have any saying, or treat it a public utility in which case only a judge can decided who gets banned and who doesn&#x27;t<p>We cannot have it both ways, based on what we thing suits better our believes at the time.')
