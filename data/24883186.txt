So instead of learning how to do proofs <i>while also</i> learning real analysis, I think its better to learn the basic proof skills in the context math you are fluent with i.e. basic algebra and basic number theory (e.g. what integers divide easily into another integer). The books by Hammack and Chartrand do that well I think, see elsewhere in this discussion for more info.')
