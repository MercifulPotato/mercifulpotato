The protein just doesn&#x27;t have the virus attached. It&#x27;s like having a factory manufacturing car door handles but no cars.<p>Things could go wrong, mostly because some folks may have allergic reactions, autoimmune flare ups, or the increased immune response can cause side effects like Bell&#x27;s palsy. That said, mRNA breaks down quickly on its own, and the spike proteins will be cleaned up quickly. The odds of a serious complication are very, very, very, very low from the studies performed so far. (Expect some flu like symptoms, however, as your body fights the cells with the modified RNA.)<p>I&#x27;m a total layperson here, just synthesizing what I&#x27;ve read.')
