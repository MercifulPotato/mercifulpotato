With 25% - 50% depth of discharge (i.e. charging and discharging between 50%-75% and 100% of capacity), the degradation is minimal.\nYou might not be able to keep your battery in this range while driving long distances but for commuting it&#x27;s certainly possible and - now the good part - it&#x27;s definitely possible when the car is plugged in. That means it can support the grid (&quot;vehicle to grid&quot;) without having severe long term effects on the range of the car.')
