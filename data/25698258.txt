It is very much illegal, and includes direct threats and incitement to violence among many other things.  This includes, for example, calls to murder politicians, the police, etc.<p>Parler has further affirmatively stated they will <i>not</i> remove that material despite having the ability to do so.  In this way Parler distinguishes itself from Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, and so forth.<p>That is, of course, their choice.  However, a failure to moderate this kind of material violates Google&#x27;s ToS.<p>It is therefore also Google&#x27;s and Apple&#x27;s choice to enforce their ToS and remove the Parler app from their store.<p>In no way does this represent censorship (neither Google nor Apple are in any way obligated to distribute third party software), nor does the offending content represent legal speech.')
