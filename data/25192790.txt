I&#x27;d hate to see a commercial company displace LE, but there are so many value adds that can be sold once you&#x27;re the CA of choice that it seems inevitable that a commercial CA with a LE style free tier is going to have a lot of opportunity.<p>IMO the biggest, easiest feature no CA has implemented is CTLog monitoring &#x2F; reconciliation.  The problem I have with LE even on a small scale is that I&#x27;m grabbing certificates for ~20 (sub)domains.  I also have several of them set up via Cloudflare.  With CTLog monitoring notifications (via Cloudflare and Facebook), I get too many notifications.  I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s coming or going or which machines are requesting certificates for which (sub)domains.<p>A service like ZeroSSL is already acting like a central point of certificate management (for me), so it&#x27;s the ideal location to do CTLog monitoring since the bulk of certificate issuances happen there.  That means legitimate CTLog entries can be reconciled and ignored silently (they&#x27;ll already show up in the dashboard).<p>I&#x27;m not sure how user accounts work in ACME, but the other thing I&#x27;d like is to be able to track which user or machine requested a certificate.<p>I&#x27;m sure something like that could also be built as a proxy.  I thought about trying once, but it&#x27;s firmly in my &quot;things I&#x27;ll never get to&quot; idea box.  Lol.<p>Another problem I&#x27;ve had with LE that could use a solution is a 3rd party service that I signed up for requesting certificates, but not installing them correctly and hitting the LE limits for that domain.  If the mindshare changes from LE to ACME, maybe there&#x27;ll be a day where 3rd parties will let me specify an ACME provider and link it to my main account somehow.')
