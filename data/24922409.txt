I&#x27;ve personally had no issues with the lane tracing as I instinctively understand where the system works and where it doesn&#x27;t and I&#x27;ve adapted my driving as such. The buttons for the controls are situated on the steering wheel and are simple to understand and easy to activate. Accelerating doesn&#x27;t disable the lane trace assist or adaptive cruise control. The system also doesn&#x27;t get confused with other lines on the road, bright sun light, glare, wet roads or driving at night. My only gripe is that the speed sign recognition system is a pain in cities where signs for side roads point wrongly to the main road but thankfully the speed of the adaptive cruise control isn&#x27;t limited by it just an annoying beep that you can switch off if required.<p>Toyota do give a warning not to use the adaptive cruise control behind a tilt and slide recovery truck, or a lorry trailer that is higher than the car itself however I haven&#x27;t found any issues with that.<p>The settings for the lane tracing can be adjusted to change the sensitivity to which it responds to the drivers turning force. I find that warning you with different beeps for different things is a pretty good system and I can easily tell the difference between the different beeps and what they&#x27;re for (even with loud audio blaring through my speakers).<p>Comparisons like these need to use the findings of drivers who actually use these systems in real life rather than made up scenarios.<p>Unrelated, (but adding this after seeing those who are in the market for a new car), it is a sporty, nice and fun to drive car, 2 litre hybrid with 200nm torque from each engine and a combined bhp of 186 (could be ~300 if remapped but you&#x27;ll lose linear acceleration) with good mpg, MacPherson suspension at the front, and multi linked individual suspension at the back, lower centre of gravity and 52.5:47.5 weight distribution for better cornering. In relation to the &quot;self-driving&quot; the system takes a little learning, but once you understand it and are used to it, there&#x27;s no going back to conventional cars.')
