From a purely economic perspective, a kitchen at home, when other sources of food are widely available, is tough to justify. From a wider point of view, a kitchen is easier to justify as a nice luxury, being that cooking at home is something that people enjoy doing. When land is cheap, it is a luxury that can be afforded. When land is expensive, it is not surprising that it&#x27;s the first thing to go. Similar to why people are likely to maintain a garden at home when land is cheap, but not when land is expensive.')
