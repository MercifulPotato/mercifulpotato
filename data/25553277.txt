It’s entirely possible for both parties to be bankrupt and awful, just dishonestly maneuvering however they can to take power.<p>The only real check on power of from bottom-up accountability to one’s constituents, which the two party system in the US makes more difficult and has otherwise been almost entirely eroded by elections being private (vs. publicly) funded. Primaries are one of the few remaining vestiges of accountability in American democracy and have been used successfully by both the left and right to enforce it.')
