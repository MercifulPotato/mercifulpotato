Item(by='jrochkind1', descendants=None, kids=[25188566, 25188349], score=None, time=1606145711, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25187511, text='I do ruby&#x2F;Rails and not Python, so it may differ.<p>But while I too had in my head &quot;for web dev most of the real work happens in a database of some flavor&quot;, I recently realized that was <i>not</i> true for my app, probably hadn&#x27;t been true for some time, and probably isn&#x27;t true of most Rails apps (possibly not the same for non-Rails web apps?).  If you&#x27;ve properly eliminated n+1 queries and other inefficient querying, I find that my apps are spending only 20 or 30ms waiting on DB results, and a couple hundred on CPU tasks to render HTML.<p>I know people are going to reply with &quot;That&#x27;s because Rails is slow,&quot; but I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s true for what we&#x27;re talking about compared to similar Python platforms, I&#x27;d be interested in seeing numbers for other real apps. In the Rails community too, people still repeat the assumption &quot;most of your response time is spent waiting on the DB&quot; -- but I dont&#x27; think it&#x27;s actually true anymore (it may have been once).')
