The other day at work I had a pretty heated argument at work with a colleague when I mentioned it is really not good for us to host any of our stuff in America (all of it is currently in America). He basically freaked out about it. I just wanted to hear his thoughts about it, but he took personal offence (he&#x27;s an aws fanboy).<p>There are problems with the laws, copyright laws too, US gov agencies etc that are all incompatible with our own laws. If something bad were to happen, our own courts have zero power to help us. We also don&#x27;t have a direct fiber line to America so all our traffic hops through Europe and more recently through South America, so about 200ms added to most requests.<p>The only reasons to use American hosting companies is because of:<p>1) The financial cost can in some cases work out to be lower than local options.<p>2) It can be easier to scale your service vs self-hosting on premisses.<p>3) American hosting platforms have really nice GUI&#x27;s and tooling, while being well integrated with the billing side - everything mostly just works as expected.<p>But other than that, if money and skills are not a problem, then on-prem is best here.')
