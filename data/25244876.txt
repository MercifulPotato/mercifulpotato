Some automated cleanup could result in unexpected file deletions from &quot;public&#x2F;&quot; (or, more specifically, the creation of dangling symlinks). However, this might be a use case for a hard link if you need the file in both places and both directories are on the same filesystem. Though I haven&#x27;t thought about the implications of a hard link in this case enough so far.')
