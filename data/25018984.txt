Nobody really disputes this.</i><p>I&#x27;d argue against Trump being an incompetent fascist. That&#x27;s still giving him too much credit.<p>He&#x27;s authoritarian, a narcissist, views the world through a zero-sum transactional lens, doesn&#x27;t see anything wrong with cronyism or nepotism, and as far as he&#x27;s concerned you&#x27;re either with him or against him.<p>Some of that has certainly allowed fascistic people to accrete around him, and enact policies that are fascistic, but as far as I can tell, that&#x27;s only because the lowest hanging fruit and the clearest path to avoiding blame was in removing restraints and checks and balances. IOW writing (and reading) and passing regulations is hard, removing or ignoring them is comparatively easy.<p>If it were easier to avoid blame,  punish enemies, line his pockets, and put his stamp on things by nationalizing industries, he&#x27;d have been doing that instead.<p>And I wouldn&#x27;t quite rule anything out as an attempt at some kind of &quot;grand bargain&quot; before he leaves office if he decides he wants to punish the GOP.')
