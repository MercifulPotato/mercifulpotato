For that purpose it&#x27;s not a matter of deducing what they are, but recognizing them in the expression, and spotting the opportunity to use the identity on the path to eliminating terms.<p>For that purpose one needs to have them memorized in order to spot the opportunity -on the carefully derived homework problem- in the wild.')
