The iPod Nano was my first iPod, I miss when it looked similar in style to the Classic. It&#x27;s a shame cause they were highly reliable devices as long as they didn&#x27;t die out of course, but you would rarely run into issues with them.<p>The iPod Nano was the first iPod I could convince my mom to buy me because it was cheaper.')
