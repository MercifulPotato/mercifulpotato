It&#x27;s almost like an Orwellian <i>&quot;Four legs good. Two legs bad!&quot;</i> attitude exists towards China these days. It seems the media is only interested in stories, no matter how trivial, that paint the country in a negative light.<p>Shame. I&#x27;d love to have read more about this technically pioneering mission. But, not being a Chinese speaker, I guess I&#x27;ll have to wait until NASA or Elon Musk carry out a similar feat. At which point, no doubt, there will be fawning wall-to-wall coverage in the Western press.')
