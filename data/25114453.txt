Might be a different issue than the bricking mentioned yesterday. All my apps were still running. Launchpad and mission control functioned but brought me back to the black screen if I tried to launch an app. I got out of it by using mission control to open a second desktop environment, then re-opening the original desktop. After restarting I have not experienced the issue since.')
