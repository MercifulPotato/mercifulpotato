I bought the Nest Secure system a few years ago because I already had Nest thermostats and cameras, so security made sense and everything integrated well.<p>But now I really regret it. I have a 3 year deal w&#x2F; Google&#x27;s partner for Nest Secure, and I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised once those 3 years are up that they&#x27;ll sunset the device completely.<p>So disappointed in Google.')
