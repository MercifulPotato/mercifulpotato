When you create an asset pipeline for an open world game, you depend on two things: the camera and character movement speed. Character angle and distance determines how well will assets look to the player, and how detailed they should be. Character speed determines how fast you need to load different assets in the background. As far as I know, all games that have both first-person camera and vehicle movement, like Far Cry, have much simpler art style and a less dense world.<p>(Disclaimer: although I have worked in game development for almost 14 years, I have never worked on a AAA project, so I really don&#x27;t know how qualified am I to talk about).')
