Being sympathetic I would say that because the Node JS Installer makes the assumption that you know what the PATH environment variable is and you know how directories work.<p>Why do I need to fire up the terminal? Your OS doesn&#x27;t do things via GUI like you do, so you need to validate that what it needs is available in the manner it will use.<p>Too damn hard and too opaque.? How did you learn that Node js was even a thing? You weren&#x27;t born with the knowledge and everything has a learning curve to it, very few things are truly easy to do starting at the very bottom.<p>I agree that things need documentation and onboarding. I think we can view the Node js docs similar to a shop manual at a auto repair shop - it will expect you to know what tools are what and how to do certain things.')
