Even the most optimistic approaches for confining such light to small areas, plasmonics, can only realistically give you something like a 10-fold size reduction, putting you at tens of nanometers. The transistors and wires in advanced process nodes have been smaller than that for quite some time, now.<p>Moore&#x27;s Law is about density. Photon gates cannot compete with electron gates in terms of density.')
