Anytime you were after catfish, you&#x27;d occasionally catch them. They&#x27;re quite tasty! I can definitely see why they&#x27;d be considered valuable.<p>Sadly, they&#x27;re a lot more rare now. I don&#x27;t recall the last time I saw one... It&#x27;s probably been 20 years... From what I understand, the American eel population started coming under intense commercial fishing pressure in the 90&#x27;s and especially after 2011, when the tsunami from the Tohoku earthquake essentially wiped out the Japanese commercial eel fishing industry. Couple that with the KY lake dam we&#x27;re behind, and a lot fewer make it into the rivers at home. (The dam does have locks and fish ladders, but it&#x27;s a significant barrier.)<p>It was always wild to me to see them and know it was a fish that had migrated from the Atlantic ocean, into the gulf, up the Mississippi, around a large dam, and made it to middle TN.')
