Just zoom in on a chart and pretend that it is summer 2017 with no future price history available, just like all the traders at the time had.<p>Regarding &quot;penny asset&quot; again, in price 3 years ago and 6 years ago Bitcoin would have been hundreds of dollars, which is not like penny assets, and even if comparing &quot;penny stocks&quot; to a digital commodity the marketcap of bitcoin 3 even 6 years ago would be greater than 99.9% of anything in the penny stock markets (bulletin boards, pink sheets), of which - of course - commodities and commodities derivative do not trade on.<p>You speak in hyperbole for emphasis and that&#x27;s generally fine, but that only works if you know what you are talking about and it is pretty clear you just conflate concepts over and over again.<p>Its fine if you personally don&#x27;t want to or don&#x27;t have the risk profile to be in this market, yes you are missing a lot of alpha from sitting on the sidelines.
