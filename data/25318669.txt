It doesn&#x27;t require fire protection, it doesnt add children to the education system, it doesn&#x27;t use any municipal resources. If it&#x27;s an eyesore or presents a hazard in some way, sure, but simply being vacant or &quot;underutilized&quot; doesn&#x27;t do that. Why should it pay to simply exist?')
