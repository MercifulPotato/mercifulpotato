Scammers love this. They install the bogus battery, click through the warning, then when they show you you are screwed.<p>Like I said above, once every boot is fine, this is what my Dell Laptop does when I plug a non standard charger for example.<p>&gt; Why can&#x27;t apple disable features, like battery life indication, for batteries they haven&#x27;t profiled for the service? This is what makes users trust apple, if your phone says battery life is 80%, you can be pretty sure it is 80%.<p>No, this is not for &quot;trust&quot;, this is only for greed since without competition Apple can ask basically any price for changing your smartphone battery.<p>Take an example of iPods, it was also an immensely popular Apple product and it didn&#x27;t have anything like this and still was fine. I don&#x27;t remember anyone saying that &quot;buying an used iPod is untrustworthy&quot;.<p>Actually, the only issue Apple even had with batteries as far as I remember was caused by them, thanks to the feature that slowed iPhones when the battery was not running at sufficient capacity.')
