For diurnal storage (daily charge&#x2F;discharge cycles), hydrogen is indeed inferior to other technologies.<p>But this is not the only storage use case.<p>Other use cases are seasonal storage (particularly important at high latitudes) and backup storage (especially for rare events when it&#x27;s both cloudy and windless over large areas for extended periods).  For those use cases, hydrogen can be much better than things like batteries or compressed air (or flow batteries, or storage in synthetic hydrocarbons).')
