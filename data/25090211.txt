If you still don&#x27;t feel like running, you can just go for a walk instead, but many people will actually <i>want</i> to run after a bit--the bottleneck is getting out the door.<p>It&#x27;s the same for other kinds of exercise. If you&#x27;re dreading lifting weights, start by just doing some sets of really light reps. If you still feel bad, you can just stop after that, but you&#x27;ll probably often find at that point that you actually feel like doing more.<p>Weirdly, I seem to often have my best runs&#x2F;workouts with this approach, when I started out feeling like crap. Motivation is a strange thing.')
