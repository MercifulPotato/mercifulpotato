But the emphasis should be on <i>in the area they grew up in</i>, because in the 21st century we’re seeing a clustering of the economy in a few (predominately coastal) metros. A big part of the problem is that it’s difficult for a 25-year-old to afford to buy a house near their job in San Francisco, not that it’s difficult for them to buy a house near the middle-America suburb they likely grew up in.<p>It’s also worth noting that the median 25 year old doesn’t live in San Francisco or New York. If that’s you, you’re probably in the top 2 quintiles in your age group.<p>All that being said, the inflation-adjusted wealth of the median 25 year old millennial is about equal to the wealth of a 25-year-old Baby Boomer -&gt; <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;ernietedeschi&#x2F;status&#x2F;1308813020425007105" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;ernietedeschi&#x2F;status&#x2F;1308813020425007105</a><p>EDIT: to address the UK home-price-multiplier data<p>This thread breaks it down in the US -&gt; <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;jmhorp&#x2F;status&#x2F;1221828310000271361" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;jmhorp&#x2F;status&#x2F;1221828310000271361</a><p>Outside of a few notorious coastal metros, the multiplier hasn’t changed all that much.')
