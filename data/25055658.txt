I was not.<p>I will elaborate in a bit more detail:<p>Parallels could potentially <i>leverage</i> Rosetta 2 (or another emulator, such as Qemu) to <i>emulate</i> x86 code, not to <i>virtualize</i> it, to enable the execution of x86 VM images on ARM.<p>VMware is perhaps an even better candidate, considering that VMware originally used x86-to-x86 binary translation to support virtualization without VT-x hardware support. Note that Rosetta 2 supports dynamically generated x86 code, such as JIT code generated by JavaScript runtimes in web browsers. I believe execution of x86 plugin code also works.<p>Note also that Qemu can already boot both native and non-native VM images via emulation - I&#x27;ve used it frequently. It&#x27;s much slower than virtualization, but it&#x27;s extremely useful.')
