At best it&#x27;s a slower Uber (drives more timidly and slower) with the potential to be cheaper. So let&#x27;s customers trade time for money. But uber pool already does that and accounts for about 10% of rides - in other words it&#x27;s not a trade off the market demands.<p>I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s the same thing. I don&#x27;t like uber pool because it&#x27;s very unpredictable, not just that it&#x27;s slow. If it were predictably slow, I might use it more.')
