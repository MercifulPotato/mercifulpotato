After initially printing things I found on thingiverse, such as cell phone holders, I started learning to make my own models (mostly from OpenScad).  And that opened up the true utility of 3D printers -- making things that don&#x27;t exist (that I can&#x27;t buy).<p>Recent example -- I got a Husky work table with a router plate insert (to make it a router table).  I have an old Craftsman router.  No one makes router table plates that have holes drilled for this model router.  So I modeled and printed an adapter plate to screw onto the router, with threaded holes matching holes on the table&#x27;s insert plate.<p>A previous example, I needed a plastic ring to hold magnets for a cadence sensor for my E-Bike kit.  The kit came with a magnet ring for a mountain bike, but I have a road bike.  Couldn&#x27;t find anything suitable online for this particular bicycle.  A couple hours of modeling, and 3 hours of printing later, I had the part that I needed.<p>As for plastic waste -- it isn&#x27;t as much as you think.  The slicing software (which converts a model file into gcode) lets you put in a fill percentage.  Default is 15%, and upping it to 35% makes a fairly strong part.  It uses a honeycomb fill pattern, which is strong yet uses minimal material.  I&#x27;m still on my first two 1kg spools of material (and the slow speed of creating something means that you don&#x27;t go through that much filament that fast).<p>Another project was making small clips that I used to mount a piece of plexiglass (from a big box store) over the TV, as protection from the grandkid that we are raising (it is surprising how delicate modern TVs are).<p>So in short, 3D printers are really good for making small parts that you need for various household projects or hobbies, and a $20 spool of filament lasts a long time.  And they get really useful when you design your own &quot;things&quot; to print.')
