Item(by='vitus', descendants=None, kids=[25530692], score=None, time=1608837404, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25530332, text='&gt; You shouldnâ€™t fail by clicking a link sent by an internal email address.<p>I disagree in making this broad of a claim -- insider threats are certainly an issue. And as a sibling commenter points out, email headers are easily spoofed.<p>I&#x27;m not condoning GoDaddy&#x27;s pentest (agreed with everyone else who sees this as a cruel prank), but also, um, why would you click a link if your company is telling you they&#x27;re going to pay you a bonus? Wouldn&#x27;t that just go through payroll as with everything else?<p>edit: it looks like the phishing email provided the bonus as an opt-in? yeah, that ought to raise red flags that it&#x27;s not just being applied across the board, but still, it&#x27;s been a tough year, so people might not think as hard about it.')
