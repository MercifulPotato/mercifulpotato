Because such a framework is illegal under the first amendment. And her statement suggests that the US adopt a more German framework for adjudicating such speech, so that corporations don&#x27;t need to make their own rules.<p>Your claim is that Twitter is &quot;effectively&quot; acting as the government. That&#x27;s not true under a significant amount of law and precedent. (There are cases where private entities are acting as a government, and importantly, trying to use government force to suppress speech, Marsh v.
