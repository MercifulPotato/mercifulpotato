Governments get money by printing it. They get revenue by taxation. They can borrow by issuing debt instruments.<p>That&#x27;s just a path for hyper inflation when no increased production is included. Money is a placeholder for value. If you don&#x27;t create value and print money, the money doesn&#x27;t magically create the stuff that gives it value.<p>It might not ruin a country, but I very much dislike this &quot;whatever, the state can pay&quot; hand-waving that just assumes the products magically appear if you just increase the money supply. There&#x27;s no perpetual money machine, you can&#x27;t just spend a billion as a state and generate 1.2bn in taxes, rinse &amp; repeat.')
