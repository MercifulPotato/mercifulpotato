I pay you $150k per year, you work 20 hours per week, there are no meetings, there are no politics; you&#x27;re assigned work, we collaborate on that work via text, you complete the work, you log off and have a life. Most engineers (including myself) are only worth about 4 hours of actual work per day anyway, so if you can do a weeks worth of work in 20 hours, then so be it. I don&#x27;t need to fill another 4 hours per day with bullshit emails, meetings, or anything else that doesn&#x27;t involve work.')
