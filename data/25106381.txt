IIRC, it could be used as memory or as cache for external memory (which was much slower).<p>If Apple integrates two more memory chips, it&#x27;ll be able to power a pretty solid desktop or laptop.<p>On the performance, Rosetta is most likely doing JIT so that most of the time it&#x27;s running native ARM code.
