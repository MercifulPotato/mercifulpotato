They are ~400. The first year I was worried that the server would collapse or something. Now I assume it is working unless I get many angry emails. (I don&#x27;t remember the last time I had problems, most of the emails are about changes in the available courses and other administrative stuff.)<p>Back to stuffer, you can use the default stuffer or just ignore that stuffers exist at all, unless your site is huge.')
