That&#x27;s pretty warm.  Salt still melts snow at those temperatures.  Even sunlight will melt snow on pavement at -5.  But below around -10&#x2F;-15 salt stops melting ice, vastly increasing the manpower needed to clear roads&#x2F;sidewalks.  Clearing ice at proper winter temperatures requires mechanical means, hammers, if not propane torches.')
