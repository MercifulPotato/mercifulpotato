Item(by='mastazi', descendants=None, kids=[25078240, 25078233, 25080732], score=None, time=1605234953, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25077923, text='&gt; keyboard + trackpad alignment is wonky (it&#x27;s off-center in a lot of cases! How weird is that???)<p>Those are laptops with numeric keypads, the trackpad is still centred relative to the &quot;main area&quot; of the keyboard (the home row and in particular the rest keys - the two keys with a little bump, F and J on a QWERTY) but it is off-centre relative to the body of the laptop due to the presence of the keypad.<p>Macs don&#x27;t have numpads so if you&#x27;ve always used Macs it&#x27;s understandable that you&#x27;re not familiar with this type of layout.<p>In any case that type of placement makes no difference while you are using the laptop, because keys and touchpad are still where they are supposed to be relative to each other.')
