I got a rare B in the course (even though I aced all the tests!) because there was so much busy work I just refused to do it all. I got literally nothing out of the course in terms of understanding (there was neither time to think nor any real direction given) and a year later I couldn&#x27;t even do the work anymore. I ended up picking up Axler.')
