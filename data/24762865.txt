I&#x27;ve decided to move away from themes, and just code simple CSS by hand - so Zola kind of fits that mindset.<p>Hugo definitely has more features. If you think you&#x27;ll want to do some complex hierarchies in your blog&#x2F;site, or want a lot of themes to pick from I&#x27;d go with Hugo.<p>Hopefully that helps!<p>Edit: I think Hugo used to require Pygments (a pip package), but it looks like that&#x27;s no longer the case. If it did that probably nudged me towards Zola too.')
