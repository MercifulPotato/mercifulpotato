All I can think of is CopperheadOS which died because it was company-backed. You could argue CyanogenMod died, though really it&#x27;s still well alive in LineageOS. (and CyanogenMod wasn&#x27;t really privacy-focused)<p>I have a very high respect for all the work that&#x27;s been done on the various GNU&#x2F;Linux mobile distributions, but it&#x27;s still so far away from Android wrt usability...<p>I agree there is something weird about fighting Google with Android, but still it makes perfect sense.<p>From a business or engineering PoV, you want best features for the fastest MVP. Android gives you just that. Actually it goes way beyond, &#x2F;e&#x2F; didn&#x27;t do much of engineering, they mostly re-used what&#x27;s done by the Android FLOSS community. (Honestly I don&#x27;t really like &#x2F;e&#x2F; because they basically don&#x27;t give anything back to the community but well).<p>If &#x2F;e&#x2F; is ever successful, they can hire many engineers to actually fork Android to have their own. That&#x27;s what Android did for Linux in the first place anyway! Most OEMs have <i>a lot</i> of changes to their Android, even though they keep using Google apps, and they are just fine. I&#x27;m pretty sure that Samsung have an order of magnitude more changes in Android than LineageOS (which &#x2F;e&#x2F; is a pretty direct fork of), and they maintain it just fine.')
