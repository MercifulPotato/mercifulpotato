You can&#x27;t flaunt copyright law without causing headache for the vast majority of contributors.<p>The productive next step is to make youtube-dl compliant with copyright law, namely by removing the TPM-circumventing code from youtube-dl (`YoutubeIE._decrypt_signature`), and making the marketing material reflect that it&#x27;s designed for non-infringing or exempted uses only. Unfortunately, you can&#x27;t &#x27;put the genie back in the bottle&#x27;, so it&#x27;s unlikely the original authors can continue to be contributors.<p>In the long term, put energy into reforming copyright law.')
