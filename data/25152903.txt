Then, they separately state that the Air contains the same M1 chip, implying (but not stating) that the Air is faster than 98% of laptops sold.<p>As we know, the Pro should be faster because of the thermal management (fans) so Apple is using a little sleight of hand here. But, I&#x27;m surprised the PcWorld writer didn&#x27;t catch this.<p>Apple is also claiming the M1 is faster than the chip contained in 98% of PC&#x27;s sold. Not 98% of all PC <i>models</i> sold. But I agree with the author, it&#x27;s a strange claim because that number would certainly include low and mid end laptops like Chromebooks.<p>Note: I&#x27;m going off of the text shown, I&#x27;m not aware of what the video (as shown in the screenshot) is specifically claiming and whether that differs from the above.')
