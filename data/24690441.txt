Copy and paste seldom works as expected, with text in the page&#x2F;section often permanently ending up an odd size&#x2F;font. Once you have more than about 10 words in a page, performance crawls practicality to a standstill, and there are multi-second pauses very frequently. Every so often it would randomly reload the page, losing anything you&#x27;d typed recently. Also, images you insert will randomly disappear at a later date. Literally cannot understand how they could release something so fatally broken.<p>And it doesn&#x27;t support markdown, which is a total no-go for me[0]<p>[0] it converts &quot;#&quot; to level 1 and level 2 titles, but that&#x27;s it. And even that only works as expected half the time')
