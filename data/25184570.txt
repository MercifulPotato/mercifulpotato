And is it legal for you to live-stream it?<p>What if it offers a view of the house across the street? Or into their window?<p>Also, it&#x27;s one thing to have a camera record 24&#x2F;7 so footage can be reviewed later. It&#x27;s very different to add motion detection and face recognition to ubiquitous live streams that include views of other peoples property.')
