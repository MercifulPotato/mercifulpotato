That&#x27;s tough to guess i.e. if you take something with roughly the same features and internal volume as an SUV it could be lighter (not necessarily), it&#x27;s wheelbase is normally lower which helps but on the other hand some of them don&#x27;t look very aerodynamic for the rest. Should be possible to make them as safe I guess.')
