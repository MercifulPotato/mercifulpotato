For example, an audio signal is just a list of values, so you can do things like:<p>- Count the number of zero crossings\n- Find out where they are\n- Create any shape of wave by adding together multiple sine waves\n- Hard clip the signal\n- Stretch a signal and interpolate it with new samples\n- Invert and revert a signal<p>For level 2, you can start processing &quot;live&quot;:<p>- Create a sine synthesizer\n- Create a small ring buffer of samples\n- Find out how to output that audio (system audio, soundcard)\n- Add MIDI support\n- Add polyphony support<p>DSP gets hard once it has to be in real time and the latency has to be minimal. It&#x27;s great exercise to mess around with it.')
