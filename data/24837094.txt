Rust has more concepts that users need to learn. It&#x27;s not gratuitous&#x2F;accidental complexity. Each of these features is IMHO pretty well designed and useful, but nevertheless Rust <i>does</i> have a larger toolbox.<p>It&#x27;s not necessarily bad. Do you prefer to put more effort into your program before it compiles, or debug it after it&#x27;s up an running? Do you want a static guarantee, or do you trust yourself to get it right? These are fair trade-offs.')
