No place left to connect external drives.<p>You can do all this through one port. Most LG or Dell thunderbolt 3 monitors can supply 65 watts of power (some models may be higher, up to 80 or even 100w) any of which should be enough to run and charge this macbook air decently, and have 3 extra usb type A ports on the monitor.')
