Everyone has their own passions. Sometimes that aligns with their chosen field of work and sometimes it doesn&#x27;t. This isn&#x27;t unique to software development nor is it wrong for those who just want to deliver the responsibilities they&#x27;re paid for.<p>Unless &quot;passion&quot; is explicitly being compensated by the company, why would you expect others to freely deliver it?
