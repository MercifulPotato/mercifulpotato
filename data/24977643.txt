If supply was increased, presumably players would need more.<p>In non-zero-sum real life, things are different. People didn&#x27;t need antibiotics before they were invented just as people don&#x27;t currently need to live to 200 years old since we don&#x27;t have that technology either. I can&#x27;t find a clear boundary between need and want. Need seems to be just &quot;very want&quot;. Some people end up with less than others and the world keeps turning. We don&#x27;t even need seemingly essential things like water because we can survive a few days without it. Just as seriously ill people can survive a few days without treatment (which may or may not have been invented yet), and normal healthy people can survive a few days when they&#x27;re already 100 years old and we don&#x27;t have anti-aging tech.')
