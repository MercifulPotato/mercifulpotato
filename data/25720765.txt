When you open a folder with icon view, sometimes loading the folder just stalls. You have to go back and open it again and then it’s fine. Also selecting multiple items with ctrl click only works in list view. There’s some bug in icon view where when I click on an item it instantly scrolls my window and selects something else. It’s honestly weird that this basic aspect of file browsing is so broken. I do wonder too if I’ve broken my system or if it always behaves this way.<p>As an aside right now I’m designing a part in the free version of the commercial software OnShape and I just discovered it does not support scaling a sketch. There is a long support thread going back 5 years of people asking how to do this and recommendations for elaborate workarounds. I decided to export the sketch as a drawing, open it in the free and open source program QCAD, select everything and choose the “scale” option, scale as desired, save, then upload to OnShape.<p>FLOSS needs to be better than this but as someone else said commercial software has issues like this too. The reality I think is that we need to look at how to better fund open source, as time strapped teams aren’t super functional in general.')
