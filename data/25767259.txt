They&#x27;re almost always cases where someone is asking for some feature or change in Svelte and the core contributors disagree that it fits with the design and vision of the project.<p>Then the OP tags Rich in the hopes that he will swoop in and and override the decision. It&#x27;s almost always more of a tantrum than a real request for help.<p>As far as project progress, most of the recent work has been on SvelteKit, but I&#x27;ve been using Svelte for about a year now and it has steadily gained features during that time. It&#x27;s definitely not in bugfix-only mode.')
