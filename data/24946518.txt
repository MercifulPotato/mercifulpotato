Coincidentally, I&#x27;ve been working on a sound visualizer which accurately translates sound to visuals, while preserving all the information and, what&#x27;s way more important, it transfers the &quot;sound symmetry&quot; which we often refer to as &quot;musical harmony&quot;. The visuals can be translated back to sound.<p>As someone with nearly perfect hearing and musical education background, I find the visuals oddly accurate when I also listen to the corresponding music. It can trivially distinguish human vowels, as those produce different recognizable shapes.<p>I&#x27;ve put together a few sample images and a live demo: check out &quot;github soundshader&quot; (the project that talks about ACFs). I&#x27;m really curious what you think about this.')
