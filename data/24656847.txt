I love &#x27;em, but man are they a hassle when the head doesn&#x27;t engage the bar.<p>Pipe clamps are comparatively cheaper with the bonus that if you need longer clamps, you can go to the plumbing supply for a longer bit of pipe. They aren&#x27;t as nice as parallel clamps for gluing up thin panels though.<p>For handscrews, I highly recommend Miro Moose. The Besseys are surprisingly subpar. Lie-Nielsen makes them as well for a reasonable price, but they galvanize the screws, and I don&#x27;t like the action as much.')
