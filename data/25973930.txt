I might gently slump over in my chair, open my mouth, breathe deeply, and meditate for a few seconds before calmly deciding what to do--a bit of an overreact to help me model and effect the mental transition.<p>The opposite helps when I&#x27;m headed energy-upward on such a cycle.<p>In any case, if I&#x27;m feeling off (relative to the rhythm) I tend to set ultradian-style timers, e.g. building on the strengths of a 90-minute cycle effect by delaying important plans or decisions for 15 minutes to see if cycle position helps.<p>I hear you on the dosage. In case it helps, the brand I use are &quot;Sundown&quot; and the tablets are really inexpensive.')
