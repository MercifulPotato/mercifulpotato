There are probably other ways to do it -- e.g. you could rewrite the url dynamically at read time if it&#x27;s been detected as a phishing attack -- but using a redirector is likely simpler.<p>Tbh I&#x27;m struggling a little to understand what the threat model is here. You trust gmail to receive and handle your email. In the vast majority of cases, you&#x27;re accessing the email through their web frontend, where they could easily detect hovers and clicks and log those with fair reliability, if they had nefarious ends in mind. But them using a redirector is a bridge too far? If you trust them to do the first two items, it seems a little far fetched to distrust the last.')
