The key travel is longer than that of a 13&quot; MacBook Pro, and I guarantee it because I use both daily.<p>60+ WPM after a few days of use. Have 80-100WPM on my MacBook Pro.<p>The adjustment comes from having a QWERTY keyboard layout where some of the keys have been reduced in size to fit. Space bar is half the size, Return is the size of a standard key and you only get the left modifier keys (ctrl, fn, win, alt) and the keys past the letter P to the right are scattered elsewhere. IMHO very good trade offs as the arrow keys are full size. The coding keys (curly braces, brackets, pipe, etc.) are in a non standard location, so take longer to adjust to.')
