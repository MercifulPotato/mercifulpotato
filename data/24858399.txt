Item(by='nobody9999', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603376998, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24858286, text='&gt; Who&#x27;s behind this survey &#x2F; it&#x27;s not clear to me from looking at the survey page.<p>That&#x27;s a great question.  Whois does not provide any identifying information (other than Google as the registrar) for the domain, and the site appears to be hosted on the Google cloud.<p>It would be interesting to have such information.  Perhaps if someone involved is here on HN, they could share that information?<p>&gt;Also kind of odd for a survey about Emacs to require nonfree JavaScript.<p>I&#x27;d note that while the <i>online</i> form does require javascript (and that it&#x27;s non-free is noted on the page), you aren&#x27;t <i>required</i> to use it.  Rather you also have the option to download the survey template and email it to the group.')
