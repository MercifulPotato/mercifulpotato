I read your argument as being structured in a similar way.<p>There are really bad things happening <i>both</i> with the mental health impact of this whole thing, as well as the impact of the virus itself. They&#x27;re both tragic, and serious, and we need to be thinking about both.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that you&#x27;re <i>not</i> on-board with this argument, and I&#x27;m not saying you are.
