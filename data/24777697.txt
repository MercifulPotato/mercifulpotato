Of course if everybody tries to show up on the first day, you&#x27;re going to have long lines. Those polling places will be open for a total of three weeks (up until the weekend before election day--and in many US jurisdictions early voting lasts even longer, in my area it opened two weeks ago) and for most of that time there will be no lines at all. But that won&#x27;t get reported in the news because it doesn&#x27;t fit the &quot;voter suppression&quot; narrative.')
