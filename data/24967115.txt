I use it for Aarch64 development[1].  It boots and runs entirely off the SSD, and the performance is not spectacular but perfectly usable, and being it&#x27;s a regular SSD it should be at least as reliable as a laptop.<p>It also has a firmware bug where it cannot boot unless there is an (empty, unused) SD card in the slot, which is annoying!<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rwmj.wordpress.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;09&#x2F;24&#x2F;raspberry-pi-4-running-fedora-32&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rwmj.wordpress.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;09&#x2F;24&#x2F;raspberry-pi-4-running...</a>')
