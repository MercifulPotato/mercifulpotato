Item(by='pm90', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607152754, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25308840, text='&gt; PG is picking a fight with the least sophisticated form of the anti-billionaire argument (i.e. &quot;billionaires suck&quot;), which is beneath him. I get that it&#x27;s easier to do that than than argue over how the structural issues that allow massive wealth accumulation also undermine the foundations that markets and societies are built on, but it&#x27;s really beneath PG to choose such a trite argument to oppose.<p>PG has good ideas and experience in programming and startups, and some fresh perspectives that I enjoyed reading in the early days of HN. His essays today seem to be devoid of that. I can speculate on the reasons why, but that&#x27;s not useful. He has a huge following, and like any thought leader they will consider his word as gospel. I just wish he would do better.')
