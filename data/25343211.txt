Item(by='modo_mario', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607417100, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25339530, text='&gt;The counterargument is that Apple is not at fault for its own success<p>No it isn&#x27;t a counterargument unless you think it&#x27;s success is solely the consequence of it&#x27;s anticompetitive market practices...in which case yes it&#x27;s definitely at fault for it&#x27;s own success.<p>&gt;so what exactly is the reason that Apple can&#x27;t try to convert its platform into a conduit for services revenue?<p>They can charge high rates by virtue of having created a monopsony in what&#x27;s essentially a duopoly.\nThis is bad for the consumer. This is bad for competition. This is bad for capitalism.<p>It&#x27;s entrenched enough and able enough to extract this way that it&#x27;s value soared to more than the GDP of a host of countries including Italy, Brazil, Canada and Russia and still there&#x27;s plenty licking their boot because their product is good.<p>If a water utility country delivers the freshest and well filtered water to your home if it does so at ridiculous rates because it pushes legislature in it&#x27;s favour and stomps on the competition using it&#x27;s clout then that&#x27;s still a shit state of affair<p>The fact that there&#x27;s an alternative option in a duopoly rolling with these high rates protecting both from being called out and split up doesn&#x27;t matter much. Especially if they only deliver sparkling water which you happen to dislike.\nLooking back it&#x27;s a bad analogy because these companies would do a whole host more than just water and interconnect their services.')
