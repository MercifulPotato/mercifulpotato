Specifically when it comes to mathematics, that is. Some astrological alignment of circumstance such that someone can realize their potential unimpeded by their economic class, physical or mental health status, abilities in the language of instruction, lack of interest in the material, or innumerable other such challenges? Or are you referring also to some eugenicist fantasy of a person whose neurochemistry&#x2F;physiology happens to be optimized for that specific subset of human activities that we call mathematics?<p>The latter assumes the former, since if such a thing exists, you can be sure that external factors would limit such a person&#x27;s ability to succeed in traditional settings.<p>In either case, I don&#x27;t understand why such a notion would be useful to anyone except as a justification for gatekeeping and maintaining a culture of elitism in math, which is very much not needed. I&#x27;m genuinely curious as to why you find the concept useful')
