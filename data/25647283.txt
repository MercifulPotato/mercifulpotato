The withdrawal process is crazy painful and there are better, though longer term processes, to get over caffeine in a manageable way. When I first started freelance&#x2F;contract dev, I was drinking 2-3 pots of coffee a day. That&#x27;s 12 cup pots. Burnout and heart issues after around a year and a half forced my change. However, I love the taste of strong, good coffee. Decaf doesn&#x27;t cut it. I&#x27;m not quite a coffee snob, but I sure can appreciate a good cup of quality coffee. I don&#x27;t drink soda or anything else with caffeine, which arguably helps.<p>Cold turkey for coffee isn&#x27;t worth it. I&#x27;ve gone through 5 caffeine purges that lasted for 3-6 months of no coffee (the taste... the glorious taste is what pulls me back). If your coffee abuse has been long term, don&#x27;t bother with cold turkey. The withdrawals make you out like a heroin addict.<p>I also don&#x27;t recommend going straight to tea. You&#x27;ll end up drinking a whole lot of tea to equalize the caffeine amount compared to coffee. Start cutting your daily intake in half. Stick to that for 2 weeks. Then cut down again by half for 2 week periods. This helps curb those withdrawals or make them non-existent. Once you&#x27;re at a cup of coffee a day, stick to that for at least 2 weeks, but I found dragging it out to a month had better long term results on my first successful purge.<p>Now is a good time to switch to tea, but again, discipline to 1 cup a day. Never more. A cup of Earl Grey has roughly half the caffeine of a cup of coffee (depends on brands and how you brew). So, you&#x27;re still sticking to the halving pattern. Another 2-4 weeks.<p>At this point, you have the habit under control and can maintain this with little discipline (but you still need the discipline 1 cup of coffee or tea daily and no more). If you want to quit, now you&#x27;re going to go with no caffeine days. 1 day on, 1 day off for 2 weeks. Then 1 day on, 2 days off. Then 1 on, 3 off. At that point, I then can quit. With the 2 week intervals, I run into nearly no withdrawals, just mild cravings. Cravings are way easier to deal with than the withdrawals.<p>I do Lent, so this is why I now have a process to effectively deal with caffeine when the time comes. My caffeine purging experience is a rough 6 year exploratory process, change as needed for your life. I&#x27;m at the point where it takes a month and half to kick it and have no withdrawals. The withdrawals are such murder, way worse than fasting.')
