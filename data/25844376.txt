But then time and again I see people say Julia is supposed to replace Python in the future. Well, you&#x27;ve just set yourself up for a little fight there because I&#x27;d say the vast majority of programmers are used to 0-based by default, and they&#x27;re not going to dick around and install packages and crap to change that default behaviour, least of all when trying to be convinced that some new language is superior.')
