If the least sophisticated hackers just go in physically and steal the PC, then you&#x27;re correct, though.<p>&gt; possibly a key component of an elaborated real world attack<p>Yes, in the sense of <i>key</i> as &quot;required&quot;, but the key to Stuxnet was being spread by USB stick, iirc, which could be the same here. The infection would need to start via some sort of direct access, unless it got to it earlier when it was connected, if ever.<p>Note that this use of an integrated circuit to transmit isn&#x27;t that innovative either.
