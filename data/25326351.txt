Item(by='wpietri', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607286439, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25323780, text='&gt; Is there a reason this is tied to the blockchain?<p>The only legitimate reason I can think of would be cynically drafting on the hype cycle. But I&#x27;ve been reading David Gerard&#x27;s book Libra Shrugged [1] and it looks like the actual answer is that &quot;blockchain&quot; has a quasi-religious belief system built up around it, and the people involved are members of the faith.<p>One of the stunning things for me about &quot;blockchain&quot; revolutionary hype is how long it has gone on without significant accomplishment. It started only a bit after the iPhone, which has had a huge impact on things, including payments. It&#x27;s hard now to imagine a world without the internet in one&#x27;s pocket. But if every blockchain stopped working tomorrow, few would notice. Contrast this with M-Pesa [2], a different approach to digital money. It started at around the same time but has had huge uptake. A recent report in Kenya [3] says M-Pesa has 30 million accounts, which is approximately the number of people in Kenya age 15 or over. To me, that&#x27;s what successful digital money looks like.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;dp&#x2F;B08M8DGKY4&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;dp&#x2F;B08M8DGKY4&#x2F;</a>\n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;M-Pesa" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;M-Pesa</a>\n[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ca.go.ke&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2020&#x2F;07&#x2F;Sector-Statistics-Report-Q3-2019-2020-.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ca.go.ke&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2020&#x2F;07&#x2F;Sector-Statistic...</a>')
