These people don&#x27;t care if the election was fair, don&#x27;t care that Republican appointed officials responsible for implementing the voting systems in Republican run states verified everything. They don&#x27;t care how audit-able the votes were. They don&#x27;t even care that Trump and the Republican leadership have no interest in vote reform despite repudiating the results of the vote.<p>It&#x27;s simply a flat out repudiation of democracy.')
