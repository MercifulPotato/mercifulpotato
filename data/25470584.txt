It seems like WGU splits two problems (teaching material and verifying that the students learned material) into two different problems. It&#x27;s not that the author crammed weeks of learning into hours, it&#x27;s that the author _already knew all the same material from years of experience with it_, and just needed someone to help him verify &quot;Yes, this person understands this material.&quot; I would love to see more universities who are happy to verify people&#x27;s learning, instead of pretending there&#x27;s only one way to learn the material.<p>The objection you raise seems more relevant to bootcamps, which claim to teach one how to program in a matter of weeks. After a few weeks, students might be able to get by, but they aren&#x27;t going to be on par with people who have been working through some of this stuff for several years.')
