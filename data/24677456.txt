Item(by='logicchains', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601802800, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24677385, text='&gt;It turns out you can&#x27;t formalize anything that doesn&#x27;t have proofs -- in other words, it basically only works for what we&#x27;d call &quot;mathematics&quot; or &quot;pure logic&quot;. You can&#x27;t formalize literally anything else in philosophy, at all.<p>What do you mean by &quot;doesn&#x27;t have proofs&quot; here? It&#x27;s demonstrably possible to develop a formalised philosophy: see Spinoza&#x27;s Ethics for an example. It&#x27;s impossible to prove that one formalisation is more &quot;correct&quot;, but the same applies to mathematics, via GÃ¶del&#x27;s second incompleteness theorem.<p>&gt;The regress argument has nothing to do with ethics in particular. It applies just as much to any non-proof area of study, including all of science, history, and even ordinary observations and recollections.<p>It also applies to maths in the form that a system cannot prove its own consistency. Yet that doesn&#x27;t stop us formally analysing, comparing and making use of different mathematical systems.')
