I’m replacing a few tests with a new set of tests. How complicated should they be? The old test was simple, I should replace it with a simple test. I need six of them, six simple tests ain’t so bad. Nearly took me longer to think about it than to do it.<p>If I write three line tests, the test quality tends to erode slowly. If I left sketchy tests, they turn to garbage disturbingly fast.')
