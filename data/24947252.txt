REST is a protocol-neutral architectural style (of which HTTP is an implementation), it doesn&#x27;t have verbs.<p>&gt; that is often super arbitrary. PUT vs POST vs PATCH...<p>They aren&#x27;t arbitrary, they have well-defined semantic differences. It&#x27;s true that “REST” APIs built over HTTP often play fast and loose with HTTP semantics, but that&#x27;s not a feature of REST so much as people understanding neither REST not HTTP.<p>&gt; HTTP response codes... so many numbers, so little meaning!<p>HTTP Status Codes have very well defined meanings.<p>&gt; Response codes other than 200 and 500 are effectively never good enough by themselves, so then we come to the next part<p>201, 202, 204, 3xx, 4xx, and 5xx are usually fine alone, though sometimes it&#x27;s nice to augment 4xx&#x2F;5xx with additional info.<p>200, on the other hand, usually needs more info unless it&#x27;s being used in a case where 201&#x2F;204 would be more specific.')
