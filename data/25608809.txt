Security researchers have struggled for decades to get people to fix their stuff after discovering something is broken. When a vuln has a human-readable name that sounds vaguely scary, even nontechnical decision makers can ask good questions like &quot;are we vulnerable to this &#x27;heartbleed&#x27; thing?&quot;. Anecdotal, but I&#x27;ve definitely noticed people talking about them; I&#x27;ve seen articles in mainstream press referencing some of these named vulns and have even had friends who are otherwise uninterested in computers ask me about them!<p>Certainly there&#x27;s a self-serving glamorous aspect to it on the part of security researchers, but fun names and logos brings attention to issues that otherwise result in eyes glazing over. As much as this stuff makes me cringe to read, I&#x27;m willing to bet the branding for this issue will result in more eyes on it and probably will result in a fix. That&#x27;s ultimately what vuln disclosure is about, after all.')
