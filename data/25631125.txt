I shudder to think at the ammount of drivel that will keep flooding the internet. I concede it will be &quot;fun&quot; (for lack of a better word) to see the eventual search algorithm changes necessary to keep the web useful for research. That, or a massive curation effort. The sad thing is, for such a massive body of knowledge, the curation effort itself will have to employ automated tools, and the algorithms for these tools can eventually be cheated to allow for low-effort content as well.')
