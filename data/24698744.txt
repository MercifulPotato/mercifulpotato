Some programmers only need to solve a small subset of problems, so understandably their skill set doesn&#x27;t need to be particularly broad. It&#x27;s ok to be capable in a niche area if that brings value to you or your organization. Largely though, programming does come down to problem solving.<p>The best programmers have an eye for detail that can see below the surface of a system. When someone says &quot;we need feature X because Y&quot;, they take a Socratic stance and ask &quot;Why do they believe X will solve Y? Why is there a Y? Is there also a Z or a W to consider?&quot; These aren&#x27;t necessarily coding questions, they&#x27;re engineering and process questions. Anyone with some familiarity with a system and the tools can add feature X, but the best developers will think about the precursors and implications of X first in hopes of improving the system as a whole.')
