The first is that it supposes the scientific publication is a rational and concerted process. It is not, here is an example:<p>I am interested in Amyotrophic Lateral Disease and I blog about research done on ALS [0].<p>However there are 15,000 scientific papers published each year on this topic, on average only 20 to 30 articles per year are worth spending the time to read them (one every 500) and a milestone appears only every 3&#x2F;4 years (TDP-43 in 2006, C9orf72 in 2011, etc).<p>After 100 years there is still no clue about ALS etiology. Scientists have strong but widely different opinions such as for some it starts in the brain motor area, for other it starts at the peripheral nerve junction with muscles, for other (new trend) it starts in the gut.<p>And scientists happily pursue hypothesis that their colleagues are supposed to have disproved. Sometimes the same lab (I have one in mind which is perhaps the best known in ALS research) publishes articles contradicting its previous research without discussing the issue.<p>How to rationally blog about this domain, how to make collections that are worth reading?<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;padiracinnovation.org&#x2F;News&#x2F;tag&#x2F;als" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;padiracinnovation.org&#x2F;News&#x2F;tag&#x2F;als</a>')
