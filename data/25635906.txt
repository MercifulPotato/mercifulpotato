As you mentioned the arrows indicate that the project is an outbound link (links are optional so having a visual indication that something is linked was necessary, though there are certainly other ways this could be achieved).<p>Pages subscribe to updates in real time, so I think you just so happened to be viewing a profile as it was being edited. Seems like live updates should probably only be on for the editor.<p>As for the landing page I&#x27;m hoping to redo this in general. As a quick first version I just embedded an actual profile so I wouldn&#x27;t have to update image assets as the design changed, but I can see how this approach is confusing.')
