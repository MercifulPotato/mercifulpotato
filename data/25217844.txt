I&#x27;m mean surgeon general once called for not wearing masks until he changed his mind completely.<p>&quot;* Animal agriculture is responsible for 20-33% of all freshwater consumption globally&quot;<p>Why would that be problematic? There is no shortage of water where they raise animals. On the other hand the is a shortage of water in California where they grow crops on a massive scale.<p>&quot;* Mass cultivation of animals increases the chances of pandemic&quot;<p>That is a true, but the same can be said of large fields of monoculture crops where disease can quickly spread and destroy everything resulting in hunger.<p>&quot;* 41% of mainland USA is used for grazing livestock, yet meat only provides 18% of our calories; feeding the world on a vegan diet could reduce farmland use by 75% or more&quot;<p>Only if that 41% of mainland is suitable for plowing and you don&#x27;t mind destroying other habitats for food production. Live stock can graze, humans cannot. Plus we don&#x27;t need pesticides and insecticides on grasslands which are destroying our fresh water supplies.<p>&quot;* Going plant-based for two-thirds of meals could reduce food-related carbon emissions by 60% (the way we produce, distribute, and refrigerate food is a huge contributor of global emissions)&quot;<p>That is already true for vast majority of people on this planet. Think of the food pyramid.<p>&quot;* 70-75% of soybeans grown globally are for livestock, only 6% are used for human food products (meat eaters often try to claim that soy production is terrible for the environment; surprise, surprise, meat consumption is the main driver) &quot;<p>I don&#x27;t know how real the numbers are, regardless it is not an ideal situation and we should strive towards less monulture.')
