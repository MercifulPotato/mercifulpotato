Item(by='pwinnski', descendants=None, kids=[25090523], score=None, time=1605308976, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25086768, text='Yes, but please note how you described it first: &quot;Apple&#x27;s control over its market.&quot; Inasmuch as its Apple&#x27;s market, its theirs to do with as they please. The question is, is it Apple&#x27;s market? Or is the market something bigger or smaller, or belong to someone else (iOS users, for example, or smartphone users), in which case <i>their</i> needs should be prioritized.<p>Personally, I think Apple&#x27;s too big, and I don&#x27;t trust them (though my M1 Mac mini should arrive Tuesday nonetheless), and I think the government should act.<p>That said, antitrust has generally been focused on acquisitions and mergers, which don&#x27;t seem to be the issue in Apple&#x27;s case. Apple has genuinely made a product, mostly on their own, that has attracted enough users that it&#x27;s become a problem. This seems like a radically different issue from other large tech companies, most of which have very large acquisitions that could be--and should be--undone.<p>And Epic is being disingenuous and inconsistent, and I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re in the right here, either.')
