However, China excels at getting capabilities fielded and generally benefits strongly from a unified desire to leap ahead.  They can often accomplish things that are potent, but executed in a cruder way than would the west.  No matter though, if they can field the capability and it is &quot;good enough&quot;.<p>At least in the U.S., profound dysfunction and misalignment of incentives exist between high-level intent at the Secretary of Defense level and fielded capability.<p>A historical trope was that the Chinese are not creative problem solvers or researchers, unlike the west.
