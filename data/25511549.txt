It takes a few seconds for XRP transactions to settle, instead of days for traditional currencies via SWIFT.<p>The value of this currency is decentralized, in the sense that people trade it with other currencies (which is also how Bitcoin, Ethereum etc. are valued).<p>In the eyes of the SEC, the fact that XRP is directly issued by Ripple makes it similar to issuing shares. Even if Ripple doesn&#x27;t control the value of the shares (XRP), they still manage the supply.')
