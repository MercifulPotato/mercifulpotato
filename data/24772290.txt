That is the complete omission of the subject. As you said, the 「私は」 might only get thrown on as an afterthought. You can have entire conversations without ever actually voicing the subject. It can come off like a British comedy sketch for somebody to come into the middle of an exchange and try to figure out the topic from the last half of the conversation.<p>Kind of like using genderless pronouns in English takes away some hint to help you catch on. Only there&#x27;s no pronoun at all. For English speakers it can get even worse when all that is spoken is a succession of passive verbs. Hilarious.<p>Edit: I should say that I never noticed a native Japanese person to be confused about the unspoken topic. They seem to be able to intuit it just fine in any context. I&#x27;m mostly just laughing at my own inability there.')
