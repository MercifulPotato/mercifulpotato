I stand by my question being perfectly valid, what does a diverse workforce that doesn&#x27;t deliver software to the globe do better than one that isn&#x27;t diverse? If the answer is as you&#x27;re suggesting: that we&#x27;re missing out on competent workforce because we&#x27;re racist, then I don&#x27;t see the importance in a diverse workforce, but rather importance in not being racist and hiring whoever&#x27;s best. I&#x27;m not tasked with reqruitment, but I don&#x27;t believe my colleagues responsible for this are racist. And we&#x27;re short on people right now so if we had a !whitemale presenting himself with a skillset we need, we&#x27;d hire him&#x2F;her in an instant I&#x27;m sure.')
