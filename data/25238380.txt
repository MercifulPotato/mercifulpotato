Sure if you&#x27;re all-in on AWS and AWS goes down, you&#x27;re all-out. But if you&#x27;re on [AWS, GCP] and GCP goes down, you&#x27;re down anyway. Even though AWS is up, you&#x27;re down because Google went down. And if you&#x27;re on [AWS, GCP, Azure] and Azure goes down, it doesn&#x27;t matter than AWS and GCP are up... you&#x27;re down because Azure is down. The only way around that is architecting your business to run with only one of those vendors, which means you&#x27;re paying 3x more than you need to 99.99999% of the time.<p>The probability that one of [AWS, Azure, GCP] is down is way higher than the probability that just <i>one</i> of them is down. And the probability that your two cages in your datacenter is down is way higher than the probability that any one of the hyperscalers is down.')
