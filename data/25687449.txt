This has got to be the most ridiculous assertion I&#x27;ve read on this site.<p>Those routes are busy simply because there are a number of Egyptian expats working in KSA who travel back home for vacations and&#x2F;or family events and stuff. Apart from that, Cairo and Riyadh are as international as you can get apart from the language - they speak different dialects of Arabic, they have different views on religion, they have extremely different cultures, and they call each other&#x27;s food shit.<p>Both parts (Arabia and Egypt) were ruled by their respective dynasties for almost a half millennia, far longer than Ottoman rule.<p>I don&#x27;t know why there&#x27;s a lot of traffic between Seoul and Tokyo, but it&#x27;s certainly not because the former was briefly ruled from the latter. Comparing these examples to the Russian and French examples is laughable.')
