For personal&#x2F;side projects that price is a no go for me.<p>I&#x27;ve used GCS before and I agree it&#x27;s not easy&#x2F;hard, but certainly not as simple as Netlify.<p>&gt; I would be interesting to have a matrix of supported features on different platforms. And how deployment compares to Nginx, letsencrypt, git.<p>That would be useful, especially now that there are more and more options out there. I&#x27;ve seen benchmark comparisons but features would be more useful in my opinion, unless the speed is really poor.')
