Sampling incorrectly does. You can absolutely approximate this signal without aliasing artifacts, but you need to sample a <i>band-limited approximation</i> of the signal, not the signal itself. That&#x27;s what BLEP does.<p>Attempting to sample the ideal signal directly (the naive approach) will indeed give you aliasing artifacts. But we already know that the ideal signal isn&#x27;t band-limited, so we should also know that sampling it directly (at any frequency) is <i>always folly</i>.<p>Do you see what I was trying to highlight? &quot;Oh no, the signal has high frequency components!&quot; is not the problem. <i>Incorrect sampling</i> is the problem. Aliasing is an effect, not a cause. You don&#x27;t &quot;get aliasing&quot; just because the ideal signal has high frequency components, you get aliasing because you <i>sampled the wrong thing</i>.<p>You can call it aliasing if you want... you wouldn&#x27;t be wrong. It&#x27;s just not particularly instructive, and referring to everything as aliasing without being more specific about where it&#x27;s coming from is what leads people down rabbit holes like running a DAC at 2+ MHz because nobody showed them how to use a polyphase filter. Sure, it works, it&#x27;s just wasteful, and you can accomplish the same thing by sampling <i>better</i> rather than <i>faster</i>.<p>Then again, your condescending response leads me to believe that you&#x27;re not actually interested in being instructive.')
