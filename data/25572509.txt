Item(by='throw_m239339', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609264315, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25571473, text='&gt; What I don’t understand is why companies want to be associated with these suppliers. Honestly the cost difference can’t be that big.<p>because ultimately the great majority of their customers do not care, as simple as that. They might care about local issues, wedge issues, but ethical and moral concerns in another country? not so much. Big luxury brands such as Apple pour billions in PR and marketing because they live or die by the reputation. The day their customers start caring more about it, things might change.<p>I just want to add, that I&#x27;m no way trying to diminish Apple&#x27;s achievements when it comes to technology, product integration and creating remarkable ecosystems. I cannot think of another manufacturer that nailed that much in so little time. I think that Apple Silicon is game changer. But yes, they are a luxury brand.')
