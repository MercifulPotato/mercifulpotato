I have since moved to Canada and my house uses forced air and a gas furnace. I can still feel cold at 21.5°C in my forced air heated house which I never did in Germany.\nRadiant heat does a much better job of heating the things in your house than forced air will. Heating things, and not just the air, is what has them store that warmth across Stoßlüften-Sessions.\nSo technically, Stoßlüften works well with radiant heated homes, less so with forced air heated homes.')
