Item(by='thaumasiotes', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608171356, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25450394, text='&gt; If I buy a laptop from Lenovo I don&#x27;t get to say oh I don&#x27;t want to pay for tablet development, I just want all of this money to go to your laptop division.<p>9HZZRfNlpR is right. Not only do you <i>get</i> to say this, you have <i>no other choice</i> but to say this. Buying a laptop sends the strongest possible message that you&#x27;re giving your money to the laptop division, and not to the tablet division. If you wanted to support the tablet division, you would have bought a tablet. And Lenovo will keep very careful track of this. They may choose to cross-subsidize, but your message will be received loud and clear.')
