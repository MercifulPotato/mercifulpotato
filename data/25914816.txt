While lawmakers, politicians and corporate heads couldn&#x27;t give less of a shit about the average joe&#x27;s privacy, they know that it&#x27;s increasingly difficult even for them and their own families to stay private from too-pervasive, intrusive data collection, and they also now see ever more often just how near impossible it is to make said data stay secure from mass public leaks. Oops... Their own &quot;optimization&quot; obsessed nosiness maybe biting them back bit by bit.<p>It would be perversely amusing to see the head of some bullshit ad tracking firm, or bottom-feeding user data reseller, or the head of a snooping social network have their own dirty laundry leaked all over the web for all to see.')
