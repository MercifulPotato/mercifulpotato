Sure, there are bad apples. But the prevalence is way overblown and the “one bad hire” who is a “toxic employee” is mostly a myth.<p>Rather it’s usually management setting things up for failure, not listening to employees, not giving support or required resources. And the line employee will get scapegoated while the bad management a few levels above will fail up and deflect any blame.')
