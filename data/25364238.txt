(Whether or not &quot;some but not enough to change the outcome&quot; counts as &quot;widespread&quot;, I don&#x27;t know.)<p>Yea, that&#x27;s what he said.<p>Regarding the rest of your comment: I don&#x27;t think _anyone_ is arguing that the US electoral system is without flaw. A large system of any kind will have many flaws. Ask any software engineer.<p>Indeed, I&#x27;m also not aware of any person that wants to avoid, indefinitely, having a discussion about how we can improve the US election system. That being said, RIGHT NOW is decidedly not the right time. I&#x27;ll be all for having an honest, bipartisan discussion as soon as there are no longer parties actively trying to steal an election. When it comes to election integrity, 100% of our focus needs to be on making sure that the results of _this_ election are respected. Then we can focus on improving things for future elections.')
