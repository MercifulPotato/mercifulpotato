When it comes to the open projects I want to do, often it&#x27;s either a library that I break off from something I am working on that I actively need.  At other times, those projects languish because of a lack of motivation, time or both.<p>Some of my best work comes out of when I&#x27;m getting paid to do the work directly.  I take some level of craftsmanship&#x2F;pride in what I do.  Those are the things I <i>finish</i> and more than one has seen production use for over a decade.  Not everyone has pride in the craft for their paid work, but that&#x27;s kind of the point, not everyone is the same.  I do wish more people took care in their craft though.')
