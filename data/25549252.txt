Item(by='ajitid', descendants=None, kids=[25549814], score=None, time=1609049623, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25548214, text='I have question, lets say we have<p>page 1 elements: A B C D E<p>page 2 elements: F G H I J<p>so 5 elements in each page.<p>Suppose I&#x27;m on page 2. If I insert a new element Q and it gets pushed as first then page 1 will have Q A B C D. Now if I go back to page 1, I&#x27;ll get A B C D E and also a token&#x2F;pointer to go back one more time only to retrieve Q.<p>So while cursor solved the issues you mentioned, it still will have this case in which pagination gets broken. I&#x27;m interested how we can tackle this.')
