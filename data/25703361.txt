Item(by='kstenerud', descendants=None, kids=[25704099], score=None, time=1610218819, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25700135, text='Concise Encoding: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;concise-encoding.org" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;concise-encoding.org</a><p>The friendly data format for human and machine. Think JSON, but with 1:1 compatible twin binary and text formats and rich type support.<p>* Edit text, transmit binary. Humans love text. Machines love binary. With Concise Encoding, conversion is 1:1 and seamless.<p>* Rich type support. Boolean, integer, float, string, bytes, time, URI, UUID, list, map, markup, metadata, comments, etc.<p>* Plug and play. No schema needed. No special syntax files. No code generation. Just import and go.<p>The specifications are pretty much ready for version 1.0 release now, but I&#x27;m holding off until I have the reference implementation done (about 90% complete at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kstenerud&#x2F;go-concise-encoding" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kstenerud&#x2F;go-concise-encoding</a>). After that I&#x27;ll start on the schema specification. Once that&#x27;s done, I have a low-level communication protocol that will use this format under the hood.<p>I could use help in the following areas:<p>* Looking over the specifications and pointing out anything that looks weird or off or might cause problems.<p>* Help with the schema specification.<p>* Implementations in other languages.')
