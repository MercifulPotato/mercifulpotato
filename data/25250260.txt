My website(s) are empty of content. And not because I can&#x27;t write it but I can&#x27;t bring myself to publish. Seems similar to you.<p>Something I tell myself is that I literally can always go back, re-read it, and update it whenever I want. I also have promised myself if I have a better version of the article I can replace it with the new one with a new date. I keep the date out of the url for this reason.')
