Item(by='rmah', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608138098, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25441745, text='Many decades ago, when I was a young adult, I probably spent around $30 a month purchasing music (CD&#x27;s and, before that, vinyl records), $30 a month on newspapers, $30 on magazines, another $40 a month on books, $20 a month on cable TV and maybe another $30 month on video movie theaters&#x2F;VCR&#x2F;DVD&#x2F;rentals.  All up, around $150 to $200 a month on various entertainment media.  With inflation, that&#x27;s probably $300 or $400 a month these days.  For my income range, this was not at all extreme.  For this, I got much much less than what you can get for $300 a month these days.')
