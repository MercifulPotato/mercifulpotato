Rendering a scene (especially with ray tracing) can use thousands of assets from the movie even if they aren&#x27;t directly on screen. Artists draw and save files in tools like Autodesk Maya and renderers read files from disk and work on them while in memory.<p>For some assets and tooling FUSE mounted s3 can work but generally FUSE and other userspace mounters I&#x27;ve seen slow down artists and rendering measurably.<p>Think of rendering assets more like code files and git with trunk based development. You want all of your artists to use the latest assets which are daily being updated. All of the assets should be co-located and you don&#x27;t want geo-replication because of latency. Even if your artists are located all over the world you&#x27;ll want them to store the saved assets in one place. Where the rendering happens.<p>There will be different assets that are hot as the movie progresses. But you&#x27;re more likely to try to keep the latest version of all assets hot rather than all versions of specific assets hot.<p>Most studios use HPC style environments. NFS + big compute servers connected with high bandwidth.')
