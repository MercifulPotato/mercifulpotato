Many of my friends worked in all departments at Zappos, as well.<p>When the drinks were mostly finished, and the clock was past  3am, the #1 rumor would be of his drug use.  At first I thought it was standard rumors due to his laid back nature and stature (and maybe confated with the fact that he smoked weed legally.)<p>However, after an interpersonal issue, one of the people with access to his private life pulled me aside and showed me a series of photos he had taken in Tony&#x27;s place prior to anyone cleaning it up.<p>Let&#x27;s just say Ketamine and Nitrous are weak comparitively to what I saw, and there was a reason he could be &quot;on it&quot; for 3&#x2F;4 of a day and then immediatly sleep.  I don&#x27;t know how to say it without speaking too ill of the dead, but I think you get the idea.<p>PPS, Google the Downtown Vegas Suicides for a true, fun, short read.')
