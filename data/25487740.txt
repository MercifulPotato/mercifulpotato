Item(by='jariel', descendants=None, kids=[25489336, 25488310], score=None, time=1608484321, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25487009, text='Take the most broad and crude measure, educational outcomes, as some, albeit imperfect input to the system and you&#x27;ll see very unambiguously and consistently that kids with better grades will do better in life, in most measures.<p>Next time you are at the office, look to your left, look to your right: you will notice conscientious people, probably educated, probably reasonably hard working, team work oriented, and probably bright.<p>Then hop on the bus and have conversations with the &#x27;average person&#x27;. You fill find somewhat less conscientious, less interested, less curious, less intelligent people.<p>We have very clearly and unambiguously a mostly meritocratic system: as you go from coffee maker, to skilled labourer, to creative worker, to middle management to executive, you&#x27;ll see a pretty obvious trend.<p>It&#x27;s funny how the meritocratic naysayers, probably already in the top 20% of income earnings, probably would believer firmly they are more &#x27;deserving&#x27; of their job than the dude who drove them there on the bus, but that somehow, the system &#x27;above them&#x27; is &#x27;not meritocratic&#x27;.<p>The issue then becomes one of &#x27;self awareness&#x27;: we don&#x27;t like our boss, we are jealous of others who have more, we see some folks &#x27;skip the line&#x27; with better access to education i.e. we see flaws or things &#x27;we don&#x27;t like&#x27; to varying degree and so somehow we believe the system is existentially flawed. It&#x27;s not.<p>The first time you start to hire people, it becomes perfectly clear: either &#x27;you&#x27; are fundamentally part of that of that byzantine, unfair system, inflicting your woes onto everyone with unfair hiring&#x2F;advancement - or - more likely, you&#x27;re actually trying to hire decent candidates, capable of doing the work.<p>So what&#x27;s more likely: 1) you are the lone hero in an unfair world, trying to hire &#x27;good people&#x27; while everyone else is either dumb or plotting like Mr. Bean a fools dystopia - or 2) that most people are like you, trying to hire reasonably good people (hopefully the best you can) and trying to do a reasonable job - and there is some intelligence in that process.<p>It&#x27;s the later.<p>Most modern systems are crudely meritocratic. When they are not, it&#x27;s obvious, but that doesn&#x27;t mean those failures are normative or existential to the system.')
