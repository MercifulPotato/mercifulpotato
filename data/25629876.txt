Some people move from Poland to London to take those well paid jobs.<p>The company grows for a few years and needs to open a second office. They open an office in Poland as paying market rate there costs a lot less.<p>Then along comes Covid-19, and some of those Polish employees in London want to WFH from Poland. The company has a bunch of options and they&#x27;re all shitty for the company:<p>* If they let the Polish employees in London work from Poland while earning London market rate, they&#x27;ll have two sets of Polish employees earning radically different wages for the same work <i>in the same country</i>.<p>* If they tell the Polish workers they&#x27;ll get a pay cut if they move, that&#x27;s arbitrary as they&#x27;re doing the same work regardless of their location - and it deprives them of the family support Brits can access, and it&#x27;s essentially unenforceable anyway (who&#x27;s going to report themselves as due a pay cut?)<p>* If they cut everyone&#x27;s salaries to Polish levels, the London office will evaporate instantly.<p>* If they raise everyone&#x27;s salaries to London levels, why open a Polish office in the first place?')
