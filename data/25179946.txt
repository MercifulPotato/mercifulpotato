Thus it&#x27;s not especially surprising that it&#x27;s also seemingly* a political issue today.<p>I am not suggesting everyone need learn quantum mechanics, but a basic, qualitative understanding of &quot;science&quot; (uncertainty, experimentation, theory) would help understanding and decision making.  In the case of COVID-19: when I read the breathless reports on vaccine announcements, potential treatments and mitigation techniques, most of the popular discussion is profoundly confused.  Likewise on climate change.  In both cases, as with so many, the need to describe the story 1 - as a clash or people, or as originating in a person whose backstory must take up most of the article and 2 - the need to push the point of the article close to one pole or another (sometimes made up by the author) completely obscures the point.<p>This is no way to make policy, or, for that matter, live life.<p>* I think the degree to which this meme is developed (e.g. &quot;democrats are the party of science&quot;) is grossly overplayed, even when there are a couple of convenient examples to point it at.')
