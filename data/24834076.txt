My 20 month old daughter is infatuated with it (not to worry, we usually limit viewing to a song-scene or two per sit down). The songs are involuntarily memorized and cries of &quot;mana song&quot; (sic) can be heard each time the toddler gets into the car. To the point that my wife, 3 month old daughter, the oldest, and myself are dressing up for Halloween as TeFiti, kakamora, Moana, and Maui, respectively.<p>If the OP should see this - what prompted you to want to attempt it, was it just the availability of the dataset or were you drawn into the story by screaming children as well?')
