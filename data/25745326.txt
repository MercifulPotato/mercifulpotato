Their ailments are very real and they have a cause.<p>Malingering exists, but the profile of the chronic Lyme patients you speak about is not at all the one of persons in need of being nursed by the society like babies...<p>Just imagine you go to the doctor and all you say is dismissed because he thinks you make it up? What a despair you would be in! Speaking of a closed logical system your physician would be in! The same kind as the ones making famous conspiracy theories.<p>&quot;I had &lt;insert illness&gt; and I was not taken seriously for &lt;X&gt; years&quot; is such a recurrent theme that it is very concerning.<p>Just recently, the &quot;long covid&quot; was very much mocked by smug doctors. Imagine the distress of the patients.<p>You&#x27;re wrong, these patients just failback on Lyme as a default and would be very pleased to discover the real causes of their ailments if it was found. To suppose that people are that much irrational and to generalize to this extent is... sorry but I am shocked.<p>In medicine, a golden rule is always assume your patient is honest in describing his problems.<p>Finally, contrary to what you said, the problem is not outside of the real world. Just as a link was proved between some tickborne pathogens and red meat allergy, you cannot exclude that one day a scientific team would prove that under some conditions the borreliosis provokes an autoimmune illness. And such a study would most likely point towards chemical markers to look for in blood and, at last, be able to diagnose it with certitude.')
