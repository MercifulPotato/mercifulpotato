It is a specific conflict of interest problem where the same people or firm are acting in more than one capacity - agent and principal or agent for different parties - at the same time (eg I see large customer order coming in then trade for myself&#x2F;my firm before I trade for the client, potentially moving the market for them which would hurt them if our trades are both in the same direction).')
