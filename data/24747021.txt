Item(by='tomphoolery', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602434399, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24745096, text='One thing that is nice about solar is that it flips the entire idea of &quot;power&quot; on its head. Solar theoretically allows you to power your own life without needing to be a part of any power grid. That&#x27;s pretty neat, and I think will be very useful in the coming decades.<p>But I think the argument here is a little convoluted. In my opinion, nuclear power is still the best &quot;bang for your buck&quot;, and that&#x27;s probably not going to change considering the same rules apply in the rest of the universe. Absorbing the energy of photons that were created by a nuclear reaction is going to net far less energy than simply using the full energy from the original nuclear reaction to power a turbine, no matter which way you slice it. On a large scale, nuclear makes sense. And even though there have been a number of high-profile incidents in the past 50 years, nuclear doesn&#x27;t even come close to the amount of deaths and sickness people have suffered over the past couple hundred years by working in coal mines. I&#x27;d much rather take my chances with a bit of radiation than go into one of those mines, knowing that my lungs are going to be pitch black by the time I&#x27;m 45...and if it catches fire, I&#x27;m done.')
