More Republicans today than ever are willing to regulate corporations especially in this area.<p>Beliefs change. We see it in the senate taking up the cases into twitter and facebook. The party is shifting. Trump was not a traditional pro corporate republican. His doj is trying to punish monopolies. Many in the gop base, including myself, cannot stand congressional Republicans embrace of corporations (although many of us are seeing the democrats embrace big money too -- biden had more bank donations than trump -- and are equally disgusted).  And honestly democrats who agree should reach out now to the shifting base. They might gain voters. That&#x27;s the point I&#x27;m making.')
