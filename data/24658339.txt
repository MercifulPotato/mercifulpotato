At the humane society she was a total love. Moment we got her home and since she&#x27;s turned into a princess who has no interest in affection and will gladly scratch you right after you deliver the treats she requested.<p>On the other hand, we&#x27;ve got an old grey guy and a young calico who won&#x27;t leave you alone they want so much affection.<p>Point being - it&#x27;s all about the personality, not the fur. I&#x27;ll also say fwiw that we notice a significant difference in our females vs males in the attitude department, but again that may be anecdotal.')
