Public clients must use implicit+PKCE.<p>Private clients are what we would have previously thought of as an Authorization code grant client where a server process has an access token to take actions on behalf of a user.<p>Depending on the OAuth use case, maintainers of the system may need to keep track of what clients are public or private, and limit their entitlements accordingly.<p>Public clients have the obvious issue that they&#x27;re on an end-user device and thus the tokens may be stolen, proposed standards like  JWT DPOP [2] and token binding [3] aim to address this.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;oauth.net&#x2F;2.1&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;oauth.net&#x2F;2.1&#x2F;</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;datatracker.ietf.org&#x2F;doc&#x2F;draft-ietf-oauth-dpop&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;datatracker.ietf.org&#x2F;doc&#x2F;draft-ietf-oauth-dpop&#x2F;</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tools.ietf.org&#x2F;html&#x2F;rfc8471" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tools.ietf.org&#x2F;html&#x2F;rfc8471</a> . Though I should say token binding does seem like it will never go anywhere.<p>This space is insane and hard to keep up with.')
