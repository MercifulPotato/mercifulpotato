I actually use ABC Notation in VIM. I can do a whole song in under 5 minutes after using this for years. Its all texted based and as a old programmer I prefer the text to the GUI.  I don&#x27;t have an symphony and so that is why it is over kill for me.<p>ABCNotion is just a text based notation program. Once I have that I can just move it to whatever format I want.<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;abcnotation.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;abcnotation.com&#x2F;</a>')
