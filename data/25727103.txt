Around age 9, cursive became mandatory, however I suffered from pretty illegible handwriting (to the point of multiple interventions between parents and teachers over 3-4 years). It was awful for me, and I was forced to continue with it. When I went to secondary, cursive was optional, and I returned to printing, but I was the only one. By the time I made it through university, I would hand wave it around 50-50 between cursive and printed.<p>One interesting thing I&#x27;ve noted with my group of friends and my partners friends are that those who have poor handwriting tend to be better typists..')
