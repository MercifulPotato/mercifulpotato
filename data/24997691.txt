I don&#x27;t see the need for detecting the G vector and multiplying acceleration with that vector, you can use the module and you&#x27;d probably get a very similar waveform in any case. Modern accelerometers have built-in logic for step counting and sometimes they are surprisingly accurate.<p>I worked in this space a little, all the algos are open sourced: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;oxford-step-counter.github.io&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;oxford-step-counter.github.io&#x2F;</a>')
