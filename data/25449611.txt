The front passenger seat is not an acceptable place to put a car seat anyway.<p>That&#x27;s what my pickup trucks says. But it only has the one row of seats, so it&#x27;s put the car seat in the front or put it in the bed.<p>My understanding is it&#x27;s legal and reasonable to fill up the rear seats with children in child seats, and then put the largest child in the front seat. Bonus points if you can disable the passenger airbag (many cars will do it automatically and indicate it, a very small number have a manual switch).')
