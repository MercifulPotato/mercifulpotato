If I send you one or two videos of that breed involved in a bad fight, will you have an open mind and be persuaded?<p>For that matter, do you drive a car? I could show you a number of videos that demonstrate the danger of cars.<p>And so on. Maybe folks are down voting you because a collection of videos isn’t a good argument. Maybe they have  a pitbull in their life that they love. Not everyone who disagrees with you is a closed-minded SJW. If you are open-minded yourself, you must accept that maybe they disagree with you because they don’t find your argument compelling.<p>I get why you are passionate about this. I understand you want to keep people safe. I am sure if we could discuss this over a beer, we could find common ground.')
