Virtually every retail broker does it.<p>What you&#x27;re missing is that Robinhood is not the only commission-free brokerage. I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;d rather have no commissions and 80% of the price improvement instead of no commissions and 20% of the price improvement.<p>The real problem is that Robinhood advertised they have THE BEST EXECUTION compared to other brokers, set up a Committee to ensure they have THE BEST EXECUTION, and then that Committee somehow failed to notice that Robinhood clearly doesn&#x27;t have THE BEST EXECUTION because they&#x27;re taking an 80% cut of price improvement, instead of 20% like everyone else.')
