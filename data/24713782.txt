Take laptops. You might think that a cheap one that costs a quarter of an expensive model would mean that you change it more often for the same cost.<p>&gt; By the end of the upgrade cycle you&#x27;d probably have a faster cheap laptop than the original expensive one and that might be true but you&#x27;d also have to live with the cheap keyboard and the cheap screen and the cheap build quality of the case.<p>It isn&#x27;t actually the case that the cheap laptop would be faster, unfortunately. It&#x27;s not an apples-to-apples comparison, but my $1000 i5 MacBook Air from 2013 is still a snappier machine than a recent $250 Celeron Chromebook.')
