If you don&#x27;t know yet what you will build, if your requirements change all the time, good abstractions maybe rarely emerge and then maybe unit tests make less sense.<p>However, I&#x27;ve worked on a number of applications where there were very well-defined units that were quite stable in terms of their abstraction, and then unit tests are a joy. &quot;I have this tree structure and I need to transform it into another structure&quot; and stuff like that.<p>It&#x27;s also worth keeping in mind that &quot;unit testing&quot; doesn&#x27;t have to mean &quot;class (or method) testing&quot;. Sometimes the class is the right level of abstraction but sometimes it can also be a small module of classes working in concert etc.<p>I agree that tests shouldn&#x27;t simply reflect implementation, but there are functional requirements that can be specified at a lower level.')
