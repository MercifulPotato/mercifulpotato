A human doesn&#x27;t slither, unless it is up to something nefarious, sneaky, malign, or evil.  The devil is seen as serpentine in the Christian religion, and historically known as &#x27;slithering about&#x27; to do evil.  The apple offered to Eve, as part of the &#x27;fall from grace&#x27; of humanity, was offered by Satan in serpent form.<p>The English language evolved and formed over centuries, in parallel with Christianity as a religion.  Hence, many such negative or positively charged words and phrases exist.<p>For example, &#x27;awesome&#x27; is &quot;good awe&quot; and &quot;awful&quot; is &quot;bad awe&quot;, but why is &quot;some awe&quot; good, and &quot;being full of awe&quot; bad?<p>Because there is the concept that one cannot withstand being in full presence of God.  Having some &quot;awe&quot; of God withstandable, but all?  Will destroy you.  To be filled with awe, something immensely wonderful to have some of, is horrible.<p>Irregardless of the current state of Christianity, English is derived from its historical, cultural roots, and some words can be &quot;associated with malice&quot;.  And again, I&#x27;ve only ever heard &#x27;slither&#x27; used in reference to a human being in a highly negative connotation.<p>NOTE: I fully agree, especially on an international forum which has non-native speakers, assume good intent.  However, the initial reply was not angry, or hateful, at least not from inakarmacoma.<p>Anyhow.<p>My 2 cents, worthful or not.<p>(Edit for all sorts of weird errors, and added a bit of context)')
