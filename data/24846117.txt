I think they&#x27;re not violating it now, but have done for a few years.<p>This makes me wonder what their thinking was. Did they decide to take it down because of potential&#x2F;unknown (to them) legal implications of using it for three years without providing a way to get the source? Or did they think this site is done because of legal issues and then go to the drawing board for creating a different site with a lot more changes (to avoid detection) so that they donâ€™t have to comply with this at all?')
