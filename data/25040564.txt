Unsupervised exams were common, and to the best of my knowledge cheating was very rare. If you were accused of cheating then you went before the Honor Council, which was run entirely by students.<p>I considered this an <i>enormous</i> success. It created an atmosphere where we were treated with respect, and where we were expected to treat others in the same way. If someone did cheat, then they would certainly be too ashamed to admit to it. It was a community where I was proud to spend four years.<p>Yes, I would say that Rice students are honorable -- without the scare quotes.<p>How is this achieved in practice? Wish I knew. This is the sort of thing that every university, and every organization, wants to achieve. Trust is <i>very</i> difficult to build if it&#x27;s not already there; and it&#x27;s much easier to erode.')
