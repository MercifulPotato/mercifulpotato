But the trouble then is that you can only describe the constituent parts in terms of those parts. For example, subatomic particles have properties like spin and charge, but that&#x27;s the only way you can describe them - in relation to one another - without having to go a level &#x27;deeper&#x27; if it were possible to describe them in further parts (which would only be describable in terms of those parts, and so on).')
