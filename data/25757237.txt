I mean I get that there are various different chat or chat&#x2F;email hybrid solutions nowadays that are competing with each other.<p>Personally though I have nothing to complain about with slack. It has threading. It only has one level threading but that might actually be a good thing because we slack with non tech people too. One thread is sometimes hard for them to grasp. Make that a regular threading model and they will utterly get lost. You can see how that completely breaks down with emails in most places.<p>We use slack both for synchronous and asynchronous communication. It&#x27;s all about the culture and what people expect. Not really different from email. Remember the people that send you another email if you didn&#x27;t answer their first one after 5 minutes?<p>Group chats you can just link to in a ticket instead of having to paste and reformat from a large email conversation? Priceless!<p>Markdown is not necessarily required. Most good email clients supported something like it, like actually displaying something like _this_ as italics or * bolded *.
