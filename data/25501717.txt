Even if I were to concede the point that all of Reddit has a left-leaning (in a US sense of the word) tinge, is that at all comparable to the right-leaning tinge of Voat?<p>Is advocating for e.g. defunding the police, medicare for all, and free college comparable to saying immigrants should be shot on the border, that the holocaust simultaneously didn&#x27;t happen and wasn&#x27;t effective enough, and that racial minorities should be hanged?<p>Even if you vehemently disagree with the three examples of left-leaning policies I used as an example, and any other examples I could&#x27;ve used, surely you can recognize that they are fundamentally different to the stuff that permeated every crevice of Voat? Saying Reddit and Voat both have a tinge completely ignores any context and nuance.<p>EDIT:<p>There&#x27;s an example I&#x27;d like to bring. It&#x27;s from a thread on the frontpage called &quot;Voat, I could use a little life advice&quot;. It&#x27;s from a person that is having trouble paying their bills, and can&#x27;t do much doordash driving because they refuse to wear a mask. The most upvoted response is this:<p>&gt; &quot;Was a really good programmer for years&quot;. Good, not many people are and it&#x27;s a skill that&#x27;s good for decades. n* * * * * * can&#x27;t fake coding skills like they do everything else<p>Another upvoted response from the thread says this:<p>&gt; Why donâ€™t we create funds for fellow nationalists like the n* * * * * * and the ki* * *? Somewhere to pool resources to lift white brothers in need.<p>Mind you, this is from the front page of both the AskReddit-equivalent and the global front page. And this is on a question that wasn&#x27;t about anyone but the original poster and their money trouble.')
