Don&#x27;t force it- it can be like hard math. Some philosophy and (anti-)theology can even f- you up. If you feel like you&#x27;re falling into a hole or learning the secrets of the universe in a way that is starting to make you feel like you don&#x27;t belong, switch to something else or drop it completely. If you have nightmares or lose yourself, maybe try (self-)EMDR or get a hypnotist to help you forget it, like Peter Gibbons.<p>It sounds like you&#x27;re interested in ethics, but I&#x27;d suggest not starting with that. Although I personally believe in having ethical and moral behavior, for me it developed from experience more than my studies; you don&#x27;t need to be like Chidi from The Good Place, unless that&#x27;s what you dig. If you get too pedantic, try Metaphysics or just take a break.<p>If you&#x27;re looking for practical life guidance, and you can take a little stoicism, Meditations by Marcus Aurelius is good gateway into that (Penguin Classics, or Munro&#x27;s audiobook).')
