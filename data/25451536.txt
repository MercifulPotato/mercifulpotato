The Quest 2 is still extremely hard to find outside of crazy scalper prices or a 1-month wait if you buy direct.<p>Besides which, 10,000,000 seems very large for an early adopter group a anyway. I&#x27;d argue that anything selling 1million+ units has pretty much made the mainstream.<p>Still, that wasn&#x27;t the bet, but it may very well be that demand for 10,000,000 existed, it just outstripped supply, at which point I&#x27;d say the spirit of the bet was fulfilled.')
