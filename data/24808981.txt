Trac was the primary wiki that was in use for almost 15 years (largely abandoned for the last 5). Think 10 000 wiki pages and documents written by a thousand developers over the span of entire careers. Note that Trac is abandoned software, for example it cannot run on python 3, there&#x27;s been issues filled on that for years and there&#x27;s simply no effort to maintain it.<p>I decommissioned it last year (hint: there&#x27;s a long and painful migration story here). Users and documents have migrated to Sphinx, that&#x27;s been actively used for the past 10 years and was always supposed to replace trac (hint: there&#x27;s a longer story on how to handle or not handle a migration here). It looks really good but the markup and editing tool is not really user friendly.<p>A few teams decided to move to the internal confluence instead, that&#x27;s supposed to be the strategic solution in the company. Looks like they&#x27;re up for another migration within 3 years.')
