I don&#x27;t recall ever seeing this apart from sometimes a short statement on an outcomes (which Coinbase has given us - they found the complaints baseless [0]).<p>&gt; ...but they can certainly commission a new one that they can disclose.<p>I did mention law but this isn&#x27;t fundamentally a legal argument. I was just saying I&#x27;d expect there to be a law, given what releasing a detailed report would entail about employee privacy. I&#x27;d be ropeable if someone did that to me after I complained to HR and the story got international attention.<p>Companies have no role at all in airing internal dirty laundry of employees to Hacker News. Coinbase&#x27;s position is an employee made a baseless claim - in my book it would probably be a very poor precedent for them to start broadcasting details globally. Best case, utterly unfair because of the power imbalance between a company and an individual employee. Worst case, a smear campaign. All cases, unhelpful except for the enjoyment of pundits Hacker News comment threads.<p>[0] <i>EDIT</i> Rather than replying - &quot;all of whom found no evidence of wrongdoing and concluded the claims were unsubstantiated&quot; <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.coinbase.com&#x2F;upcoming-story-about-coinbase-2012afc25d27" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.coinbase.com&#x2F;upcoming-story-about-coinbase-2012...</a>')
