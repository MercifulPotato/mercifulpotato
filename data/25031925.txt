We received a call from someone who runs App Review at Apple earlier this evening. They apologized for our review experience, telling us that they&#x27;ve accepted our appeal and that they will not be removing iSH from sale tomorrow. We&#x27;ll work out the details with them in the coming days.<p>A huge thanks to all of you for your support of iSH!')
