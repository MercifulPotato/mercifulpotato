Somehow brown people like myself, Asians, hispanics, and most black people don&#x27;t have an issue with it but for others it&#x27;s a hill they wish to die on.<p>So now you have to understand slang of about 10 different cultures because speaking correct English is apparently oppressive. Also, being polite and not aggressive is also racist to other cultures, but not really other cultures, just a vocal minority of one culture.
