I followed my accountant when he switched accounting firms.  Within two weeks of that, I got a generic accounting email SharePoint document share.  It linked to the actual ms domain and used some redirection trickery to end up on a pixel perfect copy of the office 365 login screen.  I only didn&#x27;t get scammed because my password manager refused to auto fill.<p>Had the email come after I had learned the name of the new accounting firm, I never would have even clicked on the link.')
