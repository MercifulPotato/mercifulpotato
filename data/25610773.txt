My point was not about retribution, but exactly the opposite - optimizing for the safety of innocent people without regard for the humanity of violent criminals.<p>I did go on to suggest reforms and a model in Japan, which has very low crime and recidivism rates, especially when controlling for population density.<p>Edit: It seems we agree that the US system is broken. We just disagree on how to fix it. To elaborate, I think the main problem in the penal system is that prisoners are allowed to freely associate, share experiences, and form a culture. This should under no circumstances be permitted. It is this culture which gives people ideas about what sort of criminal they will become once they leave the system. Instead, if we do insist on giving people a second chance, they should effectively be reprogrammed. With every aspect of their routine controlled in such a manner as to produce compliant, law-abiding citizens to re-integrate into society.')
