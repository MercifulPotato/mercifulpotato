If they ever lose the Google search money hose and become threatened I do expect a Google competitor to realize that and step in with some funding.<p>Microsoft basing Edge on Chromium was a really stupid move on their part for this reason, and I suspect they are starting to realize it.<p>That being said, I only expect it to be maintained at a hedge level, not enough to shoot for dominance again.   Think of it like Valve&#x27;s Steam on Linux efforts -- it&#x27;s not a major effort on their part, it&#x27;s just enough to keep Microsoft honest.')
