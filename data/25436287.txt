But you do still get contributors, and PR-workflow makes other aspects easier (like broad clean-ups&#x2F;reorgs&#x2F;scheduling&#x2F;versioning). For contributors who come, you also get the opportunity to socialize&#x2F;engage them during review. Overall, there are drawbacks&#x2F;risks, but I&#x27;d say it was a net-improvement (wrt quality&#x2F;clarity of the final docs).<p>Maybe look at it this way: Both workflows provide a way to organize open&#x2F;community docs. Both workflows have positive role-models. In both, you need capacity+interest for editing, for socialization, etc. If you tend to these, you can do good. But if there&#x27;s neglect... then that&#x27;s where you&#x27;ll see the starkest differences:<p>* In wiki-workflow, the likely symptoms of neglect are draft-quality content, bad prose, quirky TOC, drive-by edits that are out-of-place, etc.<p>* In PR-workflow, the likely symptoms of neglect are slow review&#x2F;feedback, older content, would-be contributors who can&#x27;t assimilate to the workflow, etc.')
