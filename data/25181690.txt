In context of usability and interface there is a simple rule: contrast and white space is mandatory. For colours and palettes there are a ton of solid research and historically validated materials. If you are designer do your self a favour and invest time and money not on &quot;quick and dirty&quot; approach on this subject but in building serious knowledge about colour. Colour is deep topic with functional and emotional impact on the user. I am with impression that tools and product implementation are leading  real design process. And this is bad. Tech knowledge is a tool for implementation. Design knowledge is not new. This article is good selling pitch but knowledge-wise is scratching the surface of the topic.')
