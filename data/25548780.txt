I don&#x27;t either for sure, but it&#x27;s a few 10s(?) of kgs of heavy metal. It&#x27;s probably going to act like a rock in the glacier, eroding slowly over a long period of time. I don&#x27;t know how much is problematic, but consider the concentration of naturally occurring Uranium as a point of comparison: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Uranium_in_the_environment#Natural_occurrence" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Uranium_in_the_environment#Nat...</a>. Even factoring in a few orders of magnitude for refined Plutonium vs. naturally occurring Uranium, it&#x27;s still a relatively low concentration, and that assumes it erodes entirely and quickly, neither of which seems likely at all.')
