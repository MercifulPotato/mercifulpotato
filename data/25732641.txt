Item(by='davewritescode', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610387122, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25729688, text='&gt; Twitter has zero liability except their profits and an anti-trust investigation which I’m sure the new president will be a lot less likely to pursue at this point.<p>I&#x27;m not sure I agree<p>&gt; And did you just call out 6 deaths which include a guy who tased himself, a cop who died of a random stroke and a woman shot in the throat for being there? Come on.<p>I also left out the 25 injured officers<p>&gt; And yes, the 1st amendment restricts the govt but it’s hypocritical as hell for a company to espouse it’s commitment to free speech all the while censoring undesirable opinions.<p>The opinions were 100% fine until the platform was used as a way to rally supporters to violence.  Twitter has gone out if it&#x27;s way to carve out harassment exemptions for the President who has used the platform for everything from outright lies to falsely accusing people of murder because they spoke out against him.<p>This was a case of someone using Twitter in a way that would lead to any of us being banned years ago.  Nobody spoke up when someone I know got banned from Twitter for retweeting a joke about Antifa planning to launch an attack on small business owners.')
