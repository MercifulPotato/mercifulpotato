The philosophical successor to the original Bitcoin is Bitcoin Cash.  You can see the difference for yourself here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bitcoinfees.cash&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bitcoinfees.cash&#x2F;</a><p>Bitcoin, at least according to Satoshi&#x27;s original white paper, is supposed to be a peer to peer electronic cash system.<p>Let&#x27;s pay for a Bay Area cup of coffee with Bitcoin. That&#x27;ll be $13 ($5 + $8 in network fees). If we use Bitcoin Cash, its $5.  As you can see, Bitcoin is no longer useful.
