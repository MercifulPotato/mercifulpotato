I have one less bottom-row key than the Moonlander, so I have combined PgDn&#x2F;LeftAlt and ←&#x2F;RightAlt onto single keys.  I would uncombine these if I had the extra key, as I occasionally press Alt when I intend to press ←, but am too slow.<p>I also have Enter&#x2F;Ctrl as a single key, but it&#x27;s very rare for this to do the wrong thing.<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.keyboard-layout-editor.com&#x2F;#&#x2F;gists&#x2F;501437fce9123ecdaa15e9d15ec325b4" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.keyboard-layout-editor.com&#x2F;#&#x2F;gists&#x2F;501437fce9123e...</a>')
