But that doesn&#x27;t mean that that group is a healthy place or that it doesn&#x27;t harm wider society.<p>I&#x27;m also not clear whether this is a group of people forming under their own initiative (as is their democratic right). Or if its actually some shady privately funded project by billionaires seeking to influence elections. That second option is much less democractic and would (imho at least) be open to investigation and regulation like any other campaign activity. Hopefully it&#x27;s not that, it&#x27;s just someone trying to launch twitter 2.0 and make some cash.<p>What a mess! :)')
