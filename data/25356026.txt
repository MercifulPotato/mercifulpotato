I&#x27;m happy to learn from your experience here. Yeah, selling &quot;just&quot; a location sharing app is indeed tough.<p>&gt; <i>how often do you update the location? I couldn&#x27;t find any setting for that.</i><p>There&#x27;s no user setting. On Android, I rely on the Job Scheduler service, so the most the app can be woken up is once every 15 minutes (less if the Android OS feels like it). However, there is also a BroadcastReceiver set up to receive locations when another app requests it. Lastly, a friend can request an update if it has been more than 3 minutes since the last update they&#x27;ve received. When they request the update, a Firebase message is sent to your phone and a service is started immediately to grab your location and send it back to your friend. The reason for all this fuzzy timing is to maximize battery energy. The alternative would be to keep a foreground service running all the time, but I&#x27;ve had complaints that people don&#x27;t like seeing the service notification there and they don&#x27;t want their battery drained.<p>In the (currently unreleased) iOS app, it&#x27;s a similar set of of fuzzy conditions.<p>&gt; <i>PS: The email verification page is blank.</i><p>Thanks, I&#x27;ll check that out.')
