It&#x27;s reasonable starting assumption for any group that has yet to denounce Trump.<p>Personally I&#x27;m not a fan of identity politics, generally try to ignore race, and try to give people the benefit of the doubt. But at this point it&#x27;s awfully hard to not judge Trump as a race baiting bigot. My final straw was him starting FUD about Kamala Harris&#x27;s birth certificate. Apparently &quot;birth certificate&quot; really was just a euphemism for pointing out that someone is Black.<p>I&#x27;m a libertarian and think that both parties screw us similarly, but after four years of this destructive ignorant shit enough is enough. It&#x27;s time to take our country back.')
