It&#x27;s reasonable starting assumption about any group that continues to express support for Trump.<p>I&#x27;m not a fan of identity politics, I generally try to ignore race, and I try to give people the benefit of the doubt. But at this point it&#x27;s awfully hard to not conclude that Trump is a race baiting bigot. My final straw was the FUD about Kamala Harris&#x27;s birth certificate. Apparently &quot;birth certificate&quot; really is just a simplistic dog whistle for pointing out that someone is Black.<p>I&#x27;m a libertarian and think that both parties screw the People similarly, but after four years of this destructive ignorant bullshit enough is enough. It&#x27;s time to take our country back.')
