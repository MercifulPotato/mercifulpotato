If you leave X and Y the same and scale N down to like 50 or 100 employees, you have a good old hard working American business that&#x27;s creating solid working class jobs. When you scale N up to an almost inconceivably large number (Amazon has over a million employees) you get an owner with an inconceivably large fortune.<p>The problem with just taxing it all away to prevent him from being a billionaire is the money is tied to control of the company, so it&#x27;s equivalent to saying nobody can build a business bigger than some arbitrary limit. Which is equivalent to saying nobody can build a business with more than a certain arbitrary number of employees. Where would any of us work if that were the case? It&#x27;s not at all a given that you would get millions of new small and medium businesses that would completely make up for that gap you&#x27;d have from lopping off every big company at a couple billion dollar market cap.
