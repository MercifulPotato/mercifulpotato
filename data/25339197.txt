They had to go out of their way to hide cellular towers as streetlamps to get the 5G rollout to happen; I remember getting two or three notices for this (each from different telcos, so the one street corner has three streetlamps and two traffic lights on one corner).<p>I suspect if the droughts didn&#x27;t make people get rid of their green grassy lawns homeowners would be more amenable to seeing green network boxes every few houses. It looks awful in the context of concrete sidewalks, though.')
