Initially India but they started using eastern EU countries as well which was cheaper but didn&#x27;t have e.g. timezone issues.  They&#x27;re mostly pulling back to in-country.  There could be a lot of reasons for this, but if the issue is about work quality then I don&#x27;t see why that changes now.<p>Anyway, fearing getting replaced by outsourcing is like fearing to get replaced by robots.  Maybe it will happen in the end but if so, we never could have stopped it anyway.  If it&#x27;s the right direction and we should pursue it.')
