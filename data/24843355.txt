For instance, &quot;actual malice&quot; in US libel law doesn&#x27;t require intention or desire to harm (the normal dictionary definition of &quot;malice&quot;), but can simply be negligence (making a statement with a &quot;reckless disregard of whether it was false or not&quot;).<p>My point is that, if you ought to have done something, and you didn&#x27;t, you&#x27;re culpable. And I would certainly use the word &quot;malice&quot; (in the everyday sense, not in all legal contexts) to describe someone who knows they are cutting corners that might have damaging consequences, but cuts corners anyway. I think it&#x27;s malicious to harm or endanger other people to make a buck.')
