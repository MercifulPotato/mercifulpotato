Item(by='fennecfoxen', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609267445, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25568707, text='&gt; I actually think most of the governmental functions in this article worked quite well.<p>Permit me indulge in a minor rant. Not against you, just generally.<p>A specialty pasta manufacturer in Italy (home of pasta, but what do they know?) can no longer export a specialty pasta (which they sell legally in Italy), because it&#x27;s marginally under-enriched by US government standards for pasta, and so the consumers in the US, who specifically seek out their favorite food, must go without, and this is ... the system working as intended, indeed, working quite well!<p>&gt; If you say &quot;well you don&#x27;t need this law, it&#x27;s over-regulation&quot;, that&#x27;s a good argument<p>Ah. The thing is it&#x27;s not a specific piece of legislation, it&#x27;s one of those regulations the FDA itself came up with to begin with (Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21 Chapter 1 Subchapter B Section 139.115, if I&#x27;m reading it right).<p>So then, aside from the fact that it&#x27;s bullshit to begin with, and no one is changing the bullshit, and that everyone is expected to accept the other 114-plus sections times the 138-or-more parts of Subchapter B times all the twenty-plus other titles, and whatever minutiae they may demand... and that broadly we are all expected take this class of thing as simply as The Way Things Are, a perfectly natural consequence of doing business in our world that we dare not question, well, then -- yes, aside from all that, you&#x27;re quite right, everything is working quite well!<p>And yet somehow I feel things are broken, and moreover, that if you say something about it, you&#x27;ll find a dozen people to complain that you&#x27;re nothing but an eeeevil capitalist who would poison our oceans and black out our skies just to make an extra $3.50 in pocket change, if not simply out of spite generally.')
