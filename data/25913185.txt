Item(by='perl4ever', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611642706, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25904113, text='&gt;Both of those represent a choice to consume less<p>There&#x27;s something wrong with this idea, that spending more on consumption means consuming less.<p>When you spend $20K extra on your Tesla, doesn&#x27;t it enable that much extra consumption by their employees, stockholders, etc., which in turn has an average carbon intensity or other environmental impact that is roughly in line with anyone in their society?<p>Like, the electric car is green, but the money pays for salary which buys a ham sandwich, which pays for a hog farm, which pays for a diesel tractor, and so on. The green-ness of the <i>first</i> transaction seems to me a fig leaf to avoid the truth that every dollar of consumption has about the same environmental impact in the long run.<p><i>If</i> the Tesla were not a lot more expensive, <i>then</i> it would be significant that it was green. But people use the concept of externalities as if they were always an infinitely flexible amount and I think it&#x27;s self-deception.<p>You just can&#x27;t do what&#x27;s right for the environment or social justice via conspicuous consumption, and yet virtually nobody endorses that ethic, because then what are you? You&#x27;re Scrooge. It&#x27;s simple, and impossible for normal human beings to accept. You consume, you take away from the poor, and you pollute the environment.')
