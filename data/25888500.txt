In one project I’m on, I pushed for linting and formatting checks in our CI not because I’m an “insane weirdo” who cares too much about formatting, but precisely because I <i>don’t</i> care, I just want it to be consistent. I don’t really have an opinion about which style or format or whatever is better, I just don’t want to have to read through 6 different coding styles when I scan through my colleagues’ code.')
