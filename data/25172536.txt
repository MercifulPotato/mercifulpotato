I was an early Instagram user, but deleted my account not so long after they introduced stories.<p>Recently, I registered a new account, and after a grace period without ads, I was surprised by just how drenched it has become in advertising. I used it to follow professional athletes. First of, many of the organic posts are themselves sponsored advertising, then the athletes share brand posts from their sponsors, and then between every story you get an actual ad.<p>Of course, with more personal connections the trade of might be different, but for my use case described above Instagram seemed unsustainable.')
