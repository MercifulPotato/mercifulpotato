They would have been filtered out by these systems.&quot;<p>This reminded me of a quote I once heard (on Slashdot if I&#x27;m not mistaken).<p>&quot;There is often a mentality in the workplace that with sufficiently detailed protocols and procedures, the village idiot can perform theoretical physics just as well as Einstein.<p>In fact, no amount of procedure will make that happen; quite the contrary, all that procedure ensures is that if you ever do hire Einstein, their output will closely resemble that of the village idiot.&quot;')
