I have an assert in the code that fronts a <i>very</i> pedantic test of the context. In all cases when this assert was tripped (and reported) an overnight memtest86 test surfaced RAM issues.<p>- Edit -<p>Also, bit flips in the non-ECC memory are _the_ cause of the &quot;bitrot&quot; phenomenon. That is when you write out X to a storage device, but you get Y when you read it back. A common explanation is that the corruption happens _at rest_. However all drives from the last 30+ years have FEC support, so in reality the only way a bit rot can happen is if the data is damaged _in transit_, while in RAM, on the way to&#x2F;from the storage media.<p>So, if you ever decide if to get an ECC RAM, get it. It&#x27;s very much worth it.')
