Item(by='Silhouette', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607801739, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25399250, text='The longer I run small businesses, the more sceptical I become of this sentiment. I wrote a cathartic rant here at first, about all the different ways external services have let down my small businesses over a period of many years and how often our in-house systems have been the only thing that kept us going in those situations. But instead of letting rip and naming names in rather undignified fashion, I have decided to settle for just posting the conclusion.<p>I <i>want</i> to agree with the principle that you build what is essential to your business and you buy in the rest. As both an entrepreneur and a developer, I <i>want</i> to focus on the unique, value-adding parts of whatever my business is doing. I <i>want</i> to let someone else handle the mechanical stuff and the formalities, and I have no problem with paying a fair price for that.<p>But that whole argument is predicated on the idea that outsourcing will get an overall better result than building in-house, so that in some way it saves time and&#x2F;or money that you can better invest elsewhere. So many services we&#x27;ve used have changed or discontinued functionality and forced us to relearn or reintegrate just to avoid going backwards, so many services we&#x27;ve used have pushed their prices up in real terms while adding little of extra value to us, so many services only ever reach 75% of what we&#x27;d like from them and the missing 25% of functionality hurts more and more, so many services we&#x27;ve used <i>just don&#x27;t work</i> so often that you wonder how they manage to stay in business at all, that I now find it hard to trust or expect good results from any external service at all.<p>Sometimes you have no choice about outsourcing. No small business has the resources to do some things, particularly in heavily regulated areas like payments and tax, or in large-scale infrastructure like operating a data centre, unless that is part of the purpose of the business. So you choose the least of evils and hope for the best.<p>But today, as someone just starting to set up another business, I am looking for services that handle <i>everything</i> in a particular area where for practical reasons we can&#x27;t do it in-house. I want to specify what we need, and have it done and the results delivered. I don&#x27;t want to care about anything in between. I don&#x27;t want to be distracted by any related legal and regulatory compliance matters. I just want the job done, properly and legally, for a reasonable price. I have little interest in working with anyone offering less than that, unless I have absolutely no choice.<p>Maybe this means I actually do agree with the original principle after all, and I&#x27;ve just learned from experience that an extreme interpretation of it is the way to go.')
