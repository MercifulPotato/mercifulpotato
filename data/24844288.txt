Optimizations at scale matter a lot. Let&#x27;s posit that 100,000 developer-years have been spent implementing HTTP&#x2F;2 and tools to interact with it. (Hopefully a great over-estimate). Let&#x27;s say we have to spend all that again to move to HTTP&#x2F;3. Is it worth it?<p>Well, per random internet stats I haven&#x27;t validated, there are about 4b internet users, spending about 3h per day on the internet apiece. I could imagine 5% of that is spent on synchronous resource loading. That&#x27;s about 10m&#x2F;day&#x2F;user - or about 28M years&#x2F;year spent waiting on resources to load. A 1% savings (the minimum of CloudFlare&#x27;s range) is 280k human years &#x2F; year. And that&#x27;s the bottom end - could be as high as 4% (1.1M years&#x2F; year), and without BBR (negatively impacting high packet loss and high throughput connections in particular).<p>Is &quot;persons average time on the internet&quot; comparable to &quot;paid developer time&quot;? No. A lot of that user time is timeboxed &quot;wasted&quot; time, in the endless content scroll. With that in mind, is it worth it overall? Probably. I&#x27;ve tried to estimate in favor of developers, but I still get their one-time effort paid back 2.8-11x _each year_ in user time, under unfavorable conditions. And this is growing rapidly, both in user count and time per user.<p>And that says nothing about the privacy benefits of encrypting headers and whatnot, which you should probably ascribe nonzero value.')
