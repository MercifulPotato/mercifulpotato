Imaging is a 2-dimensional measurement, so spatial resolution improvements follow a squared nature. Our GSD will be 10cm, so we arrive at 9x by (30^2&#x2F;10^2). Said another way, nine 10cm pixels will fit in one 30cm pixel. The 9x refers to the visible imagery, whereas our thermal (LWIR) GSD will be 2m, and the best available today is 70m.<p>For thermal, we&#x27;re only doing broadband 7.5um - 13.5um. You&#x27;re correct in that direct emissions measurements is best made with SWIR. However, there are applications where heat signatures can be used to calculate emissions. For example, if you know the surface material and fuel type of a power plant, you can calculate carbon emission from the heat signature in the thermal image. Climate Trace will use our data for this.')
