Even they are going to be restricted to the easiest of locals for years.<p>Nobody has figured it out out yet, and a &#x27;moat&#x27; for a market that is basically impossible to a big money-maker is not a &#x27;moat&#x27; at all.<p>The quest for self driving is not the same as the quest for the first commercial deployment. Solving general self-driving is the real quest.<p>And I don&#x27;t trust any experts to predict this correctly, as nobody knows yet what the solution actually is. Some experts say one thing, others say other things.')
