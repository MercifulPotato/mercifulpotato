But really it hardly matters).<p>&gt; (i.e. I guarantee that his comments on fracking in the last debate just lost him Pennsylvania.)<p>Looks like 20-50,000 people employed in fracking plus industries supported by it in Pennsylvania. And presumably most of those would be voting for Trump anyway; it’s not like Biden’s views on fracking were a total black box til now. So it only really matters if it’s very close anyway.')
