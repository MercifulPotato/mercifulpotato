If ever we want to get humans out into the rest of the solar system, this knowledge is priceless. Oh, I know that NASA has this constant pressure to justify that learning in terms of stuff like &quot;medical benefits&quot; (and there surely are a bunch of those!) but really it&#x27;s the foundational pure science that&#x27;s critical here. I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any monetary value can be put on that.')
