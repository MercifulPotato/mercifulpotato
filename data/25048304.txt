It&#x27;s possible and the ability to do so worthy of pride but it&#x27;s clear that a succinct summary in one place would be far easier and time-efficient.<p>Not to say that heavy documentation like this is perfect of course. It just seems like the complexity of the read-the-code solution is sometimes glossed over.')
