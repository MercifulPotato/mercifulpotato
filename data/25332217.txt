Item(by='istjohn', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607350231, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25321993, text='&gt; The point of philosophy is to teach you how to think so you can formulate your own answer.<p>This canard has been raised several times in this thread. Yes, who will teach the physicists how to think? Who will teach the engineers how to put two and two together?<p>&gt; Apparently you expect everything to be 1+1=2, which really is kind of sad.<p>If by this you mean I reject irrational thought, then yes, guilty as charged. This has nothing to do with my views on philosophy, though. Philosophy is a type of rational inquiry.<p>&gt; Science seems to have ruined you.<p>Or perhaps math has ruined me, expecting everything to be 1+1=2? But isn&#x27;t math an extension of logic, and logic a part of philosophy? Maybe philosophy has ruined me.')
