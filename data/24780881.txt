Item(by='wrfitch', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602705739, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24779026, text='Planet Earth will continue to exist and the natural world may eventually recover, but a manmade extinction event and the possible extinction of human life is a good enough definition of &quot;the end of the world&quot; for me, though perhaps I should have said &quot;the end of the human world&quot;. I agree that it&#x27;s not worth fixing climate change at the expense of the future, but the situation is bad enough that fixing it is worth some level of risk - we had the time for a methodical, considered approach to climate change when we found out about it decades ago, and we didn&#x27;t do anything.<p>I also think the decision to accept some long-term risks to alleviate the (frankly terrifying) short&#x2F;medium-term dangers we face is very different to the decision to exploit natural resources in service of the industrial revolution.')
