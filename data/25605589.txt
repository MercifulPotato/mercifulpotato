This was the day I decided to move jobs.<p>- I eventually grew some balls and told Apple to (a) pay me 2.5x during overtime (b) hire SREs for this critical service, or (c) go fuck themselves. They chose (c), which worked alright because our service was pretty stable.<p>- The primary lesson I learnt is that it doesn&#x27;t matter if you work hard. Nobody notices, and even if they do you will likely not get anything out of it. Do your job, but don&#x27;t kill yourself over it. Work-life balance is king.<p>- Only my first manager at Apple was an asshole. My last manager was a kind and genial person.')
