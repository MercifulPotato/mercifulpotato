They only end when management fires the people behind them, it gets cut off or there is no adoption.<p>We in software think of projects really as things which we create and which need maintenance in order to live. There is never some &quot;end&quot; to it.<p>Because it doesn&#x27;t even conform to its own definitions, we could therefore conclude that the whole PMP project management discipline, as applied to software, is a scam.')
