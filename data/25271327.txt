Item(by='vincentdm', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606864480, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25267847, text='I started a website for charitable gift vouchers where the recipient can choose from a very large and varied list of causes to donate to. It turns the receiver into an active participant. The nice thing is that both giver and receiver are left feeling good and generous, which increases the appeal and hopefully leads to even more vouchers being donated in the future.<p>It’s a local project though (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.goodgift.be" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.goodgift.be</a>). Feel free to steal the idea. Just be transparent and preferably don’t take any commissions on the donated amounts.')
