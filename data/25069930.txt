I&#x27;d imagine it&#x27;s pretty similar to the stories I hear of people shedding hundreds of pounds and being treated as a completely different person. Once again, unless you&#x27;ve been on both sides of the equation, it&#x27;s unlikely you&#x27;ll be able to grasp how much physical traits like height and weight affect how people treat you.')
