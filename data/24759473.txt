I only generally use Fargate with containers, and control with cron or with always on APIs, with Cloudwatch for monitoring, and it’s seems like a good midpoint between ec2 and serverless.<p>The APIs cost a bit more a month (they’re on quite low cpu&#x2F;memory) because they’re always on, but it minimises complexity and it’s nice to know that you can move those containers over to another platform if needed.')
