I feel like the selfish and cynical thing to do given how the electoral college works if you&#x27;re not in a swing state is to vote toward the opposite party - Republican in California, Democrat in Tennessee. That way federal politicians will pay more attention to your state&#x27;s issues. Reading the news it seems like California and New York&#x27;s issues are in part because theres no chance they help the incumbent party get reelected.')
