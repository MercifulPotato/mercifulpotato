I’ve realised lately that it really isn’t enough.<p>Until earlier this year I was cycling about 15kms a day in the natural course of going to work, and climbing perhaps 30 flights of stairs a day in the natural course of living on the 3rd floor. Then I moved house, and I no longer do either.<p>I do, however, still walk a decent amount on the flat. My phone says I average about 7km&#x2F;day (near enough 10,000 steps).<p>It’s not enough. It’s taken me a while to realise it, but I’m pretty sure that my current lower back issues are basically a result of stopping the cycling &amp; stairs. I can’t prove it of course, but it makes a lot of sense. All of my glute&#x2F;hamstring strength has just gone.<p>Starting tomorrow I’m forcing myself to ride about 15kms a day (~5 days&#x2F;week), with some sort of an incline in there. I’m lucky that I enjoy this; I was luckier when it just happened as part of my day without me thinking about it. Making myself do it is going to be a lot harder. I need to figure out a way to “science the shit out of it” so I can at least gain motivation from the fact that it works (assuming that it does).')
