However, I remember having a similar click moment when I visually or intuitively understood derivatives and integrals. Before that it juggling math mechanics, which in itself is also not bad and helps build a certain muscle that can be used later on. But I am familiar with the fumbling a bit through some math classes.<p>My conclusion is different though. I think there are different types of thinkers and different teaching styles and when the subject becomes very complex the disparity between the two is exacerbated. And luck plays the role in matching up with the right teacher&#x2F;professor for you.')
