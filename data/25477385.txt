I interviewed for one postdoc and found myself hoping I wouldn&#x27;t get it because it would mean living apart for a few years, or else uprooting our lives and moving across the country, only to repeat the process in a few years&#x27; time, with no guarantee of ever finding a permanent position.<p>I&#x27;m completely lost now, I have no job lined up and no idea what I&#x27;ll be doing with my life in 3 months&#x27; time, but I do know I&#x27;m getting out. I love science, I love the research I do, but it&#x27;s not a steady career. It&#x27;s nice to hear someone else who feels the same way - inside the academic bubble, anything other than giving your life to the broken system is seen as failure.')
