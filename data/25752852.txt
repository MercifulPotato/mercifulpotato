We added a few more Q&amp;A around this but aren&#x27;t pushing any changes to the site until after launch now.<p>The answer is essentially we have custom plans available and you just need to contact support@vantage.sh - we just want to understand your scale and use case. In some cases we aren&#x27;t the right fit right now. For example, we spoke to a company with ~$20M in monthly AWS costs and told them we need to get back to them before we can realistically support them.<p>We&#x27;ll hopefully have this updated tomorrow. Thanks for this call-out.')
