This particular virus has landed in a weak spot in our collective judgement mechanisms. Most people would consider a 1% chance of some event happening low enough to not worry about the impact of that event, and indeed, in a typical group of people that number is low enough that <i>probably</i> none of your friends or family will die of it.<p>But if we recalculate the odds in terms of a particular in-group, and tell you that, of the 25 people you know and care about, there&#x27;s a <i>22</i> percent chance that one of them will die, that seems like a large risk, and one you would work hard to avoid.<p>And if we then polled all of the people like that, the majority of them <i>wouldn&#x27;t know anyone that had a bad case</i>! We&#x27;d have anecdotes popping up <i>constantly</i> telling us &quot;actually it wasn&#x27;t that bad&quot; and &quot;stop worrying so much&quot;, alongside <i>other</i> anecdotes like &quot;my sister was in the hospital for 3 weeks&quot; and &quot;my wife died in the waiting room&quot;. And if you look around in reality, you do in fact see both sets of anecdotes.<p>(I used a 1% rate for serious cases because it&#x27;s easy to work with, and not because it&#x27;s accurate. Reality is as always more complex.)')
