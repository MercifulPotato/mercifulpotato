More broadly, this contributes to discussions about fraud in academia, the reproducibility crisis, and the pressure to publish.<p>“Any random person” includes many researchers, including phd holders or just random people with time on their hands, but whose commentary could be judged on its own merits, not by some credentials or stamp of approval from journals that don’t even examine the data used by studies they publish. This does not mean that comments should go completely unmoderated.<p>As far as I’ve seen, no journal does a thorough examination of data referenced by studies it publishes.<p>Credentials, papers, citations, and studies do little to increase the levels of trustworthiness precisely because papers like these are not publicly scrutinized.')
