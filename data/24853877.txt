This breaks the paradigm of the particle-model. Instead we have something else, which we can test now with simple experiments.<p>Experiments are on:  \n<a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;thresholdmodel.com" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;thresholdmodel.com</a><p>And I don&#x27;t know if the conclusions are correct, but I am excited to see a testable breakthrough in the stalemate of quantum interpretations.')
