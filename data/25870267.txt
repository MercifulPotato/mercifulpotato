They often make the comparison that even the most violent aspects of BLM were not trying to overthrow federal government and a democratic election (which they call treason). There are also comparisons drawn between videos of peaceful BLM protestors being pepper sprayed for sitting down on the floor and videos of capitol police taking selfies with the capitol protest moments before it became an insurrection (and removing barriers).<p>Those on the right often view this as hypocrisy, say that the BLM protests were acts of domestic terrorism and largely not peaceful. There is a divide within the right as to whether the election was indeed &quot;stolen&quot; and therefore tend to be either sympathetic or massively condemn the invasion of the capitol.<p>This is just my opinion from what I&#x27;ve seen on the internet over the last few weeks and months, I&#x27;m aware it&#x27;s essentially anecdata.')
