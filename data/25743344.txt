Disney+ was always supposed to be a poison pill for the industry, everyone will try to compete against it and bleed out money perpetually.<p>Other way to think about it: to Netflix, streaming and content is the product. To Disney (especially with the promotion of Chapek over Mayer), it&#x27;s just a marketing expense for Disneyland.<p>However, COVID really threw a wrench in that strategy. So it&#x27;s going to be interesting to see how they attempt to pivot now that shareholders expect it to be the future of the company, whereas internally its literally a ghost town built by the lowest bid contractor.')
