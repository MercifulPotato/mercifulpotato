In the article it&#x27;s mentioned that he summoned the monks to not only translate Arabic works he found in Toledo to Latin, but also Arabic translations of otherwise lost classical Greek texts. If this not the proof of Muslim Empire and scholars greatly help preserving Greek texts then I don&#x27;t know what is. As you probably know that the renaissance era was started from the fall of Toledo into the Spaniard&#x27;s hands.<p>Just for the sake of arguments, even if the Cristian world have most of their copies, are having the back up copies by the Muslim world really help preserving the books when there was no Google Drive around?<p>At least we probably can agree that these Muslim scholars were not only appreciating but they were also cherishing the Greek books just like we are cherishing the PlayStation 5 not only appreciating it. For them it is part of their religious duty to contribute and spread the knowledge regardless they were from India, China or Greek. You need to understand that these scholars not only preserved the book but they cherished them. It&#x27;s given fact that you only keep what you value and cherish, and by nature human are selective hoarders. Without the ransack of Baghdad by the Mongol where the rivers turned blue&#x2F;black by the ink of the thrown and demolished books it&#x27;s probably not an exaggeration to say that we probably living in Mars by now. The fact that the lesser backup copies in Toledo, Spain that fell into the European hands essentially initiated the knowledge revolutions or renaissance as they called it today.<p>[1]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.americamagazine.org&#x2F;faith&#x2F;2019&#x2F;12&#x2F;27&#x2F;these-are-monks-who-still-preserve-ancient-texts-around-world" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.americamagazine.org&#x2F;faith&#x2F;2019&#x2F;12&#x2F;27&#x2F;these-are-m...</a>')
