Nothing you said here makes sense. The Git as a prefix in the name is just a technicality, the same way I could create an operating system called YeahOS and everyone would understand that OS is a suffix that blends into the branding.<p>But what makes you sound particularly ignorant it&#x27;s calling GitLab a clone of Github. They are both git platforms, that&#x27;s it. By that metric BitBucket, Gitea, Gogs, CodeCommit, Phabricator, etc., are all clones of GitHub.<p>If anything, recent GitHub functionalities like GitHub Actions are a clone of mature GitLab functionality like GitLab&#x27;s CI.')
