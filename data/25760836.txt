Unless you&#x27;re lucky enough to be with a modern bank that provides that as a feature (which is legally separate from Open Banking, though often it&#x27;s the same API), your only workaround is to sign up for TrueLayer yourself just to access your own account through them.<p>* given the &quot;deep pockets&quot; requirement, it almost forces all the account aggregator apps&#x2F;services (Emma, Yolt, etc) to have a somewhat scummy business model and monetize the captured data. Wouldn&#x27;t it have been nicer that you <i>didn&#x27;t</i> need deep pockets to gain read-only access, so that an indie developer could make such an account aggregator and not have to resort to a scummy business model to fund the certification&#x2F;compliance expenses?')
