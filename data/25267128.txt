Sadly, it is an industry where caveat emptor certainly applies, but if you do your research there are definitely programs that are worth their price.<p>Check out CIRR.org which reports audited numbers from bootcamps. Good luck finding a university that reports comprehensive, audited, financial and career outcomes for their students. The numbers don&#x27;t really exist, because it would be, guessing here, VERY embarassing for the universities.')
