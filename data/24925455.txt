Daniel is an excellent computer scientist, with a talent for writing straightforward papers about difficult topics.  He&#x27;s also a non-native English speaker who is usually very gracious about accepting corrections to his normally excellent prose.   In this case, it was probably just a typo.  It&#x27;s already been corrected---likely because of a comment on the post.  But if you ignore everything that contains small temporary errors like this, you&#x27;re probably missing out on a lot of otherwise good articles.')
