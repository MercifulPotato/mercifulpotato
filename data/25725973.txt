A point the FAQ didn&#x27;t mention is user psychology.<p>Technically, the correct way to use e2ee chat on both Signal and Telegram is to verify the key fingerprint using a secure channel separate from Telegram. In reality, few people do it, so the default makes a huge difference.<p>If all of my Signal chats are e2ee by default, and I operate under the assumption that most if not all of my chats are encrypted and secure by default, when a chat that really needs to be secured comes in, I wouldn&#x27;t think of verifying the fingerprint in a separate channel first, because Signal didn&#x27;t train me to do so. If it did, Signal would have been a lot more annoying to use, because it&#x27;ll have to pop up warnings and all that.<p>Enabling e2ee in Telegram is an explicit act, which means that what that mean is enabled, I know for sure I need to make sure it&#x27;s really secure, and it will trigger my memory about verifying fingerprints. I would argue this trains the user to think more about operational security instead of just theoretical information security.<p>As far as I can understand, Telegram&#x27;s secrecy by default is __good enough__. They control all of their data centers and internal networks, and they have been known to refuse to comply with government orders. Given that I continue to use Apple and Google services with similar or lessor guarantees, I consider that good enough, and I&#x27;ll choose my messaging app based on secondary factors such as usability and features. Telegram wins hands down in these areas.')
