While some automation platforms exists, scheduled posts break all the time, it&#x27;s hard to share responsibilities for posting, and all that. You can&#x27;t even upload images by logging in to Chrome unless you hack user agents or something like that. They want a one to one mapping of account to person and have you use the app when you&#x27;re out and about instead of sitting in an office, for a more personalised feel. Probably because we already have Facebook for that.')
