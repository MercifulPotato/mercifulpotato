A lot of very security-cricial stuff like Baseboard Management Controllers, lights-out management controllers, and laptop embedded controllers are almost entirely built on pre-OPC (i.e. pre-90nm) processes.<p>All of those chips are in the &quot;security flaw equals remote root&quot; category.<p>SkyWater&#x27;s 130nm process is compatible with on-die flash (unlike most post-90nm and nearly all post-40nm processes).  You could do a &quot;secure enclave&quot; or your own Hardware Security Module and not have to worry about backdoors.<p>But to answer your question directly: this isn&#x27;t about making an iPhone comeptitor.')
