This is strictly worse than what we have now.<p>This is a double standard. C was created in 1972 and standardized in 1989. A major C compiler (MSVC) doesn&#x27;t even fully implement C99 from 21 years ago.<p>C++ itself was created in 1985 and standardised in 1998. Yet it was adopted.<p>Yes, things have changed and the bar has been raised. But people don&#x27;t seem to have followed your reasoning even for C and C++.<p>&gt; Apart from kernels and drivers (where Rust seems an outright no-go)<p>Why? From what I&#x27;ve read Rust can actually help with managing hardware resources through its semantics. What blocks it from being used?')
