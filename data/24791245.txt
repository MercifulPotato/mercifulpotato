However, bear in mind, Google argued that 1. APIs weren&#x27;t copyrightable and 2. that <i>if they were</i>, their usage was fair. In this ten year court nightmare, they&#x27;ve lost fair use and of course, are <i>likely</i> about to lose on copyrightability.<p>If the Supreme Court rules for Oracle, Android is copyright-infringing, it&#x27;s already failed on the fair use claim. But most non-commercial projects would still have a fairly compelling case for fair use.<p>Note that your &quot;copied a book&quot; analogy is poor for a bunch of reasons: Chapter headlines... are copyrightable. (Though the &quot;amount of work copied&quot; is a fair use pillar, so it&#x27;s possible to lift chapter headlines fairly.) And it fails to account for the <i>functional</i> nature of APIs which is under debate for copyrightability.')
