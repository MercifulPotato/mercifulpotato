Now they have better tools to transfer email but after some thought, i wanted to start over with everything.<p>It did feel really good once it was done.  It forced me to evaluate what was important vs what wasn’t, and it got me pretty organized.<p>Not for everyone but its doable.  My guess is it took 6 months for me.  I do have my gmail account yet just in case but its been a few years since anything important showed up there.  I mainly keep it for youtube anyway.')
