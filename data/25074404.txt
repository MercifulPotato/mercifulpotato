Once that customer went away, it became unsustainable given the high R&amp;D costs combined with questionable demand for discrete modems.<p>Intel&#x27;s flirtation with low-end embedded devices makes sense on the basis that they already were using low-power Pentium-derived cores as embedded controllers, so why not offer them as standalone products. I think they clearly underestimated the costs of packaging and support for external customers, as well as the dominance ARM&#x27;s Cortex-M series would establish.')
