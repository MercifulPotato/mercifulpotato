So while there are a variety of styles most code uses mostly the same style.<p>&gt; I&#x27;m personally of the opinion that less is more.<p>Sure, but you normally want to have a &quot;complete well rounded language&quot;.<p>For this in rust you need GAT, but you don&#x27;t need HKT, Functors, Monades or similar.<p>I hope there will never be a Monade trait in std, it would add a lot of mostly hardly useful complexity we really don&#x27;t need and would mostly be used for IMHO mostly useless over abstraction.<p>But GAT are really needed. E.g. to properly work with certain async use cases (through for this you only need GAT for lifetimes, not arbitrary type. In my experience GAT limited to lifetimes cover 80+% of the cases where you really really need GAT).')
