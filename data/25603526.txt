While this is the mathematical definition, I will be using the term sparse for matrices with only NNZ elements and dense for matrices with all elements.”<p>No, this is not the mathematical definition. An n-by-n matrix is usually considered sparse if the number of nonzero elements is O(n). Which means that the ratio of nonzero elements goes to zero as the matrix grows.')
