On expert&#x2F;master levels a good song is a serious aerobic workout but I can&#x27;t do more than 1-2 songs at a time because sweating in VR sucks. Heck, probably just standing in front of a polarized 3D display with polarized 3D glasses and VR motion controllers would work. I find it extremely fun and would be happy to do it as a workout.')
