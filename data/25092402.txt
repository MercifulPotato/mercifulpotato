This makes a lot of sense on mobile phones (where the display is usually in portrait orientation and vertically stacked buttons are easier to reach with the thumb), but it doesn&#x27;t make much sense on a big landscape display.<p>Some dialog boxes use a horizontal button arrangement though, so I guess the vertical arrangement is not hardwired (the &quot;randomness&quot; is puzzling though).<p>Other then that the new design has surprisingly quickly grown on me, even though I&#x27;m a bit of a &quot;flat UI luddite&quot;.')
