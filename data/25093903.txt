I do not want my laptop to be like my cell phone. I frequently write crappy programs on my computer, and I&#x27;ve been totally fine with the earlier implementation of warnings unless you navigate to the application directory and explicitly open it and accept the warnings. As per the question, &quot;Who better than Apple?&quot;, I wanna do bad all on my own. I do not have the technical ability to make a Linux laptop as good in terms of industrial design or hardware responsiveness (the touchpad on the laptop and the desktop version are the best user input devices ever for me), and that is what keeps me on their products. Otherwise, I&#x27;d be full time Linux again. I&#x27;m so confused as to whether or not to jump ship, and I feel like if I do I will be walking the plank')
