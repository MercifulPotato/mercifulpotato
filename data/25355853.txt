Other certification organizations are different.<p>Mauritius had fantastic diving, but the sites tend to <i>start</i> at 25m. I think I saw 60m sites listed among the well know locales, although the deepest my divemasters went the week I was there was 46m (deeper would need more complex decompression stops and multiple tanks for more than a minute or so at the bottom). I think NAUI was the predominant body on the island at the time.')
