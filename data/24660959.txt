Item(by='gambiting', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601633414, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24660862, text='Well, you have conveniently omitted the next couple words from that sentence - &quot;it&#x27;s not systematic racism [like in the US]&quot;, which is what my argument was built upon, and the reason for the entire comment. Media treat is <i>as if</i> American problems not only exist in Poland, but also as if they have the same root causes as in the US.<p>Poland does of course have systematic racism problems - for instance against the Roma people, of whom there is a non-insignificant number and who are discriminated against literally everywhere. Same with immigrants, regardless of their skin colour - Ukrainians who come to work in Poland are treated very poorly and portrayed negatively just for who they are. That is systematic racism.<p>BUT - it&#x27;s not systematic racism <i>like in the US</i> where (as far as I can understand) the racism is rooted in history of slave ownership, general belief that black people are inferior and deep history of segregation normalizing the process. None of those apply in Poland, yet some people behave as if they do - and that is what I object to.')
