Consider that this state basically solved the homeless problem by violating a sacred principle which, fully expressed in coastal cities, neither seems to actually help the homeless nor the residents around them. It&#x27;s possible that the firewall between civic and religious institutions isn&#x27;t a universal evil.<p>&quot;Separation of Church and State&quot; being a sacred principle is quite ironic.<p>I think one of the biggest political problems in the US right now is the fixation on dogma for its own sake.  It&#x27;s happening all over the political spectrum and predictably leads to the dysfunction of polarization (where factional dogmas conflict) or dysfunction of purity (where there&#x27;s little dogmatic conflict, because the dogmas are always incomplete).  We&#x27;re probably overdue for an era of pragmatic compromise.')
