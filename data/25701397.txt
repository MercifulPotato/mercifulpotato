The only debate is about what they ought to do, and whether the laws should be changed as a result of those preferences.<p>Regarding Parler: it is a large platform with a mixture of conservative speech and outright violent rhetoric. Does that justify its ban? The same is true for Twitter and FB (ie there exists a large amount of unmoderated extremist speech and calls for violence on these platforms). What makes it right to ban only Parler? Is there evidence that the density of such speech is higher there?')
