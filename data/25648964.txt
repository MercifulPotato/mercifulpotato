Item(by='CydeWeys', descendants=None, kids=[25649553], score=None, time=1609871273, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25646871, text='&gt; In the US roads are mostly maintained by taxes on gas.<p>This is a common misconception.  Most road funding comes from the Fed and state&#x2F;local income and property taxes.  Gasoline taxes exist but do not comprise the majority of funding.  It&#x27;s important to emphasize this because I pay a LOT in taxes but don&#x27;t even so much as own a car, so I&#x27;m paying way more than my fair share for road upkeep.<p>The solution would be simple -- tax based on odometer reading (and do it federally, so you can&#x27;t get around it by moving cars between states).  Every year as part of your taxes you&#x27;d look at your odometer and then pay an amount per mile driven since last year, and periodic vehicle registration renewals would keep people honest (there&#x27;d be the same kind of penalty fee there as for paying taxes late).  So long as all the states require vehicle registration and send that data to the feds, it&#x27;ll work.  The states could also have their own tax on top.')
