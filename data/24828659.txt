There are successful podcasters that are far more clueless than Lex (e.g. Joe rogan) and he s not interrupting much. In general the interviewee is usually the center of attention, and they seem to be actually going pretty deep on presenting their theses or personal ideas (e.g.  sebastian thrun, joscha bach, george hotz, lisa feldman, james gosling). As for a few cringey  questions in 1.5 hours, it&#x27;s like a restful interlude, after all talking can become exhausting. Do people think the interviewees are offended by Lex&#x27;s (few) obsessions (Musk,dostoyevsky,his soviet past)? It certainly doesnt seem so judging from their reactions during the interview and after (in twitter etc).<p>Being in MIT probably gave him easy access to the interesting people that started off his podcast, but beyond that i think his affable , empathetic and easy style is rather attractive, so people don&#x27;t say no to him, and many have returned back.')
