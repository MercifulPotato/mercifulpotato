I&#x27;m a complete layperson in nutritional science so even though this speaks to me as a genuinely important perspective when it comes the bias of nutritional science I&#x27;d like to know if this is going to have any influence in the future.<p>Additionally, how does this affect common meal replacements like soylent, huel, etc?
