That perfect 305mm x 305mm x 305mm (1 foot x 1 foot x 1 foot) magnesium cube was hell to produce, but gorgeous to look at.  And, it was the machine that the original web server ran on at CERN. [0]<p>I&#x27;ve kind of always wanted one of them, but I&#x27;ve also kind of wondered if I&#x27;d be disappointed by it, if I got one.  After all, it only ran at 25mhz.<p>What I&#x27;d <i>really</i> like to do is get an empty case and put a modern PC inside it.  That would be awesome.  You&#x27;d probably have to gut the case and put in new mounting hardware, but a mini-ATX or micro-ATX board would definitely fit in there.  There should be room for drive rails and a PSU, but I wonder if ventilation would be a problem.<p>Perhaps the most fitting thing to stuff in there would be a Mac, or, maybe, a Hackintosh.<p>---<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;artsandculture.google.com&#x2F;asset&#x2F;original-next-computer-used-by-sir-tim-berners-lee-to-design-the-world-wide-web-next&#x2F;6QHcxbuGnQ4rng?hl=en" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;artsandculture.google.com&#x2F;asset&#x2F;original-next-comput...</a>')
