You can blame the constitution for deferring election procedures to each state.<p>In PA, for example, the legislature (which is GOP I might add) forbid counting mail-in ballots until election day. That basically guarantees delays.<p>Have you been around for Gore vs Bush? I&#x27;m not sure why you&#x27;re claiming this is one of the worst elections. Most close elections aren&#x27;t called on election day. Almost every state continues counting past election day. It&#x27;s just you&#x27;re only hearing about the ones that are close.')
