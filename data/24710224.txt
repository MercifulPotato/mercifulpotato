By the time you come in contact with real patients (as a student), you&#x27;ve done the equivalent of nearly a hundred technical interviews. It&#x27;s increasingly common to be doing them both in Spanish and English as well.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Objective_structured_clinical_examination" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Objective_structured_clinical_...</a><p>&quot;It is designed to test clinical skill performance and competence in skills such as communication, clinical examination, medical procedures prescription, exercise prescription, joint mobilisation&#x2F;manipulation techniques, radiographic positioning, radiographic image evaluation, and interpretation of results.&quot;<p>&quot;An OSCE usually comprises a circuit of short (the usual is 5â€“10 minutes although some use up to 15 minute) stations, in which each candidate is examined on a one-to-one basis with one or two impartial examiner(s) and either real or simulated (actors or electronic patient simulators) patients.<p>Each station has a different examiner, as opposed to the traditional method of clinical examinations where a candidate would be assigned to an examiner for the entire examination. Candidates rotate through the stations, completing all the stations on their circuit. In this way, all candidates take the same stations. It is considered to be an improvement over traditional examination methods because the stations can be standardised enabling fairer peer comparison and complex procedures can be assessed without endangering patients health.&quot;')
