That makes it possible to implement a RISC-V core on a very small silicon die. Smaller simpler cores make it easier to increase clock frequency as well as reduce watt usage. That gives RISC-V an advantage over the competition such as ARM, where any implementation will require a  much larger and complex core to handle all the ARM instructions you must implement to be a valid ARM CPU.')
