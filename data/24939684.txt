We&#x27;re all skilled at some things and not at others.  Apply to jobs that look interesting to you and try to get them!<p>Hiring managers are often faced with the same dilemma: &quot;my job requires a little of this and a dash of that and a bunch of this other stuff.  And I don&#x27;t want a bunch of bums to apply, but I don&#x27;t need rocket surgeons either.&quot; and we take a random stab at a job description and desired qualifications and post it.<p>Find a job that looks interesting, tailor your resume a bit to fit, and see what happens.  If you get a call, strike up a conversation about your experience solving disparate problems and your interest.  Hiring managers (usually) care more about that stuff than any specific skill set, even if the job description might imply otherwise.')
