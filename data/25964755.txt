Countries (notably the US) didn&#x27;t work through the past year to build out socialized manufacturing capacity for additional dose production - everyone has been making purchasing agreements and everyone knows that everybody is going to need it.<p>These pushes to outbid other countries might go toward funding additional capacity for the next pandemic, but these corporations didn&#x27;t have enough warning to know that they were the ones that&#x27;d need to make this investment so, for the moment, all of these countries securing additional doses are securing them out of the pockets of other countries.')
