It just didn&#x27;t dawn on me that maybe what they meant on Safari is the new IE in terms of the workarounds (which were harder because there is no conditional comments unlike in IE). I have said that Chrome is the new IE because not of the bugs but more of the very Microsoft way of apparent EEE (but otherwise they tend to try to implement specs in a more tested way).<p>I should have worded it in a better way, and when someone said &quot;X is the new IE&quot; I should view the context of it. &quot;Chrome is the new IE&quot; is a very valid opinion, but not in all contexts, and so is &quot;Safari is the new IE&quot;.')
