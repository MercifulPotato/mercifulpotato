That is much more valuable knowledge for most people then knowing higher math and English literature.<p>Another place that the education system is totally worthless is healthcare. Do the schools teach us to contact our insurance companies for interaction Id numbers to see if a provider is in network and then proce we contacted 6months later...hah no. Yet just this last week I had two different providers offices try and schedule me for an appointment costing $160-$200 that subsequently my insurance would not pay for. However the in-network rate is $10. Yes this is a mess but even though it is a mess education is instead trying to teach a classical liberal arts education which most people neither want nor need.<p>We need educational reform in this country and significant cuts to the educational system could be exactly what is needed as a wake-up call.')
