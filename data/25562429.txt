I got my summary slightly wrong; buildings aren&#x27;t re-financed, but rather the owner has the ability to delay payment on any unleased units. Leasing a unit at a lower rate suddenly modifies the value of the building, which means signing a lower lease can put the loan underwater. The same basic motivation structure applies though, it is far better for the owner to leave a unit empty and pray that someone can rent it at market rates later than it is to lower rates and get a tenant now.<p>0 - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;old.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;nyc&#x2F;comments&#x2F;innhah&#x2F;nearly_twothirds_of_new_york_restaurants_may_have&#x2F;g49g4c5&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;old.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;nyc&#x2F;comments&#x2F;innhah&#x2F;nearly_twothird...</a>')
