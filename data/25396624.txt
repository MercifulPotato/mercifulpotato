Facebook is not a government, they can&#x27;t and should not police&#x2F;persecute people. Are you going to shutdown car manufacturers because a psycho used his car to plow though bystanders on a bus stop?<p>Everything facebook has been asked to do is utterly futile. Sure, they can remove a post or two but the person making those posts still runs free.<p>Fabeook is a victim of their popularity. Because of their size they&#x27;re easy to blame for pre-existing problems government neglected for too long. Government just doesn&#x27;t want to deal with any of that for real and so will just throw an angry finger at FB and shift blame.')
