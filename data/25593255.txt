Approximately 5 Kg of Carbon is burned for each tonne of iron, releasing 20 Kg of CO2.<p>This article is mostly about hydrogen-fuelled direct reduction, the step before the the EAF. Some iron is already produced using DR but using conventional fossil fuels, and this plant would use renewable hydrogen instead of fossil carbon as the reducing agent.')
