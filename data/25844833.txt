The studies and research I&#x27;ve read indicates that the people mostly trust and appreciate the balance in German public broadcasting, and most disgruntled with public broadcasting in Germany are on the radical sides. The second bit is more universally supported by psychological research indicating that the average person wants to watch stuff that confirms their biases.<p>&gt; Except you can&#x27;t give certain organizations a unique monopoly to collect fees from everyone and then call it independent with a straight face.<p>You&#x27;re perverting the meaning of monopoly here, I think. There&#x27;s a publicly funded infrastructure for broadcast programming, as well as privately funded sources of programming. ZDF and ARD don&#x27;t have exclusive right to broadcast in any market in Germany as far as I know?<p>The publicly funded infrastructure includes representative oversight mechanisms from political and community sources, which provide a far more robust mechanism for neutrality checking vs the programming decisions of a profit-motivated private organization.<p>&gt; Finally, unlike taxes<p>Means testing is a fantastic point, I whole-heartedly agree that statutory funding structures like this shouldn&#x27;t overburden any slice of the population.')
