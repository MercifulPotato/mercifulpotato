I didn’t get the message until a week later when I figured it out and deleted some photos. Pretty dumb.<p>Also, Gmail delivers an in-band message about your quota, but not in Inbox, Inbox for iOS, nor the Gmail app for iOS nor Gmail for mobile web.  ONLY Gmail classic for desktop web. So I didn’t get those banners, either.<p>In other words I still find this quota system difficult to use despite the fact that I was the tech lead of Gmail delivery SRE for years.')
