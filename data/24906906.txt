I had a Canon 5D Mark 4 and it had the option to (s)ftp up raws so I wouldn&#x27;t have to take out the card. So I went to the trouble of setting up my own secure ftp server. Guess what. It didn&#x27;t work. I tried everything from raw IP, to a naked domain, to a ftp domain, whatever it was there was absolutely no way of getting Canon to make the connection securely.<p>That&#x27;s why everything is moving to HTTPS endpoints. It&#x27;s simple. You just give a url and it works.')
