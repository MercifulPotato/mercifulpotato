That isn&#x27;t to say they aren&#x27;t out there, only that anyone who has one is negligent in not updated&#x2F;replacing it within the last 15 years or so.  IPv6 is not a new thing, it was already live in 1996 (my memory might be a little off, but not much).  Maybe you have turned off IPv6, but it should be supported and any competent IT should have a plan to turn it on (it might be a 5 year plan without any budget, but the plan should exist).  Likewise you should have a plan to turn off IPv4 (if this plan has a budget it should be paid for entirely by the sale of your existing IPv4 block - this is mostly the business costs of IPv4 only customers being unable to reach you NOT the technical cost of updating all your servers)')
