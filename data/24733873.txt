Item(by='setr', descendants=None, kids=[24733944], score=None, time=1602273982, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24733517, text='No, I&#x27;m still not understanding. Here&#x27;s my thinking:<p>Scenario #1: If the tuples are the same shape (type, size), it&#x27;s fine<p><pre><code>    [\n       (string, int, date)\n       (string, int, date)\n       (string, int, date)\n    ]\n</code></pre>\ntransposed:<p><pre><code>    [\n       (string, string, string)\n       (int, int, int)\n       (date, date, date)\n    ]\n</code></pre>\nBoth input and output have tables with consistent shapes (type, size)<p>Scenario #2: Assuming its legal, if the tuples are differently shaped (by datatype), its weird (but that was true of your original table anyways), but you can still do a valid transposition to produce a valid table<p><pre><code>    [\n       (string, int, date)\n       (int, date, string)\n    ]\n</code></pre>\ntransposed:<p><pre><code>    [\n       (string, int)\n       (int, date)\n       (date, string)\n    ]\n</code></pre>\nIt was weird to begin with, and it&#x27;s similarly weird to end with. I can&#x27;t imagine the output not being a legal table by any rule that does not also disallow the input.<p>Scenario #3: Similarly to scenario 2, If your tuples are differently shaped (by size), you can still do a transposition<p><pre><code>    [\n       (string, int)\n       (string, int, date)\n    ]\n</code></pre>\ntransposed:<p><pre><code>    [\n       (string, string)\n       (int, int)\n       (date)\n    ]\n</code></pre>\nand like Scenario #2, the output is as illegal as the input<p>In the latter two cases, I don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;d want to do with the transposition (or even its input), but I don&#x27;t see anything stopping the operation itself from being reasonable&#x2F;consistent&#x2F;valid.<p>Is there another scenario I&#x27;m failing to imagine?')
