I once got in an argument with a manager that we should measure best coders on the team by lines of code generated - is that merit?<p>To extend the analogy  in the piece, if the only way a football team measured “best” was for “yards passed” that’d be a pretty bad team on the field. They measure by position to figure out what’s right - and techniques like those made famous by SaberMetrics&#x2F;Moneyball show even THAT is not all - you REALLY need to measure by team performance and team goals.<p>Teams that are diverse deliver materially better returns[1]; if that’s “merit” then that’s a way to optimize for that. The problem with this article and meritocracies is not diving deeper in what you should measure.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forbes.com&#x2F;sites&#x2F;forbesinsights&#x2F;2020&#x2F;01&#x2F;15&#x2F;diversity-confirmed-to-boost-innovation-and-financial-results&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forbes.com&#x2F;sites&#x2F;forbesinsights&#x2F;2020&#x2F;01&#x2F;15&#x2F;diver...</a>')
