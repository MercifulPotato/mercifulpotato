There are a lot of things like that you can do in Java which people just don&#x27;t do that makes many things a lot cleaner. Its just that the eco system standards were set by people who thought that having unique class names were super important even though Java already have namespacing. Also that you need to have 100% super guaranteed unique global namespaces making your folder structure that horrible net.xxx.abc.adsasd.dfer.cthulu things, which for some reason wasn&#x27;t needed in any other programming language and it worked just fine for them so you don&#x27;t need that either.')
