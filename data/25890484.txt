There are a lot of things like that you can do in Java which people just don&#x27;t do that makes many things a lot cleaner. Its just that the eco system standards were set by people who thought that having unique class names were super important even though Java already have namespacing.<p>Also that you need to have 100% super guaranteed unique global namespaces making your folder structure that horrible net.xxx.abc.adsasd.dfer.cthulu.NetXxxAbcAdsasdUtilityHelperBuilderFactory things, which for some reason wasn&#x27;t needed in any other programming language and it worked just fine for them so you don&#x27;t need that either.<p>With that instead of importing stuff you could just write something like, assuming each library have a sensible top level name:<p><pre><code>    gzip.File g = gzip.File.FromDirectory(dir);\n</code></pre>\nWhen I write Java personally it looks closer to that. And when I follow a corporate style I write it more like that, as close as possible while still following the style guide. I 100% believe Java could have been a nice experience if it didn&#x27;t have its horrible over engineered style guides.')
