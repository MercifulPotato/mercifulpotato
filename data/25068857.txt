They want to know about the Java that I did 10 years ago, or whether I have Kafka, Python and machine learning, or maybe some JS.<p>Maybe this has something to do with the few Ruby giants not taking CVs from recruiters, but those giants aren&#x27;t calling me back either. :shrug, maybe it&#x27;s just me.')
