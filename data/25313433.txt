I FEEL satisfied with my selection in hand, that I have acquired a goodly amount of reading material on a subject or by an author who I feel is worthy of my time.<p>I open the book and skim the contents page, a worthy array of subjects that pique my interest entice me on but the MEDIUM prevents me from an indulgent glance. I understand inherently that I am expected to progress through the material with the author, at their pace before I can uncover the gold within.<p>I open the article &#x27;The Erosion of Deep Literacy&#x27; in my browser. A PROGRESS METER appears on the right-hand side known as the scroll-bar telling me this article is longer than a three minute read, and that I have a LONG WAIT ahead before my progress is complete.<p>Immediately I want to know if the article is worth my time and without a CONTENTS PAGE to assure me I flick the oh-so convenient mouse wheel or thumb across my screen and scroll to the bottom with happy abandon!<p>JUDGEMENT BEGINS as I scan for hints of life; highlighted text, INFO BOXES.. PICTURES!? my guide-posts of worthiness are lacking and emotions set in.. Do I really WANT to spend fifteen whole minutes here?<p>Long-form is dead on the web of my heart, flicked away like a tik-tok meme that took too long to load... oh look, a butterfly!')
