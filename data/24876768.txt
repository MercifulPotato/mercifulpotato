Run it as long as people pay their shares in advance. If someone is late (and has no defensible reason, like out of country etc) - dump them = ups the share or get a new body to fill in. This is a small enough amount that you should be glad you found out about them for $7. Have nothing more to do with them for the rest of your life - or you would be giving them another chance to cheat you. Shed people when they show they are of bad character or they will wear you down over time.')
