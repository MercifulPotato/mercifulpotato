Of course, somebody will have to run them but I imagine distributions or some orgs could? We&#x27;re talking here about implementing bookmarks sync, with the API already known (since it&#x27;s client is implemented in the open-source Chromium). I mean I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;d require some work, but no &quot;writing a new OS from scratch&quot; level of work, rather &quot;implement a simple API&quot; level of work. Am I missing anything here?')
