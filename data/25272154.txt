I believe Ethereum and some other cryptocurrencies prefer to use deterministic signatures on transactions, so in theory it&#x27;s possible to check that all of the signatures generated by the hardware wallet match the expected deterministic signatures so you can know that the wallet isn&#x27;t secretly leaking information through the signatures it&#x27;s generating.')
