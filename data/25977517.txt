There&#x27;s a reason high refresh monitors are loved by serious gamers. \nThe biggest improvement with 144Hz is motion clarity, but you can cheese it with tricks like strobing or Black Frame Insertation (BFI). I keep a CRT around for this reason.<p>&gt; I cannot play a game with noticeable input lag whatsoever, even if it was at 4k HDR 144hz. \nPeople are surprisingly tolerant of different latencies.\nMany Vsync implementations end up with 4-5 frames of latency, which ends up around 75ms, and consoles that run at 30FPS (or 20 FPS like some N64 classics!) can be in excess of 100ms. If the game is designed around it, people will adapt (just like people adapt to 24fps movies).<p>I agree though, if you want games to feel like your is physically connected, 10-20ms is what most folks in the VR industry are targeting.')
