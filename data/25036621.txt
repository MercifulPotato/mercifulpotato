We cannot be a nation of a single people due to the diversity of people spread across an immense chunk of land.  What is important to me in Alaska is only tangentially related to what is important in NYC.  A popular vote is a path to disbanding states and removes an important protection by the states against a tyrannical national government.  By maintaining states we allow issues of state importance to only be important in that state instead of requiring the whole nation be subject.')
