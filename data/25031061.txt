Item(by='perryizgr8', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604890921, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25024996, text='&gt; RBI doesnâ€™t want any single payment app to have more than 30% market share<p>Got it, but how do you limit an app? Does google pay simply stop onboarding new users at some point? Do my transactions start failing after a certain day of the month? Both of these are horrible UX and unfair to google pay who has developed their good user experience.<p>If this rule is not rolled back, I predict that India&#x27;s digital payments landscape will be a barren wasteland in a year&#x27;s time. There is no incentive for Google or Phonepe or Paytm to continue working on an app that is guaranteed to never grow beyond where they already are.<p>Personally, if gpay transactions become unreliable because they have to drop every 5th transaction to satisfy the quota, I&#x27;ll switch back to cash.')
