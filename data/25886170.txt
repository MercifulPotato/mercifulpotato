Even when people aren&#x27;t on the platform, they usually respond to the &quot;Hey I want to send you $50 email&quot;.<p>But this could definitely be a problem if the site grows and I don&#x27;t have enough time to track down people.<p>Another suggestion I&#x27;ve had for abandoned funds is to redistribute across the repo. i.e. A $100 issue for OBS was closed&#x2F;abandoned&#x2F;etc, so the $100 is split and the remaining OBS issues get $100&#x2F;n added to the bounty.')
