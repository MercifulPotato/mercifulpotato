To anyone who&#x27;s the least bit of a political dissident, alarm bells should be screaming in your ears. If a handful of tech execs can (and will) do this to the US president, what chance would you stand against them, or anyone, if they want to silence you?<p>Your question is weirdly lacking in context.  There was an attack on Congress, whose nastiest bits were openly planned on Parler.  It&#x27;s not like these companies just suddenly decided to cut ties because they didn&#x27;t like Trump&#x27;s views. They&#x27;ve actually been extremely tolerant of him, giving him  policy exceptions left and right (e.g. if he wasn&#x27;t the president, he&#x27;d probably have been banned from Twitter <i>years</i> ago).<p>&gt; Would it be possible to host your political views on any commercial hosting vendor in this case? Is running a server at home enough, assuming you can avoid DOS somehow? Would you have to start your own ISP, and if so, could your ISP be kicked off the backbone?<p>&gt; I&#x27;m interested in this as a technical (not political) question: is there any way to speak online if big tech decides they don&#x27;t want you to?<p>Obviously, yes.  Donald Trump has a website (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.donaldjtrump.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.donaldjtrump.com&#x2F;</a>), and it&#x27;s still up.  He can speak online there.')
