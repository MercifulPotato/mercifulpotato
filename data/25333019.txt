I&#x27;ve got an electric Samsung range that heats fully evenly, to the point it&#x27;s mildly annoying (no cold spots in the pan for the thinner parts of food). The dials correspond to element temperatures under positive control. There&#x27;s also an induction zone that boils water in three minutes.<p>It&#x27;s definitely more expensive than an equal-performing gas range would be, both in initial cost and continuing operation, but it&#x27;s also easier to clean and allows me to not have natural gas at all.')
