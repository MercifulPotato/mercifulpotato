This is Apple&#x27;s first and lowest end M series chip, and it&#x27;s blowing away Intel chips with discrete GPUs and more RAM. Their higher end processors which will be coming out over the next couple years are likely to be much better... and will support 32GB of RAM. In fact since Apple is migrating the entire line-up, it&#x27;s likely the next generation of CPUs will support discrete RAM so the Mac Pro can offer systems with massive amounts of RAM as the current Mac Pro does.<p>&gt; I need to boot up Windows in a VM for specialized apps<p>Aside from getting ARM Windows running on the Mac hypervisor, Windows VMs seem pretty unlikely. Another possibility is someone porting or creating an x86 emulator to run on the hypervisor.<p>Aside from that, Crossover by Code Weavers or something like AWS Workspaces are your best bets.')
