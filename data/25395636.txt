The FB numbers suggest FB is way worse, but the FB and Twitter numbers are platform reported rather than externally identified.<p>FB and Twitter make more reports and publish more transparently. Iâ€™d also wager that reports = (all content #)<i>(prevalence rate of CSAM)</i>(detection sensitivity)*(reporting rate) and FB&#x2F;TWTR probably have infinitely higher first terms, and better 3 and 4th terms in the equation.')
