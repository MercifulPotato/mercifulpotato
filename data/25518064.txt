It&#x27;s not just skill vs luck, it&#x27;s also willingness to throw everything else under the bus in favor of income.<p>Take for example US colleges: I&#x27;m pretty sure that tuition inflation doesn&#x27;t quite lead to a large windfall for the best at teaching and researching, but surely for apex administrators. And considering the serpentine nature of career paths leading to the top of education administrations, low level administrators couldn&#x27;t ever reach those positions through skill or hard work. The career path is basically feign academic ambition until there&#x27;s window for defecting to administration. Similar compromise-paved ways to economic success exist in corporate cultures and even an entrepreneur will often be faced with a decision between money and other goals and qualities.<p>American culture likes to glorify greed as ambition, but there are more ambitions be had than money and power.')
