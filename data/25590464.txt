It&#x27;s relatively hard to imagine how you&#x27;d have widespread increase in price without increase in cost of labour.</i><p>I’m going to step away from the word correlation because I think it will lead us down a never ending path.<p>Wages are not <i>keeping pace</i> with inflation. I’m not saying it needs to be 1:1, but businesses have managed to stunt wage growth at a much lower multiple. That is one hell of a tax on people’s wealth.<p>So now the question is, is what I just said true? Year after year there’s tons of data and literature on how wages haven’t budged in relation to inflation. The public is constantly being shown these arguments similar to Climate change.<p>I think ultimately the government doesn’t care that your earning power is not keeping pace because it is thematically consistent with what monetary easing is trying to do. The whole point is to not let your money sit around and appreciate, the whole point is to have your money in fight-flight mode at all times to keep the economy from stagnating. There is nothing in that policy that has anything to do with increasing your earning power or raw appreciation of your current wealth.<p>So be it, the failure here is that if the average person’s money needs to be put to work, there has to be more vehicles available to the average person. When your typical business doesn’t even offer a 401k, when wages only grow at a 0.1-0.3x of inflation, you can’t reasonably expect someone to stow away the max 5k contribution yearly in an independent IRA. Your average worker is simply not able to do this, and this is the failure I’m mostly speaking to.<p>Lastly, the word pension is a vestige. I worked at a large Corp that had pensions once. When I got there, there policy changed so that anyone after around the late 2000s would not receive a pension, and they would stop adding to the pension fund for those that came before. Millennial&#x2F;Z will never hear the word pension again, so it’s not a fair point to make.<p>The best current generations can do is save for a down payment on a house, and be locked financially to the mortgage payment. To have a fighting chance at this in these crazy housing markets, you need to make some sacrifices to hit that down payment. Nothing else about our system is going to help you, and all monetary policy is trying to outpace you at this point globally.')
