HUDs are an absurdly awesome coolness and safety feature. I don&#x27;t care about how the dashboard looks because I <i>don&#x27;t want to look away from the road</i>! Seeing this is extremely impressive and I hope that we can get AR technology to see widespread adoption in cars ASAP. The fact that we have to wait until 2024 (and for us Toyota or Lexus drivers 2028-2030) is just embarrassing. Why isn&#x27;t this coming in the next year?<p>Tesla&#x27;s refuse to add them and the aftermarket options suck, so I can&#x27;t buy one either which is extremely sad.')
