If everyone wore masks then we wouldn&#x27;t be where we are. The reason we need the shutdowns is because people don&#x27;t listen to other guidance so shutdowns are the only option left to slow the spread.<p>If everyone wore masks (and wore them properly) then yes, we could go about our lives as if nothing happened, but anybody with a pair of eyes can tell you that&#x27;s not the case.<p>Also, many of the people that are against shutdowns (that don&#x27;t have an ulterior motive) are against them because people are out of work and creates issues with poverty. They are not against it because it doesn&#x27;t help. So rather than saying no shutdowns, how about we take the <i>proper</i> steps and have a moratorium on rent and mortgages so solve the root of the issue.')
