Item(by='schoen', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609407143, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25590880, text='Yes, and there&#x27;s a clear mix of threat models (for instance, sometimes the guide seems to be emphasizing Whonix-style user anonymity, but other times something else entirely).<p>I see some very interesting things to go learn about in this guide, but as you note, it&#x27;s not really presented that way. I would find it more useful if it either picked a more specific threat model and stuck to it, <i>or</i> suggested a particular system that has already made opinionated choices on some of these protection mechanisms (maybe like Whonix, Tails, or Qubes), <i>or</i> invited a discussion of &quot;for each of these options, why isn&#x27;t it already the default everywhere? did some people find the associated threats too exotic, unlikely, or irrelevant? are there harsh tradeoffs here?&quot;.<p>One example for me is the ptrace restrictions. It&#x27;s clearly true that attackers can use ptrace to attach to a running process to steal secrets (if you are relying on processes as a security boundary, this feature will tend to pierce it), which was the main motivation for the kernel having an option to restrict it. On the other hand, if you&#x27;re a software developer or security researcher dealing with binary executables, ptrace is very helpful to you and you may be irritated if you turn it off. That might be a sign that there should be different OS default profiles for &quot;R&amp;D&quot; and for &quot;production server&quot; or &quot;dedicated administrative workstation&quot; (or maybe not), and perhaps if you don&#x27;t know what ptrace is you <i>should</i> default to disabling it, but it still strikes me the wrong way not to see any context about this.')
