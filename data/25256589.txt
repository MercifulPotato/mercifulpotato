Unless they&#x27;re directed to make those preparations (and not just <i>plans</i> for the event, but actually start implementing which costs a lot more), they won&#x27;t.<p>The distinction I&#x27;m making: A <i>plan</i> may take 1-4 weeks to form with 1-10 participants. They could tell you exactly what&#x27;s needed in order to implement a stimulus check program like this safely and accurately. But the <i>implementation</i> is going to take weeks or months more work and 10-1000 participants to effect it.<p>The planning is &quot;cheap&quot; and done as a matter of course. That covers things like disaster recover and conops. But it doesn&#x27;t, on its own, actually create a final &quot;product&quot;. Only the plan for what to do when an emergency or directive comes down the pipe.<p>The implementation is expensive. And they need authority to execute it. If they&#x27;re not funded for it, they aren&#x27;t going to do it.')
