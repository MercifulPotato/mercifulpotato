There&#x27;s hardly a need for a _revolution_; strong stability and support is needed but there&#x27;s just no paying market for it by the looks of it.<p>4 biggest desktop environments are by mega corporations (apple, microsoft) and by big open-source collectives (Gnome, KDE). But is that it?  \nNo, there&#x27;s also a bunch of tilling-window managers with their own desktop philosophies, there are entire terminal drawing frameworks with full GUI support.<p>Desktop is awesome. If anything mobile is the one needing to catch up. iOS and Android are awful, awful environments outside of casual usage. Just try writing up a document on your phone!   \nJust imagine what could be if they were on the level  _desktops_?<p>Real question: Do we continue to dumb down software to exclusive casual usage for house-moms or we try to move our society to be more techn savy as we are clearly moving to a more tech relying  world. Why shouldn&#x27;t everyone know how to code?<p>To paraprashe Mr. Engelbart: it&#x27;s a failed tool if you use it exactly the same way the day you bought it and a year after.')
