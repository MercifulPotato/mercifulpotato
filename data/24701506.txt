His compensation is decidedly west coast: ~30% annual bonus and insane RSU grants, while his base is near or below mine.  Stock offerings are atypical in the companies in many of these areas, and 30% bonus is unheard of for technical people.<p>So while LCOL areas may have better base comp, people expecting six figures worth of stock grants aren&#x27;t going to bite.<p>What that means I&#x27;m not smart enough to know. :)')
