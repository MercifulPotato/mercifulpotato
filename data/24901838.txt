Determining the semantics of wierd assembly is even harder. At least for syntax you can just see confirm if gnu-as accepts it.<p>&gt; Did I miss anything else?<p>I haven&#x27;t looked into what is actually parsing at all, but it correctly accepts things like %hi, strings delimited by quotes, @function, labels that are just numbers. I had expected some of those to be rejects based on the post.<p>I don&#x27;t know what else might fail because I can&#x27;t try any auto generated code because of the period label issue. I would recommend trying the assembly generated by compiling this project; it shows a bunch of weird pieces of syntax.')
