Spent quite some money on it as a student. It only lasted me 2 years. After that its chasis started to come apart, screen died and a few other things.<p>System76 really seems like a good idea, but one bad experience is enough for me to spend my 1000$ on another brand. Thinkpad has been a much better experience so far')
