A co-worker almost died on the scariest one after getting hit from behind, but was lucky enough to roll next to the car and only lose the bike.<p>Other risky ones are where the driver that&#x27;s merging in won&#x27;t expect a bike and suddenly blocks the bike lane to get a better view of the traffic. This generally happens on the long streets with fast traffic 45m&#x2F;h+ as few bikers take the risk making it more likely that drivers &quot;forget&quot; that there&#x27;s bike traffic.')
