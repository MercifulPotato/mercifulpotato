This is a topic that&#x27;s dear to my heart and have blogged occasionally about it... but never in such a comprehensive form. Great job! Now... I gotta read through everything.<p>But... here is a series of blog posts in which I covered similar themes years ago: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jmmv.dev&#x2F;series.html#CLI%20design" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jmmv.dev&#x2F;series.html#CLI%20design</a><p>And here is another single post that touches upon a single guideline I came across while skimming through the text: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jmmv.dev&#x2F;2020&#x2F;08&#x2F;config-files-vs-directories.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jmmv.dev&#x2F;2020&#x2F;08&#x2F;config-files-vs-directories.html</a> . It might be helpful in providing more details about the _whys_ behind each guideline.<p>Lastly, I&#x27;ll also mention the &quot;Producing open source software&quot; book by Karl Fogel, which provides a lot of useful advice too, especially on how to ship the tools: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;producingoss.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;producingoss.com&#x2F;</a>')
