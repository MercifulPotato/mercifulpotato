A caste of code monks who forgo a comfortable life to write free software from their Mom&#x27;s basement, or a cabin in the woods, isn&#x27;t nearly good enough.<p>Might not be able to pay out a quarter million a year like the FAAAM crew does, but we need a bunch of jobs paying half that to write and maintain open source. If it isn&#x27;t competitive with the other options, it won&#x27;t attract the best people.<p>I don&#x27;t have a plan here. I found my niche but, like most of them, it isn&#x27;t scalable. But we have to keep plotting if we want something sustainable.')
