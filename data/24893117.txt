It seemed like endless possibilities! It was fun and interesting.<p>It&#x27;s perhaps similar to the early days of the web design when we had experimentation with Flash interfaces and all sorts of crazy browser experiences! Now it&#x27;s all the same same on the web :-&#x2F;<p>I love macOS - but it&#x27;s so boring these days. It&#x27;s kinda joyless. Feature rich, but just no fun any more. I&#x27;ve been a life long Apple users, and used to work there in the late 90s.<p>I tolerate and use Windows for gaming and to mix it up a bit.<p>But right now I&#x27;ve been using and enjoying Ubuntu on older Intel hardware with cobbled together updates. And it&#x27;s more fun.<p>I like things to be fun :-)<p>That is part of the point of the Amiga and retro computing - it&#x27;s actually fun!<p>FWIW we were an Atari ST household! :-D')
