So yeah, I think they&#x27;re nothing.<p>Let me give you a scenario to consider.  At my old company, there was a mail server that would DKIM-sign everything that was passed through it.  Anybody who wanted to on the internal network could write an email with tampered headers (say, backdated, or &quot;From:&quot; someone else) and send it through this server.  This was acceptable because the SOLE PURPOSE of this signing was improving SMTP deliverability.  It tells <i>other mail servers</i> &quot;yes, this SMTP payload actually originated from this company.  Please do not treat it as spam.&quot;  So given one of these signed messages, what can you argue about the contents?  Nothing, other than &quot;these did not come from a random spammer posing as this company.&quot;<p>You run risks when you assume a signature means something that the signer does not actually intend it to mean.')
