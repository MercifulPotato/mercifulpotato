But let&#x27;s keep &quot;selfish motives of two different parties&quot; in perspective to the size and power of one side over the other.<p>This program came in after more than decade after the app store was created and when Apple is <i>finally</i> under increased public scrutiny for anti-competitive behaviour. Apple made an estimated $20 <i>billion</i> from the app store <i>last year alone</i> with estimated profits from that revenue being around <i>90%</i> [1]. Being able to afford to half the commission over night speaks to how disconnected the commission is to the costs in running the store.<p><i>Why</i> were they able to take 30% and continue to take 15% commission off of all sales? Because the value of the app store is only created via continued practices of anti-competitive behaviour. Ex:<p>1) Banning competing app stores (restricting customers choice)<p>2) Banning the mention of alternate methods of payment (restricted customers harmed by paying higher fees)<p>The argument that the app store charged &quot;market rate&quot; is also not a fair comparison. Your comparing one completely closed market to other open markets that Microsoft and Google produced. Both main competitors allow for competing app stores from their own for example.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fool.com&#x2F;investing&#x2F;2020&#x2F;01&#x2F;10&#x2F;the-app-store-is-still-a-growth-story-for-apple.aspx" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fool.com&#x2F;investing&#x2F;2020&#x2F;01&#x2F;10&#x2F;the-app-store-is-s...</a>')
