So no matter what intentions are, the effect is the same. You can&#x27;t in good faith argue Parler deserves to be taken down anymore than Twitter and many other sites. Twitter does not enforce many of its own rules, even when reported a lot of violent, hateful content stays up for days or weeks while very minor infractions will get enforced. So even what they do enforce is very inconsistently enforced.<p>Given how bad Twitter is and has been over the course of its history, you can&#x27;t really argue in good faith this wasn&#x27;t just a pretext from eliminating a competitor to the dominance of SV big tech from the market.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;greenwald.substack.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;how-silicon-valley-in-a-show-of-monopolistic" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;greenwald.substack.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;how-silicon-valley-in-a-sho...</a>')
