If AirBnB was asking either travelers or hosts to pay $X to be on a recommendation site, probably very few people would. There&#x27;s always a cheaper competitor when you&#x27;re selling information. Because you book through AirBnB, for a service which is relatively expensive, they can skim off quite a lot of money in an opaque way.')
