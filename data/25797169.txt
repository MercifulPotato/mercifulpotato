Inevitably with gatekeepers you will have corruption (controlling who qualifies gives you power) as there is always an incentive. On the flip side you incentivize cheating (loopholes in the qualifiers, lying, etc.) and then all the $ spent staffing and building tools to enforce those qualifiers, then the staff who regulate them, etc.<p>So with good intentions you’ve completely ruined what could have been a very simple, fair, and efficient system. Basically what government does every day (usually with good intentions).')
