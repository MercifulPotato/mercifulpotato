A few of the Big Brands, as you call it, have models that actually are the same exact printer with a different make&#x2F;model attached to it.<p>That business has been in a downward spiral for years where the margins are tiny and they make it up on service&#x2F;supplies.  I&#x27;m not talking personal printers - the office sized 50 pages&#x2F;min printer is what I&#x27;m referring to.  Personal&#x2F;Consumer grade printers are probably sold at a loss rather than a tiny margin.<p>Outside of 3d printing, what innovations would there be for a startup to tackle in the traditional printing sector?<p>Also patents aren&#x27;t blocking, sufficient capital will get you a license if you want to leverage existing patents.  I&#x27;m sure those Big Brand companies would take the money.')
