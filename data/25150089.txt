The thing not said is that EVERY election has fraud. Too many people involved and people are going to cheat. So news agencies claiming there was no fraud are automatically lying.<p>The answer to your rhetorical question is clearly that the news that it&#x27;s &#x27;most secure&#x27;. This claim is ridiculous at best. Also why news agencies like Fox News abandoned Trump is because you can&#x27;t push the story of fraud.<p>If people distrust the election system and then what? Coup? Another secession? What are you going to replace it with? The same problems still arise.<p>The future looks good though. Direct democracy with optional representation or multi party proportional representation via single transferable vote. This can solve these problem.')
