I’ve heard people complain about the prospect of being on-call, so I’ll just ask this: if you’re not on-call for your code, who is?<p>OK, that&#x27;s fine, but in that case we can shut down the production system outside of business hours so that our work-life balance isn&#x27;t affected. Oh? We <i>can&#x27;t</i> shut down the production system outside of business hours? So we need to be on call continuously, 24&#x2F;7, meaning we can&#x27;t ever be off the grid or unavailable?
