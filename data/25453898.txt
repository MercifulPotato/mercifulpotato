Item(by='rramadass', descendants=None, kids=[25454816], score=None, time=1608196014, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25452205, text='&gt;because the average person cannot program.<p>EWD was right in the sense of his definition of &quot;Program&quot; i.e. as a mathematical object. What he did not quite foresee is that it takes only a few intelligent folks to invent&#x2F;design&#x2F;implement the entire infrastructure so that the general &quot;mass of programmers&quot; can use those to certain profit without much mathematical background. This was how the &quot;Industrial Age&quot; played out, we use a lot of machines everyday without having an inkling of how they work. I think Dijkstra failed to realize that this was as true of &quot;Software&quot; as of material objects. In his defense, the &quot;Software Industry&quot; was still being invented at that time and hence nobody could predict how things would turn out in the future.<p>But his fundamental thesis that a &quot;Program&quot; should be treated as a mathematical object and proved using rigorous logic is still true and by that definition a lot of us fail the test. This is quite independent of the fact that the society at large has accepted a watered down definition of a &quot;Program&quot; with all its shortcomings and failures.')
