Item(by='nicoburns', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602672948, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24772618, text='&gt; I learned that &quot;he&quot; refers to a male or is neutral, but don&#x27;t mind when writers use &quot;she&quot; as long as they are consistent about it.<p>This advice seems pretty questionable to me. It seems evident that neither &#x27;he&#x27; nor &#x27;she&#x27; are actually neutral. Even if one accepts that they can be used with that intent, they still colour ones perception of the person in the minds eye.<p>I&#x27;d be interested to know which pronouns you use in speech when the gender of the target is unknown. For example in the following cases:<p>- A baby whose gender you don&#x27;t know<p>- A pet whose gender you don&#x27;t know<p>- Someone who has been referred to in conversation (perhaps someone talking about &quot;my friend&quot;) whose gender you don&#x27;t know.')
