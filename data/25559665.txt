All my computers, car, clothing, furniture in the apartment. Some things are more repairable than others, like a computer is obviously based on specific parts I can purchase online where as my clothing just needs a needle and thread. Still, keeping repair in mind when possible is important to me for a few reasons:<p>1. I like my items old and lasting because it makes them more personal and gives it history.<p>2. There is a sense of pride when you fix something, whether that be a coffee table or a bug in software.<p>3. Reduce waste.<p>4. Save money.<p>Repair (especially in technology and cars) has become more and more locked down and difficult, and the right to repair is one I think we need to continue to strive for.')
