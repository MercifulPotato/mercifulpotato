Lots of people here make society a better place, as do the companies and organisations they work for&#x2F;contribute to.<p>Sure maybe you could argue that Facebook and Google don&#x27;t make the world a better place. Maybe a bunch of other FAANG companies.<p>But not everyone here works for one of those. I don&#x27;t, and I&#x27;d say my work probably improves society in a certain sense (depending on whether web development&#x2F;UX design&#x2F;usability work does that).')
