Item(by='mannykannot', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605817843, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25151048, text='I have explained why Occam&#x27;s razor is not a simplistic and subjective matter of preferring simple solutions, and your only response to that is to say I&#x27;m wrong, without saying why. That is one factor in keeping this discussion going. The other thing was your insistence that your &quot;gravity might fail&quot; scenario is a relevant analogy; at least you did not continue pushing that view in your latest post.<p>&gt;&gt; Hossenfelder&#x27;s argument is that there are many equally plausible (and equally speculative) ways<p>&gt; This is just not true. Most of the resolutions of the past required new conjectures like EP=EPR, whereas recent solutions rely on newer sort of uses of a path integral, but are still built up from basic QFT+GR.<p>As far as I can tell, what I wrote here seems to reflect what <i>Hossenfelder</i> is saying in the article. Here, for the first time, you seem to be making a reasonable argument that the specific hypotheses are not, in fact, all alike, and that they may differ in a way that at least opens up the possibility of applying Occam&#x27;s razor correctly - i.e. by rejecting any that make unnecesarily broad or strong assumptions.<p>This brings us to Hossenfelder&#x27;s follow-on point: we&#x27;re going to need more data in order to figure out which, if any is correct [1]. Without more data, neither Occam&#x27;s razor nor any other principle is sufficient to do this - the most you can do is have a preference, based possibly on which you think is least likely to run into problems with Occam&#x27;s razor.<p>This is the point that you started this thread by objecting to, and I do not think you have yet made a strong enough case to overthrow it, but you are now making better arguments than before.<p>[1] I&#x27;m not sure about Hossenfelder&#x27;s apparent claim that this data can only come from observing black-hole decay, but that&#x27;s a separate matter.')
