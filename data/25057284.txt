Item(by='Cthulhu_', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605091657, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25053135, text='Oh dear I seem to have fallen into a rabbit hole here.<p>Adolf&#x27;s father, Alois Hitler [0] was born illegitimately and his parentage was never established, meaning that Adolph couldn&#x27;t establish his own &quot;aryan&quot; descent. Alois Hitler was born as Alois Schicklgruber, but he requested to be legitimized in the name of his stepfather Hiedler, which for some reason was registered as Hitler. In the 1930&#x27;s, Hitler had his cronies dive into his genealogy and Declare that there was no Jewish ancestry in his family. The rumour went though that Alois&#x27; mother (Adolph&#x27;s grandmother) was working as a servant &#x2F; cook for a Jewish family, and that the father may have been one of the family members. That&#x27;s a lot of speculation though.<p>Adolf&#x27;s mother, Klara Hitler [1] (nèe Pölzl), was Alois&#x27; first cousin once removed (yikes); not sure about any Jewish heritage there.<p>TL;DR we can&#x27;t be sure because his paternal grandfather is unknown, but there&#x27;s rumours abound.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Alois_Hitler" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Alois_Hitler</a>\n[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Klara_Hitler" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Klara_Hitler</a>')
