It has to be viewed in context: GDP would be reduced but per capita GDP would not be reduced by 10 percent (because the population would also be lower). Furthermore, the UK spends more on Scotland than Scotland contributes, so it&#x27;s a net economic burden. Independence would remove that burden, leaving the UK better off.<p>I think I have already expressed this perfectly clearly in previous comments, so this is the last I will say about it.')
