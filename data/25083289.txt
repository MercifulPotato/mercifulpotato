Grocery delivery is a bit less insane (tip + fee = ~13% premium) because your average order size is bigger (at least for me - I usually do 200ish bucks every 1.5-2.0 weeks). I can stomach a 13% premium for delivery when I have 2-under-2 (years old) and I really don&#x27;t want any of us to get covid for a variety of reasons (I can&#x27;t afford (emotionally more than financially) to be down a caretaker <i>and</i> partner right now, can&#x27;t afford (emotionally) to have either an infant or a toddler to have covid, etc etc).<p>Doordash is really hard for me to justify, I only use it when given gift cards etc. It can literally double the price of a meal (a $20 mcdonalds order becomes $35-40). Even during covid I still generally do curbside because that feels like a very minimal risk.<p>Post-covid, I&#x27;ll probably use instacart&#x2F;shipt maybe once or twice a year - I&#x27;m 100% sure there will be times where for whatever reason I just can&#x27;t get out and the world will end if we run out of milk for the kids. But when there&#x27;s not a pandemic on, taking the kids to the grocery store knocks out so many birds with one stone:<p>* kids get to get used to the grocery store experience<p>* we get groceries<p>* my wife gets a break')
