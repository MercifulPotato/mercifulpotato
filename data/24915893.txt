Learning TDD truly will usually lead to functional code, even if you do not write your tests first.<p>Eg. I can&#x27;t imagine what would be hard for a MS Paint clone to achieve using this approach.  There are always things with side-effects (IO, namely), agreed, but in this CRUD example, the integration bits are coupled in a way where you need a single trivial integration test.  Similar approach can be applied to a GUI app, so I am not sure why does GP feel it can&#x27;t?  Any concrete things where you think you can&#x27;t apply it?<p>Sure, you&#x27;ll have many more small functions, but I think the core takeaway should be that you can always structure code in away where integration functions are simply statement-lists (eg. no control-flow logic in them).  That will usually require rest of your code to be functional.<p>And yeah, it&#x27;s harder to adapt existing code to this pattern, but introducing new code in an existing code base following functional pattern is trivial.')
