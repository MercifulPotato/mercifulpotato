Even when every single transaction is mixed, and values are hidden, there are STILL not-insignificant risks. If it is not mandatory then it is just not good enough, even for people that are not doing high-risk things.<p>&gt;Monero doesn&#x27;t enable privacy by default, but its known as a privacy coin.
