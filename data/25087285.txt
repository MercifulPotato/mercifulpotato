It has even affected Poland. The &quot;genocidal atrocity&quot; is so blatantly mythologized and lies upon lies are layered down in an attempt to form a nation-forming myth together glorification of Nazi collaborationist, which have killed a lot of Jews, Poles and even Ukranians.<p>There was no evil order to eliminate Ukrainians issued by the Soviet government, it was a tragic chain of events. It started from purely natural reasons and got multiplied by deficiencies of the system. People on the ground played a crucial role here as well, by passing wrong information about situation on the ground.')
