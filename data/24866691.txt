So too here.<p>None of these people criticizing SuperMemo have actually used it (as far as I know, or if they did, probably a decade or two ago). I know lots of people that have switched from Anki to SuperMemo with way better rep loads. If you look at supermemo.guru and any of the writings of the creator, it&#x27;s quite clear he knows what he&#x27;s talking about. It would be pretty insane that over 30 years of research, he couldn&#x27;t come up with a significantly better algorithm (currently sm18).')
