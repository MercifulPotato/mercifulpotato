Maybe not the first thing they bring up, but it would come around eventually. They also tended to be sort of proud of it.<p>The crew people tended to be a little more low key about it, but mostly because they did legit film crew work as well and worried it might hurt them if higher ups knew. And the union thing applied to some. Couldn&#x27;t do non-union work officially.<p>I only ever met low-end producers. They didn&#x27;t care who knew what they did, at all. My social circles didn&#x27;t include the big time porn producers (this was back in the day when DVDs were still sort of viable).')
