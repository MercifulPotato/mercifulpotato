I wish other browsers would steal this idea and run with it because “containers” and “switching profiles” doesn’t mean much to users or isn’t the best experience.<p>If you haven’t in a while, go check out “Settings for websites” on Safari desktop and mobile. It’s some pretty sane and reasonable stuff.')
