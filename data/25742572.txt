There is a reason why centrists and others call left wing authoritarianists &quot;useful idiots&quot; because they are endorsed by huge companies and used as a tool by them to gather profits or drive other companies out of buisnesses or use them to push harmful legislature. Honestly i wasn&#x27;t expecting to see people wearing hammers and sickles and advocating for pogroms on their political enemies to ever side with monopolies and the bourgeoisie but here we are. No matter where you go you are already on a list(proudly supported by Pelosi and AOC) and if not already then soon you will be visited by antifa with molotovs and if you defend yourself you will be used as justification for further assault. There is nowhere to go, there is nowhere to hide, your own child is ready to sell you out for a penny, there is no place safe and my lord if you are LGBT you are hated even more by everyone. Probably the safest place would be telegram but its about as safe as pills from mexico. Oh yes when the opposing political party is in power have fun making your own ISP. You asked this as a technical not political question but the question is rooted in politics entirely.<p>TLDR; No. Since 2015~ there is no place left. Congrats you won.')
