Item(by='1996', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607456128, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25342660, text='&gt; You tell me &quot;it&#x27;s not about riches&quot; then say I should invest for a speculative 50x-100x return. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s dangerous, I think it&#x27;s dumb. I think gambling on it paid off, and gamblers think that&#x27;s proof they were smart<p>Gambling can be smart, when the expected value is greater than the cost of the ticket - or when ticket price itself is insignificant, like the 10 coins as suggested in 2010.<p>That&#x27;s what I meant with my suggestion to waste $500 - you won&#x27;t miss them much, and even if it won&#x27;t make you rich, it will have clear upsides for you, like a new car. And I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a safe bet for someone reading HN.<p>But apparently, you are extremely risk averse. I think that&#x27;s another defining features of a lot of the geeks here.<p>This is the only way I can frame that, as I just don&#x27;t understand a refusal to take such a simple action.<p>If it&#x27;s not too much to ask, can you better explain me your reasons? Is $500 a large amount of money for your budget? Or is it more about the risks of regrets of taking an action that&#x27;s greater that then risk of of regret of not-taking an action?<p>&gt; I never got the &quot;hacker&quot; spirit of &quot;eat ramen, build a startup, sell it for billions&quot;.<p>Exactly what I thought! The hacker spirit is a taste for risk and fun, as understanding things allows you gain more control of your destiny ; it&#x27;s a bit like &quot;work hard play hard&quot;, along with a hefty disdain of the mainstream.<p>&gt; In twelve years, nobody has come up with a killer app, or even a mildly compelling app<p>I see fully self managed payment and saving as game changing, you don&#x27;t. We have very different takes, maybe due to our different preferences: personally, I don&#x27;t want to ever depend on a payment provider that I don&#x27;t fully control. &quot;be your own bank&quot; is the killer app for me.<p>&gt; For someone gloating about being superior and retired, you still end up in the same HN thread as me, with a massive chip on your shoulder and an inferiority complex.<p>Superior? Gloating? No, I only find it sad.<p>Because as you correctly noticed, I feel I can&#x27;t relate to the other hackers anymore. I still help a few projects, and share interesting nuggets, but I feel like I&#x27;m in another world now, due to a profound difference in values and understanding. (I seriously wonder about the $500 - which is why I asked you)<p>After the 50x happens in about 30x years, you may not remember this conversation but I will remember how yet again I was unable to make someone take a clear beneficial action.<p>It&#x27;s like a reverse Chicken Little syndrome forcing me to watch as other hackers pass opportunities.')
