Laser printers are simply unbeatable for occasional document printing because toner never dries out and the printer never clogs.<p>If you want to get the most out of an inkjet printer, the best thing to do with it is to load fresh cartridges into the printer and then print continuously until it runs out. Leaving it sit around with partial ink cartridges causes the printer to repeatedly waste ink on cleaning cycles in order to prevent the nozzles from clogging up with dried out ink.<p>Personally, I think inkjet printers are really only viable for people who do volume photo and other graphics printing, as you would in a commercial printing business.')
