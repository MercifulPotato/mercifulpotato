States can&#x27;t and don&#x27;t do that. Therefore, Kavanaugh is either talking about (1) the networks &quot;calling&quot; the election or (2) he&#x27;s talking about some fantasy world in which states certify their elections night-of. Either is lunacy and either flies in the face of originalism.<p>I have a <i>lot</i> of problems with NYT, including ideological problems, but to say it&#x27;s just a partisan rag tells me all I need to know about this conversation.')
