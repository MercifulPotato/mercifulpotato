TL;DR: Google ran an experiment where they proxied subset of Chrome traffic without the consent of the user or the publisher. How is that not breaking user&#x27;s trust?<p>I wonder how would Google engineers would feel if they found out that their Samsung phone was sending subset of their Photos and Gmail data through their servers in Korea without any consent? (To be clear, Samsung does not do this. I&#x27;m just providing an analogous example).<p>Just because users run the Chrome browser does not mean that they give consent to Google to proxy their network traffic. There is a vast difference, and that&#x27;s why Android (and most of the operating systems) require explicit user permission when installing VPNs.')
