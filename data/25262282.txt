There might be an actual scientific advance here, but if so, I have absolutely no idea what it is. &quot;100 million degrees&quot; may sound impressive, but it&#x27;s completely trivial to create a plasma at that temperature; plasma temperatures are typically quoted in electron-volts (eV) or kilo-electron-volts (keV), and a temperature like this probably corresponds to somewhere in the tens of keV. You can make a plasma like this in your garage, and run it as long as you like (there are guides on YouTube). But it won&#x27;t produce <i>net</i> energy, ie., you won&#x27;t get more energy out than you put in. To know how impressive this is, we need to know:<p>- Was net energy produced during this time?<p>- How much plasma was there, ie, how large of a scale was the experiment at?<p>- How dense was the plasma?<p>- How repeatable is the experiment? Could it be run again sustainably, or did it fry all the equipment with fast neutron radiation?<p>The article doesn&#x27;t seem to mention any of these, and without them, &quot;100 million degrees&quot; is meaningless.')
