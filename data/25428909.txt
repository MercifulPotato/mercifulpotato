Though I&#x27;ve taken only a single night train in my life: from Beijing to Xi&#x27;an.<p>While slightly pricier than flying, I had a bed and could freely move around the cabin. To top it off - anecdotally, though intuitively it holds - those who travel by train are less stressed than those travelling by plane, and therefore friendlier and open to conversation.<p>A great experience overall. I hope to do more of this in Europe.')
