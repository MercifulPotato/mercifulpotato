Either way I suspect that you&#x27;d need to burn a lot of extra hydrogen to overcome the latent heat of water and create sufficient heat to melt the ore &#x2F; alloy.<p>A quick back of the envelope calculation would be at least 1 million litres of H2 per ton of steel. So maybe 2~3 million litres of H2 per manufactured car just for the steel alone?<p>[EDIT] Peroxide also has the added benefit of being a liquid at room temperature.')
