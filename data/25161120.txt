Thanks for sharing it.<p>Expect loads of cynicism. I&#x27;ve found that talking about having Principles and Integrity in business and professional endeavors, usually results in being accused of &quot;virtue signaling,&quot; which is ridiculous, as we are only talking about simple, basic, realistic human values; not some kind of Mother Theresa code.<p>That said, it is extremely easy to let a focus on &quot;culture&quot; turn into a toxic monoculture. It&#x27;s always easier to exclude those that deviate from the norm, than it is to adapt to them.')
