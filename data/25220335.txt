I have a second home in a remote area with a very bad gravel road. In winter, when there is snow, I was frequently unable to get there.<p>Then I bought a SUV. It&#x27;s a 4WD with and ample trunk. Now I can use my property to my liking according to my job time constraints rather then weather conditions.<p>But I sense your sub-sonic tone. I think the vast majority of SUV owners lives in a city with perfect snow removal in winter (if there even is snow at all) which hardly justifies owning such an ineffective car.')
