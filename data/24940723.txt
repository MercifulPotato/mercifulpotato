Item(by='simongray', descendants=None, kids=[24940914, 24943160, 24940821, 24941323], score=None, time=1604052236, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24940268, text='&gt; that still needs to call JS though... It&#x27;s not like they rewrote the renderer in Clojure<p>But why exactly is that an issue...? Some people also think the JVM is icky so they won&#x27;t touch Clojure. I don&#x27;t really care much myself what underlying technology is used, I just like to get things done.<p>&gt; A simpler and easy to grok alternative with minimal dependencies is thing-geom<p>Thanks for reminding me of thi.ng. I am both in awe at how prolific he is, while at the same time frustrated with the non-standard org-mode-driven development style.<p>&gt; You just declare what you want drawn and you get back an svg tree which you can either modify further or transform to xml to get an actual .svg format string<p>Probably worth mentioning that Vega can also give you an SVG.<p>&gt; I even quickly wrote a converter to Javafx bc I have the svg tree I can directly traverse<p>Can you link your code? I would like to explore this some more.')
