Notice that in this case in particular, the confidence intervals are consistent with very large positive or fairly large negative effects. Don&#x27;t underestimate the amount of noise often found in studies. Lack of significance usually just means that data is too noisy to tell us anything. If you get significance you get to say: the data is probably not pure noise but the effect could still be very tiny or caused by systematic measurement errors. Null hypothesis testing is pretty useless really.')
