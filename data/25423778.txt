C&#x27;mon. If you don&#x27;t know anything about it shut up. Material did huge things for usability and uniformity across the google landscape.<p>Over on Analytics, you&#x27;re not reading stuff and clicking upgrade&#x2F;migrate whatever and then complaining. Lame man.

You&#x27;re in a bubble man, not that many ppl were affected by Reader shutdown. Inbox. Etc. The Inbox features made their way into Gmail as the one Googler describes features evolve in smaller steps.
