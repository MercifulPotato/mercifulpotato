It&#x27;s entirely possible for workaholics to be more productive, inter-personally smooth, and a team player.<p>The most convincing reason to not be a workaholic is not that it&#x27;s a counter-productive effort.  It&#x27;s that workaholism will lead to decreased long-term fulfillment (for most people).')
