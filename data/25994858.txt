By being a third party we can be confident that any action on our part (such as rolling an SCP out to an AWS org, despite unit tests) won&#x27;t impact the observability we rely on to tell us we&#x27;ve screwed that up.<p>I can plug 100s of AWS accounts and 10s of payers into it and I don&#x27;t have to think about that in terms of making self-hosted infrastructure available via PrivateLinks or some other such complication.<p>I pay mid six-figure sums annually for these things to &quot;just work&quot;. If you folks believe I can achieve this functionality on a per-seat basis I&#x27;d be interested in saving those six figures.')
