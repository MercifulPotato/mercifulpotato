I know it seems out of scope for what Mozilla&#x27;s asking, but it seems like the missing piece of the puzzle to me.<p>It&#x27;s great if your recursive resolver is trusted (maybe you trust cloudflare or nextdns), but what if you don&#x27;t trust anyone and want to run your own TRR?  From what I can see from my own TRR the queries to authoritative DNS are sent in the clear...\n<i>Edit</i> On further thought, I realize that querying myanimememes.com&#x27;s authoritative DNS <i>CAN</i> reveal which site you&#x27;re interested in, but I believe most sites delegate their authoritative DNS these days to third parties.')
