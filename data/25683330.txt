I don&#x27;t think it has a significant role it play in the Dermatology clinic for this application. However, I am very optimistic about the potential for AI to help in the triage of patients referred to dermatology by non-specialists. For this application you are not trying to diagnose melanoma but instead aiming to diagnose - with a high degree of accuracy benign lesions that do not need review in the Dermatology clinic.')
