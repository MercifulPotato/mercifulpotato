What&#x27;s she&#x27;s asking it basically what I asked of my parents at her age.  I did things like run a BBS and write stupid programs, and today I&#x27;m a senior software developer with a job that pays quite well.  And I still love programming.<p>While she doesn&#x27;t technically need it to be creative, doing things that interest you is a <i>huge</i> boost in the creativity and learning departments.  She probably won&#x27;t learn what you or she expects to, and that&#x27;s even better, IMO.<p>Of course, I don&#x27;t know what else you&#x27;re already doing for her like that, and there&#x27;s certainly a point where you&#x27;re just throwing money away at whims.  But I just felt the need to put this out there.')
