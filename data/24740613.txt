I swear it must be just the American Amazon that&#x27;s so shit, because I literally never had any problems nor know anyone with these problems here in UK. Just this year I&#x27;m on 108 orders and counting, every single one of them was fine, working, definitely not used, definitely not counterfeit and delivered within 1 day as promised with Prime. Last year I&#x27;ve had 140 orders total, year before that 122 orders, and again never had any of those problems.  I think the only return I did was a lightbulb that broke after 3 months and Amazon refunded me but only after I shipped it back, which I thought was very wasteful.')
