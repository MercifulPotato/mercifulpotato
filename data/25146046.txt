It seems quite possible that the contributor wanted to make this change and volunteered their time. If thatâ€™s the case, the complexity of the change should not be relevant. The only complexity to consider is the downstream complexity. And besides, the change seems to be a one-liner plus find-and-replace in thousands of unit tests. Could probably have been done in a matter of minutes.<p>I am just speculating of course and maybe they were very unhappy to have to do this.')
