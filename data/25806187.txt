Wikipedia confirms FAS is still organized in this way: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Harvard_Faculty_of_Arts_and_Sciences" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Harvard_Faculty_of_Arts_and_Sc...</a><p>That said, yes it&#x27;s extremely misleading for a DCE instructor to call themselves an FAS professor. This sort of thing does happen at all top tier schools&#x27; extension programs, though far more often it&#x27;s done by students rather than instructors.')
