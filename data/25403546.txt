(I do understand not liking his jurisprudence or his abrasive style.)  He and Justice Ginsburg, for example, were famous friends while holding opposite opinions about how to interpret and read the U.S. Constitution; one would think she would&#x27;ve called him out on blatant dishonesty (intellectual or otherwise)')
