In a certain sense, the whole thing seemed like a huge waste of money.<p>I guess your mileage does indeed vary. I contributed to a subproject of a major FP7 research program, which counted with the collaboration of a major industrial manufacturing company, a state research institute, and a couple of university research groups. In the end, besides a hand full of research papers, the industrial company developed a commercial product which is being rolled out as we speak. The state research institute didn&#x27;t gained much out of the deal but we did developed institutional relationships that have been fruitful since then.<p>What you take from a research program is proportional to the legwork you put in. I&#x27;m sure some projects aren&#x27;t immediately fruitful but it&#x27;s short-sighted to claim that the money is wasted, specially if you take into account that this expenditure is what makes this sort of industrial effort possible.')
