The most common interpreted languages that I can think of where you parse as you go are shells like bash.<p>Languages like Perl and PHP are called interpreted because an interpreter runs the script.  But the interpreter actually compiles the code first and then runs off of the compiled representation.  Which is byte code - just like the JVM.  If you put energy into it, you can use all the same techniques that the JVM does.  As a practical example, both nodejs and pypy (a fast variant on Python) have a JIT.  Julia regularly hits speeds for numerical calculations that is fully competitive with C++ and FORTRAN.')
