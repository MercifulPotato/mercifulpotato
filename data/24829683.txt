It resulted in visual disturbances, snow looking at bright colors and floaters. Some neurological symptoms, fatigue, numbness, tingling. Some musculoskeletal issues, such as tendon&#x2F;muscle pain and cracking in many joints. This has been a constant struggle for 8 years now. I have met others who had the same reactions, some recover, some find help through diet, some can&#x27;t walk at all. Doctors usually gaslight you, even though all these symptoms are now on the black box label, which these antibiotics carry.<p>I have gotten some relief. Initially, could not walk for few weeks due to severe pain. Remote work helps. However, as long as I keep consistent eating schedule, low sugar diet, and eat clean I can my symptoms pretty mild and can do enough to feel &quot;normal&quot;. Sometimes I do get hit with nasty tendon flair up and need to brace it. Brain fog is gone and neurological symptoms have improved.<p>Apparently, there have been cases of individuals recovering after 10+ years. There was a doctor who did a lot of work with people affected by FQs but he unfortunately passed away. Thankfully, surgeons and other doctors are now coming forward discussing the issues and trying to figure out how the damage can be reversed.')
