Non-leaf nodes are called containers and can be tiled vertically, tiled horizontally, stacked, or tabbed. Windows and containers can be either floating or tiled on the workspace. It seems like i3&#x27;s layout model is a superset of wmii&#x27;s.<p>wmii&#x27;s tagging does sound unique if I understand correctly that you can have 1 window in multiple workspaces and correspondingly in multiple positions and sizes. Something like that sounds like it would be problematic for handling multiple monitors, though. If one window is to be in 2 workspaces, what&#x27;s supposed to happen when you want to show both workspaces at once in separate monitors? Can&#x27;t show the same window in 2 places at once with different sizes.')
