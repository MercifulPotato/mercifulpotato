The JS fallback is around 10 times slower (more in 5+ year old browsers) - for those users you want at least a decent solve time too.<p>For Gitlab&#x27;s audience the difficulty can probably be increased a lot - it all depends on the website and usecase. I&#x27;m sure the JS fallback&#x27;s performance can be improved (it involves a lot of operations on 64bit ints that need to be represented as two numbers in JS), happy to accept PRs [1] :)<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;FriendlyCaptcha&#x2F;friendly-pow&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;src&#x2F;blake2b&#x2F;blake2b.ts#L80-L82" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;FriendlyCaptcha&#x2F;friendly-pow&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;...</a>')
