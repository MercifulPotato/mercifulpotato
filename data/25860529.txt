Nice job!<p>This is something I was thinking about doing a few years ago. The serious fitness space is dying to be taken away from TNation and other operators that are basically still at forum or webcam + chat levels of tech adoption.<p>Something like Starting Strength with this level of tech production starts to look like a really powerful fitness tool. I think that&#x27;s why TrainHeroic is doing pretty well as an app (and now your contribution!)<p>Great job.')
