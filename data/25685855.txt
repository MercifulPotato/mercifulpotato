Elementary, middle, or high schools (with associated sports facilities). Jails. Courthouses. Hospitals (not basic medical services, fully featured hospitals with Ambulance support). Police forces (not half a dozen campus cops, or loaned police officers)... and so forth.<p>And remember, we&#x27;re discussing building cities like campuses - there is no &quot;just off campus&quot; space available for competition.<p>We&#x27;re discussing campuses the size of Manhattan Island, without most of the roads (which will hugely impact the ability to deliver goods and take away waste; just see how New York is taken over by these two activities at night).
