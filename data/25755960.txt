It doesn&#x27;t take a majority of people to make things awkward&#x2F; ugly, just a vocal minority.<p>Also, I suspect developers and knowledge workers are more likely to dislike Facebook. It doesn&#x27;t matter what the cashier at Safeway thinks. If your friends and acquaintances hate Facebook, it&#x27;s going to feel a lot worse. And if you are a developer or designer, it&#x27;s likely you have a fair number of friends who are developers.')
