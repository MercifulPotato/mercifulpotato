I use a five point harness when I&#x27;m racing. With a helmet and a foam neck brace, I have walked away from getting T-boned in the driver door. But that extra equipment impedes visibility that I might need e.g. when parking.<p>I&#x27;ve driven a fully caged car from coast to coast (US), but from what I understand I took a risk. The harness and cage and restraint are all designed to with together. The human body stretches in a collision,  so there is risk of head injury compared to a street car.  I trust the equipment in the race car with my life, but there is a reason I don&#x27;t drive one to work every day.')
