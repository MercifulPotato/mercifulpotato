The most fair comparison would be zen 3 on 7nm, but even that is still a whole node behind.<p>I&#x27;m not sure exactly what your point is. The fact it is IT IS on a better node. That&#x27;s probably a big part of the performance picture. But, as a user I don&#x27;t care if the improvement in performance is architectural or node. I just care that it&#x27;s better than the competition.')
