That&#x27;s not possible because each web engine behaves differently, even if somebody reimplemented the non-web apis as a portable native library (actually, these ARE implemented like that). We&#x27;re bundling whole chrome because it&#x27;s a reliable abstraction that works the same on all systems.')
