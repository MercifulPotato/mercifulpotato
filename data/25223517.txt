That&#x27;s the best way I can put it.”<p>Take this for example.   Here you just affirm the consequent.  Of course, as I said earlier for you to be right there must be a deception, and here you say that Apple are masters of deception.<p>But really that’s a naked assertion.  <i>If\nthere is a conspiracy</i> this would be true, but there is actually no evidence of it.<p>[2] “Apple, quite literally, wrote the playbook for establishing gilded cages and vendor lock-in within the (modern) computer industry.”<p>Obviously this is fantasy. If Apple had literally written such a playbook, you would be able to present it as evidence.<p>What they have written and presented <i>literally</i>, is a large body of work on how to produce a secure computing environment that mitigates most forms of security threat and is therefore trusted by consumers as a platform where they can purchase software.<p>That <i>is literally</i> what they have written.<p>Again you are just asking us to accept a conspiracy as if it were fact.')
