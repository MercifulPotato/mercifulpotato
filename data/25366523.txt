But that was a moment that I&#x27;ll remember for the rest of my life.  Amazing stuff, even with what obviously meant the complete demise of SN8.<p>I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll learn an immense amount from it, and it was amazing to see it nearly pull off the landing.  Given the way that Falcon 9 early landing attempts went, it&#x27;ll go the same way with Starship, and it&#x27;ll be landing soon.')
