Plus, increases in internet speed would negate all the gains within a few years.<p>The massive switching cost of IPv6 has slowed deployment for a decade. Since it&#x27;s so expensive to switch to HTTP&#x2F;3, it only benefits large companies like Google. To smaller companies it&#x27;s a cost.<p>Only 33% of the web is using HTTP&#x2F;2, which came out 6 years ago. Any big gains we&#x27;re talking about are many years in the future when internet speed will be maybe double what it is now. The slow adoption of HTTP&#x2F;2 relative to its great benefits compared to HTTP&#x2F;3 shows you how bad adoption will be.<p>Since 3 is single digits percent better than two, I bet adoption won&#x27;t cross 20% for almost ten years. It&#x27;s only going to be the FAANG&#x27;S of the world that think such as small increase in performance is worth the switching cost.<p>So that was kinda a rant but I don&#x27;t think throwing out big numbers because so many people use the web is a strong argument. Users aren&#x27;t the ones paying a large cost for a small performance increase')
