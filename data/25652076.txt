It sounds like there is a long tail of issues that are hard to fix but have large customer impact.  Or do they?<p>If these long tail issues didn&#x27;t get fixed, how much revenue would it cost?  Figuring that out seems key.  If it&#x27;s a lot of revenue, then it would make sense to spend the time to do the hard engineering fixes.  If it&#x27;s not a lot, then it makes sense to let you sleep.<p>&gt; Management has extricated themselves completely.<p>This is a big issue too.  If the problems warrant waking you up, they should be serious enough to involve management. If they aren&#x27;t, then it sounds like they&#x27;re waking you up for no reason.')
