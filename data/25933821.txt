No that period is not a mistake.~<p>~That&#x27;s for a pack of 6 tablets. How the heck do they end up at $13 cost?~<p>Edit: Google autocorrected to a similar drug. This specific drug is actually $4.50 per tablet here and prescription only. That&#x27;s still a massive difference.<p>Relevant sidenote: it&#x27;s fully covered as well so I wouldn&#x27;t even get a bill.')
