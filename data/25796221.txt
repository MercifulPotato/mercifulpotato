Anybody whose primary concerns are among fiscal responsibility&#x2F;the deficit, public education, effective foreign policy, civil rights, human rights, political corruption, science based public health&#x2F;policy, climate change, domestic extremism, an independent judiciary etc. has moved into the democratic party.<p>The Republican Party is for people whose primary concern is one of a theocratic judiciary, paying less taxes if you make more than $400k&#x2F;yr, white nationalism, extractive industries, military contractors, unrestricted access to any&#x2F;all classes of firearms.<p>In both of those groups there are large pro-business, anti-labor contingents.<p>Hopefully one day we will move to ranked choice voting and other mechanisms that allow 3rd parties to compete and we can have more meaningful and direct connections between parties and specific policies instead of these two loose coalitions.')
