(I don&#x27;t, but I always sort of think I should)<p>Surprised, and if I&#x27;m honest a little distressed, to see about a third of respondents use vi keybindings.<p>Absolutely amazed that so many people report using org-mode daily. Either the whole survey is primarily a survey of org-mode users, rather than Emacs users in general, perhaps because of the HN posting (I get the impression HN loves org-mode) - or nobody else uses Emacs.<p>Even more amazed about the questions on &quot;completion frameworks&quot; and packages for error checking (what?) in both of which the winning answer is something I&#x27;ve never heard of. I shall have to see what they&#x27;re all about.<p>Finally - oh blimey, everyone reads &#x2F;r&#x2F;emacs. Perhaps that explains it all.')
