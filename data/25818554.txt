While the conversion is smooth in general, the generated app (not the extension) got UI issue during extension review! Reviewer insists the app does not fit the UI guideline. I need to write back and explain the entire app is actually generated by the official Apple tool. The only use of generated app is open the preferences page of Safari. Anyway, after two back and forth, the extension is finally launched.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bartsolutions.github.io&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;20&#x2F;safari-extension&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bartsolutions.github.io&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;20&#x2F;safari-extension&#x2F;</a>')
