By itself, it does look that it is not more transmissible (see Prof. Francois Balloux&#x27;s Twitter for some explanations). The deletion, again <i>by itself</i> is not new, and also in this case it doesn&#x27;t seem it has (on its own) increased fitness over the others.<p>N50Y has also a similar antibody neutralization profile as the non-mutated version.<p>Of course, these data refer to the mutations on their own, not together.<p>More on the deletion (on its own, again): while it is supposedly tied to a faster entry into the cells (twice as efficient in experimental assays), it look like it has lower fitness in absence of an ongoing immune response (it would lower in presence - but not disappear - in the immunocompromised patient it was first found into between treatments with convalescent serum).')
