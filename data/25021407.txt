I keep paying for spotify, but in honesty I really shouldn&#x27;t at this point, I&#x27;m barely using it. Bandcamp sells me what I want, and when they don&#x27;t I listen to something else or find it somewhere else. I&#x27;ve even been buying (and ripping into my local collection) some 2nd hand CDs.')
