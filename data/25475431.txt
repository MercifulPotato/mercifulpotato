The cover image is a bit goofy and screams mid-2000s. I&#x27;ve only seen excerpts, but GoF if I remember correctly is very dry and doesn&#x27;t explain some things very well. Head First Design Patterns looks to be written for Java, but I don&#x27;t remember having trouble understanding and implementing them in other languages.<p>Head First Design Patterns: Building Extensible and Maintainable Object-Oriented Software 2nd Edition will be released on December 29. I guess this is the newer edition? It shares 2 of the authors.')
