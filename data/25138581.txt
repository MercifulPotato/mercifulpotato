There are also some severe misunderstandings of how the evaluated languages work.<p>For portability, they ask: &quot;If you write some software in a particular language, can you copy the compiled program to another computer and expect it to work?&quot;<p>This is the wrong question, but it also is answered incorrectly. You can certainly write JavaScript, Java, C#, on most modern platforms and have little trouble porting them. Java, as others have mentioned, is fully portable with JAR files. Node.js is literally JavaScript, which can run anywhere there&#x27;s a JavaScript engine for the most part (with some asterisks for Node.js&#x27;s particular flavor). C# compiles to an IL that can be used anywhere, so the parts of the code we&#x27;re talking about as &quot;not portable&quot; are the binaries wrapped around that.<p>For compilers, they ask: &quot;If the internet stopped functioning, would you be left helpless?&quot;<p>By these criteria, their assessment of compilers is mostly accurate. But I&#x27;m not sure what they mean by &quot;acquiring or setting up&quot; the compiler? Presumably that means &quot;copy the compiler manually to another computer&quot; because this is a world with no Internet?<p>In that case, the better question is &quot;can I get an offline installer for these development environments&quot;, which is a fairly commonly available thing. Package restore is a bigger question, for those that use packages - but if you have the original binaries, you implicitly have the binaries for all the packages, so not overcomable.<p>I think what this person really means by &quot;fragility&quot; is &quot;survivability&quot; or &quot;disaster preparedness.&quot; That&#x27;s an area of software work that&#x27;s often undervalued, and I agree that if you are evaluating software on that basis, many of the languages listed with the tools listed are poor choices. But that&#x27;s such a distinct area of software that its general applicability is limited, in my view.')
