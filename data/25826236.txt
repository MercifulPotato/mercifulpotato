Item(by='davidm1729', descendants=None, kids=[25828030], score=None, time=1611001733, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25826223, text='I discovered a few books that I loved on Twitter a few months ago by pure luck, and I find it weird that in 2020 we didn&#x27;t have more than mouth to mouth, bestseller lists, and &quot;you may also like&quot; to come upon some of these gems.<p>The site is quite self-explanatory, a large interactive map with more than 100,000 books placed and colored by their similarity. Right now, it&#x27;s completely based on an algorithm, and things like being written by the same author do not directly affect position or color.<p>Probably the most interesting feature, apart from the map, is that when clicking on a book similar books will be highlighted based on that. However, there are other features like the ability to create your own lists.<p>Any feedback will be appreciated. Thank you!')
