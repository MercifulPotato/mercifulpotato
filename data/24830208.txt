Then sometime later, you buy a car for $100 but pay for it with 90 GBP or 8 Bitcoin. There are two transactions: the non-taxable acquisition of the car, and the deemed exchange of the GBP or Bitcoin into USD. Because the GBP and Bitcoin are worth more now than when you first acquired them, you have foreign exchange income and get taxed on that.')
