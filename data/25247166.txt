Thanks for sharing!<p>My dream platform:<p>1. Single binary install on nodes, and easy to join them into a cluster.<p>2. Resources defined as JSON with comments in a simple format with JSON Schema URLs denoting resource types - I should be able to run 1 container with 3 lines of resource definition.<p>3. Everything as a CRD... No resources or funcionality pre-installed and instead available via publicly hosted HTTPS schema URLs.<p>4. Pluggable &#x2F; auto-installed runtimes based on the schema URL or a &quot;runtime&quot; field: containers, vms, firecracker, wasm, maybe even bare processes, etc.<p>5. A standard web dashboard with a marketplace which can install multiple containers, vms, wasm or via a copy-pasted HTTPS URL, or a standard electron app which lets me connect to clusters or manage local deployments on my devbox.<p>6. Apps can provide a JSON schema with config options, which map to env vars and volume mounts and can be displayed in a user friendly way in the web dashboard.<p>I feel something like this could standardize even more than kube. I&#x27;d love if one system allowed me to manage AWS EC2 &#x2F; DigitalOcean &#x2F; Proxmox instances, as well as manage services on my devbox for daily use (like daemons, etc.)<p>With that said, I do like a standard format across service providers. While I do find kube complex at times, I like that something &quot;won&quot; this battle, and I also like the push towards containers vs vms.<p>I&#x27;d love to see kube start pairing down and innovating toward making things easier for smaller clusters. Anyone know if there are discussions about that going on, or if there are resources for managing kube in smaller teams? Anyone interested in this?')
