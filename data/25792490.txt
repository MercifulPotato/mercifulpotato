If your backups are kept in a binary format, then it&#x27;s a nightmare. You have to restore them, delete the data then backup them up again for every backup you have.<p>Other interpretations say that it is enough to remove the data if&#x2F;when you restore the backup data. I.e. keep a record of deletion requests and on restoring a backup check if you need to re-perform the deletion request and then do so if necessary.')
