In this case, however, you are a messenger repeating someone else&#x27;s representation of what might be the truth, without actually knowing the truth for yourself.<p>You asked &quot;Has the dailywire been known to be untrustworthy in the past?&quot; apparently without googling it for yourself, then when I provided the answer that multiple news analysis sites would&#x27;ve give you, you attacked me with &#x27;both sides&#x27;-isms. When I provided a specific source and asked you to take it up with them, you continued to attack me for &quot;repeating someone else&#x27;s representation&quot; without &quot;knowing the truth myself.&quot; I knew it myself, and I backed it up with citations.<p>Some unsolicited life advice: it&#x27;s pretty rude and insufferable to ask people questions on the internet and then attack them when they do your research for you. Maybe think about not doing that.')
