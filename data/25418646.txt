Unless it&#x27;s changed it is percentage based with a min. If you&#x27;re making less then 50k it&#x27;s nothing, if you&#x27;re making 50k it&#x27;s 17k in repayment. If you&#x27;re making a 150k it&#x27;s capped at 30k, but you&#x27;re paying 2125 dollars a month until you hit that.<p>It&#x27;s 17 percent of your salary for 2 years or you hit 30k repayment whichever is first. If you don&#x27;t make over 50k, or don&#x27;t get a job in a related field (which includes things like IT support I believe) it disappears.<p>You can kind of see why a student would think that the bootcamp is aligned with their interests. They want you to get a high paying job so they get paid more, and if you don&#x27;t succeed you owe nothing.<p>I went through this, and my salary went up 2.25 times what it was previously. I also enjoy my job significantly more. To me this was worth 30k.<p>Why didn&#x27;t I just teach myself? A few reasons, one is motivation&#x2F;accountability, another is structure, and a third was a hope that career services would help me on the other side. I won&#x27;t claim it was my smartest move, it got me out of the hole I was in.<p>Edit: want to be clear I&#x27;m not recommending doing this, I&#x27;m just saying what my&#x2F;other students I talked to decision process was')
