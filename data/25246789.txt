Rapid cuts jump around topics and rooms and days without any transitions and without any logical continuity either. Shiller frequently references things he probably said 5 minutes ago in the actual lecture, but won’t say for 10 more videos in the Coursera edit.<p>I cannot find anyone else talking about this in the reviews; they are all glowing. Wondering if I’m crazy, if Coursera is glitching just for me, or if no one actually watched the videos.')
