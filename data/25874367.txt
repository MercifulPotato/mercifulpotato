Similarly as memory, thread count, and storage capacities of modern servers have continued Moore&#x27;s law the number of applications that can fit within the same finite cost has also improved.<p>In terms of efficiency, the big question is &quot;does an incremental gain in efficiency matter for this application?&quot; if we&#x27;re talking about &lt; 10x performance&#x2F;cost change the answer will be no for most teams. Consider how many of these big data applications are implemented in python or other interpreted languages.')
