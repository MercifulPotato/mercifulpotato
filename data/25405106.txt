Item(by='cbanek', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607847406, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25403283, text='&gt; how you feel we (recruiters, interviewers, hiring managers, etc.) are failing you.<p>Here&#x27;s my big thing - interviews, recruiters, hiring managers are all trying to do one thing, and one thing alone - fill that spot.  Many times, I don&#x27;t think they care if it&#x27;s a great fit for the candidate, and will paper over workplace issues or culture.  In the end, sadly the problem is that the people doing the hiring and the person getting hired many times have completely different goals.  Same for compensation.<p>Whereas for the candidate, it&#x27;s really about picking the right company to work for and interview at.<p>People are really on their own to find the right fit, and it&#x27;s certainly not easy.  Finding your own fit can be tricky especially if you are changing roles and your resume doesn&#x27;t look like what the hiring manager was expecting.')
