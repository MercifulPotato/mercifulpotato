I&#x27;ve scratched a bit of this, I&#x27;m not expert.<p>Needham alone is huge, and Chinese technology vast.  If you can find a copy (a decent college&#x2F;uni library should have a set), it&#x27;s fascinating to leaf through.<p>There are several digests, one a single volume, another a mere ten (!), rather than the 30 or so of the full work.<p>Simon Winchester has written a biography, <i>The Man Who Loved China</i>.<p>Philosphy covers a fair bit of general knowledge development, and Peter Adamson&#x27;s series in his History of Philosophy project includes Western, Arabic&#x2F;Islamic, Indian, Africana, and eventually Chinese philosophy.  Science and technology make apprearances, along with ... a lot ... of religion, ethics, aesthetcss, logic, epistemology, metaphysics, and more.<p>I&#x27;m very weak on anything Africa.  The UNESCO series <i>A General History of Africa</i>, 11 volumes, (1964-) is the most comprehensive of which I&#x27;m aware, which isn&#x27;t saying much.
