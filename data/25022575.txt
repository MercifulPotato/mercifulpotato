It&#x27;s as simple as that. Personally, I hope it&#x27;s a failure because I don&#x27;t want there to have been any impropriety. If that&#x27;s the case, Trump is done. There is no fascism. There is no dictator.<p>It&#x27;s not “as simple as that.”<p>He&#x27;s made baseless claims about the security of mail-based voting, suggested that shifts in tallies are the results of illegal votes — instead of a predictable effect of preventing counties from tallying ballots until election day, and clearly and unequivocally claimed that he has won the election and that any other outcome must be a result of fraud.<p>Working to create the appearance of fraud and then pointing to the situation as evidence is problematic, even if it is not ultimately successful.')
