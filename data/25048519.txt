Item(by='elmo2you', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605029505, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25045697, text='&gt; It&#x27;s likely not an anti-trust issue. No single manufacturer has anything close to a monopoly ..<p>Funny .. It&#x27;s exactly this kind of response that illustrates what I meant with the erosion of the meaning of anti-trust.<p>You appear to hold a rather narrow definition of what anti-trust means. One that is not surprisingly rather convenient for a lot of companies these days, and as mentioned a result of systemic lobbying efforts (for decades). Feel free to know little about history, and go make those same mistakes all over again. Just don&#x27;t even dare complain, when you end up regretting it.<p>&gt; ... and there&#x27;s no legal duty to make it the printers compatible with third party modules.<p>I never argued there is such a thing. There is a legal duty to prosecute anti-trust violations though.<p>&gt; Vote with your wallet and buy something that will work with third party ink. Go a step further and avoid all HP products. That&#x27;s the only way this will be solved.<p>Sadly, that won&#x27;t solve it either (history has a way of proving that point). But it is indeed the only thing you can really do. Still, as an argument it is about as valid as saying: &quot;don&#x27;t go out on the street after dark, if you do not want to get killed&quot;.<p>Might be equally true, pragmatically speaking. But totally side-steps that your country has a legal duty to at least try keep you from being murdered for no reason. You know .. because it signed and ratified that pesky little document called the Universal Declaration of Human Right ;-)')
