Average temperatures in the winter in Toronto are only slightly colder than NYC.<p>Yes, where I&#x27;m originally from in central Alberta, it gets cold as hell. But most of the population of Ontario (the most populous province) lives significantly south of the 49th parallel, on the same latitude as much of Oregon. Further south than Vermont, Maine, or New Hampshire, and due to weather patterns this side of the lake is actually a tad warmer on average than the south side in central NY.<p>TDLR: Most of Canada isn&#x27;t as cold as the stereotypes. Lots of Americans live in colder areas.')
