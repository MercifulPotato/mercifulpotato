This means the more you have to give, the more you get to decide for the rest of us what counts as “public good.” I’m not sure I like the idea of a handful of billionaires deciding for us what public projects are worthy and good.<p>Today, my neighborhood&#x27;s roads get paved the same as Jeff Bezos&#x27;s neighborhood. If taxes were voluntary, then I might not be able to afford more than dirt roads for my house, whereas I bet Jeff&#x27;s house would be fine.')
