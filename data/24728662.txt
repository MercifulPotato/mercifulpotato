Tools like massscan generally send 1-2 packets per port, so a target host just has to deal with &lt; 130k packets, even assuming no intermediate firewalls are dropping the traffic to unused ports.<p>Also, minor nit, if it&#x27;s just one machine doing the scanning, that&#x27;s a DoS, not a DDoS :)')
