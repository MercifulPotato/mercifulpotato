I would use this as a remote terminal to the desktop so I could still use the desktop&#x27;s power from my couch.<p>As wifi speeds have increased, netbooks have all but disappeared and laptops mostly suck, I&#x27;m seriously considering this again, but instead of a netbook I&#x27;d jerry-rig a Raspberry Pi into a &quot;laptop&quot;.')
