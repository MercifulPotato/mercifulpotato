If Amazon has a 50% cost advantage on AI by producing their own chips, then an algorithm working 2x as effective but inaccessible to Amazon would be enough to catch up.<p>So my prediction is that as chip designs get more exclusive, algorithmic research will become more important again.<p>Everyone is using interpreted languages because CPU time is still considered cheap. So if you want to prepare for this future as a coder, learn C++ or Rust.')
