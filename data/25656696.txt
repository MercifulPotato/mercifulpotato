It is much easier for old people to look back on a lifetime of doing good than young people, but prioritising healthcare to young people minimises DALY lost.<p>It also penalises people who are sick with serious diseases, as giving them more healthcare would have less impact than helping someone healthy.<p>I think it is easy to justify mathematically but in practice would be quite cruel. Plus it creates incentives for shenanigans as people desperately bribe doctors to lie about their potential futures.')
