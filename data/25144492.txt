For example, in Europe you must offer at least two years of warranty.<p>Corporations are government-granted legal fictions, so a government is free to impose whatever constraints it wants on corporations. In return, corporations get plenty of benefits like the ability to declare bankruptcy and not have it hit the pocketbooks of its executives. I would be fine with a regime where if a corporation doesn&#x27;t abide by the rules, its executives become personally liable for debts, for example.')
