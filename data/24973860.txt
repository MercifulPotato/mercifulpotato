For example if you use Linux on ARM you still need to build new containers, because the x86_64 won&#x27;t work there, so why it should be different with FreeBSD? Yes, it would be great to run the same docker images on FreeBSD, but that should be a later step, and stuff like described in this wiki, could be used to accomplish that.')
