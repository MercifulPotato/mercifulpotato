If so, I would recommend considering using something like Duplicacy (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;gilbertchen&#x2F;duplicacy" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;gilbertchen&#x2F;duplicacy</a>) to perform your backups with snapshots.<p>The reason being is you can decide how long to keep older copies of files, just in case something changes on a file, but you don&#x27;t happen to realize the incorrect update for a couple of months and want to go back to an earlier version.<p>To give you an idea of what is possible, here is the snapshot configuration I use:\nKeep no snapshots older than 450 days\nKeep 1 snapshot every 90 day(s) if older than 180 day(s)\nKeep 1 snapshot every 30 day(s) if older than 30 day(s)\nKeep 1 snapshot every 1 day(s) if older than 1 day(s)')
