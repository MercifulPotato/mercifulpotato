All the diffs used in git log presentation or git-diff command or git rebase command are computed on the fly from the two stored versions. And yes, if you commit a giant file, and then delete it in next commit it&#x27;s there forever, until you remove or rewrite a history of a branch that references this file somewhere in history.<p>There&#x27;re optimizations on the storage level, compression etc, but on logic level those are transparent')
