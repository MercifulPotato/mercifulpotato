Whether it&#x27;s legal censorship or illegal or even government mandated, it&#x27;s still censorship. You&#x27;re trying to change the meaning of well-defined terms because you&#x27;re uncomfortable with what the implications of them might be. If you&#x27;re pro-censorship, just say so, don&#x27;t try to change what freedom of speech means.<p>There&#x27;s no one who would advocate complete and total freedom of speech in every arena. Whether it&#x27;s social, legal or self censorship, the question isn&#x27;t about whether a line exists, it&#x27;s where we place it.')
