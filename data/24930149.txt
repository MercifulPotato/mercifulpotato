Item(by='jpcooper', descendants=None, kids=[24934013], score=None, time=1603977508, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24913371, text='Actually what exactly is the member of staff doing on the DLR that is necessary, other than answering tourists&#x27; questions and putting a triangular key into a receptacle at every stop and then turning it? I have not been able to figure this out.<p>In the Netherlands, the NS has two types of trains that go between towns. Intercity and Sprinter. Sprinters have someone who will walk onto the platform at every stop, or failing that, lean out of the carriage, verify that no one is getting in, and then step into the train again to put the key into the receptacle and then turn it. Following that, the doors close. In contrast, there is no such person on Intercity trains; they do fine without. There may be a conductor who checks tickets. In comparison to the DLR, both Sprinter and Intercity trains have drivers.<p>Is there some requirement or function that I am missing that requires a dedicated member of staff to perform this key-turning ritual at every stop on the DLR and Sprinter, or is this simply to appease the unions?<p>It could be that Sprinters are meant to be more lenient towards people running to get on than Intercities, which might have a stricter schedule.')
