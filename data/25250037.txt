The fact that its a single SOC, what in turn reduces traces on the MB. Freeing up real-estate.<p>We are finally moving to the conversion point between smartphone&#x27;s and PCs. It has been in the making for a while.<p>Now, if that is a good thing for the consumers ( losing upgradability ) is another thing? But given how PC&#x27;s have become less and less flexible anyway.<p>We used to have slots for everything ( GPU, Network, Audio, ...). Now we have ATX boards where you maximally put in a GPU. SATA is going the way of the dodo with m.2 becoming the new standard for anything data. I mean, what do we even change anymore on PC&#x27;s... CPU, Memory, GPU.<p>GPU&#x27;s will become a external device with USB4. Mass storage has been moving to NAS more and more or USB3 devices. The people that need 4+ HDD&#x27;s are more exceptions. And you can get away with USB3 HUB&#x27;s + external enclosures.<p>I questioned for a long time, why we still have Chipset, that artificially segment MB&#x27;s when the difference has become very small between them anyway. You can easily move that last bit of IO into the CPU SOC.<p>The days that we buy AMD or Intel SOC&#x27;s with some default CPU+RAM+IO is probably closer then what most think.<p>Separate hardware is probably going to become a Server &#x2F; Workstation Pro only feature ( with big $$$ prices ).<p>The reality is that hardware has reached a point, that most people did not even upgrade for years anymore. And its more a smaller group &#x2F; minority that really needs ultra fast hardware.<p>Flexibility is moved from big MB&#x27;s to external devices, connected over high speed connections.<p>Sorry if i have gone a bit off topic but when you mentioned the onboard memory, it got me thinking about how we really are moving to a SOC&#x2F;NUC&#x2F;... future for even powerful hardware.')
