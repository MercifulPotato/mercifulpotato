I did a course on Data Analysis from MIT and used R a bit there. I liked GGplot and RStudio. I don&#x27;t think Python has anything close to those two. R was a bit harder to learn and I&#x27;ve already forgotten most of it, since I don&#x27;t use it. I understand that it&#x27;s based on Scheme and has roots in functional programming. I&#x27;m curious about Julia as it&#x27;s being promoted as one of the fastest languages. I don&#x27;t see a lot of value in that as I do most of my data intensive (in terabytes) work on pySpark on AWS clusters before I touch Pandas or any other BI tool. I couldn&#x27;t use Julia on my laptop to do that! I guess sticking to R has more short term benefit as most courses on Statistics are heavily dependent on R. Julia will probably catch up soon.')
