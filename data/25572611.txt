I can code without an IDE just fine, I just don&#x27;t want to.<p>It&#x27;s too slow and you end up doing a lot of very repetitive and boring tasks. Modern IDEs, much like type systems, help you avoid whole class of errors.<p>Why type a method name, with the risk of typos, when with 3 keystrokes it&#x27;s filled for you and provably correct.<p>Same for renaming operations, function&#x2F;variable extraction, etc.<p>Also, code navigation. Large codebases are read a lot more than written. And code is not read like a book, it&#x27;s more like traversing a graph. Do dataflow analysis, find usages, analyze hierarchies, etc.')
