For a third party to have a chance, you would need individuals from both dominat parties to switch. I say this because most people see their party affiliation as part of their identity and a switch may create substantial cognitive dissonance. Also factor in the combative nature of politics and people won&#x27;t leave their party if they know it means the opposition party would be more likely to win. It&#x27;s similar to how many people see this election and the prior election as a choice for the lesser of two evils - it&#x27;s not about winning, but about the other side <i>not</i> winning.<p>The way I explain my view on the election is that it is a choice between a shit sandwich and a shit sandwich without the bread. Which one is which depends on the topic&#x2F;policy that matters most to each voter, but they are both terrible choices.')
