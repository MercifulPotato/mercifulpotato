It happens very rarely sure, but certainly not never. Probably about as often as experts in any other language&#x2F;profession make silly mistakes. Perhaps you’re a better schemster than him, but I have my doubts :)<p>I think no matter the language the syntax will disappear over time and your brain will learn to look at the character matrix and directly see logical constructs, moreover this will always apply cross-language to other languages with similar syntax. Fit example, I primarily work in TS, I have decent amount of experience in other C-style, and to me Rust is easily readable with very little experience actually using it.')
