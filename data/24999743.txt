The confusion seen here is quite common when somebody without a proper philosophy background is trying to hold a discourse on abstract philosophical topics. Obviously it happens often in philosophy, but often due to the outsiders (computer scientists, physicists, sociologists, artists) who believe, they have revolutionary ideas ;) Wittgenstein&#x27;s (or rather Kripkenstein&#x27;s, depending on the interpretation) were rather of a different, more profound, nature.<p>In my opinion author has decent ideas but lacks skills in communication to express them properly.<p>&gt; because the facts of problems to be solved and, moreso, of the physical machines we use in solving them provide ground truth.<p>It is a very optimistic view of the programming as a knowledge domain. IMHO in real life &quot;The facts of problems&quot; are often very blurry and prone to similar problems seen in the philosophy. I am not talking about academic toy problems, but real-life problems that have to be solved.')
