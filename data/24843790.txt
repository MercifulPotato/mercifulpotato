The number of read() syscalls shrinks as the per-call buffer grows.<p>With mmap() of course we only ever have one syscall to create the initial mapping. Everything else is a memory read.<p>We can get read() down to just one syscall too, with a 4G buffer ;) I can&#x27;t recall if GB sized buffers are possible, but I have certainly used MB sized read buffers for exactly this reason.')
