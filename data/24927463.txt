He was an absolute favorite of students of all backgrounds. Extremely strict, very buttoned up. In the arts department. I think he literally was the advisor for like the multi-cultural club (that did somewhat lame lunch multi-cultural stuff).<p>He put on a performance that turned out was racist or sexist or something. Think les miserable - we were always doing stuff like that, so the stories were very varied.<p>Bam, he was gone. Even the students in the group that should have been offended were like, he&#x27;s great. But there was a very very vocal very small set of more activist parents (white BTW!) with one or two students who were after him. Reminds me of the (white again) liberals in Portland or Seattle going after the police chief to cut her pay etc (black women).<p>I was like, who cares what two parents and their kids think. But they got in the paper talking about the racist (I think?) environment he created &#x2F; messages being sent &#x2F; cultural appropriation etc. This is theatre - people dress up as different characters so no question an identity politics issue was there most likely.<p>And yes - he was gone the next year after something like 12 years of building up this amazing program. His performances were sold out for multiple showings (literally everyone in school, every parent, every relative, randos went). The shows were major. All the context was overlooked (this guy was so formal he was never crude &#x2F; rude or insulting). He&#x27;d spent all these extra hours doing all these things to bring different groups together - through music and more (he was an immigrant).<p>Two to three people, a scared &#x2F; sensitive admin team, and boom, thousands of folks the worse for his going.<p>Everyone is worse for this. A lot of the categories of offense are extremely broad or very subtle and penalties are very severe.')
