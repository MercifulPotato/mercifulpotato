And then the whole COVID response would have been framed in those terms, as a right-left politicization like it is in the US. At least now, with a right wing government administrating the COVID response, only the far lunatic right (cough Randy Hillier cough) has politicized it. For conservatives, it&#x27;s &quot;their guy&quot; delivering the tough medicine, and they just blame Trudeau for anything they don&#x27;t like, even things the feds have nothing to do with. While it hasn&#x27;t been great the management of this situation is not _nearly_ as bad as it could be. Just look at Jason Kenney&#x27;s gov&#x27;t.')
