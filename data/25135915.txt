Item(by='csala', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605701648, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25135501, text='&gt; I&#x27;ve honestly tried to give Vim a go, there just seemed like to much setup and configuration so I went back to an IDE.<p>I&#x27;d like to point out something to avoid scaring away potential Vim newcomers here.<p>While it&#x27;s true that Vim can get as complex as you want via plugins and configuration, I think that one of beauties of developing with Vim is not doing this, spending a lot of effort configuring it to behave like a complex IDE, but rather changing a bit your working paradigm to rely only on just the basics and, at most, a few tweaks on a custom .vimrc which you can quickly scp over (or wget) to the host where you are working on.<p>Here I will totally agree that at the beginning it may require some time to get used to it. But once you get there, the level of freedom that it gives you is totally worth it. And not only because then any shell feels like home, but also because not having all the IDE helpers available also ends up forcing you to have some additional awareness about what you are doing on the code. You need to remember what the function signatures are, where the different pieces of code are, take care of the coding style while typing, etc. And, while it&#x27;s truly a much more spartan experience, at the end your efficiency stops depending on your working environment to become just a part of you.')
