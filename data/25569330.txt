Sheer labor is worth minimum wage, the value of someone is far more than their hourly labor.<p>A well connected person can  bring many many times the value to a company of someone without connections.<p>The right strong personality can be a performance amplifier for the rest of the company, Steve Jobs can be argued to be an example of that.<p>The long and short of it though is a person who makes the people beneath themselves work more valuable is worth that added value, and arguably deserves a proportional portion of said added value.')
