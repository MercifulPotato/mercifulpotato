Empirical studies suggest this effect does not occur.<p>That study doesn&#x27;t deal with long-term neighborhood revitalizations. It&#x27;s dealing with new developments in New York generally, though if you read the study it still mentions that the amenity effect does occur and could increase rents. It says that this is offset by increased supply, but that&#x27;s looking at things in aggregate. The increased demand from a few new restaurants in a already developed area isn&#x27;t going to come close to the transformation of a burned out crime ridden area into a prosperous one. Anytime spent in gentrifying neighborhoods (or time spent looking at how cities have been trying to develop these) will show you that, unsurprisingly, the impact is much higher there.')
