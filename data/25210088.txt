Just as your vulnerability scanner du jour.<p>Sometimes an attacker does not need more than a flaw discovered and patched 2 years ago. Regularly I still see important systems in my customers&#x27; networks vulnerable to MS17-10. But that is covered completely by vulnerability scanning.<p>What does this supposedly bring to the table? Blue team training? Network detection validation and tests?<p>If you are a financial institution the groups that want to target you include sophisticated and determined attackers. They will have techniques not adequately covered by these systems. Or they will just invent a new technique. You don&#x27;t hamstring these operators by endlessly re-sending their C2&#x27;s traffic through your network sensors! (Or so I keep telling people rabidly interested in &quot;actor emulation&quot;). They are not stupid, they&#x27;ll just invent a new technique...<p>Secondly, holes in your monitoring correlate with holes in your preventive security. You can hardly monitor for an exploit you don&#x27;t know exists. You can&#x27;t &#x27;simulate&#x27; an attacker living of the land.')
