Item(by='tzs', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601567510, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24650718, text='Q1: would it be possible to make a dongle that when plugged into a USB-C port negotiates for maximum power and tells you what the port can do?<p>Q2: can it also do this for speed? (I&#x27;m not sure if there is a speed negotiation like there is for power, and even if there is I&#x27;m not sure if it would depend on the use--e.g., maybe a particular port supports a different maximum speed for network devices than it does for mass storage devices)<p>Q3: Can a similar thing be done for cables? A box you plug both ends of a cable into, and it tells you how much power you can put over the cable, and how fast it can go?<p>Q4: could these things be made small enough and cheap enough that it would be reasonable to expect nearly everyone to get them?<p>The above devices, plus readily available USB-C one to many hubs [1], would fix most problems people have with USB-C.<p>[1] Most USB-C hubs connect one USB-C port on your computer to many non-USB-C ports. Most that do have a USB-C port on the other side only have one (and sometimes that one is power only, not data).')
