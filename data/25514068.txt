They seem to have used pre-existing towers and modelling.<p>Telcos would have known this works but haven&#x27;t done it because of why? Regulations on high towers? They don&#x27;t want to be stuck managing these unique things? What&#x27;s the catch.<p>The solution is probably not technology but some sort of process issue that you need to actually get dirty to find out about and fix. Facebook needs to invest in building towers.  Go do it in Africa. If it&#x27;s profitable they wont lose money and if not they&#x27;ve tried something great.')
