Wasn&#x27;t expecting this to happen :) The site is definitely still in Beta so I appreciate any and all feedback.  I just launched it a few days ago.  It&#x27;s been my COVID project and I finally got to the point where I felt comfortable having others use it.<p>The biggest hurdle was the speed of the graph creation.  Basically taking a 250,000,000 paper&#x2F;2,500,000 citaiton db and creating graphs that could be up to 200k papers and 3-4mm citations. For that I ended up learning&#x2F;using Rust (which was a great experience).<p>The plan is to keep it totally free and hopefully get some institutional support once I get a better handle on demand and costs.<p>Ask me anything!<p>EDIT:\nAs you are going through the site, be sure to use the purple &quot;+&quot; buttons to create your own graphs centered on the topic of your choice. That combined with the in-graph keyword filters are probably the most powerful ways to quickly zero in on the most relevant literature.')
