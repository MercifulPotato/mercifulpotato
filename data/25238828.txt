Like praying away cancer or medical problems, or believing they have magic powers.  Sometimes believing you can do something that you can&#x27;t (or will never happen) is a detriment.<p>Now let&#x27;s talk about the &quot;not certain or probable&quot; as I think this is more interesting ground.  Sometimes you have to realize that you need to do something differently.  If what you want to do isn&#x27;t probable, then maybe you should look at the problem in a way that has more probable success.  I struggle with this all the time at work, sometimes I feel like I&#x27;m right on the cusp of a breakthrough or bugfix, and other times it feels hopeless.  But that doesn&#x27;t always mean it is so.  Sometimes knowing when to give up is important, as long as you start again.  Or maybe you realize it wasn&#x27;t that important after all, and you should just do something else.<p>I could believe all I want I need to win the lottery.  I could buy a ticket every day and it&#x27;s not probable I will win, but it&#x27;s not impossible.  And you never know!')
