It&#x27;s just too far from my workflow (maybe that&#x27;s just me).<p>I can, however, see how something like this would be extremely valuable to people who are instructing others on how to write code (DevX, bootcamp instructors, people who do video coding tutorials). I think that &quot;Document your code just by hitting &#x27;record&#x27;&quot; is overselling that value though.')
