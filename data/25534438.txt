It was within a span of a few years of deep social isolation. I had frozen meals delivered and left outside the condo. I mean fully that I didn&#x27;t interact with a physical human during those months.<p>It was a painful experience at times, although I tried not to wallow in it. Becoming completely accepting of that sort of isolation, and growing to thrive within it, is something I wish everyone could experience.')
