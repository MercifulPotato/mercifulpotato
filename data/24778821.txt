There&#x27;s other companies that care nothing about such paperwork, but want to hire people who are good at solving problems and eager to learn (quickly!) from colleagues about all the stuff needed to do the job beyond the code base itself.<p>PS: don&#x27;t leave the career change too long - ageism does, sadly, exist in the tech industry. It took me over 800 applications to land that first gig!')
