What a great deal. A year later, I sell it for $600,000. Hey cool, I made $100,000 profit. Of course, quietly I&#x27;ve handed the original seller a briefcase with $110,000 cash in it. The extra $10k was to keep his mouth shut, but in return I&#x27;ve converted $110,000 of dirty money into $100,000 of clean money.<p>But maybe it&#x27;s not just one house- maybe it&#x27;s 10 houses. Maybe it&#x27;s a huge mansion worth $5m (which I negotiated a great deal on at $4m). I&#x27;m not cleaning the full value of the asset, I&#x27;m cleaning some portion of it&#x27;s value.<p>What those other parties do with the dirty money is up to them, but it&#x27;s easier to deal with smaller amounts of it, spread out, than it is to deal with one big pile of dirty money. Maybe they work construction as a general contractor and buy their supplies for jobs using cash, but get paid in clean money. Many hands make short work when it comes to cleaning money.<p>All that said, every large purchase - homes, cars, boats, etc - leaves a trace. Financial Intel agencies get a report each time you move $10k or more. And if you move too much, too frequently, they start investigating- how come this guy bought 5 houses in 3 years, each one below market value? Sooner or later, someone under questioning by the police gives you up and then it all unravels.')
