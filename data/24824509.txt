You are absolutely right that incentives and policy play huge roles (even more so in the US). I agree that my online doctor example was not the best choice.<p>However, my point stands that there is a fair share of difficult technology problems that will meaningfully contribute to healthcare:<p>1) Symptom checking: Identify the state of a patient prior to the point of care.\n 2) Triage: Prioritise treatment options in conjunction with 1)\n 3) Assisted decision making: Improve professional decision making, especially for rare diseases.\n 4) Patient follow-up: Manage the process after care has been received.\n 5) Symptom tracking &#x2F; monitoring: Quantify disease severity over time. \n 6) Adherence to medication: It&#x27;s estimated 50% of medication is not being taken.\n 7) Personalised medicine: Match treatment&#x2F;prevention options to patients (e.g. genetics, gender, circadian rhythm)\n ...<p>These are some broad themes from the top of my head, of course there are many more disease specific problems, e.g. the early detection of Parkinson in voice samples, automation and delivery of CBT for insomnia, the list goes on.')
