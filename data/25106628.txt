On a single GPU you&#x27;ll spend years to train reasonable quality model, moreover a streaming one. Streaming training requires teacher-student setup.<p>Thats why there are dozen RNNT projects around, some of them more reasonable, some less, but most of them struggle to demonstrate even a good librispeech WER.<p>You have a long way to go.')
