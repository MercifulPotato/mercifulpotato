Organizing a union is different from doing intentionally disruptive protest activity, and while one can argue that both are morally correct, one is a lot more job-threatening than the other.<p>The people who are organization the union and signing petitions,  but not hacking employer systems or calling their coworkers &quot;Nazis&quot; are still employed and organizing but also less visible to the public.<p>Much like cyclists facing cars have to learn that it&#x27;s better to be alive than claim the right of way and be dead, activists need to be smart about taking calculated risks. (And if people are calculating that getting fired is good for their political cause or future career at a like-minded organization, then good for them!)')
