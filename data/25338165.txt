The flame doesn&#x27;t hit the bottom of the pot at all. I can heat up 2x the water in my pot that has 2x the diameter in less time.<p>Sucks.<p>The old fashion type of electric burner in that article is my 2nd favorite, great contact with almost any type of pot or pan put down on it.<p>The best pot I ever had for heating water was of the dollar store variety. It was pretty much the minimal vessel needed to just hold the water.<p>Wider diameter pots of course work best, assuming a lid is put on. More bottom surface area to transfer heat to the water.')
