Item(by='amyjess', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609964423, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25661496, text='HN has rules against stories that are pure politics and that don&#x27;t speak to intellectual curiosity, and I&#x27;m sure people are flagging this article on those grounds.<p>But the mods have also said that exceptions will be given to political events that are particularly historic. I&#x27;m not a mod, and I have no power here, but I&#x27;d like to think this counts as historic enough. Personally, I haven&#x27;t been anywhere near this scared for the future of my country since 9&#x2F;11. Not even 2016 gave me this feeling.')
