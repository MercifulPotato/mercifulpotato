It&#x27;s both too obvious and also too obtuse. It completely ignores what certain types of foods do inside &#x2F; to your body. It&#x27;s possible to gain weight on a caloric deficit and it&#x27;s possible to lose weight on caloric excess. People who struggle to lose weight while intentionally under eating and trying to exercise more and end up failing, feel terrible about themselves because they believe this unhelpful statement you keep repeating.')
