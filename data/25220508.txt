Even if general-audience coding schemes like this enjoyed some popularity (I do not know but am rather doubtful), it does not mean that everything in such a book saw usage. Did people employ a code word to save a fraction of a pound on placing a 4000 pound lay bet (another example) at presumably greatly increased risk of the bet getting cocked up completely or to concisely inform the family that whilst the mother was a goner but at least the female baby twin survived? It would be fascinating if they did, but maybe a bit of scepticism is in order.')
