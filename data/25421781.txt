Various models of apprenticeship&#x2F;training&#x2F;education fail today, because we have rejected what made them work in the past. We don&#x27;t want &#x2F; can&#x27;t have a system where young people are completely under the control of an apprentice master for several years, unable to change jobs or live where they want. This is probably a good thing. But without it, the idea of apprenticeships makes little sense.')
