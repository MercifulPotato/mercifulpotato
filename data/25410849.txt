How would that make sense? It would if many large governments abandoned their own currency system and used bitcoins.<p>Compare that to golds 1.9trillion practical market size.  To match that Bitcoin would be 100k$. Which seem to be a stretch in 5 years by many imaginations, one that requires US to pretty much hyper inflate.<p>A more realistic upper price could be 50k$ in 5 years based on regulatory risk, volatility and realistic cap, half of all of golds theoretical cap.<p>The down side is a side way risk where Bitcoin will stay around this 20k-30k mark, may as well invest that in equities or ETFs.')
