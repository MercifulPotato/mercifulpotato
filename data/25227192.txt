We could start to think of the team as the manager. The team can perfectly give feedback, handle friction, distribute boring work and so on. We already have plenty of stupid daily standups, team meetings, weekly all-hnds meetings and so on, \nso it wouldn&#x27;t really be hard to have a team daily standup where problems can be brought up to everyone and solved cooperatively.')
