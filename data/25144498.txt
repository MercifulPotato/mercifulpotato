Everything from custom JS frameworks with XML&#x2F;XSLT bindings, to React, to plain HTML and a bit of jQuery and everything in between.<p>The whole time I&#x27;ve had the lingering thought, &quot;There has to be a better of doing this than popping open my text editor and manually writing all these tags&quot;.<p>Was it the &quot;field-group&quot; tag I needed to wrap these in? Why won&#x27;t this damn thing align vertically? What was the structure of that select element that&#x27;s not actually a &lt;select&gt;? Why did I think this was a good career choice again? Even with years of experience, little things like these eat up so much of my time. I&#x27;m jealous of tools like Elementor that work well in Wordpress but not for custom frameworks that so many of us work in from day to day.<p>Pretty much all the ui builder tools I&#x27;ve seen are scoped to a specific framework, or aren&#x27;t programmable&#x2F; extensible enough for me to drag and drop custom elements onto pages and save me dev time.<p>Has anyone else had the same thought? Are you using tools like this today and I&#x27;m just missing something?')
