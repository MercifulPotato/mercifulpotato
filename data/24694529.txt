I had a pair of sennheiser headphones back in like ~2005, they lasted like 11 years before the cups started to fall apart. I replaced them with a new pair of sennheiser which lasted ~12 months before they began to fall apart... Not only that, the old sennheiser was SUPER comfy, the new ones hurt my ears after a while... Replaced the new sennheiser with another model, fall apart in ~12 months...<p>Now I&#x27;m just using some Asus gaming headphones, quality is not Bose level but its good enough, and the cups have lasted longer than the last 2 pair of sennheiser I&#x27;ve had.')
