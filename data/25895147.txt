It is the substitution of a common force for individual forces. And this common force is to do only what the individual forces have a natural and lawful right to do: to protect persons, liberties, and properties; to maintain the right of each, and to cause justice to reign over us all. &quot;<p>The problem with modern society today is the law goes far far far beyond what individuals have the ethical right to do,  namely self defense. Today the law has been perverted by the influence of two entirely different causes: stupid greed and false philanthropy.<p>The law has placed the collective force at the disposal of the unscrupulous who wish, without risk, to exploit the person, liberty, and property of others. It has converted plunder into a right, in order to protect plunder. And it has converted lawful defense into a crime, in order to punish lawful defense.')
