If Medicare kicks in earlier than 65, then perhaps those who want to retire or semi retire will clear up bottleneck.<p>How about instead of ‘mandatory retirement at 50,I propose ‘retirement benefits kick in’.(Altho it won’t solve the problem..but gives people a choice to retire earlier without fear of being left without instance coverage)<p>I should have also clarified that this thought experiment scenario is for the United States only.
