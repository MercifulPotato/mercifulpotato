I didn&#x27;t think it&#x27;d be a problem for me, but a year or two in, I felt regret there.<p>The Surface Book seems like a vast improvement in that regard... but it&#x27;s extremely expensive, and relied on an overengineered latching mechanism. Dell made a really neat Book alternative, the Latitude 7285, which was really compelling, but by the time I was in the market, they&#x27;d abandoned that form factor already. :&#x2F;')
