All 10 of them, when followed up with the purported voter, were found to be valid.<p>This gives you a rough estimate of voter fraud of having an impact of &lt;0.01% of the election results. The tightest race this year was 0.25% margin--that&#x27;s a full 20Ã— a reasonable upper bound on the incidence of voter fraud. <i>Fraud doesn&#x27;t change election results.</i><p>On the flip side, some of what you claim about--particularly ID rules--has a real disenfranchising effect on people. Having valid ID isn&#x27;t an issue if you&#x27;re someone who drives, but if you&#x27;re someone who is physically incapable of driving and can&#x27;t get a driver&#x27;s license, well, obtaining that ID can be quite difficult. (Even getting a driver&#x27;s license in my state requires going to a particular building in the hours of 9-5 M-F--sucks if you have an hourly job you can&#x27;t get time off to get an ID!)<p>A lot of the rest of what you complain about... [citation needed]. The complaints I&#x27;ve seen about signature verification aren&#x27;t about requiring a signature on the ballot, it&#x27;s about requiring a <i>second</i> signature (IIRC, unrelated to you!) to &quot;witness&quot; you doing the ballot yourself. In all the states I&#x27;m aware of, the voter is still required to sign the ballot themselves.')
