The identity has also evolved into Xicano or Xicana and, more recently, Xicanx. Chicano&#x2F;a is sometimes used interchangeably with Mexican American, although the terms have different meanings.[..]<p>I would think Latino&#x2F;a applied more to Europe than in the Americas.

I had always associated it with Rome, not Spain.<p>The Latins <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Latins" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Latins</a> [..] The Latins were originally an Italic tribe in ancient central Italy from Latium. As Roman power and colonization spread Latin culture, during the Roman Empire, Latins came to mean mostly unified Italic Latin-speaking people and the Latin-speaking people of Dacia, Iberia, Illyria, and Gaul whose land was settled by Roman colonists (see Latin peoples).

In consequence, by the mid-19th century, the former American colonies of these nations became known as Latin America and this region&#x27;s inhabitants as Latin Americans.[..]')
