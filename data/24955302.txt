It&#x27;s like someone looking at the human body and complaining about the huge amount of energy spent collecting waste from the body and passing it out via the urinary tract. Wouldn&#x27;t it be wonderful if the body didn&#x27;t generate any waste in the first place and thus didn&#x27;t need a urinary tract in the first place?<p>The problem with this scenario is that it is unrealistic, just like assuming there is a way of having an absolutely peaceful world.<p>A planet with billions of agents each who are moderately self-interested will result in the agents trying to take things from each other by force. To protect themselves, the agents form groups and aggregate their resources, using them to produce war-making abilities that can deter other agents. &#x27;Tis the way of the world.<p>The wonderful thing is how far we&#x27;ve come in making the world safer over the last 2000 years. In the west we have a largely functional police force and judiciary that will protect and provide justice to every citizen regardless of their political influence<i></i><p><i></i> As compared to 2000 years ago of course, as compared to some utopian ideal we have a long way to go, as recent news in the US shows :)')
