Perhaps there is (or could be) an hn equivalent for pols and wonks and they would have really invigorating discussions about policy and rarely flame each other because they were past that level. Then every so often someone would post something about programming a universal remote controller and they&#x27;d flame each other about technical topics and each others&#x27; ignorant opinions on how humans and machines interact.<p>&gt; There might even be some interesting points being made about the role of technology in all this, but they&#x27;re being drowned out by the purely political back-and-forth.<p>I&#x27;m just happy that people with different viewpoints are learning from each other. People with different viewpoints don&#x27;t really learn from each other on most other platforms. They basically only learn to emulate the rhetorical jabs that score points.')
