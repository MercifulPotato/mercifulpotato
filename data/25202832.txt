Simply trying a bunch of inputs and choosing the most effective ones based on the output is like running a single round of training on a machine learning model. It&#x27;s hardly machine learning by any stretchâ€”there&#x27;s no feedback loop, the machine doesn&#x27;t &quot;learn&quot; anything.<p>If I build a compiler and test a thousand constants for default configuration options and choose the ones that perform the best, or would be a very bold claim to call my compiler &quot;powered by machine learning&quot;.')
