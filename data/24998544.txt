Learning on the job today is a snooze. Training manuals and performance reviews? Terrible. We think better coaching results in more people reaching their full potential. To start, weâ€™re building screen-capture tech and workflow analytics for team members to watch and learn from each other, remotely.<p>Myself and 2 other co-founders left HBS to build this. Backgrounds at Uber + General Catalyst, and our CTO in blockchain tech.<p>We&#x27;re a team of 7 that have raised seed funding (unannounced) and looking for Senior Full-Stack Engineers who care about helping people be their best at work and having fun while joining on the ground floor.<p>More info: on.so&#x2F;Senior-Full-Stack-Engineer-Tango-bd92c1e529b746e58c0e62e27c94e4c5<p>Apply: rebrand.ly&#x2F;tango-sfse<p>or reach out dan at tango.us - always excited to share more!')
