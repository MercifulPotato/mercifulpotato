Item(by='AnthonyMouse', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610163199, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25696003, text='Something really weird happened with Donald Trump.<p>He had a tendency to say things like &quot;I got twice as many votes as Obama did when he was reelected.&quot; (I don&#x27;t think he actually said that one, but it&#x27;s hard to find a real example when... they deleted his twitter account.)<p>And then that isn&#x27;t true. Trump got ~74M, in 2012 Obama got ~66M, that&#x27;s not twice as much. But it&#x27;s <i>more</i>. So if they run the story correcting it, they&#x27;re running a story that tells people that Trump in 2020 got more votes than Obama did when he won in 2012.<p>At some point the media got tired of this, but what are they supposed to do about it? If they don&#x27;t correct it, the claim stands unopposed. If they do, they&#x27;re still running the story Trump really wanted, telling people he got more votes than Obama.<p>They eventually started omitting the context. So then the headline becomes &quot;Trump lies that he got twice as many votes as Obama&quot; and then that&#x27;s the entire story. No mention of how many there actually were. But that didn&#x27;t work, because then the first comment on the story is from some Trump supporter providing the actual numbers and you&#x27;re back to having a story about Trump lying that still benefits Trump.<p>So then they want to do something about the Trump supporters because they keep providing the inconvenient context that Trump&#x27;s controversy generator left there on purpose. So they censor them in some way. But then the supporters feel wronged -- being punished for saying something true -- so they support Trump even harder and it backfires.<p>The whole thing made them so angry that they&#x27;re now willing to cross every line in order to destroy him. But the current strategy seems to be to censor him as much as possible so that nobody sees the rebuttal to the rebuttal because nobody sees the rebuttal because nobody sees the original claim.<p>Which might actually work to destroy Trump, but only by destroying a structural pillar of the democratic process at the same time. And anybody who thinks that such a weapon, once used, will only be used once, is delusional.')
