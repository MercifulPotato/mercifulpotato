They&#x27;re in a tough spot to serve geographically since they&#x27;re effectively an island and the closest big country (China) isn&#x27;t somewhere you&#x27;d want to have your cables going though. My understanding is IIRC they largely connect to Japan and perhaps Singapore.<p>But yeah, if they just used a CDN this wouldn&#x27;t be an issue.')
