In order to join the SMC, you need to:<p>- have an acceptable usage policy that means you will not allow any of your users to send spam (defined as...). Your first violation gets a warning. Your second violation gets you suspended from the SMC for a month. Third violation in a year disqualifies your organization from ever rejoining. Reset the count a year after a second violation.<p>- register the fingerprint of your SSL certs with the SMC, which will publish it in a DNS accept-list.<p>- add an SMC header to your SMC-bound email that indicates the address of your SMC postmaster, who is one or more people who can enforce the AUP on your side. The SMC postmaster address should never accept non-SMC email.<p>- agree that the SMC postmaster will be tested every so often and a lack of a response within 168 hours will be considered a violation, same as spam.<p>That&#x27;s all off the top of my head, but it could reasonably work... for individuals and small to medium organizations.
