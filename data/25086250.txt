But as a societal model[0], it&#x27;s deeply anti-human.<p>The article does discuss the lack of &quot;data quality&quot;, but again in a very anti-human way: As anyone who&#x27;s worked on a software project is well aware of, people&#x27;s wants and needs are often intrinsic and private.<p>The author provides his own solution to the solution to this &quot;problem&quot;: &quot;Imagine if every product had tracking devices, with other sensors and cameras to determine product quality.&quot;<p>In other words, we can make communism work by spying on people.<p>While I do not object to the fact that many companies are gathering data in dubious ways, there&#x27;s something quite different to giving unlimited power to do this, to the only organisation with a monopoly on violence.<p>What if a group of citizens demand a different type of government? Or the right to private ownership of their own bodies and creations? Will anyone believe that a totalitarian government will respond to these citizens with anything but oppression and violence? If so, one ought to spend a few hours reading the history of communism.<p>While free markets don&#x27;t work well with monopolies, Amazon is still doing my bidding. I choose what to order and whether or not it is worth my money. If Amazon is out of stock, I will go somewhere else. If Amazon grows to a size where there will be no where else to go, I find that to be a proper reason to use the power of the state to make sure that competition isn&#x27;t hampered.<p>I also find the Soviet Union fascinating in many ways. But to semi-defend the system, by pointing at their lack of computational power, rather than lack of basic human qualities in the system and among its leaders, is historical revisionism at its worst.<p>While there are many errors in markets, they are somehow still much better than any planned society. Free individuals can plan for themselves, while solving the larger problems using words, rather than violence. Being able to leave is the best weapon against oppression.<p>[0] I am aware of the debate about what is &quot;real communism&quot;. At its core, a communism society is a stateless one. However, to achieve a communist society, a state ( = a monopoly on violence) is always needed and for some reason, that state only grows more powerful, violent and corrupt.')
