They don&#x27;t clog. I don&#x27;t know about you, but I don&#x27;t tend to wash baked-on lasagne from myself in the shower as happens in a dishwasher. I think it would largely be dust and the like if it wasn&#x27;t left to build up.<p>I&#x27;m thinking these things would be designed for new-builds rather than retrofitted. Recess the floor an inch. Sealed door. Pressure sprays angling down that hit the wall up to a height of around 6-7&#x27; or so. Doesn&#x27;t need to be fully watertight. Run an exhaust fan during and&#x2F;or after. Maybe have a linear grate&#x2F;drain at the shower end, and an air spray to help push water as well as dry the tiles.<p>Seal or hide power points. Cabinets would need a loose seal (they&#x27;re sprayed, not submerged).')
