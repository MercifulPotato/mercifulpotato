There is almost no specialty equipment that is mandatory, except decent PVA&#x2F;Eva glue. Just sharp blades, rulers. Everything else can be scavenged.  Iâ€™ve made many hardcover notebooks.  I am fond of A5 and A6 form factors, or passport-sized notebooks.<p>Btw does anyone know where I could find high quality trapper-keeper style hardware in smaller factors (like a5)')
