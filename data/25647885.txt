The worst is the other, powerless humans, who nonetheless cheer for the powerful humans to be able to censor them!  What do they have to gain?  Fleeting feelings of superiority over a different set of powerless humans, at best.  And a one-way trip to the Gulag at worst.<p>So you see, in your planet things may work out fine, but here it&#x27;s all a bit messier than that.  Take my advice, go back to your planet where you know what are the &quot;issues&quot;, and how to &quot;fix&quot; them.')
