I think basically, we realized that the higher reasoning and planning capabilities of a human mind that we were emulating were worth nothing without the fuzzy pattern recognition capabilities of our reptile brain to recognize and categorize objects for us to even reason about. The way I see it, the deep learning revolution of recent years is basically providing us with that missing link, the fuzzy recognition engine that serves as a foundation for higher reasoning. It still remains to be seen if this approach will scale to AGI on its own or it needs to be combined with others. But saying we are running up against a wall with that is like saying we have run up against the wall of what a visual cortex can do - the real fun begins when we combine it with other components, and those other components are still being developed.')
