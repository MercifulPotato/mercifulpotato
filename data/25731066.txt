There is a powerful segment, including the media, cheering this on. But I believe most Democrats just want to move on.<p>The media doesn&#x27;t want this to end because they are at an unprecedented level of power right now. They have just become the gatekeepers of thought; a monopoly of like-minded people in control of the truth. As soon as things queit down, dissent will resume (if there is any freedom left), but for now they are on top of the world. They want to keep this going, and will stop at nothing to prevent quiet.')
