I got to watch as she adjusted the shape and then watch the milling. I didn&#x27;t get to see it come out of the kiln, which I&#x27;m told is quite a sight since it&#x27;s still glowing red hot when they take it out.<p>It&#x27;s impressive tech and the crown fit better on the first try than my previous crowns that were done the old fashioned way.')
