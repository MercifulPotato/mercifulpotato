No matter what I say, both pro-vaxxers and anti-vaxxers are equally hateful. And I feel it&#x27;s not super important and it&#x27;s just something I rarely talk about anymore.<p>Anyway, this is real off topic and I am feeling like you just don&#x27;t really understand me or something on this topic and it&#x27;s not important, really, for you in specific to understand every little thing I say.<p>I don&#x27;t intend to continue this discussion.<p>Have a great day.')
