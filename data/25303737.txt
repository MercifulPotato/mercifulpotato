It&#x27;s an extra cost and step that&#x27;s entirely unnecessary. If you want or need a service animal you obviously have to have some way to train it and care for it, but a license is extra. Also if it is ever lost or anything you could be turned away from any public place until it&#x27;s resolved. I just see it causing more issues for people than it tends to solve.')
