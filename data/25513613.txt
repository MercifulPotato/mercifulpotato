Plato understood right action as a consequence of right knowledge, the ascension from the cave into the heavens is this pursuit of right knowledge - and it got him sold into slavery by Dionysus I as a test.<p>Aristotle is a radical empiricist next to Plato (he was a a zoologist after all): absolute Good is impossible because it isn&#x27;t <i>adaptable</i> to the specific situation at hand, whatever that may be; but you can&#x27;t be very adaptable if you practice excess or are intemparate, and these take training to manage - Nichomachean Ethics is a book on proper parenting.<p>Thus I wager Plato saw himself as bringing right knowledge into the Sicilian courts, whereas Aristotle saw himself in a much more practical light in both Philip and Alexander&#x27;s courts')
