Where the 3rd piece is the human module?<p>And they’re going to land this with parachutes? Where? In the ocean?<p>Won’t this kill the reusability of the plan, for quick turn around time?<p>Granted, if the BSTSB is to only be used for transporting inorganic materials, like fuel, then G-forces does not matter for human usage.')
