They say children that go through abuse and trauma in childhood start to internalize and develop compulsive fantasy worlds as a defense mechanism (or rather we all do it via escapism - avoidance, drug abuse, paranoia, compulsive behavior, all anti-social outgrowths).<p>It’s really hard for the left to remain mature and fight rationally. They have given up on doing that and taken on the ‘if you can’t beat them, join them’ strategy where they are now using the same right-wing nonsense conspiracy tactics to rile up the base.<p>The right has fully internalized as a traumatized child into madness. They’re political capital was wasted on a party that used them to goto war, bailout banks, not buff up or protect the working class. They are betrayed, and like an abused child, fully cocooned themselves from rationally considering the circumstances. Even when they actually evolve and reject pro-war platforms (you know , the right wing actually adjusted and fixed this), they are unable to formulate their economic concerns in a non-racist way. They are exhausted and beaten down, and basically need rehab.<p>They literally need a breather, but the Republican machine won’t give them that and will rile them up against everything Biden&#x2F;Dems will do for the next four years. It’s viscous stuff, reminds me of a bipolar kid I remember from elementary school where all the kids would just rile him up knowing he’d eventually start throwing chairs uncontrollably. It’s callous as fuck, there’s no love amongst ourselves at all.<p>There are no healthy adults at the table at the moment.')
