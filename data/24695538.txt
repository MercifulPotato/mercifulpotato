This way any code will turn into a big ball of mud over time. This is a problem.<p>But trying to anticipate everything in the first iteration is not the solution. The solution is to write maintainable code and apply each change with the same discipline and thought which was used when in the initial iteration. Follow the boy scout rule: After any change, the code should be in a better state than before.')
