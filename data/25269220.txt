Item(by='Delk', descendants=None, kids=[25269479], score=None, time=1606852995, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25268303, text='To be fair, I get notifications of &quot;important updates&quot; on my Fedora Workstation more often than I get on Windows. (Or at least I think I do; I don&#x27;t use Windows that often.) Fedora also wants to reboot for nearly every bunch of updated packages that doesn&#x27;t consist entirely of top-level applications, which seems to mean at least 95% of the times it wants to update.<p>I think I get it why it wants to reboot: not only is it probably somewhat safer in terms of not screwing anything up in running session, but you can&#x27;t be sure some running application or service isn&#x27;t still using an outdated version of a library until you&#x27;ve restarted it. (Not to mention that the Linux kernel updates every week or so nowadays, but those are definitely not the only ones that trigger an update [edit: by which I of course mean &quot;trigger a reboot&quot;].)<p>I tend to not use the graphical software updater and just ignore its notifications instead, and just update from the command line and reboot when it suits me. That does allow me to not have my workflow interrupted but it doesn&#x27;t change the fact that I still <i>do</i> get notified of updates that require some kind of action pretty often.<p>On the other hand, checking for those updates doesn&#x27;t burn minutes on end of CPU time every time the OS is booted, as it seems to do on Windows 10.')
