Too much negativity is wrong for kind of obvious reasons. Too much positivity is also wrong, because not everything is positive so it sounds fake.<p>In my experience, the best outlook is to appreciate what is actually good in life (e.g. your qualities, good things that happen), and accept that what is bad (e.g. your flaws, bad things that happen), are bad.<p>Unfortunately if you barely have anything, than your life objectively sucks and no outlook is going to make you happy. But the thing is, I&#x27;ve seen a lot of people who are depressed that don&#x27;t &quot;barely have anything&quot;, they have food and shelter and qualities and things going on in their lives which should make them happy, but they still spend their time thinking about the things they don&#x27;t have.')
