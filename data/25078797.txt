Item(by='gwright', descendants=None, kids=[25078905], score=None, time=1605240906, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25078644, text='&gt; have a Court in Pennsylvania throw out 10,000 ballots<p>* The Constitution says that the state legislatures set the election mechanism.<p>* The Secretary of the State decided to change the rules on her own without the state legislature&#x27;s approval.<p>* The Court ruled that the ballots that were accepted by the Secretary&#x27;s adjusted rules but that would not be accepted by the legislature&#x27;s approved rules can not be considered legal ballots and should not be counted.<p>The court didn&#x27;t &quot;throw out ballots&quot;. The court ruled that the Secretary of the State overstepped her authority and that ballots must be processed according the the rules established by the legislature.<p>This seems utterly straightforward to me but it is entirely possible I&#x27;m missing some important detail.<p>If you disagree with that chain of reasoning, what is your disagreement?<p>My understanding is that the ballots in question are not part of the current vote count in PA and so this ruling changes nothing with regard to the electoral votes from PA.<p>At best this was sloppy and careless behavior by the election bureaucracy, at worst it was an unjustifiable power grab.')
