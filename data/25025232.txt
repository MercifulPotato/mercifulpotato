Why?<p>You&#x27;re out-of-context quoting someone who has been dead for no less than the better part of a century, and based on the evidence that you&#x27;ve drawn my attention to she was a tireless advocate of sensible family planning. I think that deserves some defence.<p>You said PP distanced from her because of her racist views. Ok, fair enough, everyone in history was basically a racist so that seems like a fair call. But her work as a &#x27;eugenicist&#x27; seems to be commendable and most of what you have been bringing up today has ranged from commendable to reasonable in context. From what I&#x27;ve seen here it seems to me that this woman lived a life well spent. I&#x27;m not seeing anything that doesn&#x27;t look like a reasonable option in the modern era - it is still the case that educated and wealthy families generally go with fewer children and are more likely to plan out their family for example. I support free and easy access to abortions.<p>&gt; &quot;maybe she meant something else&quot;<p>I&#x27;m happy to be a bit stronger than that. She obviously meant something else. Voluntary access to family planning tools and training black ministers has to be one of the worst schemes to eradicate out the black community that I&#x27;ve ever encountered. It strains credulity, in fact.')
