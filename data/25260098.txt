Neither of those can be done anywhere with an Internet connection; they&#x27;re going to require close collaboration between software developers, data scientists, electrical&#x2F;mechanical&#x2F;biomedical engineers, and actual scientists (physicists, chemists, biologists, and material scientists).  The Bay Area is excellently situated to take advantage of this, having 2 world-class universities, a number of smaller colleges, thriving industries in all of these, and lots of capital.  Much of the rest of the country, not so much.<p>I suspect that the days of SaaS and pure web or mobile app developers are numbered.  That field is increasingly getting commoditized.')
