If I go into Massachusetts and find 10% of the people claimed to have voted don&#x27;t exist, I can confirm fraud. If someone who didn&#x27;t voted has there vote counted, that also confirms fraud.<p>Anyone can count up and add up the votes. That&#x27;s public too.<p>And anyone can confirm their own vote was counted.')
