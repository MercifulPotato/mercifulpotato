They can register with any country that refuses to adhere to the standards or simply has a corrupt system and doesn&#x27;t check anything.<p>Yes, they have relatively low carbon emissions, but NOx&#x2F;SOx as you said are extremely high. And the Earth&#x27;s ecosystem doesn&#x27;t really have individual parts, it&#x27;s all interconnected. Polluting the oceans leads to major problems on land. Air pollution is also carried everywhere else.<p>Hence, banning cruise ships in particular is a straightforward way to reduce global emissions without significant side effects.<p>I am poor. My vacations have been by bus and train, and I like them. I can see various cities and people while going to my destination, and it&#x27;s cheaper than a cruise. Since it&#x27;s on land, emissions are strict and it&#x27;s really hard to break the laws around them.<p>You&#x27;re right about the private jet flights, as well. It&#x27;s really an extra luxury for the people who will soon tell us we have to make sacrifices in order to save the planet. I guess they really need that extra hour when going to ask for public money for their failing enterprises.<p>I&#x27;m not downvoting btw, you have a valid point. I only downvote extremely dumb or offensive comments.')
