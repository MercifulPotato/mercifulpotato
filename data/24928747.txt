Mark my words in ten years, the dems will move more right, I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised to see Kasich and Romney as democrats.<p>The left will be regrouping, and the far right, well they&#x27;ll be hiding from the FBI mostly (at least the terrorist factions).<p>I mean, think about it. The dems are the epitomy of Reagan republicans. If you wanted to reboot the insanity that is Trumpism, all you&#x27;d need to do is get a significant number of fiscal republicans to become democrats, and run as democrats, and maybe embrace a &#x27;few&#x27; social programs to &#x27;appear&#x27; democrat enough.')
