Currently Russia seems to be the primary perpetrator, so they are the ones that we should be discussing sanctions for. (They also did the most recent invasion, in Crimea). All this &quot;but the US also!&quot; is exactly the kind of whataboutism that Glavset trolls routinely engage in, and it&#x27;s not constructive at all. Yes, the US plays dirty, as does China, but that&#x27;s no reason to let Russia do so too.')
