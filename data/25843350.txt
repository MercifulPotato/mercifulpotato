Nobody cares about the shares.<p>Options contracts are SUPER market inefficient, in that their pricing is tied to dollar moves stacking onto the &quot;intrinsic value&quot; part of their multivariable calculus formula no matter what percentage difference that really means, and do not take volume of the underlying asset into affect at all, even though that matters more to options traders than the purpose of the options contract itself: to accumulate shares.')
