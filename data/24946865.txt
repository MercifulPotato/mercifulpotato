In order the person needing to see the captioning to see it he has to initiate the meeting and sharing the link. The link never expires and could be saved in Notes from all members of the group. The members of the group needs to share the meeting time via other means for example email , text message.\nCompared to Zoom, Google meetups Team has superior video, audio and captioning capabilities. \nThere are desktop and iOS versions of Teams. No way to use Otter reliably with hearing aid device because it requires Chrome browser and needs physical sound from the speakers to work. Internal networking the sound is not working.\n3) Phone calls - CaptionCall. It is free service paid by the FEDeral government. You sign up and receive dedicated phone number which you enter in settings for call forwarding. When you are calling or somebody is calling you CaptionCall is intercepting the call and forwards it for machine learning+ person transcriber. This is the best combination.\n4) Messaging across devices -WhastApp. No video or audio captioning in iOS so - using only messaging. Used for announcing Teams meeting.<p>All other solutions do not do anything to accommodate-WebEx, BlueJeans, etc.<p>Microsoft is having the best accommodation service - there is dedicated web site with free 24&#x2F;7 support for people needing accommodation. One Teams account is just $5&#x2F;month and the support is responding within several hours.')
