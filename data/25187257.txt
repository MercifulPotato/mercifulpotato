They have reciprocal agreements with a bunch of airlines around the world.<p>I was flying Iberia from Tel Aviv to Madrid once and just barrrrrrrely managed to squeeze on a flight.  It was a 6am flight that I assumed would be empty but happened to get overbooked because of another canceled flight, so all those magical empty seats vanished before my eyes.<p>They managed to squeeze me on in one of the flight attendant jump seats - not the one in the cockpit, but the super uncomfortable vertical half-seats at the front of the plane.  The only other standby passenger was the husband of one of the flight attendants.<p>Right after we took off, his wife came up to both of us and said “hey it’s 6am, you guys look tired - do you want to sleep in the crew rest?”  I mean, why not?<p>So he took the bottom bunk and I took the top one - I think this was an A330 or 340 — it wasn’t nearly as fancy as the 787 here, but it was damn cozy.  Pitch black, full lay flat, and I slept the whole 5 hours like it was 5 minutes.<p>Later a few friends told me this was absurdly against every regulation and that I basically had a once-in-a-lifetime experience.  But I guess <i>shrug</i> Iberia Airlines, eh?')
