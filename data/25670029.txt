It discourages use, which is not what you want from your exercise equipment.<p>I never used their classes.  Nothing I used had a technical need for a subscription.<p>But they still want me to pay $40&#x2F;month to show me a web app with stats my bike sends it to tell me which days I&#x27;ve used it and how I&#x27;m doing on my streaks and distance and duration.  This information can all  be stored locally (and is, presumably, both before and after you send it to them but only with a subscription).<p>I really hope that decoding the Peloton hardware leads to freeing my exercise bike from it&#x27;s corporate overlords.')
