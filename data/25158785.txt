It&#x27;s a very large change, and very complicated. It&#x27;s been in progress ever since I started using zfs, and that was years ago :)<p>It&#x27;s worth noting you can expand a RAIDZ through replacing disks - if you start off with a pool of 4x2TB for instance say giving 6TB usable, you can expand it by replacing those disks one by one with 4TB disks - in which case you eventually end up with 12TB usable, once all disks are replaced.<p>Alternatively, you can add another RAIDZ to the same pool with extra disks (but you will lose more capacity this way).<p>Otherwise, recreate the pool, and restore from your backup (which you definitely have, right?). Assuming both your live and backup are zfs, this is easy with zfs send | zfs receive.')
