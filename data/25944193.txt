The price plummeted today because of Robinhood and other small brokerages restricting trading the day before lots of shares would have to be purchased to cover in the money options.<p>So, many retail users of Robinhood and other brokerages couldn&#x27;t buy, could only sell, while hedge funds and other institutions could continue to do what they want.<p>The rules should be the same for everyone, all of the time. If Jane StockPicker can&#x27;t buy a security, then nobody else should be able to. I&#x27;m honestly furious about this. I made a small amount of money on GME and cashed out a couple days ago - the shorts were in a bad spot, too bad - so seeing how other retail investors are being screwed over here makes me feel sick.<p>Oh, and Melvin Capital (one of the short sellers who has been most screwed by taking a bad position) was bailed out by Citadel, and guess who one of Robinhood&#x27;s investors is?<p>I&#x27;m not exaggerating when I say that there needs to be a congressional hearing and SEC investigation. You can say what you want about retail traders exchanging ideas on WSB, a public forum, but closing down trading for retail investors cost them a lot of money early and why were hedge funds able to short a stock so heavily?<p>Pending investigation, this is a serious problem and I think there is likely to be ongoing corruption here.')
