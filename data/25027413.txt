I bought a 1971 motorcycle that still had the bank on the title as a lienholder, and it was a royal pain for both myself and the seller. If it wasn&#x27;t an extremely rare bike, I would have backed out of the purchase.<p>A bank will repo a car if it isn&#x27;t paid, but if the loan is paid off then their name can be removed from the title. This doesn&#x27;t happen automatically in all states though, so you may need to do some legwork. However, when the time comes to sell the car having the bank&#x27;s name on the title is almost worse than a salvage title. Most car dealers will absolutely refuse to take the vehicle in on trade, for example.')
