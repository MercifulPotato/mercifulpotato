Sega had the license to the Daytona name and usage for electronic games and that’s one of the most well-known tracks and events. We had every other Cup and Indy circuit, but couldn’t get Daytona.<p>(For our in-house racing series, we had a “Florida” circuit that was the first and middle race in the schedule. For some reason, it was surprisingly close to Daytona International Speedway in design.)<p>We’d have probably sold more boxes and surely would have gotten more online subs if we’d been able to offer Daytona. (Some of the Papyrus crew went on to form iRacing and they’ve got a great product over there; still no karaoke though...)')
