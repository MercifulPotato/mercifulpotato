Everything I want that I can afford, I already own. Anything I want that I can&#x27;t afford, I shouldn&#x27;t be receiving as a gift from someone else. That leaves the only remaining case of &quot;things I don&#x27;t want&quot;. So duplicate gifts, expensive gifts, or bad gifts.<p>This puts us into the category that the article states you don&#x27;t want to be in: guessing for things the other person wants (but doesn&#x27;t know they want). this works great for me and my wife. it becomes an adventure of learning about each other. Not so much for aunts&#x2F;uncles&#x2F;etc. Cash, or nothing is fine. I feel worse about getting some knick knack that gets thrown out than just getting nothing.')
