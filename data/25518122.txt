Now look at how often your RAID card firmware gets fixed... use MDADM&quot;.<p>Modern filesystems like btrfs &amp; zfs both prefer to deal with the RAID aspects themselves as it gives them far more control. Even if you&#x27;re a hardware raid afficianado, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend formatting (eg) ZFS on top of a hardware raid pool.')
