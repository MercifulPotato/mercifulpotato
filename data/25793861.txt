Every president&#x27;s platform is going to be centered around &quot;the UBI is too damn low!&quot;  And if it gets high enough you&#x27;re going to find lots of people who you could otherwise depend on for the tax dollars that keep this scheme afloat deciding to retire and live off UBI the rest of their lives.  I mean I make six figures and have a modest, paid-off house in a relatively low COL area.  Get UBI up to say $4K per month and I&#x27;ll sure as hell think hard about dropping out of the workforce.  And don&#x27;t say UBI will never get past $1K per month...<p>Also, there will also have to be a reckoning on immigration of unskilled workers if UBI came to pass.  The whole argument around UBI is that there&#x27;s so many unskilled workers in the US who are going to find themselves automated out of a job, so we need to pay them UBI.  Meanwhile we... continue to import huge numbers of unskilled workers who are destined to do soak up UBI?  Something&#x27;s gotta give.')
