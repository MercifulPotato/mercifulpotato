Item(by='spekcular', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601864938, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24681903, text='Didier Sornette, Critical Phenomena in Natural Sciences: Chaos, Fractals, Selforganization and Disorder. Springer, 2nd edition.<p>This covers the mathematics of heavy-tailed distributions and a lot of fun applications, and also touches on some other interesting, Taleb-esque topics (fractals, renormalization group).<p>For financial stuff in this vein (heavy tails), Bouchaud has some books with various coauthors (e.g. Theory of Financial Risk and Derivative Pricing: From Statistical Physics to Risk Management). Admittedly I have only browsed them, but what little I&#x27;ve read has been good.<p>Also, on a tangent which may interest you, Charles Martin and Mike Mahoney (of UC Berkeley) have some recent work which uncovers heavy-tailed laws in neural networks.
