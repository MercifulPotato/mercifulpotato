It would change so much. Right now my living room houses my hobbies, my job, my tv, my dining room, my gym, and my couch where I can fit 1 friend awkwardly sleeping with their legs sticking out the end. A second bedroom would become the office, the gym, the guest room, the music room, and would free up my living room for, well, living.<p>I dream of that day, but I don&#x27;t expect to see it for another 4-5 years at least given the nature of the beast in this field in this city.')
