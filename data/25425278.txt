I was only given a single problem to solve in each of my 45 minute &quot;coding rounds&quot; at Google and Facebook. If you approach these interviews like a competitive coding competition you will absolutely not get the job. By that I mean arriving at a non-optimal solution as fast as possible while writing messy code and not explaining your thought process. Not to mention that senior roles involve an increasing number of interviews that focus on design rather than algorithmic questions.<p>This all seems like nonsense coming from individuals who are (understandably or not) frustrated at an interview process that doesn&#x27;t align with their strengths.')
