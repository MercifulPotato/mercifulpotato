If you&#x27;re doing a simple project, Next is the best around. Also great for marketing pages, etc. But if you have a more sophisticated app, with an API, page routes that need to toggle based on cookies, etc, then you have to integrate something like Express. I&#x27;ve done this several times with Next, and it just doesn&#x27;t pay off. I&#x27;ve also tried to use it at work, but it changes rapidly, and it&#x27;d be too much to expect engineers who aren&#x27;t keeping up with everything on the clientside to know what to do.<p>I feel like there&#x27;s a need for something between roll-your-own and what vercel is offering.')
