E.g. I need to remote to office desktop and instead of having to open my phone to read the 2FA pin, I just setup stoken on my desktop and wrote a simple script that invokes stoken and copies the pin to the clipboard. Mapped the script to a shortcut and now I can just press the shortcut from the login page and do Ctrl+V for pasting the pin. Small things like these become very easy once you know a bit of scripting and the time&#x2F;effort saved over time adds up considerably.')
