Item(by='lovelyviking', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610641544, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25746866, text='&gt; I know this probably isn&#x27;t what you&#x27;re looking for ...<p>You know , actually after similar mileage with Macs I consider exactly the same solution. I started with Mac as escape from windows. It was fine for some time when Jobs was around and some time after that, but since 2015 I cannot choose Mac Book Pro that would just fit for work with all that idiocy with touch bars, malfunctioning keyboards and idiotic dongles, instead of working horse that has everything you need and makes things simpler.<p>&gt;I&#x27;m sure Apple will continue to sell tons of Macs and that&#x27;s fine...<p>And now as MBP 2015 had gracefully died after I provided the best care for it you can possibly imagine, I wish to move away from Macs even more.  I do not wish to pay premium money for shitty equipment.<p>This 2015 model have just fallen apart, starting with screws that by some unknown to me reason where unscrewing themselves and you could not tight them back because some idiot made them non standard to make sure you really cannot do it, not even with the knife. Then I discovered that screen has traces of buttons after closing the lid. Then I discovered those small traces are unremovable.  Then battery even with a proper care died anyway after third of cycles it suppose to have. Then screen have stopped working  and then this shit have stopped booting completely ( even with external display). \nI should also mention power cord ( with cheap plastic) that became yellow and was not always connecting , while it was carefully kept from banding too much. HDMI that in critical  situation did not work, with the best cable you can get. OS that was constantly confusing where the main screen is, forgetting the ‘mirror’ option at will and I can go on and on ....<p>Overall the experience is horrible. I have other models from previous years and nothing like that had happened.<p>And I am told MBP2015 is considered to be a best model, as after mid 2015 models are even worse, not mentioning connectivity that renders them useless for mobility I need.<p>So looking at the way Mac is made these days I am not at all convinced they would continue to sell ‘tons of Macs’\nin the following years.<p>Only inertia saves in such situation but for how long? In my case I cannot move from the platform because I’ve decided to write a proper File Manager for Mac. It is almost complete and I simply cannot live  without it. I also  cannot leave it unfinished as this would be a huge waste of effort. So I’ll have to finish it,  start selling it, and then port to other platforms.<p>&gt;Obviously that&#x27;s a personal choice, but for me losing that level of control of my desktop operating system - and seeing this as the start of a trend that will only get worse - is not acceptable.<p>For me too. Anyway, I’ve been exploring gnu&#x2F;linux for some time now and it appears as the next step. Since Mac is dead I’ll have to stick with linux for a while. I have no other options available.')
