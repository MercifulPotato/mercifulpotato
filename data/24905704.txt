Because it&#x27;s <i>contagious</i> and when cut loose cases literally widespread death, massive economic peril and joblessness ?<p>Why is that so hard to understand?<p>Do people not feel any responsibility for others they infect with potentially deadly pathogens that spread to large numbers of people?<p>We&#x27;re not that hugely concerned about &#x27;other people taking small risks&#x27; - the issue is the externalization.<p>Frat Houses can drink &#x27;24 beers&#x27; and visit the hospital, okay, &#x27;it&#x27;s their body&#x27; ... but the issue with COVID is mostly systematic.<p>We don&#x27;t care that you as an individual want to bring &#x27;Deadly Asian Wasps&#x27; into North America, it&#x27;s not a big deal, but by introducing them, you&#x27;ll cause calamity as they spread through the region causing mayhem. Or like setting a &#x27;small fire&#x27; in a dry forest.<p>I&#x27;m struggling to understand how people think a their contagion is a &#x27;personal choice&#x27;.<p>People who think about &#x27;personal choice and living with the consequences&#x27; may want to contemplate the liability in such a situation: you hit someone&#x27;s car - you owe them the repairs. Imagine if you had to pay for someone&#x27;s healthcare if you were to &#x27;infect them&#x27;. Instead of passing &#x27;mask laws&#x27; maybe liability laws could be passed -&gt; you infect someone, they sue you for $50-500K. We&#x27;d literally have to buy insurance for that, and one of the criteria for insurance would be &#x27;mask wearing&#x27; - if you &#x27;wear a mask&#x27; your &#x27;infection liability insurance&#x27; premiums would be 1&#x2F;2. It&#x27;s obviously not going to work, point being it illustrates the systematic issue here, it&#x27;s not &#x27;personal risk taking&#x27;.')
