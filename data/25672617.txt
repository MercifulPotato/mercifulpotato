If it&#x27;s just discomfort using it for long periods of time, there&#x27;s a 95% chance, you need to turn on the lights in your room or turn down your monitor brightness.<p>&gt; Can you please recommend a VA panel that is good for text sharpness, too?<p>Some subpixel arrangements might require you to change the font smoothing (Windows ClearType), but any monitor with high pixel density will do, really. I&#x27;m not an expert on specific models so I won&#x27;t recommend one.')
