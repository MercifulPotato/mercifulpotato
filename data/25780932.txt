From another perspective, one could say that people have more time available than before, be it due to less hours of work or less transit time (since some people work at home). And given that people are only fans after investing a significant chunk of time, one can conclude that this sudden increase in free time allowed for people to become invested in a fanbase.<p>Once everything goes back to normal, so to speak, or at the very least, once there is less time for people to enjoy themselves, then this shift in the economy would reverse back to an attention economy.')
