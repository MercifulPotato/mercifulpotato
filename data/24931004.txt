If folks want to pay someone (Grubhub) to go pick up food for them, why should the restaurants be allowed to say no?<p>&gt; Food may not travel well.<p>Fair point, but if the customer still wants it, that&#x27;s on them.<p>&gt; But that may lead to unfairly low ratings for the restaurant.<p>If (say) 30% of the restaurant&#x27;s patrons choose to get the food via food delivery, why shouldn&#x27;t those folks&#x27; ratings of the food be factored into the restaurant&#x27;s rating?<p>&gt; If people want food and the restaurants doesn&#x27;t want to support delivery apps, then folks should respect that and visit the restaurant in person.<p>Many people aren&#x27;t able to visit in person, either due to time constraints, mobility constraints, COVID precautions, or other reasons.<p>&gt; Restaurants may not be able to handle the additional load placed on them by these services.<p>I empathize with this one and don&#x27;t really have a rebuttal.<p>&gt; Delivery services sometimes make their own websites and phone numbers more prominent than the restaurant&#x27;s own, deceiving people into using them instead of going straight to the restaurant&#x27;s site&#x2F;number.<p>I agree, this is a horrible tactic and aggregators like Google and Yelp should work to prevent this.<p>------<p>These are just the opinions of me, a privileged engineer who has little knowledge of the restaurant industry, so I definitely welcome any criticism to my points and am certainly open to changing my view!')
