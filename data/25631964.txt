I considered trying to answer myself, but (a) I was too lazy and (b) it wouldn&#x27;t have been as good as your answer anyway. To make amends, here are two additional points about the relationship between the two.<p>(1) One of the statements in the CRUSH paper introduction is flat-out false. Specifically, it says that &quot;RUSH [a predecessor] remains the only existing set of algorithms in the literature that utilizes a mapping function in place of explicit metadata&quot; etc. By 2006, other approaches - including Kademlia, but more commonly circular consistent hashing - were extremely well known. Just as Ceph itself grew from this paper, so did the tendency to make exaggerated claims on its behalf (e.g. &quot;it&#x27;s a filesystem&quot; years before that was actually true).<p>(2) One of the key problems with any &quot;deterministic placement&quot; approach like CRUSH, which relies on clients later duplicating the process by which data had been placed, is what to do when the map changes. Section 3.3 addresses this in terms of how much data has to move, but that process is hardly instantaneous. What to do in the interim? And how does the new map get propagated? These issues are not addressed, which is fine given its mathematical focus, but anyone who hopes to build an actual system based on an algorithm like this needs to think through the answers, and those answers have a large effect on how well the system really works.')
