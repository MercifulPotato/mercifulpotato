Item(by='uhryks', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601700829, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24661773, text='It&#x27;s very easy in japan to find a &quot;baito&quot; job, that is low skill, part time and paid at the hour and with no benefits. People like the &quot;freeters&quot; cumulate several of these jobs to earn a decent monthly wage. The problem is of course that there is no security of employment, very little rights and as I said no benefits like pension. Housing is still doable as the market is not too high tension, but it&#x27;s pretty much impossible for them to get a loan for anything. Raising children and sending them to higher education is pretty much not feasible.\nI guess for US people it&#x27;s pretty similar to the fast-food workers earning less than livable wage.')
