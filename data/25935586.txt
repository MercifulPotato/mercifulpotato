Plenty of stocks never pay dividends. A lot of companies pay more to charity than to dividends to investors.<p>Or, you get a vote on company policy at the stockholder&#x27;s meeting... But if the founders own more than half the stock, that doesn&#x27;t actually matter. And that&#x27;s assuming the founders haven&#x27;t just sold stock with no voting privileges.<p>If the company files for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, stock owners are entitled to company assets... And almost never see any, because they&#x27;re last in line behind every other creditor.<p>So it&#x27;s unclear what, precisely, the practical weight of &quot;partial ownership in a real business&quot; has in general. In specific, sure; stock could be access to dividends or a meaningful voice in company policy. For a lot of stock, the only real value is &quot;How much will someone else pay me for this piece of the action?&quot;')
