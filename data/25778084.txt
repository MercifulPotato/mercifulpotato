Cow herds you might encounter in a field are also artificial constructs, removing the aggressive males that might have otherwise defended their family. Walking into a field of wild bison&#x2F;Nilgai&#x2F;Water Buffalo and aggressive behavior will have you hanging from a pair of horns before very long. Even feral dogs are fairly friendly and tend to ignore non-threatening humans in their territory - but you wouldn&#x27;t want to do the same with wolves.')
