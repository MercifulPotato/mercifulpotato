You wouldn&#x27;t be surprised to hear that the best factory workers tend to produce the most widgets per hour, or that the best butchers process the most meat per hour. Productive output is definitely highly correlated with job skill, almost tautologically so. Yes, a code commit isn&#x27;t exactly the same thing as a widget, but it&#x27;s similar enough in broad strokes to still be a useful measurement.')
