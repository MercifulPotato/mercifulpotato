And I really think our DNB and Dubstep scene kept many independent shops and mastering&#x2F;pressing afloat and it was a big part of the resurgence in vinyl in the 2000s we saw. Even now I get a chuckle of seeing the limited color pressing offers&#x2F;pre-buys on Bandcamp as almost no one who DJs is on vinyl anymore, unless it&#x27;s their gimmick, so when it sells out you know its just fans buying them up. So why do we need these people now that distribution and fees can be reduced to what they are now on bandcamp and PR&#x2F;booking tours is no longer the only thing that made those relationships remotely tolerable?<p>If you haven&#x27;t already done so, check out Grimes interview with Andrew Yang. It was kind of interesting hearing her view on things as Canada promotes its local talent and the State gives them grants, which is incredibly odd but kind of novel way of doing things if it generates local demand for events and record sales which they benefit from in tax revenue.')
