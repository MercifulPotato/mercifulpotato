Verdana is a weird font in a lot of ways -- it was designed for low-DPI screens in the 1990&#x27;s, mainly as an interface font for Windows. It was never intended for print at all, and so doesn&#x27;t follow some standard typographical conventions (such as bolded numerals being the same width).<p>Which is why when IKEA chose it as their main branding font (in their print catalog, no less!) to replace Futura, there was such an outrage among graphic designers, as it was such a terrible choice. (IKEA no longer uses Verdana anymore though.)')
