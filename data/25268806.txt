You can download an ISO from Microsoft, but there is literally no way I could find to successfully write that ISO to a USB stick from an OS other than Windows.<p>If you Google &quot;write windows 10 iso to usb linux&quot; and click on a result like <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;itsfoss.com&#x2F;bootable-windows-usb-linux&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;itsfoss.com&#x2F;bootable-windows-usb-linux&#x2F;</a>, the instructions will create a USB stick that will successfully boot to the installer, but will fail shortly thereafter with &quot;A media driver your computer needs is missing&quot;.<p>If you Google this error and try to find a solution, it feels like you just asked a witch doctor for medical advice.  You&#x27;ll find advice to try plugging the USB drive into a different USB slot, try using a USB 2.0 drive instead of 3.0, etc.  This Stack Overflow answer swears that the cause of this error is that Microsoft&#x27;s servers corrupt the download of the ISO file in transit by aborting the transfer early: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;superuser.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;964362" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;superuser.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;964362</a> (I verified the SHA of my file and it was fine).<p>Many answers suggest that using the Windows Media Creation Tool from Windows is the most reliable way to do it.  I managed to resurrect my old Windows partition and boot into it, and indeed the Windows Media Creation Tool burned a USB stick that successfully booted the installer.  But when I tried to select the partition I wanted to install onto, I got the error &quot;Windows cannot be installed to this disk. The selected disk is of the gpt partition style.&quot;<p>If you Google this error, it sounds like when you create the bootable USB, you create it as either a BIOS-booting or a UEFI-booting variety of boot disk, and once created, it can <i>only</i> install onto a MBR or GPT partition, respectively.  The Windows Media Creation Tool did not ask me which kind I wanted, it (apparently) just creates a BIOS-booting USB by default.<p>The only way I was ultimately able to install onto my GPT partition was to use Rufus, which explicitly lets you choose between UEFI and BIOS when you create the USB.  It is amusing that Rufus runs on Windows only (so you need to have Windows to install Windows). Luckily I was able to use the VirtualBox images provided by Microsoft for Microsoft Edge testing to run Rufus and create the USB.<p>Once Windows is installed it&#x27;s pretty reliable. But it is a <i>nightmare</i> to install.')
