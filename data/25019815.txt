I&#x27;m sorry for the poor leave conditions at your institution.  It would be great if you got more (paid) time off and were able to participate in work in a voluntary fashion rather than out of necessity.<p>I was lucky that when my first was born my institution began a policy of a semester of paid leave for the mother or partner.  As others have pointed out though, it seems to have a drawback that partners are more likely to use it for extra research time, which tends to raise tenure standards for everyone, including mothers.<p>I think the problem is larger than a policy can address.  We need a culture change.<p>And enjoy the baby wearing!  Mine are too big now and I miss it dearly.')
