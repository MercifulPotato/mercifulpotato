The federal government doesn&#x27;t have the resources to enforce all the laws they have on the books and rely on states to enact similar laws to enforce most of them. I wonder if they will ever increase enforcement or if this state-level defiance&#x2F;contradictions will continue to grow and spread to other states. I think there has been some talk of similar movements for gun rights.')
