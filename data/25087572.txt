A lot of those things often come down to difference in opinion. I&#x27;ve seen some developers be really adamant about how a bug was actually a feature.<p>&gt; The openness of issue trackers even helps elevate that.<p>I agree partly. For me it helped see things different and make a positive growth. But I can image some staying afraid to enter or be deterred really quick never coming back.<p>&gt;&gt; This follows the &quot;praise in public, punish in private&quot; maxim.<p>So like the previous poster said. I am wondering if Github et al. should not contain a private channel.<p>I have a email on my Github page. And besides spammers I sometimes get questions regarding my projects. I don&#x27;t know if it is due to people not understanding Github that well[0] or wanting to contact privately[1]. But for some reason they didn&#x27;t open a public issue[2].<p>[0] I&#x27;ve met a lot of technical people that just are afraid of Github because it is complex. Electrical engineers, mechanics, embedded engineers. People I figure would understand software development concepts.<p>[1] Asking a stupid question publicly could also count toward making a public mistake depending on how secure someone feels about themselves.<p>[2] There is of course also the discussion if issues should be your projects helpdesk next to being an bug tracker. And raising an &#x27;issue&#x27; for something that might just be a question might feel strange for some.')
