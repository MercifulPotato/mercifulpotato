You&#x27;d be hard pressed to find any deaths here that weren&#x27;t obvious, often video-documented cases of self-defense.  Even then, the state has zealously prosecuted them, in Jake Gardner&#x27;s case overriding the local prosecutor&#x27;s determination that no crime had been committed and leading Gardner to suicide.  Most ridiculous of them all, Kyle Rittenhouse is facing murder charges when every single one of his so-called victims is on video assaulting him.')
