Item(by='zachf', descendants=None, kids=[25586609], score=None, time=1609349398, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25582074, text='Penrose’s model of the brain needs to be more powerful than quantum computation, so that it can actually solve NP problems in P time and similarly amazing feats.<p>If you’re interested in CS and quantum physics and whether there could be any relationship to the way the brain works, do check out Scott Aaronson’s book “Quantum Computing Since Democratus”. It’s a great read, it’ll get you up to speed on quantum mechanics and complexity theory, the book is conversational, and it’s written by an expert in the field of QC. It also discusses Penrose’s arguments about consciousness and other fun digressions into philosophy. Great and fun book!')
