But to get decent scaling, you really need to make instances in at least 2, and preferably 3 dimensions in one go.<p>We&#x27;ve already done it with things like the printing press that can churn out books very cheaply - but it turns out that we&#x27;ve now reached the limit of the numbers of books people want.<p>Humans also reproduce exponentially - with a sufficiently high birth rate, numbers of people can rapidly grow.  One needs enough space to support that growth, and we are sadly lacking in that...    Perhaps Mars will allow us to practice our fast-scaling of civilization?')
