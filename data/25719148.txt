It&#x27;s not a reasonable strategy to use unrestricted C++, just like it&#x27;s not a reasonable strategy to use unrestricted Rust.  You actually have to design an ABI, not just rely on the compiler to do it for you.<p>I thought there was a GNOME doc too, but I couldn&#x27;t find it.  The point remains: there are lots of things in C++ that people who care about stability don&#x27;t use at their ABI boundaries.')
