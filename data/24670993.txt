Was bad as you would get people putting oversized rubbish down it so would get stuck in the shaft.  Would also collect `matter` so would have a smell in the summer that permeated up the tube and whilst good in principle, in practice - not suited or accommodating towards a recycle culture.<p>Making general waste easier to dispose of IMHO only distracts&#x2F;dissuaded people from recycling based upon my observations.  More so in building types I described, to recycle you have to walk down to the ground floor to access a locked bin area to place your recycling into separate bins.  Or as many did - just dump it down the one shoot for all the rubbish.')
