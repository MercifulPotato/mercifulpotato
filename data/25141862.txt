The issue they had when I was there was depending on where you went, you may or may not have access to the record, because the VA didn&#x27;t use a central system, it used many systems across the country, each with their own records(basically their own mainframe). We once added a hospital to our system, and had to have dual workstations because the systems couldn&#x27;t be easily merged, and they had to look up patients in both systems.<p>Also, with Veterans Choice, I don&#x27;t know how much there was an effort to bring this data back. Same thing with the DoD, for a while there was an agreement to send medical records for active duty to the VA, but then that got pulled for a time.<p>I believe there was a huge undertaking to consolidate these to fewer systems in the last few years, but Vista[0] (the VA&#x27;s EMR) is pretty scary. I wouldn&#x27;t wish it on anyone.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;VistA" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;VistA</a>')
