I&#x27;m struggling to think of a non-technical analogy, but basically what&#x27;s going on here is that most data-copying tools, when used in the most common ways, are looking at CD-ROMs like they would look at the logical disk presented by a RAID5 array.<p>That works fine most of the time. But imagine if the computing industry had come up with a &quot;RAID5 Mode 2&quot; that was actually RAID0, where the parity disk was just used to store more user data instead of parity data, but most of the copying tools didn&#x27;t know the difference between &quot;RAID5&quot; and &quot;RAID5 mode 2&quot;, and so they just copied 2&#x2F;3 of the data, on the assumption that the parity data would be recreated on the receiving end. 1&#x2F;3 of the user data just went down the drain. That&#x27;s basically what&#x27;s happening when you try to store anything other than a 100% vanilla data CD-ROM as an ISO file instead of bin&#x2F;cue.')
