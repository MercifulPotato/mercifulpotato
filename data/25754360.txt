The Civil Rights Movement in the 60s was considered hateful and violent at one point, without free speech they would have been driven into the sea. Gay and Trans rights were once considered not valid speech as well. Without Unregulated and uncontrolled speech. All of these things could have been labeled as hateful speech, hateful to white people or hateful to the traditional family unit. Any talk about limiting speech by the government or social media only dictates that we have enough freedoms and liberties and anything new that comes up is fair game to be labeled as &quot;hate speech&quot;')
