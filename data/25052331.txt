(That plane has a compensation system, similar to the 737-MAX.) Is &quot;intrinsically unstable&quot; different from &quot;relaxed stability&quot; in some subtle way?<p>And while military planes are quite different from commercial planes, many (most at this point?) military jets are aerodynamically unstable.')
