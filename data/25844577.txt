I was brought up on it and it just seems right. I think a lot of the old films I watch are 4:3 anyway, unless they&#x27;re 2.39:1, in which case 16:9 is hardly ideal either.<p>What I find really hilarious is how they sell laptops with a 16:9 screen with an OS that confiscates a wide strip at the bottom of the screen, a browser that confiscates a wide strip at the top of the screen, and then the web sites add their own massive strip of menus and crap at the top of the screen, and some cookie notice that you can&#x27;t possibly agree to removes another generous strip from the bottom, so that the remaining aspect ratio for the actual content is about 9:1 and it&#x27;s like peering through somebody&#x27;s letterbox.<p>&quot;Hullo, Mrs Jones, are you all right in there?&quot;')
