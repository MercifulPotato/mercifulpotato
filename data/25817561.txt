I’ve paid the $100 a year fee for over a decade, even though I don’t have anything in the App Store right now. For me, it’s worth it for access to the betas and to be able to self-sign and notarize stuff on GitHub.<p>So I already pay the $100 a year. But there is a browser extension I help maintain that has a very limited audience (it is essentially an internal tool, though it is in the Chrome and Edge stores). I would like to bring it to macOS&#x2F;Safari and started the process of doing it. But there are so many hoops, it will vastly change the build pipeline (I’ll literally have to package every single update differently than the other platforms), and the process is so convoluted that honestly, I’ve given up for now. Bear in mind, I’d be the primary user of said extension and even for me, I can’t make the internal argument to waste time doing it over just using Chrome or Edge when I need that feature.<p>Having said all that, I should go ahead and port it to Firefox. That at least is a lot more straightforward.')
