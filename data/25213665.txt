That should be front and centre - for a while I wasn&#x27;t sure whether it was a separate videoconferencing app because the screenshots are just the app, rather than it being used in Zoom or whatever. The only reference is &quot;Funner Zooming&quot;, but for some reason that wasn&#x27;t explicit enough for me without an example Zoom screenshot.')
