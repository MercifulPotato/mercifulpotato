I&#x27;ve been using such for at least a decade, and would never return to a tiny porthole facing work of interest (such as a laptop, which is comically unsuited to serious, prolonged use).<p>I <i>do</i> use prescription glasses ground for that working distance and strongly recommend that (prescription lenses).<p>I recently (four weeks ago) had to replace the monitor&#x2F;TV and spent more than a short while choosing comfortable typeface, font size, and RGB&#x2F;BGR pixel ordering.<p>As some others have mentioned, if one&#x27;s eyes are strained, corrections are warranted. I do not deliberately practice frequent distance gazing, but I suspect I do so unconsciously.')
