No they don&#x27;t, at least not in Germany. Here, &quot;socialism&quot; is primarily associated with the Soviet Union and the GDR (East Germany).<p>&quot;healthcare, paid vacations&quot;, in contrast, is not associated with any particular political system, because it&#x27;s understood to be the baseline, or taken for granted. At best, it&#x27;s associated with the &quot;Sozialstaat&quot;. Note that the term &quot;sozial&quot; in German does not mean &quot;socialism&quot;, but rather &quot;caring for others&quot;; it&#x27;s an antonym to &quot;anti-social&quot;, not to &quot;capitalistic&quot;.')
