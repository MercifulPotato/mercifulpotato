Indeed, most people who complain about this are just grifters. The reason you don&#x27;t hear about normal people complaining about this is because they are nobodies, they have no other platform to speak out when they get banned.<p>The rules are almost always really vague and it&#x27;s not clear what you can or cannot do. For example facebook can ban you if what you&#x27;ve said <i>might be interpreted by someone</i> as offensive. From what I&#x27;ve remember, they specifically say that <i>what you&#x27;ve actually meant does not matter</i>. If someone just <i>might</i> think it&#x27;s offensive, you get a 30 day ban. At least they used to have this rule at the time I left facebook, and I left it precisely for that reason.')
