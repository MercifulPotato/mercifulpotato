If this were true, wouldn&#x27;t this mean that China won this time since Biden is the President (vs Russia won in 2016 since Trump was the President)?<p>I think there are a lot more internal actors, such as special interest groups, PACs, activist groups, etc..., that may dwarf the external influence. There is so much money involved in politics and elections. I wonder how can we curtail the flow of money to make things more civil in politics?')
