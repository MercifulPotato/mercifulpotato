But I came to that realization in a matter of seconds based on first principles--principles learned in middle and high school.<p>But as noted elsewhere in the thread, you mostly aren&#x27;t exhaling your food. Respiration is a reaction that takes in O2 and produces CO2. The only thing you can get rid of by breathing is carbon. But you need to excrete a mixture of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen. (Plus trace elements.)')
