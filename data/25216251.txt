Are humans considered animals? Is the issue that some things are treated as commodities at all, or just that living things are? Are we okay with treating <i>people</i> as commodities, but just not &quot;animals&quot;? As in, it&#x27;s okay to buy human-animal created products (like a phone or a computer), but not to buy wool socks because that is animal cruelty?<p>I&#x27;m not suggesting that people aren&#x27;t treated as commodities, I&#x27;m suggesting the opposite. Your citations (unfortunately) add to my point.')
