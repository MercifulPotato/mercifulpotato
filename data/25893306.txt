Artifacts from the sampling and stitching leave subtle bands in the output that I&#x27;m fairly confident are not in the original.  This is likely a biproduct of using some non-uniform scope-attached illuminator and not having sufficient overlap in their sampling.<p>Nonetheless, when zoomed in, the detail is impressive.')
