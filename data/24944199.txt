COVID is not a big threat to you and your family (based on my assumptions about you which could very well be wrong). Neither is it a big threat to me, 30 year old, healthy, single male living in Germany.<p>However, some of your assertions are not true. The COVID waves were vastly different in different countries across Europe, and despite Germany having elevated cases again and a second &quot;Lockdown&quot; the situation is nowhere near what it was in May. No constant Sirens from Ambulances (where I live), no overcrowded ICUs (some exceptions). Similarly, the lockdown proposed now is more lenient than a couple of months ago.<p>There is a definite talking point to be made about which rules are more effective than others and I personally would be more lenient than what my government proposes, but all in all we fared fairly well in comparison with our neighboring countries.<p>One point you made about a generation only caring about itself I can falsify immediately: The only reason why I am missing a basketball game with friends tonight is because I had an encounter with a positive covid case (my cousin). While I&#x27;m &gt;99% sure I&#x27;m COVID free, I opted to argue on the internet tonight as some of my basketball peers are in a risk group (&gt;60).<p>You&#x27;re not the villain. I don&#x27;t know you.')
