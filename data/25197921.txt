Many of the comments here describe tension headaches, cluster headaches, and any other kind of headache lacking a formal diagnosis as a &#x27;migraine&#x27;. Many also self-medicate their self-diagnosis.<p>Even the study itself is vague on the definition of &#x27;migraine&#x27; other than stating the study was based on rumours of self-medication by self-diagnosed migraine sufferers. The article itself is paywalled, but I suspect subjects were recruited from a base of volunteers answering &#x27;do you suffer from migraines&#x27; on a questionnaire.<p>There is, in fact, a medical definition of what a migraine is. It excludes tension headaches, cluster headaches, anxiety-induced headaches, earaches, back and neck injuries (chronic or acute), and even post-concussion headaches.')
