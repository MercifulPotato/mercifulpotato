Indeed the whole notion of &#x27;race&#x27; itself is largely artificial, historically- and locally-contingent, and thus so is racism.  If the claim was that as humans, we&#x27;re all naturally driven to be more broadly biased and perhaps intolerant towards <i>some</i> others, that would be far more defensible.')
