I&#x27;ve never seen eg.

I guess this illustrates an issue with the term &quot;conspiracy theory&quot;.<p>Edit2: Like other posters, I&#x27;d like to know what predictions you&#x27;re talking about. The big, scary one I recall was the Imperial study that predicted 500k total deaths in the UK in a completely unmitigated scenario, or much lower numbers with various mitigations. As it is we&#x27;ve had 60k deaths so far, with very severe mitigation measures. Which doesn&#x27;t look like a wildly wrong prediction to me.')
