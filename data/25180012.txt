Well... I guess you got exactly what you were looking for, between interviewing Brian Kernighan and being featured on Hacker News...<p>That&#x27;s probably a good formula to go by: get interviews with &quot;big names&quot; who have done incredible things in the field, make the content as good as you can, and submit to HN.<p>Personally I would <i>love</i> to hear an interview with Fabrice Bellard, if you can get him. That man is a true &quot;superstar&quot; of programming. Interview Fabrice and you have my subscribe, 100%.')
