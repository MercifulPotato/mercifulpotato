People who bought Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies have no misconceptions about what they bought. It&#x27;s a scarcity-driven store of value just like gold or silver.<p>Crypto feeds on opportunity asymmetries and financial asymmetries in society. There are people in our society who can earn millions of dollars without lifting a finger, while others have to struggle the extreme just to make ends meet. Is a dollar worth the same to both of these people? No.<p>A dollar is worth much more to someone who has to struggle to earn it. If you get a passive fiat income for free, then your dollar is worth hardly anything because it didn&#x27;t cost you anything to get it... If there was once a struggle, then it is likely far behind you.<p>If a human gets a lot of anything for free and they can&#x27;t figure out a good use for it, then it&#x27;s basically trash to them. They may as well put it into crypto, gold, silver or other scarce assets which are known to soak up other people&#x27;s surplus fiat currency.<p>The fact that crypto is a store of surplus currency is what makes it much more valuable and resilient than stocks.')
