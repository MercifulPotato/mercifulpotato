I know my last washing machine lasted X years, but how that will compare to the new one from the same manufacturer, I don&#x27;t know. The manufacturer also won&#x27;t (really) tell me, just the usual fluff about quality.<p>So as a consumer, I am unable to decide objectively, just using rumours if there isn&#x27;t a hard guarantee or a trustworthy evaluation of the quality of all products I could pick. In that situation, I will price in the uncertainty, I will evaluate the rumours and the tendency to produce crappier stuff over time. And when in doubt, buy 4 cheap short-lived washing machines instead of 1 for 4 times the price.')
