Item(by='Denvercoder9', descendants=None, kids=[24827280], score=None, time=1603120664, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24826881, text='It&#x27;s unlikely to happen. Using the numbers from Wikipedia for Starship, for a 5 ton payload the first stage has a delta-v of 3.8km&#x2F;s and the second stage of 8.8km&#x2F;s. That gives only 12.6km&#x2F;s in total, while Voyager had around 20km&#x2F;s after its departure from Earth. Even if the Starship is fully refueled in orbit to give it another boost (and we don&#x27;t want to recover it), we get only 21.4km&#x2F;s. However, the Voyagers got a gravity assist from all the outer planets, where they gained even more speed. That&#x27;s only possible if they are all aligned, which happens only once every 175 years. That&#x27;s also the reason why New Horizons, the Pluto probe launched 30 years later, will never overtake the Voyagers: it&#x27;s travelling slower because it didn&#x27;t get to do the gravity assists (even though it was launched at a higher speed from Earth).<p>Also it&#x27;s important to note that Starship isn&#x27;t really optimized for such missions due to its high dry mass. It&#x27;s made to bring a lot of mass to orbit cheaply, not really to accelerate it very fast.')
