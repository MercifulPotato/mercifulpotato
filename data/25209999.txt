I&#x27;m not sure why, but I think the problem is that files on BitTorrent cannot be directly addressed by hashes, it had to go through an intermediate step called a &quot;torrent&quot;, which does not uniquely identify individual files directly. You can always select the one file you need from a huge torrent, but it&#x27;s not as convenient as directly addressing files by their hashes.')
