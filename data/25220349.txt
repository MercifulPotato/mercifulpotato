We&#x27;ve never seen such great urbanization. In almost a generation we&#x27;ve moved from rural to urban.\nWe moved from collecting firewood, by hand, and growing our own food. To being completely dependent on electricity, and the electrical grid. \nI&#x27;ve been luckily enough to meet many elderly people.  People who grow up on farms, and moved to cities. Now in their 90s.  The 20th century was such a great leap into the future.<p>I&#x27;ve heard countless times, of a person growing up on a small farm with 8 siblings. Seeing electricity come to their village, the first phones. Them seeing planes for the first time.  Being able to afford to make an international phone call. I live in Canada.')
