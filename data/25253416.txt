My visual perception of things was bombarded by platonic shapes being layered onto everything, coalescing into vague but animated silhouettes of faces and bodies. Rotating pink triangles, bouncing blue squares, pulsing green circles can make of the majority of most outlines surprisingly - you get the idea, linear transformations of basic shapes with random colors can approximate a good deal of objects at a distance. The &quot;engine&quot; here felt like a bunch of symmetric rotations (abstract algebra) coupled with linear transformations (linear algebra) through a stochastic process of selecting colors (stochastic clustering?). Brain&#x27;s firing all on cylinders so I&#x27;m surprised to see not only one intensive heuristic at play, but that they&#x27;re all subtly feeding into each other. If video game graphics can make up surprisingly realistic depictions using only triangle meshes, this is basically a strictly 2D representation that takes advantage of the fact that we have two cameras, and that circles can be approximated from points without having to compute anti-aliasing.<p>Not enough to be there, but enough to be perceived. Not very fun. Best way to describe it, I suspect my visual cortex processes information by layering geometric objects and softening them until it&#x27;s able to perceive a kind of eigenrepresentation of the object, and overactive stimulation just amps up the process until maybe they&#x27;re not so soft.<p>I ended up riding it out because it was more annoying than scary and my doctor prescribed me something different.<p>To draw attention to the content of the article:<p>Constructor theory is interesting. I&#x27;ve often wondered, okay sure there are these mathematical foundations of understanding the language of the universe. What at all allows them to interact with each other? Are they even separate at all? Example: You can jump around in calculus to algebra to trigonometry and so on with a few identities and theorems, but to what extent is all of mathematics connected to each other, paradoxes aside. I suspect organisms and existences are living proofs, dynamic formal systems only capable of understanding what our foundations are capable of computing. Not only is life and reality necessary from a mathematical perspective, it went out of its way to prove it.')
