I already see this system as having no real benefit. Trash is $250&#x2F;year and sewer is $1250&#x2F;year, so this new sewer-like proposal will likely be more expensive than it is now.<p>This is just the systems thinking approach. Who cares about transporting trash if you still have all the other problems, like dumping it in landfills. It&#x27;s better to think about the entire system and make changes that benefit us on multiple levels. If you aren&#x27;t willing to talk about the entire problem space, then that tells me something about the quality of the proposal...')
