However, the lawnmower or the Tercel are machines that have inherent limitations.<p>RH&#x27;s decision here isn&#x27;t an inherent limitation of their platform. It&#x27;s an active decision they made. One they did not have to.<p>Also, what RH has done isn&#x27;t harming just their own customers, but the entire market. People using Questrade or E-trade are finding that they have fewer buyers for their shares. If RH is going to act like a Tercel on the racetrack, they have no business entering the race in the first place. They&#x27;re a danger to the other participants.<p>(BTW, analogies are fun.
