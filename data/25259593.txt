You could differentiate Chicago&#x27;s genuine homeless from the career panhandlers downtown by the bleach-stained clothes.<p>Not sure if they still use this practice, but it wouldn&#x27;t surprise me.<p>It&#x27;s easy to criticize SF for its negligence, but the homeless challenges are real and the affordable solutions tend to be severely lacking empathy.  And SF lacks a rude force of nature doing most of the work every winter.  Damp and chilly, sure, but still relatively comfortable.  Chicago has it easy in this department, and its occupants aren&#x27;t exactly the most empathetic towards the homeless either.')
