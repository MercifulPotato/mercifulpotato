So this is not exactly CPU pinning, it is a new &quot;trusted&quot; thread group scheduling implemented through cgroups where threads can move around CPU-cores as long as they end up in &quot;trusted&quot; groups of threads&#x2F;processes. So, if two non trusted threads are to be scheduled, they won&#x27;t be in the same CPU-core&#x2F;CPU&#x2F;resource&#x2F;etc.<p>* Edited for clarification')
