As much as I would love to move to Linux full time, I also don&#x27;t want to think or deal with OS issues when I&#x27;m trying to write my code. OSX is far more polished than any other unix-based system out there, and there&#x27;s a ton of support for any issues you might have.<p>I also love homebrew, it strikes a good balance between something like apt and windows-style installers. Toss all that together with the ecosystem that apple offers with it&#x27;s other products (being able to send texts from my laptop via iMessage was a revelation) and you have one hell of a value proposition. There&#x27;s a lot of valid criticism against apple but I can pretty much guarantee that 99% of the actual devs who rail against them use a MBP for work.<p>People have to understand that these are not your bargain-bin windows laptops, these are premium products. You wouldn&#x27;t compare a Ferrari to a Toyota Camry, nor would you treat them the same or expect the same level of &quot;performance&quot; across all use cases.')
