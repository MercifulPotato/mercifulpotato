Probably true, I don&#x27;t know. But that isn&#x27;t an argument I&#x27;m dealing with - I&#x27;m pointing out that wealthy people buying comfort is the complaint at the root of the threat and it isn&#x27;t a strong complaint. Because that is what wealth is for.<p>&gt; I can&#x27;t imagine whatever costs you&#x27;re imagining are involved in tracking down people skipping court dates would tax the rich out of their privilege.<p>People need to control more money than they spend so they can set themselves up for retirement. &quot;This would just come out of their savings&quot; is also a bad argument at all levels of the social tree.<p>That isn&#x27;t really going to the point you raise, which I am going to leave alone, but is an aside that I think that argument is fundamentally bad because it could be repeatedly applied until it turns out you misread the future and people start running out of savings.')
