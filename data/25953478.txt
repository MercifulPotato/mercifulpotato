All is well as long as they buy it back by the end of the day as settlement takes 2 more days.<p>If settlement was instantaneous then the market makers would have to already own a bunch of the stock in order to sell any. Owning stock requires capital. Similarly if they wanted to buy more stock they&#x27;d need cash on hand.')
