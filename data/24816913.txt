The result on CO2 emissions is pretty damning.<p>This is the danger of picking &quot;winning technologies&quot;, you are telling the market to waste resources. Instead, you need to incentivize the market for your <i>actual goal</i> and then let it do its thing. Putting a price on CO2 would&#x27;ve incentivized all sorts of technologies that reduce net CO2 emissions.')
