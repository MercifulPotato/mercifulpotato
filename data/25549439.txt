If you can get 1000 students in one day but spend three weeks hunting over 60s willing to be injected.. do you refuse to test 1000 students? No. You&#x27;d do something akin to Monte-Carlo random sampling into the age bins to get a distribution of experiments to match your needs. Maybe by the time they learned they had a fuckup on their hands, they&#x27;d only tested with the bodies available?')
