I have been using Scala for 10 years and never used monad transformers. I find Scala code usually easy to write and to read. At this point I wouldn&#x27;t trade it for any other language.<p>From where I stand, Scala was neither &quot;taken over&quot;, nor &quot;destroyed by FP fanatics&quot;. It is not Haskell, and the upcoming Scala 3 is not going in the direction of being more like Haskell. Scala has always been about supporting both object-orientation and functional programming. It&#x27;s still the case with Scala 3, and it&#x27;s getting better and better.')
