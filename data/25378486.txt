If the token is part of the URL, which is in the command-line, then it appears other users can see the token.  What I do for DomTerm (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;domterm.org" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;domterm.org</a>) is create a small only-user-readable html file which sets the secret token, and then does a &#x27;location.replace(newkey)&#x27; where newkey to an http url to localhost and includes the secret token.  I spawn the browser file a file: url, so teh browser can only read the file if it is running as the same user. Better suggestions?')
