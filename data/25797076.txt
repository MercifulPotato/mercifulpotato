It _is_ true that a standard library doesn&#x27;t cater to single developers&#x27; or companies specific, custom needs and performance tradeoffs. But that&#x27;s only true for limited parts of the code. Most of an application&#x27;s code is not the critical &quot;secret sauce&quot;, and typically, we are well served with standard library facilities. We simply don&#x27;t use the small part where we need something different.<p>It&#x27;s like that for basically any high-level language, I believe; and standardization is desirable and appreciated. Are we really to believe that most big LUA users need their own regex library for LUA? Their own sqlite library? etc.')
