It just shifts it to knot-stability.<p>The question is: can I create a situation which can not lead to stability?\nAnd if so, what happens? Will it simply not work? Or will every situation lead to the possibility of stability?<p>Say, I travel back in time at the moment the universe &quot;ends&quot;, and from that point onward in the past I destroy all time machines with a certain technology. Then, no one can fix what I did, and no stable loop could exist.<p>Now it is the same paradox all over again.<p>I mean, my guess is that such a situation simply can not exist, therefore I can not experience it - I can not live in this universe where this is possible. So, I can only live in the universe where my technology somehow fails exactly when someone travels back in time to correct my loop.')
