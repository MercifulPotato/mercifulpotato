If I write this into a file (&#x2F;tmp&#x2F;test.py):<p><pre><code>    #!&#x2F;usr&#x2F;bin&#x2F;env python\n    \n    print(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;)\n</code></pre>\nand mark it as executable (chmod +x &#x2F;tmp&#x2F;test.py), I can just execute it as &#x2F;tmp&#x2F;test.py like I would do with any bash file.<p>If you mean invocation as &quot;execute a command that I&#x27;m passing&quot;, &#x27;python -c&#x27; does exactly that.<p>Even as a complete shell it works including changing directories and using standard python to do file IO, though it won&#x27;t execute any system executables and doesn&#x27;t do piping like you&#x27;d like from a shell. It&#x27;s not intended for that purpose so I can&#x27;t really blame python for that.')
