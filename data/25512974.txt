Humans are way too advanced species to progress from monkeys to what we are now in just a few thousand years. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s taken close to 18 millions years since humans were advanced monkeys, but even then the difference between a &quot;regular monkey&quot; and an &quot;advanced monkey that can make tools for hunting&quot; is massive and needs an extended period of prehistory.')
