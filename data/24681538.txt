The world&#x27;s adaptation that needs to be done for colorblindness is simply not making color the <i>only</i> differentiator between states. And if you have to do so, using one of the many free, publicly available sources to choose a palette that is colorblind-friendly.<p>For example, in a traffic light, both color <i>and</i> position are status differentiators; the top light is stop and the bottom light is go. Many buttons are both colored and have symbols&#x2F;shapes on them associated with the color. Even using entirely different senses are helpful; crosswalk signals near me use color, position, shape, and <i>audio</i>, the last because blind people can&#x27;t see color or shape.<p>Color in general is just not a great sole associator, even for fully sighted people, because perception of color can change depending on environmental conditions, and because meaning of color is not standard across cultures.')
