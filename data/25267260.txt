It was untested<p>We can say Newton had a hypothesis regarding Earth artificial satellite, which took centuries to experimentally observe. But regarding powered descent, Delta Cliper flew years ago by the time SpaceX Grasshopper tests, and Northrop Grumman Lunar Lander Challenge showed that again. The untested part was to actually land the stage of an orbital rocket - difference in usage, not principal technology. Wouldn&#x27;t say it was a far bet.<p>&gt; But they were right there on it, and doing the lionâ€™s share of the pushing of it.<p>They were practically alone in the commercial space, but technologically their achievements, I think, more incremental that Wright Brothers.<p>I&#x27;m not saying SpaceX did nothing worthy mentioning. It&#x27;s the case, IMO, of staying on the shoulders of giants when other commercial giants became to lazy to look forward - indeed, the status quo was rather beneficial to Boeing-Lockheed, while Musk was interested in more long range projects. But Musk wasn&#x27;t operating in vacuum by a long shot. Andrew Beal could probably reach similar results in a slightly different scenario.<p>&gt; SpaceX is miles ahead of all of them.<p>&quot;Better equipped&quot; in this context is mostly &quot;had almost a hundred millions to spare on first project development&quot;. That kind of money was&#x27;t available to XCOR, Armadillo Aerospace, Masten Space - but probably was available to Beal Aerospace and certainly to Blue Origin (which is somewhat to the side of this list), maybe to Kistler Rocket... It&#x27;s not about ideas and achievements, it&#x27;s about starting conditions.<p>&gt; Hell, out of your list, only Scaled Composites still builds anything.<p>It&#x27;s almost two decades since founding of SpaceX, and this is capital-heavy area, surely only commercially successful survive. Blue Origin is practically only exception. Doesn&#x27;t tell about technological advantage.<p>&gt; If we say SpaceX does no science, we must argue that the Japanese and Indian space programs do no science.<p>SpaceX does applied science, targeted towards rather immediate applications in commercial systems, be that Raptor of Starlink. Here at least we can agree that a degree of science work is required for projects of that kind.')
