Item(by='henrikschroder', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603140217, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24824993, text='&gt; Anyone who thinks IKEA is anything less than an industrial design marvel should go buy a few things there.<p>...and then buy flatpack furniture from a competitor and compare...<p>I&#x27;ve done it a couple of times for different reasons, and it&#x27;s always a shitshow. Everyone loves to joke about the IKEA instruction manuals, but they&#x27;re much, <i>much</i>, better than anything from the competition. Quality and innovation is always better with the IKEA stuff, because they&#x27;re driving the technology, not copying from someone else. And the price is always better with IKEA, because they have economies of scale unlike any other competitor.<p>And if you want solid wood furniture, you can get that at IKEA too, but it costs 10x as much as the particleboard items. (And if you go to the competition, it costs 20x as much...)')
