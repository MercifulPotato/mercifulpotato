Too many people are making a big deal about their profitability as a whole. But if you look at customers at a cohort level once customers get to years 2,3,4 they are actually profitable. The big question is what is the average lifespan of a customer for them, do they make it to years 2,3,4, how far in do they make it and at scale how much profit can they expect to make from each customer that does last that long. Then when that is all said and one what size company are we lookin at? $1B in annual revenue?, $10B?, $100B? That will determine the viability of DoorDash and its size as a public company.')
