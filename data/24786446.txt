All information is misinformation until it isn&#x27;t. I could say that the reason that some people are asymptomatic is that the virus is lying dormant in them like herpes. Can anyone credibly refute that?<p>Logic would dictate that a novel virus -- novel in that we don&#x27;t know everything about it -- is a threat to the survival of our species as a whole until disproven otherwise and that we should collectively do everything that we can to minimize its spread.<p>What I know to be true is that to curb the infection rate, we should stop spitting in each other&#x27;s mouths. Yes, there is science at the base of that assertion, but mostly it&#x27;s just common fucking sense.<p>If you can tell me how basic common sense is being subverted on a massive scale without the use of a platform of social manipulation, I&#x27;m willing to hear you out.')
