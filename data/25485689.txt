Soaking in your surroundings and thinking about your place in the universe -  how insignificantly small we are in the vastness of space that surrounds us.<p>It&#x27;s humbling and helps me with self reflection. What have I done wrong? What have I done right? What are my plans for the future? How can achieve them? What can I do to better myself, the people and the things around me?<p>That&#x27;s much more preferable than being shocked and 15 minutes is really nothing...')
