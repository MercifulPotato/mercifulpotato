And to make it worse the police were poorly trained and did a number of dangerous things:<p>- After the shooting it was over <i>30 MINUTES</i> until an ambulance came for Breonna Taylor. What the fuck&#x27;s up with that? It seems terribly wrong.<p>- 20 neighbors said they never heard the police announce themselves. The police said they did. So it&#x27;s unclear if the police even said they were police.<p>- The policeman breaking down the door immediately put himself in the line of fire in the doorway, which he&#x27;s not supposed to do, putting himself at risk and increasing the danger of the situation for everyone.<p>- Another policeman who was outside, once the shooting started, <i>blindly shot through the windows of the apartment.</i> He couldn&#x27;t see what he was shooting at. I believe this was the only officer convicted of anything - for endangerment.<p>- Several shots from various officers went into neighboring apartments.<p>- When requesting the warrant, the police lied about their source of information.<p>- The police didn&#x27;t have a formal plan for the raid.')
