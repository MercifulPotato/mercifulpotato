Subtle behavioral changes in the kernel combined with user space code could empower a state actor to move unnoticed.  I think of it like 20 parts of a munition.  Each piece by itself may look mostly harmless.  This is all theory of course, but that is how I would do something malicious in the kernel.  A theoretical example would be a simple kernel API combined with something like systemd&#x27;s binfmt mount and a benign looking PNG image file that when parsed by binfmt, instructs the kernel to do something <i>interesting</i> such as tickle an undocumented CPU instruction.')
