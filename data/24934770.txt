Then if you can process it in space since not all of the asteroid is useful metal. Then send the processed material down to earth. However, it may just be more effective break chunks off and send those to earth. Either way your going to need fuel to move the material to earth. Energy to process the material ect.... It&#x27;s not going to be free.<p>The asteroid in question is only ~120 miles in diameter. Not massive enough to effect earths orbit that much. Earth is hundreds of thousands of times more massive.<p>However, Platinum group metals are relatively rare in earths crust. This would be the what we would really want from an asteroid. If it was just for iron and nickle not many people would think about asteroid mining.')
