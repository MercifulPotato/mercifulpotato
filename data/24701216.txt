Insulin is probably cheaper in Germany (I have no clue since I&#x27;ve never bought any), but our taxes are much higher as well. For somebody who has no money to buy insulin, that doesn&#x27;t matter much, as they wouldn&#x27;t pay any taxes. For <i>most</i> people however, that means something, as it would cut deeply into their budget.<p>All of these things are trade-offs, you can&#x27;t view them isolated and expect to gain any insights.')
