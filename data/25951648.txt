Perhaps you can agree on methods for assessing evidence as a starting point, and then jointly apply them to a particular issue, once the collaborative atmosphere has been established. FWIW I&#x27;ve had more luck doing this in email rather than in a text client or on twitter. The communication medium has to allow for a longer-form discussion, both to establish common ground, with minimized emotion, and to enable the nuance to be worked through.')
