Perhaps it&#x27;s also the algorithms fault, if only a few people (considered from a worldwide view) download it, it&#x27;s not shown to others looking for map apps (it&#x27;s a very crowded space app wise).\nCzechs are very outdoorsy people, they recommend this app to each other and so it&#x27;s very popular there, but unfortunately the language barrier makes it harder spreading over borders. But these are all just wild guesses, who knows? Most people here in Germany use Komoot which gives away their maps for free on a regular basis, perhaps that&#x27;s better marketing than &quot;everything is free already&quot;... :)')
