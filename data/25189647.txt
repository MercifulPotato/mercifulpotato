Not just in America, but as a global phenomenon.<p>With GREAT emphasis on the fact that is was not the large-scale spending that did it in, but the hidden aspect of it.<p>You correctly identify the catch-22 for governments: once one government (arguably France I guess, or at least they forced the world to follow them, I guess they didn&#x27;t start it) showed you could do this, other politicians in other governments had little choice but to follow suit.<p>In a way you can say that the breaking of the gold standard was the problem. But that&#x27;s like saying in a heart attack the heart is the problem. It&#x27;s not wrong, but it&#x27;s of course not the root cause: it&#x27;s (usually) the decades-long excess of cholesterol in your arteries, mostly due to unhealthy eating habits, that&#x27;s where you should look to the root cause. Hiding increasing government expenditures is the root cause.')
