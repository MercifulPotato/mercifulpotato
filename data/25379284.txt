I will continue to write Clojure for a living as long as I am able to find a job willing to pay me to do so. I have never encountered a more pleasant environment to do my work. I think Clojure isn&#x27;t going to &quot;go away&quot; any time soon as long as there are other people like me still around.<p>I do think that Clojure shops (like all software shops) need to dial back the torture interviews &#x2F; homework &#x2F; tests, but that&#x27;s really a bigger thing that just Clojure. I think more could be done to market Clojure to the non-believers, but I don&#x27;t have specific ideas on how that could be done.<p>You can take my parentheses from my cold, unemployed hands.')
