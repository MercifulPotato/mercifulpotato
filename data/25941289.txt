It&#x27;s rather impossible to truly prevent contributions in FOSS (someone can always just make a fork).<p>Instead, this seems to me as a kind of branding where the maintainers are saying that for the upstream they would like to dictate the style the code is developed with including how&#x2F;if &quot;bugs&quot; are fixed. This seems reasonable to me. Even the best style guides can&#x27;t convey styles of ideas about code structure, so having this branding of &quot;Upstream is written according to my thought processes that I can&#x27;t put into words&quot; seems like a pretty reasonable approach for projects maintained by individuals or small teams.<p>Also, in this case the dev is still open to bug reports&#x2F;feature requests. The only thing they&#x27;re asking for is to not have their style of thought be disturbed.')
