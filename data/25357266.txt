You should have prefaced with &quot;Trigger warning: I talk about scr#ll b#rs in this comment&quot; because I am 100% triggered :-D<p>Rant incoming - sorry it&#x27;s been done to death already but I never weighed in before. I will never understand the desire to mess around with custom scrolling on a &quot;normal&quot; page. If you have one of those weird parallax-scrolling visualisations that news sites are often fond of, fine - I don&#x27;t like them but I understand it&#x27;s there to present some photography or graphs or whatever in a novel or fancy way. But so many sites that are just serving an article with some pictures override a browser&#x27;s scroll behaviour in a way that not only adds <i>nothing</i>, but often breaks things. By that I mean it can either just slow or interfere with scrolling in a way that will annoy technical or observant users ... or it can prevent scrolling altogether for a subset of browser&#x2F;OS or for touch&#x2F;non-touch users.')
