And as I said, there are many cold viruses in circulation, at all times.<p>Even if you believe that &quot;the steps we are taking&quot; are working, you have to assume that they&#x27;re <i>disproportionately effective</i> for the common cold in order to make the statement the OP was making. Say what you will about SARS-CoV2, but it&#x27;s more-or-less like any other respiratory virus in terms of transmission characteristics. There&#x27;s no particular reason to believe that anything we&#x27;re doing would stop rhinovirus or RSV, but not SARS-CoV2.')
