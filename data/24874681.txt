If they did clone youtube-dl, their clone carries the &quot;meant for copyright infringement&quot; colour, by the virtue of being a clone of a project with that colour, and not a completely unrelated and independent project. It&#x27;s the provenance and intent that matters. Web browsers and HTTP libraries do not have the &quot;bad&quot; colour, and being general-purpose tools, they likely never will.')
