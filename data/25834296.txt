I assume they understand better than anybody that the dev and startup dollar is enormous and crucial to their future success. This type of thing - and their past willingness to leach off open-source - has to have a marketing and sales impact - at least at the &#x27;startup&#x27; top of the funnel. Is it sufficient to push AWS to change direction? Would be good to see a RocksDB, Cassandra or the likes emerge from AWS.')
