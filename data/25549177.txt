Connections to 192.168.123.034 went to 192.168.123.28.  I thought sure it was an issue in my TCP client code, which was handling connections to hundreds of different devices.<p>Guilty party was Poco::Net library if I recall correctly.  I can maybe see this making sense if you provide four octal digits (0377), but not three, and I have a hard time believing anybody has ever used this on purpose.')
