For whatever reason our auto payment stopped on the health insurance on a year-to-year rollover.  I didn&#x27;t notice, everything is on autopay.  Sure it was my &#x27;fault&#x27;, but you know what the result was? I was uninsured for 9 months (except for a garbage plan I could find that I&#x27;m sure would have done almost nothing).. if something serious had happened I would have been FUCKED.<p>So yeah we can sit here and say all this bullshit about eligibility windows. But the truth of the matter is every one of these things just points to why the entire country should be covered.<p>It&#x27;s honestly SICK how some people think healthcare should work.  And honestly the amount of resources put into all the billing jobs and compliance and all the bullshit is STAGGERING.  How much energy is wasted on the bullshit billing systems and rules which are just made to fuck people over who have health problems.<p>&#x2F;rant off')
