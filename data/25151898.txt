This is about the books kids are required to read in class. Would you object if your kids were mainly reading the Old Testament and Mein Kampf for class, or would you push for a more balanced curriculum? Should the parents have no say in the literature their children are taught from? This isn&#x27;t a law, the focus here should be increasing the effectiveness and fairness of education.')
