In modern per-capita US terms, that would be like 866 deaths (mostly children) and 1750 disabled.  While that&#x27;s not much compared to COVID, it is about 1&#x2F;6 as many deaths as polio in its worst year in the US, and that was a widely feared virus.<p>The Measles vaccine is also a proxy for other behavior.  Minimally, in the US, folks that aren&#x27;t innoculated for measles probably aren&#x27;t innoculated for mumps or rubella (as MMR is one vaccine), or other important vaccines altogether.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20161023051702&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;measles&#x2F;hcp&#x2F;index.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20161023051702&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.g...</a>')
