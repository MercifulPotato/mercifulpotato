We&#x27;re nowhere near to creating an algorithm that could be trusted with deciding if we should go for Medicare for all or stick with the system we have (I&#x27;m absolutely in favor of the first one), to what extent speech should be censored online and how, or nay other political decision whatsoever.<p>We are absurdly ill equipped technically for even attempting to attack such a problem. I for one am thankful that no one is yet trying to sell such bullshit.<p>No machine messiah can help us - we need to get our acts together as humans and fix some of these ills.')
