Item(by='CryptoPunk', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607840339, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25403335, text='&gt;&gt;Kelly just takes this (dubious, reductive) reading of Hegel, which was spun into apologetics for Prussian absolutism, and spins it into apologetics for contemporary tech entrepreneurship.<p>There&#x27;s a lot of bias packed into this one sentence.<p>Firstly, it&#x27;s biased toward the presupposition that Kelly&#x27;s take is dubious&#x2F;reductive. That is what actually needs to be demonstrated, as opposed to accepted as an axiom for secondary arguments.<p>Secondly, it focuses on &quot;Prussian absolutism&quot;, a term which conjurs a vague association to fascism, to the exclusion of all other less foreboding developments associated with Kelly&#x27;s line of thinking. This suggests a manipulative, agenda-driven characterization of Kelly&#x27;s theology.<p>Thirdly, it presupposes that tech entrepreneurship is a generally objectionable phenomenon, and that defenses of it are merely apologism. Again you need to demonstrate your presupposition to be true, rather than implying it&#x27;s an irrefutable fact that can be used as an axiom on which to discuss the issue.<p>This kind of snide counter-culture cynicism - where you take the role of a crusading critic of The Man - seems profound to the naive, but has little substance.')
