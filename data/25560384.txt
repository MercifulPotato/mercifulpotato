The human body is an incredibly efficient biomechanical system that can perform a wide array of delicate movements, and current robotic systems are still too far away from reasonably mimicking human muscles, joints, and sensory nervous systems. Robots might still has difficulty in performing everyday tasks done by humans, even if the algorithms are intelligent enough.')
