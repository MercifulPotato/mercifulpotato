It&#x27;s the short sightedness of the thing. (or in this case, perhaps a marketing trick as they now have a great &quot;now supports up to 32 or 64GB&quot; tagline for their 2021 model that will drive another must-upgrade rush)<p>It&#x27;s pretty ridiculous to release a &quot;latest and greatest&quot; generation of any computer in 2020 with a hard 16GB limit. Sure, it&#x27;s most likely enough for general usage and diehard Apple fans will buy that thing in droves and then spend countless hours debating it and justifying the buy, but as already stated by other commenters, there are many reasons to need more RAM and I suspect it will be a deal breaker for a lot of potential buyers, especially developers and designers. There are many things that benefit of more ram, large or complex ide&#x27;s, virtual machines, game development, sound design, video editing, 3d rendering, and just plain old multitasking.<p>So, in my opinion, no, it&#x27;s not reasonable for Software Engineering work unless you upgrade machines very frequently, and even then, I wouldn&#x27;t really go for it, not only because of the RAM issue, but also the novelty of the entire system.')
