If not, what would it take?<p>I think you hit the nail on the head for a core use-case: deployment processes inhibiting quick data changes. I believe the problem gets worse as you work at larger places... I&#x27;ve worked at [unnamed SF Tech Company with ~1k engineers] where deploying took ~a day simply waiting for the CI along with a backlog of commits from other developers.<p>I really like the challenges you call out. We don&#x27;t do a good job of saying this on the site but we explicitly don&#x27;t want h manage secrets &#x2F; sensitive data; especially because the API_KEY is on the client libraries - so there isn&#x27;t really anything stopping anyone from peeking in memory &#x2F; the source making requests (I think this is different than say a more traditional login-auth system where the secret is stored in a session and only the person with access to the client with that session can access that data).<p>100% agreed on latency and availability. Config.ly needs be super solid here (sacrificing of course some consistency... slightly delayed updates). Besides following best practices for building&#x2F;designing&#x2F;operating high-avail systems (both my cofounder and I have experience here), there are some clever things we can do on the client. For instance, caching should help with both and I thought some of commenters below mentioned had great suggestions for other sorts of clever client fallback mechanisms we can do to help here [1] [2].<p>Thanks again for the great input!<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25062496" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25062496</a>\n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25063062" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25063062</a>')
