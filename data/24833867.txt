It would be a law more or less targeting a particular religion. That&#x27;s against both the letter and the spirit of the constitution. Unless I&#x27;m missing something here?<p>&gt; (Certainly it&#x27;s not interfering with the corporation&#x27;s freedom of religion interests, is it? Corporations don&#x27;t practice religion!)<p>Serious question: Why can&#x27;t they? They&#x27;re groups of people after all. (I&#x27;m not sure how that would fit with protected classes under federal employment law though. If a company openly supports a particular religion is that potentially a form of discrimination?)')
