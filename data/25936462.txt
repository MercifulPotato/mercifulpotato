The market is what it is, and their strategy failed. It doesn&#x27;t really make sense to blame the market when the scheme fails and presumably celebrate the individual or group&#x27;s purported brilliance when the scheme works. What actually happens is the ultimate arbiter of who profits and who doesn&#x27;t, not the hypothetical fairer environment that &quot;should&quot; have existed to reward certain strategies.<p>It&#x27;s similar to blaming the roulette wheel when the gambler fails and praising the gambler when they succeed.')
