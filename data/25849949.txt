Usually the distinction doesn&#x27;t matter but it does affect outcomes. States have different rules in how their electors vote for the president.<p>Some states have tied their electoral votes to the national popular vote in the name of increases democracy.  It will be interesting to see the first state that has its electoral votes changed due to this. I imagine those residents won&#x27;t be so thrilled to have their votes go against their will and in favor of how other people in the country voted.')
