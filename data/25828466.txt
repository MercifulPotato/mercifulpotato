I hadn&#x27;t previously appreciated just how much of an unprecedented explosion in the money supply there&#x27;d been this year.<p>In particular, it seems to quantify a <i>lot</i> of potential for long run inflation and a very expansionary monetary policy move required to prop up the economy during the pandemic. But I&#x27;m not an expert here; I&#x27;m hoping we can put our heads together. I&#x27;d be very curious to hear general discussion and insights into the dynamics. Let&#x27;s go, community of systems thinkers :)<p>While the M1 measure of money shows the change most dramatically, other ways of looking at the same data (dollars printed, M2, MZM, etc.) seem to tell the same story. There have also been some news articles written, but I thought that for HN, we&#x27;d go directly to the numbers.<p>Thanks for taking a look!')
