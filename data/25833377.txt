We made this as a hackathon project over the weekend to experiment with OpenAI’s new CLIP model. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;openai.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;clip&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;openai.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;clip&#x2F;</a><p>Glad you’re enjoying playing with it and discovering failure modes! Yesterday we tweaked the prompts to penalize people writing text when we discovered CLIP can read. Looks like we should add something to prevent it from falling in love with solid blocks of color. Any ideas for how to describe that? (Someone below suggested a bonus for “complexity” but I’m concerned that’d make it fall in love with scribbles.)<p>You can read more about the project on my Show HN from yesterday: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25822610" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25822610</a>')
