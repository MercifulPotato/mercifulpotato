Sex is not free. I can&#x27;t go outside and instantly have sex. I need a partner who is willing - which is, again, not free.<p>&gt; Women getting married and having children later should mean more opportunities for casual sex, not fewer.<p>You&#x27;re conflating &quot;should&quot; with &quot;What is.&quot; You think it &quot;should&quot; mean more opportunities - but you haven&#x27;t given any evidence that it actually should, and society shows that there is less sex. So this is false.<p>&gt; Boomers have not forced younger people to find hookups on tinder. The argument about competition makes no sense. Everyone can&#x27;t be outcompeted.<p>The argument makes perfect sense if you would get over your need to protect boomers, which is an odd strawman.<p>People don&#x27;t want to settle. Now that they see they have potential access to more attractive mates, they are less likely to settle for someone less attractive and in turn others are less likely to settle for them. The benefits of having a partner just aren&#x27;t there anymore, and the younger generations are far more risk averse (not just with sex: “It’s part of an overall trend toward less risky behavior since 1990, including not only sex but alcohol use, risky driving, and criminal activity,” Dr. Arnett told Healthline.&quot;) than the lead fueled baby boomers.<p>Young people can&#x27;t consent until 18. While boomers aren&#x27;t forcing anyone to use tinder, society has impressed these things upon youth. It&#x27;s unfair to say that children and adolescents have free agency. They don&#x27;t.')
