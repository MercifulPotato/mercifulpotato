Logging the traffic can for example mean storing CDRs for the connections. The kind of thing your ISP could also do, and in many jurisdictions is legally obligated to.<p>They could do per-flow logging of TCP flows (subscriber 89 made a TCP connection to 1.2.3.4:567 starting at 12:00:05, ending at 12:02:04, transferring 10kB up and 1MB down). In the worst case this would also include the TLS SNI, which is transmitted in plaintext.<p>Or it they could do logging based on the endpoint (subscriber 89 transmitted 1MB from IP 1.2.3.4 in the 15 minute interval 12:00-12:15).')
