Where Google says &quot;quota system&quot;, for normal people that means &quot;buy another computer&quot;; you have hit your quota when you&#x27;re out of memory &#x2F; cpu cycles &#x2F; disk.  At Google, they have some extra computers sitting around, but it&#x27;s still not infinite.  Quota is a way of hitting some sort of limit before every atom in the Universe becomes a computer on which to run your program.<p>I don&#x27;t think there is any way to avoid it.  It sounds bad when it&#x27;s software that&#x27;s telling your service it can&#x27;t write to disk, rather than the disk not having any more free sectors on which to write, but it&#x27;s exactly the same thing.  Everyone has a quota, and left unchecked, your software will run into it.<p>(In the case of this postmortem, there was a bug in the software, which makes it all feel self-inflicted.  But if it wasn&#x27;t self-inflicted, the same problem would have manifested in some other way.)<p>There is a comment in this thread where the author says they take less risks when the safety systems are turned off.  That is fine and nice, but is not really a good argument against safety systems.  I have definitely had outages where something hit a quota I set, but I&#x27;ve had more confusing outages from something exhausting all physical resources, and an unrelated system failing because it happened to be nearby.  I think you should wear a helmet AND ride safely.')
