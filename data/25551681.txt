The reality is that even though Portgres seems more stable etc, making queries in Mongodb is much easier and fun.<p>Postgres JSON operators are cryptic and made my head hurt every time I wanted to accomplish something more complex.<p>To express it differently, if mongo and postgres where identical operationally, I would choose mongo every day.
