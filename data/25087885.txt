Nvidia GPUs have not been supported in macOS since Mojave, so this seems like an apples-oranges comparison. Unless the benchmark for M1 was also run on Mojave (unlikely), then there&#x27;s 3 years worth of software optimization potentially unaccounted for.<p>Possibly a more realistic comparison is between the M1 and the AMD Radeon 5300M. Shows between a 10-40% deficit in performance:  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gfxbench.com&#x2F;compare.jsp?benchmark=gfx50&amp;did1=79877526&amp;os1=OS+X&amp;api1=metal&amp;hwtype1=dGPU&amp;hwname1=AMD+Radeon+Pro+5300M&amp;D2=Apple+M1" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gfxbench.com&#x2F;compare.jsp?benchmark=gfx50&amp;did1=798775...</a><p>That said still an impressive showing given the TDP and the fact it&#x27;s an integrated GPU vs. a dedicated GPU. It seems to hint that with enough GPU cores and a better cooling solution, it&#x27;s not unreasonable to see these replacing the AMD Radeon 5500M&#x2F;5600M next year in the MBP 16 and iMac lineups.<p>EDIT: pasted wrong compare link')
