Though an academic book Oligarchy is very easy to read and surprisingly neutral politically.<p>Winters basically says that oligarchy is when a particular economic group has asymmetric power in a society, arguing that the main use of the power is wealth defense. He then outlines how this has four major forms:<p>- Warring oligarchies where warlords fight each other to protect wealth<p>- Ruling oligarchies similar to Italian city states<p>- Sultanistic oligarchies were multiple oligarchs align to support a single oligarchical ruler<p>- Civil oligarchies which are basically like the US and Singapore where oligarchs mostly use tax law and investment strategies for wealth defense.<p>The main evolution between these oligarchies is how much energy needs to be expended in wealth defense, the earlier stages requires constant violence against both the lower class and competing oligarchs, evolving to more cooperation between oligarchs and finally when the wealth class agree to the civil law so long as it can still defend its wealth.<p>In the case of civil oligarchy, Winters argues that nearly all of wealth defense and manipulation of the law is basically around tax codes and loop holes that allow wealth defense. The oligarchs in general are fine surrendering their military power (which is expensive anyway) so long as they can still defend their wealth. They agree to adhere to the rule of law, so long as the rule of law doesn&#x27;t impact their ability to maintain wealth.<p>The conclusion of course being that we will always have complex tax law because it is required by the ruling oligarchy.')
