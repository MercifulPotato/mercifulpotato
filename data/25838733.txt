The truth is, for all streamers pay they probably won&#x27;t end up paying as much as theaters.  And it is not clear any of them currently make money.  What if the model that really makes money is YouTube, and a lot of classic expensive movies are going to be replaced with mediocre user generated content that is extremely profitable to stream?  That may sound crazy, but think what happened to radio?<p>I am not seriously arguing that I know what will happen, but you just have to understand that when there is a good buisiness for high quality, you tend to get quality.')
