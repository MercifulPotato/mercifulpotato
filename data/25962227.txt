These are pre-orders for a vaccine, and the contract has a section on how it will be funded. AstraZeneca is under no obligation to not do business with anyone else (provided they can meet their contractual obligations).<p>If the both the UK and the EU wanted a million doses each and AZ has the capacity to manufacture 5 million, then nothing stops them from entering into other agreements with countries in Africa, South America, or Oceania.<p>They probably overestimated their capacity and are now pushing back on deadlines. I don&#x27;t have much to criticise AZ for on that since we&#x27;ve all been there, but you can&#x27;t tell a paying customer that you have other customers that paid you first, when you signed a contract agreeing to meeting certain deadlines. It simply does not matter. Did AstraZeneca lie in their negotiations regarding their capacity? Let&#x27;s also remember that this was likely brought up when discussing the funding for manufacturing sites in Europe and the UK.')
