For example, showing some slides to some people, with some jumps to code or terminals. In this case, it&#x27;s extremely valuable to have the call with webcams open on a second monitor so I can keep tabs on the expressions of the audience in order to adjust tempo. Switching the contents of the presentation screen &#x2F; shared screen without warning is jarring and confusing to the audience. And commonly used communication programs do not support sharing one virtual desktop easily, only screens and&#x2F;or windows.<p>And sometimes, it is valuable to be able to display more information at once. Sometimes, during larger outages, it helps to be able to display more key metrics of the system on one screen and poking the system on the other screen. This one can be done with virtual desktops, yes, but it has less overall cognitive overhead for me to just have a stable screen with the monitoring data and&#x2F;or logs on it available instead of constantly flipping between desktops.<p>And again, during screen sharing, people hate it and get confused if I flip the main screen around too much between monitoring data and shells. So having a work screen to share with people on a call and another screen for information helps reduce that.<p>A lot of other use cases are convenient with more screen space, but good virtual screens with hotkeys work almost as well I&#x27;ve found.')
