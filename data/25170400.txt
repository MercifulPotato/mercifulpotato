Amdahl&#x27;s law just says that there are diminishing returns on the whole when increasing parallelization in a program with significant serial parts.  It is a fairly obvious observation, but people seem to distort it and apply it to general scalability.<p>First, everything needs to be synchronized but that doesn&#x27;t mean synchronization is expensive or blocks computation from happening.  Lots of synchronization isn&#x27;t even dealt with explicitly by users, it happens in queues in the kernel, in networking hardware, or even in the memory controller when talking about reading from memory.<p>The closest thing is the database becoming a bottleneck, but that is not because of Amdahl&#x27;s law or even synchronization, it just about reads, and those are extremely parallel, so it likely comes down to total CPU power when it is a problem. That&#x27;s why query caching can be so effective - it isn&#x27;t about synchronization and definitely not about serial parts of a program, it is just about usage.<p>For connected social media sites, not everything has to be done on a page request. Anything done ahead of time is also done in parallel.')
