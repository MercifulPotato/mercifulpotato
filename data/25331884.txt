That involved quite a specific tool tailored to the codebase in question, and a lot of manual cleanup afterwards.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.google.com&#x2F;document&#x2F;d&#x2F;1P3BLR31VA8cvLJLfMibSuTdwTuF7WWLux71CYD0eeD8&#x2F;edit" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.google.com&#x2F;document&#x2F;d&#x2F;1P3BLR31VA8cvLJLfMibSuTdw...</a>')
