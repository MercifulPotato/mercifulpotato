It just doesn&#x27;t fit with the accelerationist philosophy of many places anymore. When I studied in Vienna (a city famous for it&#x27;s coffee house culture), you could just go there, drink one coffee and stay for 4 hours, meet people, chat, discuss etc. When you go to a καφενεíο in Greece things are pretty much the same still (only that you drink a Nescafé Frappé instead of their warm counterparts).<p>In my eyes the metropoles of the anglosphere are too transactional, too monetized and to much under (economic) pressure to allow for such inefficiency. In London I&#x27;d probably feel guilty for staying much longer in a café than my drink lasts (or someone would tell me to leave). If you have places that don&#x27;t have such policies, they at least signal this with their interieur and their throughput. Most starbucks are certainly not cosy places that I&#x27;d like to spend my day in given the choice between a starbucks and a traditional viennese coffee house.')
