This data is for a single shot. There is an ongoing trial for boosting with a second shot down the line, but having a single shot that&#x27;s known to be effective at eliminating the disease and extremely effective at reducing severe cases and hospitalizations is a game changer. We can vaccinate lower risk populations with this vaccine and do it twice as fast. Once everyone is vaccinated, we can invite people to come back for a second shot as a booster. From the phase 1&#x2F;2 trial data I saw, I&#x27;d expect a second shot to boost the efficacy to numbers approaching the mRNA vaccines.<p>Edit: It also only needs to be refrigerated so it eliminates a lot of coordination related to frozen transportation, scheduled appointments, etc. will be eliminated.')
