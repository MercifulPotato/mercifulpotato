They do not provide the experimental group&#x27;s baseline metric for cognitive function and the increase.<p>It also doesn&#x27;t mention anything about how it controlled for patients&#x27; initial levels of vitamin D, or what those levels were. There could be a threshold effect, for example, where raising levels to X produce the result observed, or a linear relationship between D levels &amp; cognitive function...<p>Certainly the full extent of things like this would require additional research, but the basics would be known just from the data collection on the patients and their results.<p>I&#x27;m not saying I doubt the research: I know vitamin D has some interesting and diverse impacts on the body, so this result would not surprise me if it&#x27;s true. But the abstract was lacking in important details. (And unfortunately the university library to which I have access does not have this journal in its databases)')
