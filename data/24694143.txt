Item(by='kbenson', descendants=None, kids=[24696111], score=None, time=1601950283, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24693579, text='Sure, but I find most interesting science fiction takes liberty at least <i>somewhere</i>.  I&#x27;m willing to let the author play a little loosely with a few things, which are hopefully explained as &quot;additional input we don&#x27;t quite understand alter known theories&quot; instead of &quot;ignore this well accepted thing&quot;, if it adds significantly to the story.<p>FTL communication?  Eh, there&#x27;s both enough new stuff to discover in physics and it provides such a massive boost to most stories that I&#x27;m generally willing to allow it, if treated well.<p>The clone personalities diverging almost immediately?  Kinda torn.  On the one hand, I think they would diverge significantly eventually anyway (take anyone at age 40 and give them a couple hundred years of experience being a martial protector, trying to unite nations, an R&amp;D head, or a explorer of the wondrous, and you&#x27;re bound to come out the other side with large differences), so I&#x27;m not sure how important it was to have it immediately if the plot points it helped could have been achieved in some other manner.')
