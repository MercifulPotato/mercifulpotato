This is quite an achievement, more than 40% of children born in the lowest wealth quartile stay there.<p>I believe it stems from the feeling that the talk of white privilege is taking something away from this achievement, so there is a counter reaction.<p>To that I say that yes breaking the circle of poverty is a great achievement, but acknowledging that others have factors that make it even more difficult does not take away from this achievement.')
