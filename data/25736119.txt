Someone quoted in the data leak thread that they spent ~300k&#x2F;mo on AWS which suggests they&#x27;re definitely past a few cages of equipment. Who knows though, AWS charges insane rates for the privilege of not needing to think about hardware and making trivial difficult problems like establishing geographic presence or redundancy across datacenters. Parler is probably going to eventually need to self host anyways though, and then we&#x27;ll see what a popular website will look like when it goes back to doing things the old fashioned way.')
