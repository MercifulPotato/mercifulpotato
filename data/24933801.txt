Is your claim that the emails were forgeries? If not, the NYPost story had relevant, true, information of public interest.<p>If you&#x27;re discussing the broader context of the Ukraine prosecutor firing, I agree that there is strong evidence that Biden was not pushing for his firing in response to circumstantial evidence of pressure from his son or anything. Not, to me, strong enough to consider the claim &quot;completely debunked.&quot;')
