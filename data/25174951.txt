And being able to have freshly-cooked rice at a fixed time (for breakfast or dinner) is super useful. I personally don&#x27;t like congee (I didn&#x27;t grow up with it), but my partner cooks it from time to time for herself. So we end up using most of the features pretty often.<p>But I guess whether you&#x27;d find those features useful really depends on how often you eat rice at home -- my partner is from south-east Asia so rice is part of basically every meal. When the rice cooker is empty, I fill it at night and set it to finish cooking in time for lunch the next day (if you just cooked it and left it overnight it wouldn&#x27;t be as fluffy).<p>I don&#x27;t use my rice cooker to bake cakes, but these kinds of features are born from the fact that in Japan very few households have full-sized ovens and so other appliances have to fill those needs.')
