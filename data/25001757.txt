Their predictive ability was low, and even playing by the rules of Nate’s model you have to admit he was off by some 30% at minimum.<p>Nate’s model has the average PA poll at Biden +6 (!!) where the final result looks to be under 1 (and could go either way). It’s simply impossible to argue that was an accurate model.')
