Item(by='kotxig', descendants=0, kids=None, score=3, time=1604366538, title='Ask HN: How can I work with OG engineers?', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='I have recently joined a company that has been around for a while but is still in startup mode. The team is fairly entrenched in its ways and has a handful of engineers who are &quot;super effective&quot; because they built every thread of complexity.<p>Besides finding the work incredibly unfulfilling, I&#x27;m concerned that this entrenchment will prevent growth of the company in the mid to long term. I am also concerned that as a fairly senior person (and having held a senior position prior), will be unable to meet what I consider the correct level of effectiveness for someone working at that level.<p>Onboarding besides the basic company introductions was very thin. The OG&#x27;s don&#x27;t have a team building mindset. I think it&#x27;s probably more of a nuisance to them and they expect information to flow through question polling and osmosis.<p>I want to find a way to become an effective contributor to this team and someone who can lead and contribute a wealth of knowledge, but I feel that the OG&#x27;s have reached a knowledge escape velocity that I will never be able to catch up with.
