I&#x27;ve seen situations often enough where a dev team would like to change frameworks&#x2F;backends&#x2F;dev environments&#x2F;codebases, whatever it might be. And this has to be weighed between short- and long-term success. This is where a more technical product manager shines. On the other end of the scale I&#x27;ve seen dev teams walk all over their (non-technical) PM because they knew they could do so. It&#x27;s a give- and take between team happiness and advocacy as well as end-user satisfaction and what the company needs at any given point in time.\nBeing a great PM is actually much harder than it seems at first.')
