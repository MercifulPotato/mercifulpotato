So depending on the lens you come and view it through, you can find villains all over the place. IMO, one of the biggest problems was that the Docker moat was primarily about mindshare. The core tech popularized containers, but it was thin enough that there&#x27;s now the OCI, many other competing container runtimes, and docker plays completely no role in many large container usage scenarios (large public cloud operators). Kubernetes and really a lot of other clustering solutions always seemed to outweigh docker swarm, which was unfortunate too because that was probably one of the better monetizable vectors for the company.<p>If you compare all of this to a company like hashicorp, which in my opinion is just expertly run from the top, it&#x27;s just a night-and-day tale. You can build great developer businesses, but you have to be careful, and probably still a little lucky. Docker had poor luck but I think they also had a lot of problems with not fully ideating the business of the product.')
