They&#x27;re also uniformly excellent, and I&#x27;d recommend them to anyone. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikisource.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;The_Essays_of_Montaigne" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikisource.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;The_Essays_of_Montaigne</a><p>However, if you click on virtually any of the essays in the link above, you&#x27;ll find an essay that is packed with references and quotations. Quotations are a form of direct citation. Sometimes Montaigne misquotes, but this was well before the information age, and he was often working off of memory, so I think we can excuse his lapses.<p>However, if we are to use the origins of the essay as an example,  I don&#x27;t think we can say that the form necessarily resists citation.')
