Item(by='ColanR', descendants=None, kids=[24812542], score=None, time=1602962500, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24812193, text='&gt; There are multiple ways how a language can deal with such loanwords: they can keep the original spelling, making those words an irregular exception to the pronunciation rules...<p>Isn&#x27;t that the point? IIRC, English was originally about 50&#x2F;50 Saxon and French - most of the fancy &#x2F; unintuitive &#x2F; rule-breaking words are French loan words (e.g., &quot;rendezvous&quot; &amp; &quot;accomplice&quot; are French, &quot;loan&quot; is old Norse, &quot;word&quot; is old English).  The combination happened when Britain spent a while under Norman rule. The commoners were largely Saxon &amp; Norse, the rulers were French. Eventually the languages simply merged, with grammar rules and vocabulary taken from both sides.<p>I believe the first edition of the Webster dictionary in the 1800s was when the spelling was standardized.  At that point, Webster looked at the original language of the words to both define them and figure out a correct spelling.<p>Edit: additional recollections, formatting.<p>Edit2: I&#x27;m being downvoted?')
