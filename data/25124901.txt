I&#x27;ve also seen saunas and gyms<p>- Airbnb plus or Airbnb Luxe can have breakfast or groceries basket<p>- Early check in or late check out is possible. Just discuss with your host prior to confirming reservation.  Unless they have a guest coming just after or their cleaning crew can&#x27;t make it work, they will find a way to make it work<p>- Many Airbnbs have 24&#x2F;7 access. Many have electronic door locks<p>- You can get local, custom recommandations by discussing with the host, and more.
