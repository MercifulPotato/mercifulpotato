I always appreciate my opinions being challenged, and acknowledge that they are simply my opinions. Any perceived sarcasm is meant as banter and not disrespect :) a tough line on the internet I&#x27;ll acknowledge, hence this reply.<p>I will also say that yes transparency in these matters is a strict improvement over the status quo so we can certainly agree on that.')
