I&#x27;d already been annoyed with them over something seemingly trivial; I go by my middle name and last name, not first and last, and want my credit&#x2F;debit card to match that, reading &quot;Middle Last&quot;. Everyone else allows me to do this and Simple <i>did</i> allow that... until we all had to migrate our accounts from Simple&#x27;s original &quot;banking partner&quot; to BBVA. At that point they changed my name and refused to change it back after multiple go-rounds (which ended with a rep telling me &quot;sure, we can do this, just fill this out,&quot; filling said thing out, and being told &quot;we can&#x27;t do that&quot;).<p>As with some other mentions here, though, it was killing the ability to have Simple send checks to payees that did it for me. I&#x27;d been waiting for <i>years</i> to have Simple be able to accept ebills (e.g., receive a bill from a creditor that specifies an amount to pay and paying that, rather than just paying a fixed amount every period), and they never did; instead they regressed.<p>But here&#x27;s the thing: while I&#x27;d left Bank of America because Simple&#x27;s app and design was so much better, I&#x27;d never <i>closed</i> my BoA account for the simple (ha!) reason that <i>they</i> could accept ebills and pay them <i>out of my Simple account.</i> This always left me with the niggling feeling that while Simple was better at technology and customer service, BoA was better at... well... banking. And when I checked out BoA after getting fed up with Simple, well, their app was <i>still</i> ugly and had bad UX design, but the functionality had mostly caught up with Simple. It even has goals built into it, if I want them. (I don&#x27;t, and never cared about Simple&#x27;s equivalent, so I can&#x27;t compare the functionality.)<p>And while there are &quot;bank things&quot; I only do once in a blue moon -- deposit at an ATM, get a cashier&#x27;s check -- it turns out it&#x27;s nice to have a bank that, well, does those things. I know there are other banks (and credit unions) that do them, too, and I&#x27;m not suggesting BoA is particularly good (or bad) in this regard.<p>Simple was a promising idea, but I think they made a serious mistake by letting themselves be bought out by BBVA. And while I&#x27;d love to see someone else try again, I&#x27;m going to be a lot more reticent to move to a new bank just because it gives me a terrific mobile app experience next time around. Simple was a great technology company, but at the end of the day, I just don&#x27;t think they were that great a <i>bank</i>.')
