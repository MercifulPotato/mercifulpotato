A class could hold immutable references to immutable objects&#x2F;functions&#x2F;whatever (these are often the easiest classes of all to reason about).<p>Call me a weirdo, but I enjoy using Spring DI with Scala.  It&#x27;s quite easy to inject into a constructor like &quot;class Foo(f: Int =&gt; String)&quot; even if a little bit of &quot;manual currying&quot; is sometimes needed.')
