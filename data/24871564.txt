If someone can choose when and where to work and they choose a time and place where people mostly don&#x27;t need rides, they mostly don&#x27;t do any work or make any money. Which they may be fine with if they&#x27;re willing to be signed in for 40 hours a week but only work 10.<p>If you force them to a fixed hourly wage, you can&#x27;t hire that person and still let them work those hours in those places, because you&#x27;d be paying them for 40 hours while they&#x27;re still only working 10. So the now money-losing employee either gets a pink slip or has to work different hours.')
