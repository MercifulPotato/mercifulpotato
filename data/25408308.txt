Very useful for hooking up a whole bunch of serial ports to an embedded controller over USB.  I made a video about doing so for my old startup like 7 or 8 years ago (though the hub in the video may have been single-TT...  It was stolen so I can&#x27;t go back and test it again).<p>Per-port power and LED control was also really useful, but really rare, for embedded hardware.  The idea was that a ton of peripherals would be connected over a network of USB extenders, and a user interface would let you flash the LED next to a device you wanted to find, if you weren&#x27;t sure where it was.  No cloud needed.')
