If there is any imbalance it will add up and block a subsystem at some point in the future which will domino its way throughout until total failure.Think of a 1 byte production(memory leak), or a 1 transitor consumption(physical failure) over infinite time. Biology has a very throw things together and iterate what sticks style which is somewhat contrary to the fine craftsmanship required for perfect balance. For all we know, biology might have already taken a design decision which will never be able to be perfectly balanced out, or perhaps we&#x27;re 3 steps away from engineering a fix.')
