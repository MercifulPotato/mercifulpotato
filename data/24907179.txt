Yes, ES5 is a huge pain. However, I believe 5% of users (see other comment) are not a joke for many apps. There&#x27;s always the question of minimum critical APIs required: If you build a 3D or webcam app you can forget ES5 altogether, of course.<p>&gt; Itâ€™s a lot like using polyfills when needed.<p>Never thought of it this way, thanks for that! As is state in the conclusion, the study would likely be more convincing with ES6 and build steps. So yeah, ES5 is questionable :)')
