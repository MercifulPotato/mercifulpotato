At my company (onspecta.com) we solve similar problems (and more!) to accelerate AI&#x2F;deep learning&#x2F;computer vision problems, across both CPUs, GPUs as well as other types of chips.<p>This is a fascinating space, and there are tons of speed up opportunities. Depending on the type of the workload you&#x27;re running, you might be able to ditch the GPU entirely and run everything just on the CPU, greatly reducing cost &amp; deployment complexity. Or, at the very least, improve SLAs and 10x decrease the GPU (or CPU) cost.<p>I&#x27;ve seen this over and over again. Glad someone&#x27;s documenting this publicly :-) If any one of you readers have more questions about this I&#x27;m happy to discuss in the comments here. Or you can reach out to me at victor at onspecta dot com.')
