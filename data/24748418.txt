Images can take very large amounts of bandwidth, even when used “properly”. (since I know the knee jerk reaction on HN is that people should be using arbitrarily low resolution images to save bandwidth)<p>Beyond that, user experience is highly impacted by latency, and CDN PoPs will naturally be closer to users than your single server, unless you happen to only serve users who live in a specific city that happens to house your server — and even then, it’s a coin toss as to whether your server is really interconnected better with your users than a CDN’s PoP in that city.<p>Improved performance, lowered costs, and no need to manage a distributed fleet of webservers yourself...
