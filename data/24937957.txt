If it made the US look good without actually requiring them to do anything, why did Trump withdraw? Do you even logic?<p>This is the problem, you value appearances over reality.<p>&gt; In that case, make sure you go out and vote.<p>No problem, already voted for Trump.<p>&gt; You can help MAGA by voting out the buffoon currently leading that nation. As a bonus, a republican party without Trump and the white supremacists he emboldened would be a party more people will find palatable.<p>Oh no! Emboldening muh white supremacists, aka literally nothing. I think you&#x27;re consuming far too much biased media from wherever you are in the world. If you&#x27;re looking for problems in the US currently, look no further than the endless looting and rioting by left-wing agitators, not some bogeyman white supremacist lurking about.<p>&gt; would be a party more people will find palatable.<p>You mean a party which a Democrat would find palatable, no thanks. I had no love for Republicans until Trump came along. The best part about Trump is that he doesn&#x27;t simply bend over whenever met with criticism. I recall Bush, McCain, Romney all being called Nazis at some point. These attacks no longer hold any meaning.<p>On another note, it would be nice if foreigners like you would stop trying to influence the US election.')
