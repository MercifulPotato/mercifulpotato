Item(by='davexunit', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606160939, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25190525, text='For those that read the above comment, I believe by  &quot;Jean Paul&quot; they mean &quot;Jean Louis&quot;, who spammed Guix, Guile, and other GNU mailing lists for weeks with lengthy, rambling essays saying essentially the same thing over and over.  They maintain a web page smearing one of the Guix maintainers.  Among other details on this page that I can only describe as a screed, are a collection of cherry picked comments from sources like 4chan that agree with their point of view. Unsurprisingly, these comments include slurs (homophobic, ableist, and more) and other offensive language.  So take that into consideration when deciding who is spreading hateful propaganda.')
