I got myself off the street by moving into an SRO. I still live in an SRO more than three years later.<p>Most people in developed countries on planet earth today have completely decadent levels of wealth compared to literally billions of the people alive today, much less historic kings and queens. Yet many of us spend far too much time, money and effort on having walk-in closets full of clothes, getting cosmetic surgeries and similar.<p>I mean the Kardashians basically make millions off of playing to the crowd and sharing their lifestyles of the rich and shameless lives with people who are paying their bills and have zero hope of ever living that way. It is mind boggling and pointless and I am appalled the world is okay with that while also being okay with widespread poverty.<p>There are some incredibly perverse things going on in the world today and if people like the Kardashians did anything that was one tenth as interesting and useful as this experiment, the world would be a vastly better place. Instead, they sell clothes and makeup as if dressing up like them will make you a millionaire like them instead of just keeping them in comfort.<p>Edit: which is to say my idea of decadent wealth, connections, etc is different from yours and I&#x27;m not apologizing for that and I don&#x27;t feel compelled to agree with your set point for &quot;decadence.&quot; This was like some kind of movie Quest where you gather rare and ancient artifacts to make magic. He literally did that and you&#x27;re dismissing it as merely <i>bread.</i><p>(Also also: How many people could start with an argument on Twitter and end up with &quot;So help me make bread that hasn&#x27;t been made in 2000 years.&quot;? This is &quot;decadent&quot; for reasons having nothing to do with financial cost, though there is real cost involved. Not everyone has a backyard to bury pots in and try to figure out how you bake like they did in ancient Egypt.<p>Etc.)')
