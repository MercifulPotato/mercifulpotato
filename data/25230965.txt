It&#x27;s not just about being physically attractive, but that a good photo conveys personality -- including the sense that you care enough about your profile that youre not just grabbing the first selfie off your phone.<p>That said... in my personal experience a good candid shot is more effective than a portrait. These portraits are all lovely but they don&#x27;t say much about you. One says &quot;I have a dog&quot;, and some distinguish &quot;I like cities&quot; from &quot;I like being in nature&quot;. But the bokeh removes one of my most important tools for looking at a dating profile -- knowing what to say for my opening line. Being able to look closely at the photo and say, &quot;You like X? I like X too!&quot; or &quot;Tell me about your trip to Y&quot; is infinitely better than &quot;Hi&quot; or &quot;You look nice.&quot;<p>It may be that a good portrait is the best front picture, and you supplement it with candids. A good portrait doesn&#x27;t make you look good so much as it gives a truer sense of what you really look like.')
