Finally got an email last year from a paint supplier (Gamblin), and a single 37ml tube is $75... with a limit of 2! I really hope at some point that these &#x27;rare earth&#x27; ingredients come down and it can be more readily available &#x2F; cheaper. I&#x27;d seriously paint my roof and my whole house with it to keep it cooler in the summer.')
