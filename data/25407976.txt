It must be structured, in a format that is commonly-used and machine-readable. The ICO&#x27;s guidance suggests that CSV, XML and JSON best meet this requirement.<p>Tracking is something else that GDPR helps with. Tracking of personal information via e.g. cookies require active consent. Silence is not consent.<p>&quot;sharing data with our partners&quot; requires a lawful basis when dealing with EU data subjects. This will normally be consent where data is sold to third-parties for e.g. marketing, so data subjects will be able to make an informed decision and opt out of this. Again, silence is not consent - and burying data sharing in an unreadable legal document is not informed consent.<p>&gt; the ability to point a product at an API endpoint of my choosing<p>The right to data portability includes this:<p>&gt; Individuals have the right to ask you to transmit their personal data directly to another controller without hindrance. If it is technically feasible, you should do this.<p>&gt; Actually let&#x27;s add more: The data generated by my use of my data in the product.<p>This is in scope for a Subject Access Request.<p>&gt;  Non-canned support responses that don&#x27;t ask for information I literally put in the ticket three weeks ago<p>This is difficult to solve with regulation but I think it&#x27;s an entirely reasonable thing to expect for your money. GDPR does not help here<p>Hopefully if there are multiple competitors in the space, customer support is something that providers can compete on.<p>&gt; Prominent indication of where (geographically and legally) data is stored and used<p>Privacy information <i>already</i> must contain a transparent list of data processors:<p>&gt; This includes anyone that processes the personal data on your behalf, as well all other organisations.<p>What we really need is for other countries to start taking data protection regulation seriously.')
