Like you say, if state1 x raw_material -&gt; state1 x state1 (i.e. we are able to take some raw material and clone state1) and also state2 x raw_material -&gt; state2 x state2, then linearity forces us to also have (state1 + state2) x raw_material -&gt; state1 x state1 + state2 x state2. This is not the same as (state1 + state2) x (state1 + state2) which is what we&#x27;d want in order to clone arbitrary states.')
