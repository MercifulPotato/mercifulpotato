It <i>is</i> amazing.<p>But then there&#x27;s that one game that doesn&#x27;t work, or works but with half the fps... for me, it was Death Stranding.  It runs at 60+ fps at 1440p on Windows, but runs at half that on Proton, with horrible artifacts&#x2F;frametime on Linux + Proton (even the community mod &quot;GloriousEggroll&quot; Proton version).<p>If CyberPunk is any good, I&#x27;m going to buy it and want the best experience... for now, that probably means Windows, unless by some miracle it works on Proton with no issues.')
