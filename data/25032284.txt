If someone is being an ass or cheating online, maybe that&#x27;s grounds for multiplayer banning, like with valve, but not for a complete shutoff.  Watching youtube videos or playing beat saber by yourself doesn&#x27;t let your toxicity spread to others.  Same with potential payment fraud even, just don&#x27;t let them buy online anymore.<p>It should also be up to the developers of apps.  Some may not care (ex: beat saber), or someone just want an ability to ban from their app specifically for bad behavior in their app, or have cool off periods instead of perma bans or whatever else.')
