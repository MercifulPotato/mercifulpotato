What machine learning engineer writes that kind of code anymore?<p>I can write it, yes I can fumble (a lot) and figure out how to optimize it, but in reality these are the type of algorithms that you <i>almost always</i> use some library that someone has already written for you for that kind of stuff. They spend the entire hour nitpicking at your implementation of NMS, base their entire impression of you on that implementation of NMS, and never in your entire interview ask you anything about, say, what the state-of-the-art object detectors are, what their breakthroughs are, how their networks are roughly structured, what you might think about doing to improve on them, what you could do if you only had limited annotation data, and other real machine learning questions.')
