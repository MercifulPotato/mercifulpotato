Item(by='AnonHP', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604202422, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24954772, text='&gt; For context, when NodeBB faced this possibility, we simply contacted every single contributor and asked nicely if they&#x27;d assign over their ownership of their contribution to us (note the use of the word &quot;assign&quot;, not &quot;license&quot;, a license is revocable, an assignment is not).<p>1. Could you expand on how you asked the contributors and what reasons (and justifications) you gave them for it?<p>2. Didn’t they feel like their work was being “stolen” (sorry for using such an extreme word) for proprietary use?')
