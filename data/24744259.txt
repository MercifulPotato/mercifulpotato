Before climbing back into simple elegance and understandability as their self-confidence and assurance in the language gradually subsumes the need to be ‘clever’ and gnostic in their coding.<p>I’m amused the author chose Shakespeare as an example of ‘difficult’ writing. Shakespeare is eminently readable at all levels: his skill was precisely that his compelling stories can be read for their exciting narrative by anyone, and equally can be mined for deeper meaning by those that are interested in unraveling his layers of metaphor and symbolism.')
