I can buy a Power Wheels EV for $400.<p>Making a good EV is hard. The set of technologies required is still unknown -- bear with me for a little bit.<p>In the early days of the PC; anyone competent could make a perfectly competitive computer in their own garage in a few months, buying chips, etching PCBs, and coding up a basic operating system. Wozniak did that, as did a few others. It seemed like it&#x27;d be simple forever, but it wasn&#x27;t. Today, the tech tree to make something like a MacBook is long, wide, and extensive. There&#x27;s a massive engineering team for the mechanical design alone, let alone the OS or the CPU. I can still make a computer, but it won&#x27;t be competitive.<p>Same thing happened with airplanes; shortly after the Wright Brothers, all sorts of amateurs made basic planes on their farms. It&#x27;s still possible to do that, but you won&#x27;t be competitive with an Airbus jetliner.<p>Early radios were a few vacuum tubes. Compare that to making a modern cell phone.<p>Part of the reason ICE vehicles are complex are the same process. The first mass-produced ICE vehicle, the Benz Patent-Motorwagen, was pretty simple. It cost under $5000 in today&#x27;s dollars ($150 at the time), and looked like a glorified tricycle with an engine.<p>If you throw engineers at tech, it goes up in sophistication. People figure out how to do things better. Anyone can make an EV. I&#x27;m confident, though, that we&#x27;ll see the same progression as we did in every other fields. If Tesla has enough of a head start making things cheaper and better -- and they seem to -- it&#x27;s unlikely the established players will be able to compete.')
