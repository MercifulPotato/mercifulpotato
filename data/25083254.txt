I have to wonder, why did IBM sell its laptop and PC businesses to them, later its server business as well? Lenovo got not only the brand, but also advanced production lines, technology, engineering and sales teams. What did IBM get? A few billion bucks, and 18.5% share of Lenovo,  which they&#x27;ve largely sold off.<p>Maybe IBM should have invested that money into fixing what was wrong with their profitability and management model. Hire Lenovo to manage the product lines or do a joint venture like GM-Toyota.<p>It&#x27;s sad to see a once great company just give up the fight.')
