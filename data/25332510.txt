That’s where the real speed comes from: ever tried to backspace a joint you built wrong?<p>That can take <i>days</i>.<p>I would say that much the same is true of software - it’s more important to be purposeful and accurate than fast, because re-doing work adds a lot of cost.<p>If you turn in work 1.33 times as fast, but have to do it twice... you actually work 0.66 as fast.')
