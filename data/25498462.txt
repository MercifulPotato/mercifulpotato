During that time I accumulated a significant number of stock options which could potentially make me a millionaire.<p>I left the company because my salary was incredibly low relative other companies in the same area.<p>I have left and I have no possibility of exercising the options. I technically could but that would mean ~50% of my net worth in a single risky investiment.<p>So yeah, I now price stock options at zero.')
