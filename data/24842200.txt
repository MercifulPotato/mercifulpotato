The only SIMD programming I&#x27;ve seen is where the programmer would carefully call the cpu-brand based instructions and painstakingly manage the memory register making sure the numbers to be added, multiplied etc. is evenly divided then given to the SIMD ALUs.<p>Sounds like what you are saying that fork join model translates easely by the compiler to these SIMD instructions?<p>Some compilers can also vectorize plain loops, but you would advocate for fork join?')
