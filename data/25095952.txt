I can&#x27;t think of other ethical issues where you wouldn&#x27;t be looked down for going against your firmly held beliefs.<p>&quot;Mostly plant-based diet&quot; sounds like a better term if you&#x27;re less concerned about the animal suffering aspect. Vegan would also include not wearing leather for example so it might be a case of you not using the right word.')
