I went on vacation with a girl I was dating one summer, and her parents brought their Alexa with them. Her dad thought it was so cool, and he loved to show me by saying &quot;alexa, play &lt;music&gt;&quot; three times until he got frustrated enough to just do it with his phone. Then, he&#x27;d say &quot;hey alexa, you&#x27;re a b*tch,&quot; and laugh when it responded by telling him that was rude.<p>Why would anyone pay money for that???')
