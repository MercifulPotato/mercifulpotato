This is due to city zoning ordinances, not inflation.<p>Similarly house prices exploded in major metros like SF because of artificial supply constraints. The city won&#x27;t allow new building -&gt; refuses to allow smaller units -&gt; prices go up. Again, not inflation.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fee.org&#x2F;articles&#x2F;new-homes-today-have-twice-the-square-feet-per-person-as-in-1973&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fee.org&#x2F;articles&#x2F;new-homes-today-have-twice-the-squa...</a>')
