In this case, the problem is how to improve privacy without advertising revenue dropping off a cliff. And it&#x27;s not like the solution is staring you in the face -- it takes iteration and testing for it to be &quot;found&quot;.<p>So I don&#x27;t think Google is being disingenuous here. Nothing is being implied as a somehow natural phenomenon. Business in general is about &quot;finding&quot; satisfactory solutions to problems day in and day out. &quot;Find&quot; and &quot;develop&quot; are essentially synonymous and interchangeable here.')
