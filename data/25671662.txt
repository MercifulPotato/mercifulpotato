It&#x27;s still extremely important when assessing an anomaly. If you can say &quot;okay this is a known-good config that gets me the numbers from the paper&quot;, it&#x27;s an enormous help in uncovering what leads to issues.<p>If you can&#x27;t even get those numbers, then you can suspect any number of things. Maybe you&#x27;re not using the right data, maybe there was a typo, maybe someone fraudulently manually tweaked the numbers, maybe you forgot to do a step in the processing chain etc etc. There&#x27;s no way to know what&#x27;s going on if you can&#x27;t even be sure how the original numbers were created.')
