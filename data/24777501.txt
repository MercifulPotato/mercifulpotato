I was sympathetic to this until I saw the US system in practice.<p>Waiting for hours in line to vote is exactly why mandatory voting is better: optional voting encourages voter suppression. If you think one party doesn&#x27;t make it harder to vote in areas where they have a disadvantage you&#x27;re crazy.<p>Also, voting needs to be moved to the weekend. This makes finding venues easy: you use schools. This is what we do in Australia.<p>In Australia voting typically took me 5 minutes at most.')
