The small tanks have a lot of evaporation as well so every week I add 2-4 litres of fresh water to them, so additional water changes are not really needed. If you have a large number of healthy plants in the aquarium and enough filter surface there&#x27;s usually no problem with nitrate&#x2F;nitrite buildup. I know people that run their aquariums for decades without a water change (replacing evaporated water of course), so it&#x27;s definitely possible. You can&#x27;t agressively use fertilizer though in that case. Most aquascapers use &quot;estimative index&quot; fertilization method where they usually strongly overdose fertilizer to ensure no plant has any nutrient deficiencies, this then makes regular water changes necessary as inevitably there will be a buildup of organics or nutrients otherwise. Personally I found that with most plants you don&#x27;t need to do that.<p>In most of my aquariums I also don&#x27;t use organic soil and instead put a combination of volcanic (anorganic) rock and gravel. Works quite well for most plants and if you have enough fish in the aquarium they will produce almost all necessary organics for your plants to thrive.')
