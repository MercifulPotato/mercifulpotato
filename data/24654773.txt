Should you read Dante in his original medieval Italian or in a modern English translation? Yes. But if you want to understand and make strong arguments about Dante, you&#x27;ll probably have to dig out the Italian.<p>Or, alternatively, back in the day there were these shows called &quot;situation comedies&quot; or sitcoms. One of them was &quot;Three&#x27;s Company.&quot; Many of the stories of the episodes of Three&#x27;s Company were taken more or less directly from Shakespeare&#x27;s comedies.
