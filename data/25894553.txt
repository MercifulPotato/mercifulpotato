Yeah, that&#x27;s definitely a travesty of policing.<p>Meanwhile the Metropolitan Police Service are cracking down hard on psychological abusers who have the audacity - the. god. damn. <i>AUDACITY</i>! - to call a transgender person by the wrong pronoun. God bless those hardworking Xes and Xirs for toppling the the true criminal empires.<p>EDIT: Since the poster deleted his reply, I&#x27;m gonna leave this here for him:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.independent.co.uk&#x2F;news&#x2F;uk&#x2F;arrests-offensive-facebook-and-twitter-posts-soar-london-a7064246.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.independent.co.uk&#x2F;news&#x2F;uk&#x2F;arrests-offensive-face...</a><p>&quot;The Communications Act 2003 defines illegal communication as “using public electronic communications network in order to cause annoyance, inconvenience or needless anxiety”. Breaking the law carries a six-month prison term or fine of up to £5,000.&quot;<p>Annoyance. Inconvenience. Or needless anxiety.<p>Instead of just telling <i>adults</i> to block someone.<p>I don&#x27;t know how anyone in their right mind could possibly say the United Kingdom is not devolving into a nanny state when that kind of language is used <i>in their laws</i>.')
