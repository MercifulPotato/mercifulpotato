I had a fat roommate who measured out the raw almonds he ate because they were calorie dense the same day he’d eat two whole pizzas for dinner.<p>Meanwhile, almonds and bananas aren’t the things making people fat. Looking at my own fat friends, some tasty fruit is the only fiber they even get.<p>And vegetables aren’t even on the menu of most fat people I’ve lived with. Don’t discourage the only healthy habits people do have.<p>Look at the the actual diet of an obese &#x2F; fatty liver &#x2F; type2 person and you’ll see how silly this advice is. It ain’t the fruit.')
