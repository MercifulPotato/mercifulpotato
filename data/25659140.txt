A few years from now VSCode might still reign supreme... or it might not. If you&#x27;re fine jumping to the next winner every few years, great. If you&#x27;d rather just invest in one editor platform and stick with it for a couple of decades, and know you can rely on it to stick around and be supported that long... well, you might want to take a look at emacs.')
