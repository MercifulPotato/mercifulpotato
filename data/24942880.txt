I hate having &#x27;TODO&#x27; lists for stuff like this, I like keeping ideas&#x2F;notes. Maybe it&#x27;s just a difference in the naming convention.<p>Another similar example - I no longer keep a &#x27;reading list&#x27; or a &#x27;someday maybe&#x27; list, I just have a series of bookmarks and notes that&#x27;s searchable if I need to reference them for something in the future.<p>Either it&#x27;s important enough to do now, or it&#x27;s important enough to forget until it&#x27;s important enough to do now.')
