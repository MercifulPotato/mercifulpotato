If users want to they can use something like filestash (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.filestash.app&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.filestash.app&#x2F;</a>) that gives a drive-like access to storage placel that respect standards, such as SFTP. It&#x27;s very easy to install on a cheap server and bridge to rsync.net without storing any secrets on that server')
