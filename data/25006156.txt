Always has been. Net worth is not a proxy for ability.<p>[edit] Don&#x27;t get me wrong I&#x27;m not saying billionaires are idiots. I&#x27;m just saying that having a fat stack is not in and of itself a proxy for aptitude. Judge that on the person instead. Just judging them on their bank balance is an unnecessary appeal to authority that hasn&#x27;t historically held.')
