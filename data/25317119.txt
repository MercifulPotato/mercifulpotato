Epub is just html in a wrapper file. I don&#x27;t know what a supper node is. Is it anything like a breakfast node or dinner node? Seems like it would be quite messy to mix food with ink.<p>Writing free stuff works for a <i>few</i> people. Most people can&#x27;t afford it. This means we&#x27;d end up with significantly fewer written works, and almost of what remained would be the highly-marketed James Patterson-type formulaic crap that sells well. In fact...James Patterson <i>is</i> the personification of your aggregation formula. He doesn&#x27;t even write his own books anymore (and hasn&#x27;t for almost a decade); he looks at trends in reader data and pays <i>other</i> writers to ghost-write his novels for him.<p>Middlemen exist because they provide valuable services: editing&#x2F;proofreading, printing, distribution, and marketing. And in book publishing, they provide one of the most valuable services of all: <i>discovery</i> based on an author&#x27;s talent, not their personal marketing abilities.')
