That&#x27;s extremely obnoxious behavior, even though you&#x27;re likely right on the low risks of transmission in sparse outdoor settings.&quot;</i><p>Wait wait wait...why should everyone be required to cater to the most paranoid people in the world, or be considered <i>&quot;obnoxious&quot;</i>? Where does this end? If I walk down the street, and someone twenty feet away from me scowls at me because I&#x27;m not wearing a mask, that&#x27;s objectively <i>their</i> problem, not mine.<p>If you&#x27;re so scared that you can&#x27;t stand the idea of someone else being outside without obeying <i>your rules</i>, then perhaps you should reconsider being outside in the first place.')
