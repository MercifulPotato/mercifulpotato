Our work for the first time takes into account soft tissue as well as bone anatomy, integrating virtual modeling of musculus opponens pollicis and its interaction with three-dimensional bone shape form. Results indicate that a fundamental aspect of efficient thumb opposition appeared approximately 2 million years ago, possibly associated with our own genus Homo, and did not characterize Australopithecus, the earliest proposed stone tool maker. This was true also of the late Australopithecus species, Australopithecus sediba, previously found to exhibit human-like thumb proportions. In contrast, later Homo species, including the small-brained Homo naledi, show high levels of thumb opposition dexterity, highlighting the increasing importance of cultural processes and manual dexterity in later human evolution.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cell.com&#x2F;current-biology&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;S0960-9822(20)31893-5.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cell.com&#x2F;current-biology&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;S0960-9822(20)31893...</a>')
