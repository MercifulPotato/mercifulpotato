If you have objects that escape downwards (so X calls Y, y creates some item i, i gets returned to X) then you can&#x27;t have a stack. i may be overwritten at the next call of anything else, as the stack grows over it.<p>I guess they do escape analysis and where items are provably local, stack allocate them. If not, plonk them on the heap.<p>A call frame is an object like any other, so they go on the heap. This allows you to create closures.')
