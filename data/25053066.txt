And sure the quality arguably falls to below 480p in very low light conditions, but that&#x27;s not an issue in any normal well-lit office, coffee shop, or kitchen or living room.<p>I would assume Apple is making the right call here that a higher-resolution camera isn&#x27;t worth additional thickness.')
