You can&#x27;t verify everyone&#x27;s software environment and verify that the DR plans actually work. Also some cases don&#x27;t care about data loss - there are areas where you can repave everything and ignore the incident happened.<p>Where it&#x27;s actually required, we already have checks like PCI-DSS, data retention laws, government policies, etc. and you&#x27;ll be audited. But again - this is very selective to make it realistic. Can you imagine there&#x27;s a government entity which can come to your independent company at any point and say &quot;show us your recent backups, how you restore it, and validate it&#x27;s complete&quot;? There&#x27;s no way anyone would agree to this, or fund it.<p>What we know is that backups are the lowest barrier and if you don&#x27;t have them for data you&#x27;re prepared to pay for, you are pretty much sponsoring the ransomware business.')
