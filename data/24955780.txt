Item(by='LockAndLol', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604184016, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24952892, text='&gt; HR departments say they can&#x27;t do anything because caste is not a protected category<p>The whole idea of &quot;protected categories&quot; just sounds wrong to me. \nThe current system makes it seem like it&#x27;s always OK to discriminate, but only these reasons are  not OK. It sets the default to &quot;we&#x27;re all considered unequal before the law except under these circumstances where we are considered to be equal&quot;.<p>That&#x27;s working with a blacklist in world where the number of reasons for discrimination is infinite. It would make much more sense IMO to use a whitelist instead: you may only legally discriminate in these cases otherwise it&#x27;s illegal = &quot;we&#x27;re all considered equal except in these cases where we have to be allowed to differentiate&quot;.<p>Issues like the current one would be prosecutable without adding another protected category.')
