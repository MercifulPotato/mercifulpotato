During that time, a lot have been open-source contributions.<p>It&#x27;s understandable that technology won&#x27;t solve everything, but it helps to get us to the point of solving it or helping to mitigate the issue sooner (for example, track and trace products)<p>I&#x27;ve noticed that especially in the UK, there isn&#x27;t exactly a huge amount of outreach for entrepreneurs, developers or scientists to contribute some hours of their time to help solve the problems at hand.<p>Are there any countries&#x2F;cities who are doing this already? Or are there any projects related to COVID where normal folk in tech (not in the major companies) can contribute some of their time easily?')
