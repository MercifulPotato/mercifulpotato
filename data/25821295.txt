For example Germany have zero benefits for letting Google, Amazon, Facebook and co. to drain profit and suffocate local competition while not paying any taxes or creating any meaningful jobs here.<p>I wish Germany, France and the rest of EU would just push for more regulations and taxation of foreign digital companies, even if that would mean having a Great EU firewall.<p>Remember, even the USA would not be there where it is now if they agreed to the free trade agreement with the UK back in the time after gaining the independence. They would be just a source of cheep beef and wheat for UK overlords.')
