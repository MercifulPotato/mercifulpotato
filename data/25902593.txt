It&#x27;s a lot easier to sell expensive software. The lower your set the price the more &quot;cheap&quot; customers you will have, which results in more support tickets, maintenance, marketing needed, etc. The customers who want lower prices are also those who would be more critical of your product, as the price they paid for it means more to them compared to someone who doesn&#x27;t mind spending $50&#x2F;mo for a basic service.<p>I am still trying to find a way to accommodate for both enterprise customers and low-budget customers. I tried doing this using some simple licensing terms (eg. get this if you are a solo dev, get this if you are large business), but people will just buy the cheapest option that has the features they want. This makes it hard to offer the same features at different prices and might lead to either downgrading the basic product or adding some buzzword features for the enterprise product.')
