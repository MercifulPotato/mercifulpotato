There&#x27;s a few options on Matrix.org[0]: Nio[1] seems very nice but it&#x27;s iOS only and still alpha, but I&#x27;ve been using FluffyChat[2] and I&#x27;ve found it good sofar. Much much nicer than Element at least.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;matrix.org&#x2F;clients&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;matrix.org&#x2F;clients&#x2F;</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nio.chat&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nio.chat&#x2F;</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fluffychat.im&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fluffychat.im&#x2F;</a>')
