Truth is I&#x27;ve found no ecosystem more productive than .NET in all of my coding. The only problem with .NET is the sheer amount of haters and we fare very well even though.<p>You all screaming performance and techempower stats don&#x27;t even realise that C#(ASP.NET Core) is 6th placed on techempower&#x27;s list when you check the composition of all the various benchmarks.<p>All of these without sacrificing readability, compile times, verbosity etc.<p>Or do you want to talk about the agility of the framework, speedy bug fixes, endless innovations and all. Don&#x27;t even get me started on the tooling. It&#x27;s unmatched in all of programming. VS2019, VS Code, Rider, dotnet cli etc. Ever heard about Roslyn?<p>Drop your hatred and check out dotnet&#x27;s current state before jumping into conclusions.<p>C&#x27;mon, let&#x27;s be real. .NET is supreme in the streets of code.')
