Gate agents largely do not have the authority--or the inclination--to help with much past their own flights.  Anything you need done outside of that is usually handled at a customer service desk elsewhere in the airport, if such a desk is staffed by that airline.  Most low-cost carrier (LCC) airlines do not staff help desks in the airport.  And, in many circumstances, the gate agents wearing the uniform and logos of a LCC are contractors who hop from gate to gate, wrangling flights as they come and go.<p>An unexpected circumstance happening two days before Christmas in a busy airport on a LCC?  I would do the exact same as the author of the linked article and get my traveling party where we needed to be with a minimum of fuss and handle the rest later.')
