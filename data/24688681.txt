When on the phone everything I say is with the knowledge that someone (the receiver) is listening. In my home I make no such assumptions.<p><i>Assumptions</i>, maybe no. But i think people need to be better educated on when those assumptions are false. We put recording devices in our homes and are shocked when those recording devices turn out to be recording.<p>Ideally, the devices should be legally required to give you strong indicators to when it actually is recording. Be it your phone, speakers, w&#x2F;e. But still - we&#x27;ve got recording devices all around us. If we don&#x27;t acknowledge that then privacy is just for show.')
