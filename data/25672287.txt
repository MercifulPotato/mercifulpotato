And as they continue layering on the convenience of being a payments platform alongside Libra&#x2F;Diem, it becomes another WeChat, and eventually you may <i>require</i> it to do everyday purchases, company interactions, bookings, etc. This is especially true in emerging&#x2F;unbanked regions. Signal&#x2F;Telegram&#x2F;etc are focused on being messengers, while Whatsapp is part of a broader, increasingly indispensable platform and network, with social hooks. I worry the choice will be made for us as to whether we install it or not, since only a minority care about privacy.')
