They cannot perceive anything, nor can the be aware of anything; one second in time is exactly the same as a billion years to the dead. And you cannot do anything to the dead that would change that.<p>Barring the possibility of an afterlife, if nothing can affect the dead, and the dead are unaware of everything, what could possibly be the dead&#x27;s problem?<p>The living on the other hand? They would be the one that would perceive the dead&#x27;s absence, and mourn it. They are the ones that have to deal with the uncertainty of what death is. Or the questions of why someone would prefer death.<p>But there in lies the key point; someone has to perceive the death of a peer to mourn it. Let&#x27;s say for a moment that there is only one person in the universe and he dies. Who mourns for him? Like wise, if someone exists, and no one else is aware, who mourns for him after he dies? In either case, he cannot mourn for himself.<p>So really... is being dead a problem for the dead? Or is it more the concern of those still alive?')
