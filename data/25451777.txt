There&#x27;s enough legitimate interest in NAT traversal that big NAT deployments like CGNATs tend to cooperate<p>Traversing non-cooperative fully symmetric NATs, which randomize ports, is hard enough also for pwnat. Though in theory should be doable - you just need a lot of patience to brute force ports (there&#x27;s only 64k of them) until it finally clicks')
