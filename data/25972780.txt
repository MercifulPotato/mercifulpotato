Item(by='austhrow743', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612039198, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25971427, text='Can&#x27;t a tradition based society just use tradition to keep divorce painful and punish those that do it? Like the core aspect of a wedding is to bring everyone you know together so you can tell them all at the same time &quot;I promise to stick to this person&quot;. If you want that to have weight then just treat it like it has weight. Shame your friends in to staying married if they talk about considering divorce, and shun those that go through with it anyway.<p>I understand the concept of having different views of how serious of a commitment marriage should be, but I don&#x27;t understand why &quot;I want things to be this way&quot; automatically means &quot;the government should make things this way&quot;. They&#x27;re the scariest institution that exists because of the overwhelming power they wield. Hell, they&#x27;re largely defined by it. Bringing the government in to play for every little thing seems to me like buttering your bread with a scimitar.')
