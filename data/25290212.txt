Item(by='tpoacher', descendants=None, kids=[25292253, 25290240], score=None, time=1607011445, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25285576, text='This is a minor pet peeve of mine so apologies if I come across as rude, but the word &#x27;codes&#x27; is a linguistic error (particularly prominent in indian coders for some reason, but also common elsewhere).<p>The word &#x27;code&#x27; when applied to computer source code has no plural.<p>This is in contrast to other uses where it <i>does</i> have a plural, like in &quot;Nuclear Codes&quot;, or &quot;Codes of conduct&quot;. In this capacity, it refers to codes as a collection of &#x27;individual code items&#x27; (i.e. symbolic representations that map to practical functionality) that can be thought of as countable items in a bag.<p>However, when used to denote things like source code, or morse code, it is an uncountable singular noun. It is wrong to say &quot;I sent a message using Morse Codes&quot;. In this sense, &#x27;code&#x27; is similar to sugar, fruit, fish, etc. Note that sugar, fruit, and fish also have this distinction that the word has a plural form, but the plural is only used to denote &#x27;different varieties of&#x27;, as opposed to a large number of sugar molecules, a large number of otherwise identical fruit items in a basket, or a large number of individual fish of the same type.<p>Obviously you can&#x27;t change the website now just to correct a silly grammar mistake, since that would cost money, but ... arrrgh.<p>Other words often mistakenly used in the plural when they shouldn&#x27;t:\n - Advice: Let me give you some advice (not some advices)\n - Practice: You need more practice (not practices)\n - Exercise: You lack exercise (not exercises - &#x27;exercises&#x27; means a collection of individual exercise items, not an increased quantity of exercise)\n - Text: You need to add more text (not texts - &#x27;texts&#x27; means a number of text items, e.g. &quot;this appears in many texts&quot;)<p>etc.<p>&lt;&#x2F;rant&gt;')
