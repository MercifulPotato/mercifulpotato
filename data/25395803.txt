He wasn&#x27;t unpopular, he was the 2nd most popular candidate ever.<p>People like to undersell how well the democrats did in 2018 and in 2020. Georgia going blue, Arizona going blue, and the blue wall getting rebuilt...it&#x27;s pretty impressive. They kept the house, and may yet still win the senate.<p>The districts are already stacked against democrats as is. Republicans won&#x27;t gain much from redistricting.')
