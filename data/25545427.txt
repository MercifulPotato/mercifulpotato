Item(by='wildermuthn', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609008396, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25545373, text='I have a PyTorch model I want to run in the browser.<p>From what little I&#x27;ve been able to understand, there are a few different ways of handling this, but none are all that great: Onnx.js is somewhat stale and missing many PyTorch operators, Tensorflow.js works great but requires either porting to TF or doing multiple conversions (PT -&gt; Onnx -&gt; TF), and then there is TVM which sent me down this rabbit-hole of deep learning compilation. It seems possible to use TVM&#x27;s IR to compile PyTorch (along with many other frameworks) into Wasm or WebGPU. Haven&#x27;t tried yet, but this domain is fascinating!')
