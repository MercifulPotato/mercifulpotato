Item(by='bonoboTP', descendants=None, kids=[25455103], score=None, time=1608208045, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25454680, text='I think teaching anything to a <i>not self-selected group</i> is excruciatingly hard. It&#x27;s the same with foreign languages, math, biology etc.<p>An easy way out that schools use is to teach things that can be memorized like laundry lists. Name the 5 components of the &lt;thing&gt;. Name &lt;famous person&gt;&#x27;s 3 contributions and write a sentence to each. Specify the formula for &lt;physicist&gt;&#x27;s law.<p>As you say, if you try to teach a non-self-selected general population computing, you&#x27;ll see how nontrivial even the mental model of files and folders etc. can be. But these are people who successfully do complex jobs in their lives. Sometimes even some sort of STEM-related or technical&#x2F;engineering job, just not computer related, like a car mechanic. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s some sort of brain-compute-power&#x2F;intelligence issue. A car mechanic uses similar brain pathways to &quot;debug&quot; and repair a car, keeping logical dependencies in mind etc.<p>Perhaps it&#x27;s about the transition from physical to the entirely abstract&#x2F;symbolic world.<p>It may be about a mental defense against the low-status of nerds, as in &quot;I&#x27;m not like them (thank God, haha, I have a life), so I can&#x27;t do this...&quot;.<p>Again, forcing knowledge into someone&#x27;s brain is extremely difficult. They <i>need</i> to cooperate by their own will, otherwise you just get memorized lists that are forgotten after the test.<p>People learn languages by immersion when they want to interact with people around them, but when people are forced to live in a country they don&#x27;t like, they can go decades without properly learning the local language, despite going shopping etc. and living a normal life.<p>I know relatives that run to me with all sorts of IT tech support issues, pretending they just cannot solve it. But when it&#x27;s actually about something they really want done, like watching a movie or an episode of their favorite TV show, they are suddenly able to figure out all the details of torrenting.<p>Not that this is some novel insight, but <i>motivation is key</i>. If you have an actual goal in mind that you <i>really</i> want to achieve (like watching the next episode of a show), you will push through the discomfort and uncertainty of learning how to get there. If you want to learn a language because you love a culture, or you need it to talk to clients at work to get a promotion etc., you will learn much better.<p>Some charismatic teachers can create motivation where there was none. This sometimes ends up as &quot;learning to please the teacher&quot;, but sometimes a single teacher&#x27;s influence sets someone on a whole career course.<p>Learning basic coding (perhaps not necessarily becoming professional devs) should be possible for a large part of the general population <i>if they have direct use for it today</i> (&quot;I cannot do &lt;desired activity&gt; unless I figure this out&quot;) outside of made up tests and teacher-pleasing.')
