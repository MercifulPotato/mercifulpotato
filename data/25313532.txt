Item(by='twblalock', descendants=None, kids=[25313601], score=None, time=1607165704, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25313493, text='&gt; College used to be something where you could reasonably pay tuition with a decent summer job.<p>That was only true for a few decades in the late 20th century, due to massive state subsidies covered by taxpayers, many of whom did not get to go to college themselves.<p>I guarantee you that college will not get cheaper if the student loan money dries up. The only thing that will change, is that only rich kids will get to go to college.<p>Even public schools are building luxury student housing on campus. They aren&#x27;t going to cut back, because they will always have enough rich kids and foreign students to cover the cost of running the place. In-state students are not who pay the bills.<p>We don&#x27;t live in a socialist country. If we hope for a utopia we will only lock non-rich kids out of college. If you want normal people to be able to afford college, they need access to loans, which fortunately have flexible terms and, again, amount to about the cost of a new car. It&#x27;s hardly a dystopia. It&#x27;s a realistic accomodation to a capitalist society, and a college loan is one of the least burdensome loans those students will undertake in their lives.')
