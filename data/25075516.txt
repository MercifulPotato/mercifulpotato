It appears the the mixed control group means that the MICT was actually reducing the average exercise intensity from the norm. What a frickin&#x27; overachieving set of septuagenarians (reminds me of Mr. Awesome in Chuck)! I&#x27;d assume if there were more &quot;no&#x2F;low&quot; exercise group the MICT would appear much better. Tantalizing results though.')
