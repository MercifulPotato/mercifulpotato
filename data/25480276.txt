You can only give when it is healthy to do so.<p>Agreed. We all deserve the same fundamental measure of respect. It’s equally important to be kind to myself and to others. The two are the same thing in disguise.<p>It can take reflection to parse out each situation, but if a “helping” act of mine is actually damaging to me in a way I resent or would prefer to avoid, then am I really being kind to the other person? I’d argue that often I’m actually acting out of an unhealthy impulse of guilt, some sense of social-obligation, self-identity, etc, which is really just about myself.<p>Sometimes helping another person - even if they want said help - actually doesn’t help them at all, and that’s not really kindness in my opinion. It requires judgement.<p>True kindness includes more than the “soft and mushy” feelings a lot of us look on with suspicion. Authentic kindness and care can be hard as fuck because it means saying no or <i>not</i> helping someone when your natural impulse is to do so.<p>See: parenting, family members&#x2F;friends with addictions, letting go an employee who’s well-intentioned, breaking up with someone who’s nice, etc.<p>IMHO Buddhist thought is a great tool for thinking about this kind of stuff.')
