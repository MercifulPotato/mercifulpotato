The amount of Amps going into something is the amount of electrons moving into it (water in a pipe). Volts is how hard you&#x27;re pushing the electrons through a circuit (pressure in a pipe). Because of magic I don&#x27;t understand amps is ~constant while how much force is behind those electrons have is changeable (how wide you open your faucet).<p>Processor governors change the clock speed of the CPU (how many dishes you&#x27;re washing). Dynamic voltage control is changing how hard you&#x27;re pushing electrons through the CPU to let it stably operate at a given frequency (opening&#x2F;closing the faucet as your scrubbing your dishes).<p>By doing this we can lower the amount of Power (water) we use while getting the same amount of work done (dishes washed).')
