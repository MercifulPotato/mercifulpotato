Indeed, the language you had in mind may not actually exist. It’s easy to operate based only on examples, and think you know what your language is, when in fact there are cases you didn’t consider. Your parser will resolve the ambiguity (because it has to), but if the tool had told you about the ambiguity, you might have redesigned the language. The result is often that one of your users will discover the ambiguity instead, and then it may be too late.<p>As an example too well-known to actually occur, suppose you parse “if x then if y then x else z” with the else clause associated to the first if statement, because that’s just how you happened to write the parser. It’s not ambiguous, but your users won’t be happy when they find out the unambiguous rule.')
