The author is not giving their understanding of the legalities and merits of the case.<p>The article is written by a layman and includes a contextless quote from the judge which doesn&#x27;t appear relevant to the point you&#x27;re trying to make.<p>&gt; OP&#x27;s statement, &quot;Epic had to do this to be able to legally challenge Apple in court&quot; is worthless if they are not a lawyer and don&#x27;t have some reputable source.<p>Accusing someone of not being a lawyer is not a counterargument, it&#x27;s an ad hominem attack. If they&#x27;re right, they&#x27;re right. If they&#x27;re wrong, where&#x27;s your evidence?')
