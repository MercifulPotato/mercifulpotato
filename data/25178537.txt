You can use the generators to scaffold a bunch of stuff but those pages have no CSS and lack basic javascript like dynamically adding a row to a form.<p>I don&#x27;t think they need to go all the way to something like react.  But a souped up Turbolinks where you can also easily do partial rerendering of pages would be enormously helpful.<p>The barrier for entry into doing anything is still Rails + Bootstrap&#x2F;Tailwind + webpack&#x2F;yarn&#x2F;npm.  Which is a lot more than just whipping some stuff up in rails.')
