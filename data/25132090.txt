I do have my doubts. First, it&#x27;s been 20 years. What have we achieved in there for the good of the US? If not now, then how soon? Again, I don&#x27;t really know any in-depth details. On the surface, the longer it takes, the more it looks some people just don&#x27;t want to withdraw the troops. Second, almost all the allies of the US opposed that US stayed in Afghanistan or Iraq years ago. What has changed? The third, how do we know the allies were being unreasonable? The more we agree to them, them more they will praise us. Again, not saying they are being unreasonable. I&#x27;m just saying that I have doubts.')
