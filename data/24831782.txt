It usually means that you&#x27;ve received and understand factual information about the tradeoffs from hopefully neutral parties who are acting in your best interest and can weigh those considerations based on your own priorities and preferences. And that you can make the choice you make free of coercion, or otherwise it isn&#x27;t consent at all.<p>Signal&#x27;s software management practices make the system largely opaque even to experts, and what review does happen comes at a significant lag.  This is evidenced by the substantial number of times that signal has had to back-pedal on a change after substantial backlash. Even where it isn&#x27;t opaque, there is no consent: the software stops running if you don&#x27;t accept all changes, and seldom are changes introduced as optional features (default-on or otherwise).')
