The theory was men have to prove themselves more to successfully breed so genetics throws the dice a bit more with men, whereas women had to raise the children, and in groups, and so a bit of deviation is probably less helpful. I&#x27;ve tried to find it a few times but haven&#x27;t been able to, maybe its debunked by now, maybe someone here knows it.')
