When you reset your password once, probability is high to reset it many times. It is often because you don’t remember it, and the new one isn’t fixated in your memory. Or because I’ve changed devices, but my computer kept my old password, so I reset it too, and back and forth on each device until I have time to bring the two devices together and type in the same password. Basically password resets happen rarely, except when they happen, they happen in a salve.<p>That is the exact opposite scenario of when London hired statisticians during the Battle of England because they were surprised how all German bombs fell on specific buildings, and were wondering why Germans would target those, only to discover that randomness meant bombs would randomly fall in clusters for no reason at all.')
