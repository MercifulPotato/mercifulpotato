You’re basically giving the people who are the most likely to not care one bit about the license an “out” where they don’t have to respect it anymore. If you claim your project is GPL but I’m using an device with some derivative of that project’s code in it but I can’t get the source, then I’m not getting the benefits of it being GPL.<p>Really, I think the title is the best explanation of this strategy: you want companies to pay you; you don’t really do this if you care about the freedoms that GPL is meant to preserve. In this case the only purpose of using the GPL is that it scares big companies into paying you and lets individual projects use it for free.')
