You still have to pay part of most costs in Australia, looking at my budget that&#x27;s come out to about another ~1% of my income in the past year.<p>So I pay 5% of my salary for health services. It&#x27;s pretty much inline with other costs like food and utilities. Doubling it to 10% would be doable, but it would suck.<p>It seems that the US system doubles the cost and the extra money serves as the very healthy profit margin of their private health industry. Keep in mind Australia manages to sustain a private health sector off that 5%, this isn&#x27;t abolishing private health by any means.<p>A proper government health system could probably be even cheaper than the 5% I pay because the US has much better economies of scale. Not to mention the benefit of untying it from employment.<p>I&#x27;m not really making a point here, your comment just inspired me to compare the numbers and it sure is grim...')
