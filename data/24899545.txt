Each successive major shift in American politics has been a shift towards the left in some way (more egalitarian&#x2F;equalizing policies, more erosion of authoritative positions on social policies, etc).<p>Conquest&#x27;s Second Law is in effect!<p>At any one time, the &quot;center&quot; is just the point of acceptable shared discourse between the organizations that control the &#x27;poles&#x27; at the left and right extents of common discussion; anything past those poles is considered &quot;extreme&quot;.<p>For example, during our lifetimes, discussion of a topic like Gay Marriage has gone from being an extreme leftist social policy you couldn&#x27;t discuss with people in polite company, to being a hot topic of common debate that even Obama said he would not legalize, to becoming official policy, and then even being accepted by the Republican Party as simply the law of the land and not a subject for discussion any more, pushing the topic as far to the right now as it was to the left 30 years ago. (I hold no judgement on the topic here, merely using it as an example for how the window of what is socially acceptable can shift, and the &quot;center&quot; shifts with it.)')
