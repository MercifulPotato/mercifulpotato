The OS itself (and most of the stock apps) are calling home to Google constantly, depending on the phone manufacturer, it&#x27;s likely calling home to them all the time too.<p>You can use something like Netguard to get some idea of what&#x27;s going off your device (if you&#x27;re rooted AFWall). It&#x27;s not perfect, but it&#x27;s essential software in my opinion. You can see somethings that of that get through Netguard on PiHole, if you have it setup on your network.<p>Removal of play services is one step, but pretty much every app on the phone from the stock keyboard (&quot;Gboard&quot;) to all pre-installed apps call home. In the newer versions of Android, Gboard and other apps will complain every few seconds if&#x2F;when Play Services is Disabled, as they don&#x27;t get to send the telemetry and usage data to Google.')
