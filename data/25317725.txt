Didn&#x27;t check the value of any accounts from about late March to September. Just kept putting my pennies in like always. Doing what they say has worked out pretty well so far; buy the dips, buy the peaks, buy whatever there happens to be the same time every month when I have some pennies to spare. The conventional wisdom on investing seems to work out so far. As you suggest, anyone just dumping it into index funds over the last decade has had a good ride.')
