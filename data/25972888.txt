My configs for DPI consist entirely of the following:<p>Xresources:<p><pre><code>    Xft.dpi:120\n    st.font: monospace:size=14\n</code></pre>\nxsession:<p><pre><code>    # haven&#x27;t had time to dig into this, some systems need\n    # DPI set twice\n    xSetDpi () { xrandr --dpi &quot;$1&quot;; xrandr --dpi &quot;$1&quot;; }\n</code></pre>\nThat function is called in a case statement for other machine-specific startup config, but it&#x27;s just a matter of <i>xSetDpi 144;</i>.<p>emacs.d&#x2F;init.el:<p><pre><code>    (set-face-attribute &#x27;default nil :height xxx)\n</code></pre>\nAgain this is per-host, but it&#x27;s a simple COND expression.<p>qutebrowser&#x2F;config.py:<p><pre><code>    # even with DPI set, I typically find web text too small\n    c.zoom.default = &#x27;175%&#x27;\n</code></pre>\nI promise you that this does not feel like any significant effort for me. It&#x27;s ~10 lines across a few config files, each of which I would be maintaining anyway - none of these configs were born for the express purpose of handling DPI or zoom or anything like that.<p>I value having a system that is configured exactly to my preferences. I recognize that having multiple configs is a turnoff for some. I can&#x27;t debate personal preference.<p>I have spent much more time trying to get something like Gnome to behave in a way I want than I have on all of my current config. XFCE is a pretty good experience for a DE and configuring scaling through system settings.<p>Machines:<p>1. 11&quot; HD, OpenBSD current<p>2. 12&quot; FHD, Artix Linux<p>3. 2x27&quot; WQHD, Artix Linux')
