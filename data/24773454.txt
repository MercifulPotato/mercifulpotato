(See, e.g., a LA Times series of articles on homeless in LA, in which reporters found that more than half of the homeless were from Texas and the Midwest.)<p>But the bigger problem is the ACLU and especially homeless advocacy groups, who have decided that being drunk, high, and shitting on the sidewalk are constitutional rights. It is literally impossible to get a homeless person the treatment they need for their mental illness or drug dependency because these groups have blocked all efforts by the city and county to administer such programs.')
