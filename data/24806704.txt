Item(by='kemitchell', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602897611, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24806294, text='I&#x27;m not quite sure what you mean by modularizing licenses, but I&#x27;d bet I&#x27;m probably for it.<p>All of the 1.0.0 PolyForm licenses are built from a common template. A lot of the language is completely common across forms. Diffs are fairly clean.<p>At the same time, we&#x27;re starting to hear that some of the mechanisms for that modularity, like the concept of &quot;permitted purpose&quot;, make reading individual licenses harder than could be. If&#x2F;when we get around to 2.0.0s, I expect we&#x27;ll probably individualize the terms more.<p>If you&#x27;re interested in modularity for building licenses that <i>haven&#x27;t</i> been implemented yet, I&#x27;ll plug a project of mine: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;berneout&#x2F;normally-open-closed" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;berneout&#x2F;normally-open-closed</a> These are essentially templates with blank spots for what you are or are not allowing.<p>The standardization-customization trade-off applies as usual. The point is to help people who actually need new license terms to focus on the terms that are actually new, rather than the legal rigging. Think &quot;license framework&quot; or &quot;license starter&quot;.<p>By the by, I&#x27;m affiliated with PolyForm, but don&#x27;t speak for the org as a whole here. Diversity of views and opinions is one of our strengths, though it has slowed us down from time to time.')
