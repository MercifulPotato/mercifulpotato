It&#x27;s not just about making the payment page secure. Indeed, many (most?) e-commerce websites already link off to a secure 3rd party payments page. The problem is that if the <i>originating</i> page gets compromised, it can replace the link off to the secure payment page with a link to a malicious page.<p>This is not theoretical. Many websites include a primary &quot;marketing&quot; site built in something like WordPress that links off to a more hardened &quot;app&quot; site for authenticated users with stronger security policies. If your marketing site gets compromised, malicious scripts can usually pretty easily replace links to your app site to a spoofed page.')
