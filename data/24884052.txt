We have a relationship with the receiver. They want to be sure nothing happens in transit from origin. We do not have a business relationship with the transporters (many of whom are independent).<p>The way the transporters know they&#x27;re getting a fair deal is precisely because we are <i>not</i> the source of truth â€” a database outside of our control is (a blockchain, in this case).<p>We&#x27;re not voting on what is true, we&#x27;re relying on the blockchain as an immutable representation of state. An append-only, distributed database that <i>we do not control</i>.<p>And please don&#x27;t downvote my comments out of a misunderstanding. That&#x27;s juvenile.')
