Modular, detachable storage located farther from the CPU is just gonna be slower, period.<p>Completely wrong. They&#x27;re using PCIe 4.0 for the onboard SSD, and PCIe 4.0 for the aftermarket SSD slot. There&#x27;s no performance penalty for going with removable storage here. We&#x27;re not talking about a high-speed DRAM interface where shorter traces without the insertion loss of a connector really does help reach higher clock speeds (other things being equal).')
