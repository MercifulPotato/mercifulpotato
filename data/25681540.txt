Item(by='tptacek', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610080363, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25677111, text='&quot;Whiteness&quot; kind of is a problematic term. Italians, Slavs, and Irish people don&#x27;t actually share all that much culture, do they? The term really is mostly about solidarity against Black people (Black being in fact a real culture, one we managed to create by kidnapping people and stripping them of their original cultures). The meaning of the term has even fluctuated over time, as different European ethnic groups were admitted.<p>Maybe it&#x27;s OK if that term gradually goes away?<p>There&#x27;s a difference between acknowledging that the term &quot;white&quot; is bad, and suggesting that Poles need to apologize and live lives of penance for what English slaveholders did in the 1800s.')
