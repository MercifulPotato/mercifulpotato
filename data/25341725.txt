Even the one guy who escalated all the things I&#x27;d roll my eyes about in private. At least he was making sure the escalation path worked.<p>Someone who has taken the time to report an issue is probably one of hundreds or thousands who had an issue and didn&#x27;t think it could be fixed and shrugged it off. We certainly can&#x27;t fix everything, but weird network shit like this can be fixed, and it&#x27;s worth escalating, because when you get it fixed, you can also figure out (hopefully) how to monitor for it, so it doesn&#x27;t happen again.<p>OTOH, I didn&#x27;t work for the phone company. We don&#x27;t care, we don&#x27;t have to, we&#x27;re the phone company. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vimeo.com&#x2F;355556831" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vimeo.com&#x2F;355556831</a> (sorry about the quality, I guess internet video was pretty lowdef in the 70s :P)')
