Check Lexy Alexander&#x27;s posts on this topic. Check also releases by CD Projekt Red and their DRM-free store GOG.<p>DRM is and will remain unethical, no matter how much its proponents will try to whitewash it with demagoguery, claiming it&#x27;s &quot;part of life now&quot;.<p>And for the reference, DRM doesn&#x27;t do anything good for creators.
