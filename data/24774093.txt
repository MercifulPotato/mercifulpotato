The issues - e.g. water consumption, worker rights, pollution related to production and logistics,... - associated with the production of both devices have already happened.<p>Reuse and recycling would only be a net positive if they replace the amount of new resources which are introduced into the entire production&#x2F;consumption cycle, and reduce pollution. That&#x27;s just not what is happening.<p>What happens to old electronic devices? Their value is gradually written off until they are deemed worthless junk. What&#x27;s fraction of originally manufactured and sold iPhone 4&#x27;s is still in active use in 2020? How many are sitting idle somewhere in a drawer? How many ended up in landfills? How many ended up as exported waste to developing countries?<p>A far more interesting question is this: Is the need to own the latest generation artificial? Is that need driven by the unveiling of latest new features and &#x27;improvements&#x27;? Or does the latest generation solve fundamental new consumer demands which emerged independently of the product?<p>As the poster poignantly asked: Does one really need to replace perfectly working devices just to do the exact same set of things every 18-24 months?')
