Item(by='packetlost', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606268040, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25204200, text='&gt; Typically speaking waiting periods are about reducing the risk of someone in a crisis purchasing a firearm and immediately using it for harm, usually either suicide or domestic violence. From a public health perspective there is very little increase in danger for someone buying a second gun, especially of the same type. All of the risk is for their first firearm.<p>This assumes that people don&#x27;t get rid of firearms or have changes in mental health. There doesn&#x27;t seem to be much of a justifiable reason to get a gun on short notice, so why not just apply it universally?<p>&gt; If you&#x27;re pro-firearm, there is very little difference between &quot;you have to register your gun&quot; and &quot;you have to register to buy a gun&quot;.<p>I&#x27;m pro firearm. I&#x27;m also vehemently pro education. If you need a license to prove you can safely operate a motor vehicle, you should need a license to purchase a semi-automatic weapon IMO.<p>I disagree, there <i>is</i> a functional difference between licensing gun owners vs registering guns. One tracks that an owner has gone through training and is authorized to purchase certain types of weapons. It doesn&#x27;t concretely determine whether they own, or have ever owned a firearm, just like a driver&#x27;s license does not determine that I own, or have ever owned a motor vehicle (just that I was able to borrow one for the duration of my practical exam). Further, mandatory registration of firearms would include things such as purchase date, <i></i>serial number<i></i>, <i></i>model<i></i>, location of purchase, etc., which is actually new information that could be potentially used to track and confiscate firearms under certain circumstances. I&#x27;d also like to point out that a background check gives more info about the purchase of firearms than a license would. It tells: the date of purchase, the rough type of firearm (handgun vs anything else, at least in WI), and the location of purchase.')
