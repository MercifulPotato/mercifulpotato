Apple is merely allowing users to OPT IN to tracking. It doesn&#x27;t matter if tracking is good for small business, because it&#x27;s the users that are being tracked. And if Facebook tracking is so great for the users, then clearly every user will opt in. So why is Facebook worried? The only reason Facebook could be worried is if they know tracking is bad for users.')
