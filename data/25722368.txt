I’m thinking of the feature “find a convenient time for everyone in the invite” in calendars. If your calendar is booked, does that mean people have to come to you out of band to negotiate a time?<p>Do you fill your calendar up day of (I.e. Monday morning you fill in around the meetings you have)?<p>I have on my calendar a 2 and a half hour chunk of time every day for training&#x2F;lunch.
