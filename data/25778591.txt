Infact, that was the big issue - Trump not moving to Parler or Gab while calling out Twitter.<p>This is a legitimate criticism even for people on the right about Trump. He knew these Tech Giants were questionable about uneven censorship, he’s been complaining about it for years.<p>So why in the hell wasn’t he posting to gab, parlor, bitchute, streamable, all the “alternatives” first, then  the tech giants on automatically on delay? Someone could have EASILY set that up for him.<p>The media for the past four years set around salivating for the next Trump tweet. They would’ve had to say Parler, Gab, whatever. They would’ve had to show the logos. They would’ve had to make it more about the words in the platform.<p>You could be a diehard Trump supporter, and realize that this is largely his fault for not being smart about how his message got out. I really think he thought he was above censorship, they wouldn’t DARE... I guess he was right, just until until he lost power.')
