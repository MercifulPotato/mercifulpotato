Would you consider those &quot;hard drugs&quot;?<p>And, back to water... accidental overdoses have occurred from drinking too much water.  Paradoxically, it tends to happen when people have heard that they should &quot;drink lots of water&quot; when they&#x27;re exerting themselves and getting hot, but they don&#x27;t realize that it&#x27;s important to get electrolytes with your water, or drinking too much water will disturb the electrolyte balance in your blood and you could die.<p>So even by your &quot;accidental overdose&quot; criteria, water would be a &quot;hard drug&quot;.<p>Also, if I can infer that you consider accidental overdoses to be undesirable, then you should be all for making drugs legal, as it&#x27;s their illegal status that leads to more accidental overdoses, because (as I said in another comment in this thread), when drugs are illegal their users don&#x27;t know the purity or dose they&#x27;re getting, while when drugs are legal their known dosage and purity leads to fewer accidental overdoses.')
