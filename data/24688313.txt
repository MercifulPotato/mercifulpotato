Item(by='cwhiz', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601909859, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24685019, text='&gt;Landlords extract the marginal difference between what people can buy and what people can rent. By participating in real estate markets, they leverage inequality of capital to overcharge renters beyond what the market would clear at without landlords.<p>This statement presumes that people, if given the choice, would always choose to buy.  Not so!  People rent for numerous reasons, many of which have nothing to do with their income or ability to buy.<p>&gt;Small-time embezzlers are just normal people too! Loan sharks, shady mechanics, and bail bondsmen are also extractive everymen.<p>Fairly absurd for you to compare people who own a second home or a duplex to embezzlers or loan sharks.  Give me a break.')
