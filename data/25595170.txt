Item(by='adkadskhj', descendants=None, kids=[25596251, 25595239], score=None, time=1609437746, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25594937, text='&gt; For example a really good friend of mine, was having a bunch of trouble in her home life but she couldn&#x27;t exactly afford to move out. So if you&#x27;re working with her and she&#x27;s rude to you, it has nothing to do with anything you did. 99% of how someone reacts to you is based upon what they&#x27;re going through. And plus getting upset over someone else doesn&#x27;t improve anything.<p>Not to over criticize your friend, but as an example: this pattern of behavior is what separates mindful, good people from jerks - imo. Everyone gets less controlled as they get stressed, but controlling how you express that is hugely important.<p>I&#x27;ve found that not only is it a thing in myself i need to be very vigilant about, but cutting out the people in my life who immediately lash out rather than behave constructively did a lot for me. It&#x27;s a good indicator to the person behind the facade that we all wear.<p>And again, nothing intended to your friend. Just an example. I also think we can still have &quot;those friends&quot; around if we think they have promise, or perhaps offer other benefits that outweigh the toxic affect their behavior can have. It&#x27;s just super mindful to be aware of toxic indicators, in ourselves and those around.')
