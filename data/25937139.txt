Item(by='m1ckey', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611799176, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25936694, text='&gt; You know as well as I do that if you gather 250k people in one spot someone is going to say something that makes you look bad. That room was golden and the people that run it are awesome. We blocked all bad words with a bot, which should be enough, but apparently if someone can say a bad word with weird unicode icelandic characters and someone can screenshot it you don&#x27;t get to hang out with your friends anymore. Discord did us dirty and *I am not impressed with them destroying our community* instead of stepping in with the wrench we may have needed to fix things, especially after we got over 1,000 server boosts. That is pretty unethical.<p>Fair point.')
