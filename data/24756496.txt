It&#x27;s very hard to generalize this type of property; really the only way is to use some type of normalized data, and that faces the problem which plagues all generalization, in that it doesn&#x27;t apply to large swaths of what is being generalized across. I think that Detroit is a violent place, and if you generalize across all of Michigan, you&#x27;ll see Detroit isn&#x27;t representational.<p>There are some places in the US, mostly in dense urban areas, where gang and organized criminal violence is a problem. These places need to have well armed violent response units. Cops should not be engaging every situation in these places as if they are all extreme violence situations, but in the case that there are people shooting at other people, call on those violent response units.')
