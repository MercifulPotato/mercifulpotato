I&#x27;m expecting it to make inroads in embedded stuff first (which, I mean, it already has, ex. WD using it for controllers) and eventually wind up as something where you can get a single board computer running on it pretty easily but as a second-class option for a long time. But we already are in a place where you can use Linux for most daily tasks if you want, you can run NT games via Proton, plenty of folks use Pis for side projects, etc. So if we get there with RISC-V in a few years I&#x27;ll be happy.')
