Harmonisation is fixed exchange rate thinking.<p>It would happen between Scotland and London, but not (to the same extent) between Poland and London.<p>Once you move something abroad the output becomes an import which ultimately has to be balanced by an export (or mercantilist tricks which is a whole other discussion - see China for details).<p>The correct response would be to unionise, rather than throw hands up in the air and continue to feel exploited.<p>There is a shortage of skilled staff.
