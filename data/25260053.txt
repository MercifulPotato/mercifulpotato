Mt. Gox was much bigger on a percentage basis than Coinbase is now when it went out of business. There are plenty of other exchanges and other ways for people to buy and sell bitcoin [1][2].<p>Bitcoin is a global network of tens of thousands of full nodes verifying the block chain and miners; there&#x27;s no feasible attack for this.<p>It&#x27;s been 12 years; I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s been attacked every which way possible in that time. The only way you can stop bitcoin is to shutdown the internet and that&#x27;s not going to happen.<p>One mantra in the Bitcoin community to live by: &quot;Not your keys, not your bitcoin.&quot;<p>Anyone with a substantial amount of bitcoin should transfer them from an exchange (or Cash App or PayPal) to a wallet they control, which isn&#x27;t that difficult. There are plenty of hardware wallets to enable this and <i>n of m</i> multisig solutions, so there isn&#x27;t a single point of failure.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;keys.casa" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;keys.casa</a>')
