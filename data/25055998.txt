My MacBook Air from ~2016 has 8GB of RAM.<p>My first PC which had 8GB of RAM was built in ~2010 if I remember correctly. My current machine has 32GB. In all honesty, 32GB is not even much, considering my motherboard can take 128GB (in the old days, if your motherboard could take max 8GB RAM, people would fill all the slots to capacity). Also, I have a Lenovo machine that I paid $200 for that has 8GB RAM.<p>WHY any power user would buy a MacBook is beyond me. They&#x27;ve become devices that only my mother would use, not to get work done.<p>Apple should&#x27;ve made the baseline 32GB with 128GB as max spec. It would&#x27;ve forced the whole industry to give us more RAM. So for the next two years RAM will still be stagnant, all other manufacturers that copies Apple will indeed keep shipping 8GB without blinking.')
