For the most part it&#x27;s pretty seamless, though there are occasionally backwards incompatible changes that pop up, but they&#x27;re called out in the release notes.<p>The biggest bites have been changing the database driver from pypgsql to psycopg2 and there was a binary column default wire format change at the 9&#x2F;9.1 upgrade. In another job, I&#x27;ve got essentially the same code running against 9.5 and 12, and I don&#x27;t notice the difference.<p>Performance improvements for a feature are almost always &#x27;free&#x27;, but obviously your code isn&#x27;t just going to start using CTEs if you haven&#x27;t been using them.')
