How much of each and the sequencing will depend largely on the learner and their objectives.<p>As is usually the case, &quot;conscious practice&quot; tends to be far better than &quot;rote (mindless) practice&quot;. When our kid got into the third year of piano, solo practice sessions became more of a struggle, frequently slipping into mindless repetition that was largely ineffective. That&#x27;s when we introduced some app-assisted practice sessions. The app approach was helpful because it provided consistent, granular, objective feedback on missed notes, timing, etc. Obviously no app can replicate all the dimensions of an experienced human coach but in the right context app-assisted practice can be a useful component of a blended learning strategy.')
