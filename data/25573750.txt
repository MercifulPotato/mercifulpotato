I certain don&#x27;t.<p>Having literally worked for one of apple&#x27;s suppliers who they bankrupted to bring the process in-house I have given this probably a lot more thought than you imagine.<p>They have been trying to vertically integrate all suppliers as much as humanly possible for reasons of control, margin and competitive advantage. This has been apple&#x27;s approach for many years and they have been utterly ruthless in doing so.<p>If they had the will to start to take the steps to actually divest from a literally genocidal state, they could do it. They simply do not care.<p>The part I do agree with you on is that they also know their customers do not care, and consumer awareness and action is a key part of pushing back on this kind of thing.<p>But please do not absolve apple of guilt by waving your hands and saying the supply chain is too interdependent and complicated.<p>If they can take steps to fuck over suppliers for profit and control, they can take steps to avoid slave labour.')
