I think the central issue really is a chicken-and-egg issue: the people who live around them put causal force on the Roma&#x27;s anti-social behavior, the Roma put it on their rejection &#x2F; exclusion by the people around them (or maybe they don&#x27;t?). Nobody wins until somebody backs down. Whoever backs down pays costs. If the surrounding people back down and start treating the Roma well, the Roma will take advantage of them for a while. If the Roma back down and start behaving the way the surrounding people want them to, they won&#x27;t get full credit for their efforts for a while.<p>Maybe there&#x27;s some way to broker a detente. Maybe that&#x27;s already happening.')
