I bet the majority of grown-ass men you see in an Apple Watch wouldn&#x27;t think twice about sporting a bead bracelet, the silly Live Strong plastic atrocity, or my favorite thing to ridicule, the little &quot;braided string bracelet&quot; that some influencer in Hollywood declared cool shortly after outlawing fanny packs. haha. Yes I say all this in jest, so please don&#x27;t be offended. Everything is going to be ok. :)')
