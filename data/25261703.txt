Holy hell, the students were something else as compared to other disciplines. They literally would not leave my SO&#x27;s office until they had argued up their grades on every assignment. My SO had to get security to escort them out, I am not joking. If they forgot, say, to multiply by 2 and then got the answer wrong, they still argued for full credit despite the very clear error.<p>There was no shame whatsoever. We figured the other Profs and TAs just didn&#x27;t want to deal with them, so the pre-meds learned to just wait out the graders to get their grades.<p>To be clear, this was maybe ~15% of the class, but still a lot of students. The Prof was no help with this either and just advised to pass them along. What a mess.<p>I understand that med school admissions is about as cut-throat as it gets, but my lord! It&#x27;s these pressure cookers that lead to MD burnout and mis-selection. After all those shameless hours in undergrad, then med school hell, you finally get to practice on people just looking for their preferred opioid.<p>Sorry to hear about the mess you are in, but you are right, it&#x27;s systemic.')
