It is done by the government, and has fared poorly in the US and Europe. The excuses are variations on &quot;the states don&#x27;t know how to set up a distribution system&quot;.<p>But we already have a distribution system for vaccines. Where did you get your last flu shot? The local drug store, a market based system. I see the government busy trying to reproduce overnight an efficient, working system that&#x27;s already there sitting idle. Of course they&#x27;ll fail.<p>I phoned my local drug store and asked if I can make an appointment for a covid vaccination. They replied they have no idea when or if they&#x27;d ever get any vaccination supply. Meanwhile, the state says they have a severe lack of people who can give vaccinations. (I know where they are hiding, they&#x27;re behind the counter at your local pharmacy.)<p>The solution is simple and stupidly obvious. Distribute vaccines to the zillion pharmacies, and pay them per vaccination in arm. They&#x27;re not going to waste any time vaccinating people.')
