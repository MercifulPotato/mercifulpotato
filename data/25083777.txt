Polyphonic note editing? Utterly transparent time stretching? Even just the ability to do huge amounts of serious DSP on generic CPUs has completely altered the entire landscape of music production (and the software that is used to do it).<p>The same is true of so many other fields.<p>What hasn&#x27;t changed much is the sort of software that is concerned with entering, editing and generating reports on data. The business&#x2F;consumer focused versions of this stuff have changed from being built with tools provided by Oracle in the 1980s to using various web stacks, but the basic model - data input, fetch some data and present in a GUI - remains unchanged. And perhaps that&#x27;s because the task hasn&#x27;t really changed much, and what we have is actually fairly good at doing it.<p>But switch over to other areas where data-driven applications are important - many scientific disciplines for example - and even there you will find huge expansions in what is possible, particularly in terms of visualization (or auralization) as a way to help humans explore data.<p>And FFS, Google freakin&#x27; maps! Yes, something like it existed 10 years ago, but have you actually used it while driving recently! It&#x27;s not bringing about world peace or solving hunger, but good grief, that is an absolute marvel of the composition of so many different areas of CS and software engineering into one incredibly user-friendly tool that I don&#x27;t even know what to say other than &quot;use the 2nd lane from the right and then turn left at the light&quot;.')
