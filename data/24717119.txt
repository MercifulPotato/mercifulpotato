Slashdot has (or maybe had, I haven&#x27;t checked in a while) a way of associating votes with tags. So upvotes could be tagged &quot;insightful&quot; or &quot;funny&quot; or whatever, and downvotes tagged &quot;flamebait&quot; or &quot;off-topic&quot; or others. Especially for downvotes I would often be interested in this kind of quick feedback.')
