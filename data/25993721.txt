It helps _a lot_. You will likely hate the feeling they give you for the first week (you will genuinely feel high even on 10mg Adderall XR), along with nightmares and night sweats but after a few weeks, you&#x27;ll suddenly be productive at a very normal level.<p>I wonder if I could have persisted long enough with Adderall to find a theraputic effect if it had been during lockdown.  10mg of Adderall made me unsafe to drive to work (I would suddenly get the subjective sense that my car was completely still and instead all the parked cars on the side of the road were hurtling at me at 25 mph).<p>My doctor actually started me on a higher dose (15 or 20mg maybe?) because I needed such a high dose of Ritalin to get a theraputic effect (and at that high of a dose it greatly impacted my sleep).  I took it exactly once and I didn&#x27;t feel tired for 36 hours and was completely non-productive.  For the first time I finally understood what all that clinical language describing the symptoms of a manic episode were all about.<p>Vyvanse did not feel nearly as bad subjectively, but my wife insisted I change meds because I was (in her words) &quot;an asshole&quot; while on it.<p>Finally settled in on 20-30mg of Focalin a day.  The year of titrating the doses of each medication was hell.  And then when we finally figured it out, my company switched insurers I had to change the pill sizes (not total quantity) to get it covered with the new insurance.<p>The one thing I&#x27;d like to add is that diet for me made a <i>huge</i> difference.  I might as well not be taking the meds if I have a carb-heavy breakfast.  Prior to taking the meds I had quit eating breakfast altogether because I felt like such crap around lunchtime if I ate breakfast.  Obviously taking stimulants on an empty stomach is not a great idea, and my psychiatrist helped me out to go for a breakfast that doesn&#x27;t provoke such a strong insulin response.')
