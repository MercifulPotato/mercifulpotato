Take &quot;alt&quot; attributes in HTML img tags for instance, or various metadata attached to buttons that use an icon instead of text (like a play button, or a X close button and similar things).<p>You can see an example next to this very comment actually: the up and downvote buttons won&#x27;t be accessible with OCR, but they have &quot;title&quot; attributes describing what they are.<p>I suppose that ideally you&#x27;d want both: use native accessibility data if available, fallback to OCR when there&#x27;s no alternative.')
