I don&#x27;t see why that couldn&#x27;t be coupled with &quot;no review required&quot;, so long as the list is relatively short.  But, yeah, likely will never happen.<p>Fortunately for me, I can re-do my extension to use the JS postMessage api which won&#x27;t require hardly any permissions, and thus, not much to review.')
