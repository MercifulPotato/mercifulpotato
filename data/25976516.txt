Item(by='jdashg', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612073431, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25975397, text='1440p at 27&quot; with no scaling is perfect for my desktop. I wish it were more popular, because it&#x27;s a great compromise between quality and performance for gaming.<p>The relatively common use of &quot;2k&quot; to mean 2560x1440 has always struck me as confusing though, since it&#x27;s not half as wide as 4k.\nWords mean whatever people agree they mean, but I feel like &quot;2k&quot; is too ambiguous.')
