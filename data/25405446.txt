Human trade is a natural phenomenon, and economics is the study of its structure and behavior. I don&#x27;t see why that couldn&#x27;t be a science.<p>Now if you mean to say that we&#x27;re far from understanding it properly, or that there&#x27;s little it has yet allowed us to apply for practical needs, maybe. But I&#x27;m not following the &quot;it&#x27;s not a science&quot; bit.<p>Edit: Oh, or you are criticizing that the current practice isn&#x27;t properly using the scientific method for it.')
