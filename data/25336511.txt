While I&#x27;m pointing out all the bugs, maintability issues, etc. on their commit, they&#x27;re busy writing a new commit full of the same types of issues. And on the flip size: because I self-review my code with the same attention, I rarely have any of those same sorts of issues in code that I make others review.<p>I&#x27;m lucky in that my company recognizes and appreciates the quality that provide with my work and encourage from others, but I&#x27;m not sure of how to actually address the imbalance. Many times I&#x27;ve thought of just asking engineers to put more effort into self-reviewing their code, but I always feel like it would just be too rude.')
