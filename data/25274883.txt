Co-founded startup around turn of the century, growth slow but upwards. Institutional investors come on-board, and maybe 5 years in was the opportunity to sell some founder stock to institutional investors. Because this is not my first rodeo, we knew that when there’s an opportunity to get some cash, if you don’t take it, the chance might not come again. Sold enough for a house (would be a deposit now...). A few years later, IPO gave the opportunity to cash out up to 25% of each founders individual holding at more or less IPO price, so I did. Which was lucky, as the company got hammered by the markets (couldn’t continue hockey stick growth), and eventually it got gobbled up by one of those funds that picks up  undervalued SaaS companies for a song, which was what I got for the remaining holding.<p>$1.5m is not enough for helicopter retirement, but it is enough to dig out of a hole when life takes unexpected turns, and you need to do things like buy a new house at 30 days notice without having to (or being able to) sell your old one.')
