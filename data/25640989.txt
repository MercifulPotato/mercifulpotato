So you can argue that it works perfectly the way it was designed to work. The official theory is that it somehow will reduce crime. That hasnâ€™t happened obviously. And yet the system continues. So obviously the real purpose of the US prison system is not to reduce crime. Other countries has for years shown how to effectively reduce crime without torturing people.')
