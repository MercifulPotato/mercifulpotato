Given that the US is both the largest economy and military power this feels like a moot point.<p>China&#x27;s growing influence and Russia&#x27;s influence on international politics clearly show that it&#x27;s not about absolute power but how you apply it. Europe is large enough and powerful enough that the US can&#x27;t invade it or cause massive economic damage without significantly hurting itself. Europe has massive leverage in negotiations and politics and diplomacy. It just fails to use it likely because it&#x27;s not unified enough to fully and quickly apply it.<p>Please stop blaming Europe&#x27;s diplomatic failures on external factors. All that does is ensure that they will continue to happen because you won&#x27;t blame the government that is actually at fault.')
