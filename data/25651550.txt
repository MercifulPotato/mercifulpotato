As people say regarding decision theory, &quot;the utility function is not up for grabs&quot;; people&#x27;s goals are what they are, and if it turns out that someone&#x27;s goal actually is more about personal service than good results, well, you can&#x27;t force them to change so let&#x27;s just facilitate them to get good results while still achieving their core goal, to get a win-win outcome.<p>It&#x27;s plausible that their goals might also be achieved just as well without actually productively helping someone - so you might want to nudge them away from that and towards more productive means; but these nudges won&#x27;t be effective without taking into account what their actual goals are and what types of &quot;service that actually does help&quot; are not valid options because they don&#x27;t satisfy the goals of the potential helper.')
