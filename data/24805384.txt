My general understanding was that it&#x27;s uncouth to devour or inhale your food at the table.<p>In that sense the nuance is not that this might be the last food you get for a while - but rather that having food is no big deal, don&#x27;t make it seem like this is the first meal you&#x27;ve had in forever.<p>Another rule (not the same but similar) is to finish each course at the same time as the host, not sooner nor later.')
