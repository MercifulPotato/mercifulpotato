Item(by='bird_monster', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609797718, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25638276, text='&gt; An internal team change is often a lot less stressful and less risky than going to a different company.<p>This statement really nails it. If you change teams and are still unhappy you can always quit. If you quit without having changed teams and then hate your new job, you might not be able to go back to your previous company (but new team). I think it&#x27;s general good practice to give another team a change before you leave the company if you&#x27;re on the fence. If you know it&#x27;s a company problem, bail, but if you think it could just be your team, give it a shot.<p>Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but I like to minimize the amount of decisions I make that I cannot undo.')
