I&#x27;ll admit that I&#x27;m naive about web and security (not my area). Are multiple password resets within a small time frame common? I would not expect this to be common, but user behavior has often defied my expectation. If it is uncommon I think you could create a correlation and get an estimate, if it is common then I completely agree that it would be lost in the noise.<p>And yeah I agree that this type of analysis wouldn&#x27;t help with dormant accounts and also does require them to log the user out on their phone (otherwise why issue another reset?). But both these could be captured. This is probably <i>way</i> too much analysis for such an attack and over engineering the issue, but hey that&#x27;s what we all do, right? haha')
