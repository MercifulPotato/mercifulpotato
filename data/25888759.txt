My situation before I went fully remote a few years ago was a pretty flexible policy where you could wfh 2 days a week. I think you could extend this to 3 days a week or maybe even just have a mandatory 2 days at the office.<p>The effect is you spend most of your time at home but still get to go into the office. Think everyone is in office T W TH or T W F or something. I miss that setup and have since returned to that job and I hope I can go back in this year.')
