Item(by='dangus', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603665387, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24889488, text='&gt; The golden age of personal computing in the 1980&#x27;s is long over.<p>When an article starts with a statement[1] like this I know I&#x27;m in for a whine-fest about how everything sucks now and we need to Make Computing Great Again.<p>What the author wants is a ThinkPad P Series or a Clevo clone. I don&#x27;t know why the author is making the assumption that a more modular, utility-focused laptop or portable device doesn&#x27;t exist. They absolutely exist. Just don&#x27;t be mad that it&#x27;s a niche and that other people <i>who just want an appliance</i> have different needs than you. Don&#x27;t be mad that other people in the world aren&#x27;t necessarily any more interested in computing than they are in fixing their car.<p>It&#x27;s also entirely inaccurate to say that the 1980s was a freedom-loving general purpose heaven. In reality, users still bought into ecosystems and proprietary technologies, perhaps even more-so than today.<p>For example, remember when you had to worry about what format your floppy disk was formatted in? Remember when the same productivity program on a different platform had different save formats? Remember when different platforms had different ports and physical connections for things as simple as a mouse? It&#x27;s not like Amigas and Commodores and Apple ][&#x27;s were just oozing interoperability with each other.')
