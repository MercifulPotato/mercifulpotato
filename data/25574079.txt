There&#x27;s an example here if you scroll down. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thecut.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;nurses-are-dealing-with-patients-who-think-covid-is-a-hoax.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thecut.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;nurses-are-dealing-with-patie...</a><p>But I&#x27;d also argue that such denials are on a spectrum, from people who don&#x27;t believe in the virus at all, to people who don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s dangerous, to people who think it&#x27;s only as bad as the flu, to people who don&#x27;t take wearing masks or other precautions seriously, and even people who believe their youth and existing good health will protect them from harm. This has been exacerbated by both the president and allied media putting out false and misleading information.<p>Countering those false narratives are exactly what good journalists do.<p>The journalists, as always, have to have the consent of the patients they are talking to. That&#x27;s always been the case. They aren&#x27;t hovering over anyone without consent, and suggesting otherwise takes agency away from people bravely telling their stories, or who consented to have their last moments documented, or whose family consented to their body being shown.<p>Showing the real effects of disease, violence and death are a powerful element of journalism.  Consider Emmet Till&#x27;s open casket funeral. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Emmett_Till" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Emmett_Till</a>\nConsider George Floyd&#x27;s last moments.<p>The issue I see is that, because someone entirely different from the filmed individual has a chart at the nurses station, the government has created a regulation claiming you also need their consent despite that not being shown&#x2F;viewed.<p>That seems like an attempt to obfuscate the truth under the guise of medical privacy, despite no harm being done to anyone.')
