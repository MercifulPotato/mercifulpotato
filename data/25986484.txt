She is slandered by ignorant press.<p>Isn&#x27;t failure to educate international press still a (big IMHO) failure?<p>Personally the result for me has been that she was once a kind of freedom hero, than became a kind of mass murderer and should have her Nobel prize revoked.<p>Then I read today that she&#x27;s been almost a hostage of the military for all this time and she&#x27;s getting some of my sympathy back again. However the trade she accepted to do feels bad and the signaling of being a hostage was totally missing.')
