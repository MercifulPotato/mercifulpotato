So for example if a tune is in the key of C major, people can have fun arguing about what pitch E should exactly be. But if the note is repeated in the melody but played with changing pitch then generally it will sound out of tune.<p>So something like a variance of pitch per note measured at the end.<p>In particular, something like Bach&#x27;s cello suites tend to highlight these sort of intonation issues.')
