Highly scalable systems usually come with more operational complexity, and steeper learning curves<p>I think you&#x27;re overestimating the cost factor of future-proofing an architecture for extreme scale (and 26K&#x2F;sec&#x2F;server isn&#x27;t actually that &#x27;extreme&#x27;). And instead of downvoting people who&#x27;ve walked that walk, perhaps people may realise this by engaging instead.<p>Also, I didn&#x27;t read any &#x27;arrogant dismissiveness&#x27; in the post.
