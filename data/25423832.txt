All of the states where there was pressure for the legislatures to appoint Trump electors rather than the Biden electors that won the vote in that state have already voted, and went to Biden.<p>It currently stands at 240 Biden, 232 Trump, with only California, Oregon, and Hawaii left to vote.<p>California has 55 votes, so Biden wins unless at least 26 California electors who are pledged to Biden are faithless electors (and that would be if all 7 Oregon electors and all 4 Hawaii electors are also faithless). That ain&#x27;t gonna happen.<p>California electors meet at 2 PM PST.')
