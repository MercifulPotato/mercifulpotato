I have seen plenty examples of negative reactions by him, but they were never in reaction to <i>helpful</i> PRs.<p>They were always in reaction to bad code, unhelpful behavior, etc.<p>In some cases, they were in reaction to people who were <i>genuinely trying</i> but failing to be helpful. In that case, the kind of blow-up that he became famous for is usually not helpful[0]. That doesn&#x27;t make him an awful maintainer, though, it just makes him a human being with large but finite amounts of patience.<p>[0] Though who knows -- perhaps there are cases where the blow-up was what finally got the point across to the person who thought they were being helpful but weren&#x27;t really. In that case, the blow-up was perhaps a crude tool, but got the job done. Difficulties arise largely due to cultural differences, keeping in mind that &quot;old-school kernel development&quot; is a culture in itself that deserves to be treated with some respect.')
