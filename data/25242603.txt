HTML loaded, but nothing else.<p>- A computer on shared hotel Wi-Fi with a packet loss rate of 70%.<p>- A browser with an addon that applies a dark theme to web pages by injecting a stylesheet<p>- A browser with default background&#x2F;foreground colors that aren&#x27;t white&#x2F;black<p>- Braille readers<p>- Screen readers<p>- E-readers and webpage-to-epub converters<p>- Browser reader-mode, or a host of 3rd-party reader-mode addons<p>- Bookmarking services with article extractors (e.g. Pocket)<p>- RSS readers<p>- Printouts<p>- Textual browsers: lynx, links, elinks, w3m<p>- An old computer in the public library, running Firefox 23<p>- A niche OS with a custom browser you&#x27;ve never heard of<p>- A browser that won&#x27;t exist until the year 2028<p>- A mobile app you&#x27;ve never heard of<p>- A link aggregator that displays previews of articles<p>- A custom script that converts HTML to markdown and saves the markdown file for offline reading.<p>Each of these is an edge case. Yet most users fit into a few edge cases. I have yet to meet a single person who isn&#x27;t often inconvenienced by being an edge case.<p>A simple site that uses HTML with some CSS properly automatically gets stellar cross-browser compatibility and accessibility. My site works well on everything from Firefox to lynx to screenreaders (I don&#x27;t have a braille reader to test, but I suspect it should work well on one), and I didn&#x27;t even have to try. If your train goes through a tunnel and only HTML loads, it&#x27;ll still look just fine; CSS is an optional progressive enhancement.<p>Every piece of tech you throw at a site makes some edge case fail. If there are multiple ways to deliver the features we need, we should choose the one that&#x27;s the simplest, to avoid excluding more edge cases. If your website is a blog with formatted text, there&#x27;s no reason to add JS and throw out all the edge cases that this could exclude.<p>TLDR: Don&#x27;t build a gingerbread house with construction equipment. Plenty of sites don&#x27;t need to use future tech.')
