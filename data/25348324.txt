I&#x27;ve been a happy Mapbox GL JS user for years, hosting my own tiles and not using their service at all.  I even had a few (very small) pull requests accepted into the project.  Hopefully the OSS community can maintain a fork of the 1.x codebase.<p>-edit-<p>The FAQ says developers can still use self hosted tiles, but also says that usage is now billed per map load, and &quot;a map load occurs whenever a Map object is initialized on a webpage. Each map load includes unlimited vector tiles, raster tiles, and terrain tiles for the length of the map session.&quot;.<p>To me that sound like while I can still use my own map tiles, it would still costs the same as if I used Mapbox hosted tiles.')
