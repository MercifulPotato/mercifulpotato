People in relationships tend to enjoy significantly higher life satisfaction than single folks. I don&#x27;t have the numbers in front of me, but I believe the gains are on par with an extra $20,000 in income. (Not to mention all the actual savings that go with consolidating two people into a single household.)<p>If premium dating boosts increase your chance of a relationship by even 5% per annum, then $100&#x2F;month probably is worth it.')
