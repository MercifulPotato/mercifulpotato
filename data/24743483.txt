That horrible and pervasive graphic, reinforced by veins looking blue through skin. Science education content fails both teachers and students, far worse than is often appreciated.  I&#x27;ve wondered if it might be pedagogically useful to tell students that, or not.<p>I wish I had a better friction talk or paper for you.  I don&#x27;t recall seeing that video, but the version of the talk I saw, I recall as benefiting from the audience discussion.  Sorry, it&#x27;s what I had at hand.  At some point, perhaps already, we&#x27;ll get a nice survey paper, which can then be repackaged for teachers and students.<p>Wikipedia seems to not do well with widespread misconceptions.  Perhaps if it had an additional layer of Backstory&#x2F;WritersNotebook, in addition to Article and Talk.  Or at least a similar convention on using Talk.  As it its, past talk gets buried, and people come along and tweak things to better match their misconceptions, or some buggy source, so correctness isn&#x27;t stable.<p>The google snippet of [1] looks hopeful... but isn&#x27;t available on sci-hub - perhaps email the author?  [2] is eh.  I didn&#x27;t quickly find nice researchy sources.  For soot details (eg, I remember it as C-C bonds, but maybe not), there&#x27;s ongoing work on using soot luminescence as a light source, which might well have good details buried somewhere, but I didn&#x27;t quickly find them.<p>If anyone finds anything nice, I too would be interested.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.osa-opn.org&#x2F;home&#x2F;articles&#x2F;volume_27&#x2F;june_2016&#x2F;departments&#x2F;why_are_candle_flames_yellow&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.osa-opn.org&#x2F;home&#x2F;articles&#x2F;volume_27&#x2F;june_2016&#x2F;de...</a>\n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.chemistryviews.org&#x2F;details&#x2F;ezine&#x2F;1393371&#x2F;Chemistry_of_the_Christmas_Candle__Part_2.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.chemistryviews.org&#x2F;details&#x2F;ezine&#x2F;1393371&#x2F;Chemist...</a>')
