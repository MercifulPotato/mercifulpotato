Many people do. Blanket stating that that is not an option is kind of weird. It&#x27;s a fine browser. It doesn&#x27;t have this problem. Chromium is also still a fine browser; and it supports extensions as mentioned before.<p>Seriously large caveat: YMMV.<p>I&#x27;m increasingly hitting weird bugs on sites with Firefox, some sufficiently complicated web &quot;apps&quot; just throw up &quot;Use Chrome&quot; overlays.<p>The situation is similar on Safari, although, oddly, not quite as bad.')
