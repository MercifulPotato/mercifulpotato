Nobody came through that knowing any more than they started with in regards to fixing computers.<p>Luckily, I already knew how to fix them.  I found the job to be a cake walk and quite liked helping people.  But I had to listen to people around me fumble through it.<p>It was frustrating at the time, but my favorite thing that happened was that I was admonished <i>twice</i> for having average call times that were too low.  To them, that&#x27;s a warning that someone is just getting people off the line without fixing their problems.<p>They monitored calls and they said I&#x27;d never received a complaint, but the system would keep flagging me for low call times so I had to artificially raise them.  They suggested that I have a conversation with the clients.<p>I didn&#x27;t, and I didn&#x27;t stay there much longer, but it was quite a crazy situation.  But I also felt much less pressure to handle calls quickly after that, too, which was nice.')
