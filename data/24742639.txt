You need to &quot;order&quot; it.<p>For some models you need to wait for months. So you don&#x27;t get to choose an exotic color, unless you agree to wait even more, like many months. I guess colors are chosen so people can suffer them. I like orange or yellow, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy green. So they have white, gray and black.')
