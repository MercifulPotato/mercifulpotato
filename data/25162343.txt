Some examples:<p>o Xbox Series X and PS5 consoles are have very limited availability from retailers at their MSRP of $500, and are instead being scalped on eBay for upwards of $850 to $1300.<p>o Thinkpad AMD Ryzen 4xxx T series laptops have ship dates of more than 5 weeks, yet have massive black friday discounts.<p>o Apple M1 laptops with 16GB of RAM have ship dates a month out, and are not being sold at a substantial premium.<p>Why are manufacturers not taking profits when demand is so clearly outstripping supply?  In the Xbox&#x2F;PS5 case, its clear that scalpers are taking profits.  If the natural price of a PS5 is $800, isn&#x27;t it better to just let me pay that via normal retail channels, and not have to deal with a potential scammer on Ebay?')
