Item(by='luckylion', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602412364, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24744804, text='&gt; But we expect 5 year olds to grow up to better.<p>But we shouldn&#x27;t where it&#x27;s important (implying that code is important). Don&#x27;t put the &quot;open door&quot; button next to the &quot;set building on fire&quot; button, just because all employees should know which button to press to open the door.<p>It reminds me of Pointing and Calling [1].
