A clarifying example:<p>I have a favourite brand of tea that I&#x27;ve been drinking for years. I have some disposable income, so even if the price of that tea went up 2x, I wouldn&#x27;t switch to a cheaper (but less tasty) alternative. But I know people who would, and I lived through period of financial distress during which I&#x27;d make such switch. The same applies to quite a lot of other goods I buy: from ketchup and mustard to soap and toilet paper.<p>The same also applies to the places I shop. I&#x27;m already buying most groceries at our local ALDI equivalent, but I could optimize that further - but I don&#x27;t, because I have disposable income, and I won&#x27;t - even if the prices go up - until it becomes noticeable enough on my balance sheet to justify the effort.<p>My hypothesis is the example above, but generalized over population: if an average person has $X of disposable income, the market suddenly loses the downward pressure from demand side to the tune of $X; the pressure resumes once the average person has no disposable income.<p>I haven&#x27;t made my mind up on this either, I&#x27;m just presenting what I currently believe to be a causal relationship. This is partially based on the experience in European countries (notably Poland and Germany), where double income is increasingly becoming a necessity as well, but we don&#x27;t have some of the commonly attributed contributory factors like student debt and high healthcare costs.')
