Intel&#x27;s failure to execute on mobile really opened the door for ARM to have tons of resources over a decade thrown into it&#x27;s development as a platform, and now the M1 is and extremely solid proof of concept that tentative forways into ARM on desktops&#x2F;laptops&#x2F;servers will absolutely warrant the shift in platforms. A few years for software ports and an extra 2 generations of chip improvements, and I think Intel&#x27;s failure to execute on it&#x27;s fab processes will just become a moot point. I have more confidence in AMD to pivot, and they have their GPU business as well. Intel may be relegated to aging obsolescence the same way HP and IBM did with their &quot;big iron&quot;.')
