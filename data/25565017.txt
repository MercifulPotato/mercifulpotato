The results are also highly dependent on how bald you are, the type of hair you have, and even the doctor who does it. If you accidentally pick a bad doctor your hair transplant can end up looking awful. It also doesn&#x27;t make your balding stop, so you may continue balding and need another hair transplant in the future. Hair transplants treats the symptom of hair loss but not the problem.<p>The holy grail would be a pill or lotion you could take and truly stop&#x2F;reverse hair loss. There are some existing pills (finasteride) and lotions (rogaine) but they don&#x27;t work for many, and have their own issues as well.')
