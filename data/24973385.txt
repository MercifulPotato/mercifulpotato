EDIT: &quot;if it validates&quot;, I guess so.<p>The other bit which is not clear to me is, what is the key in the database to identify ownership of user information?<p>You need a linking record which looks like hash(email) -&gt; uid (or user record or whatever) which does not seem any better than what is proposed in TFA.<p>OTOH if no information is stored against the user&#x27;s email &#x2F; uid &#x2F; username then you probably don&#x27;t need login or auth.')
