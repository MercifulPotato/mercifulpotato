There is a good chance one day they will go down and take your (their!) domain with them.<p>From their website:<p>---<p>We&#x27;re not actually a domain name registration service, we&#x27;re a customer to these.<p>[...]<p>When you buy a domain in our system, we&#x27;re actually purchasing it for ourselves.
