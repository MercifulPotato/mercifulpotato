But definitely an opportunity to raise standards.<p>Now - how that works if say the UK raises a standard and the impact upon EU imports.  For example the EU regulations for `carper dust sucker` was questioned by Dyson for being flawed.  Now if the UK does it&#x27;s own standards that have to be followed for `carpet dust sucker` to be sold in the UK that exceeds EU standards then that could be interesting.<p>So the prospect of a trade war via standards used to limit external competition and sudo subsidise companies in that cunning way - could be something we could well see down the line.  That equally could work both ways.<p>Which all makes how this trade agreement is worded in need of scrutiny as rules to protect one way, will also word both ways in such agreements to lock-in standards.  Now if they refer to just EU standards as a base and no reference to equally protection to UK standards or whatever is the higher.  Small details like that could have some interesting ramifications later on.<p>One thing is for sure - we are still a long way off from a standard global shoe size that is used by all.  Which say&#x27;s little and lots about trade and standards country to country.')
