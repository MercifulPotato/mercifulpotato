I&#x27;d suggest finding a prescribing nurse practitioner. It&#x27;s hard to find a psychiatrist without waiting six months for the first appointment.<p>&gt; You can&#x27;t call to check on availability of Schedule II medications from pharmacies, you have to query in person, and many require a prescription before they&#x27;ll answer.<p>I drop three prescriptions off at a time. Or it&#x27;s called in and then I call for refills. If they don&#x27;t have it in stock they can probably order it.<p>&gt; You can only ever get one month prescription at a time (with no refills), and have to contact your doctor every month. Not too early, not too late.<p>I&#x27;ve had five or six psychiatrists. All of them prescribe 3 months in advance after the prescription is stabilized.')
