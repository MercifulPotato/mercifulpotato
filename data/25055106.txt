We customized a car for the guy who owned a famous brand of liquor. He had a vanity license plate on one of his cars that said something like &quot;3 Stars&quot; on it and I asked him what that stood for. He said it was less expensive brand of the liquor he sold and then he went on to say &quot;it&#x27;s the same as the expensive stuff and if you tell anyone that they&#x27;ll call you a liar, but take it from me, it&#x27;s the same stuff&quot;. And he was right. I did tell people and those who purchased his expensive brand flat out insisted I was wrong.<p>Apple can charge more because they always have and people will buy it because they believe it&#x27;s better.')
