If you’re just trying to DDoS the other person because, unless they exert superhuman effort to track down evidence for claims <i>you believe</i> are extraordinary, you will dismiss their point unduly. Why can’t you do the research for their argument, for example? It’s not their obligation to do so.<p>Further if you self-reflect and still really believe their point is incredulous without bolstering evidence, why not just say nothing? What possible value is it to add a sniping comment like “uhm, citation needed”? It’s plainly not contributing anything, solely looking for the evidence challenge itself to bring some kind of undercutting rhetorical flair, which is frankly <i>worse</i> than making uncorroborated, but civil, claims (because others can fact check them for themselves).')
