Item(by='z77dj3kl', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609768184, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25628729, text='We implemented a passwordless, OTP-to-email login system, and doing user research, people just complain it&#x27;s too complicated. They don&#x27;t like logging in to their Gmail and (as others have mentioned) waiting a few moments. It&#x27;s especially bad on something like mobile. People like to use passwords, apparently.<p>I see passwords as reducing security (we have a low-security product so people can reset with an email, so security-wise, the upper bound is your email security), hence we used it. But people prefer the &quot;remember the secret&quot; shortcut!')
