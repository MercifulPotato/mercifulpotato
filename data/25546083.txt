I agree that you certainly need to write tests for algorithmic code unless you are formally proving it. I definitely would not feel safe about a data structure I wrote in Haskell without writing a large suite of tests. If your tests cover a good portion of the code, then errors arising from incorrect arguments will be quickly found. It&#x27;s nice to have that eliminated by the compiler when possible though.')
