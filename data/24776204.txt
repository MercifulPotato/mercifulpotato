Item(by='speeder', descendants=None, kids=[24776797], score=None, time=1602681759, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24765382, text='In my country this wouldn&#x27;t surprise me at all.<p>School system here is basically hell, they picked the worst parts of USA and EU styles of education and mixed them into some kind of unholy beast designed to break children.<p>Here many schools have the building literally designed after prisons, something that kids DO pick up (the most important school in my town had the nickname when I was teenager, of &quot;Cadei√£o&quot;, that means &quot;big jail&quot;, a nickname also used to refer to supermax prisons).<p>Although we don&#x27;t get a ton of mass shootings like USA, non-mass shootings are normal (and mind you, in a country where guns are banned... people still find a way to get guns anyway, also axes, knives, etc... we had a &quot;mass axing&quot; here...), violence between not just students, but students and teachers.<p>Much of this I suspect is because my country is one of the few ones in the world where homeschooling is 100% illegal, with no exceptions, attempting homeschool here is a serious crime that results in the parents being arrested and the kids sent to orphanage, so you have schools full of kids that DO NOT want to be there, ever, so they focus their time on making life hell for everybody around them, hoping that maybe someday, people will kick them out of the system (but they won&#x27;t, because it is illegal).<p>About EU vs USA vs Brazil schooling system:<p>I lost the excellent article I read about it years ago, but basically in USA the students can choose what classes they want, this including theoretically let them switch what classes their are going if they want to avoid a certain student. Meanwhile in Europe the classes are fixed, everyone go to same classes, but in many places you can choose the curriculum, so if you want to be an engineer for example you can pick an engineering focused curriculum, classes will be fixed, and all students you see every day won&#x27;t chance, but you will learn more about what you want.<p>In Brazil the government decided somehow, that the best path was not choose anything, all schools have same curriculum, all university entry exams are obligated to ask some mininum about subjects even if they are irrelevant (ie: if you are offering a physics course, you still need to ask literature questions in your entry exam), you can&#x27;t choose time, can&#x27;t choose curriculum, nothing. Basically you go to school when it opens, stick with same students even if they hate your guts, see the same subjects as everyone else, even if they are completely irrelevant, and then you go home, and you keep repeating this until you have to get into a university, when you then have to take a government-ran test (that often includes propaganda) and whatever test that the universities you want to enter have, such test must ask along whatever the university wants to know, also some questions about subjects the government wants all universities to ask to all students, no matter if it is completely irrelevant or useless for their lives.')
