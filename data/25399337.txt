People don&#x27;t seem to care that we&#x27;re making &quot;lies&quot; a justifiable basis for censorship. Whether you believe Trump is lying or not, we are accepting and normalizing the existence of a third party that censors things deemed to be &quot;lies&quot; for the greater good.<p>What&#x27;s more, is that it being defended under the guise of &quot;well, they&#x27;re a private corporation, etc etc.&quot; Yes, and they do have the right, but that is orthogonal to the fact that we are normalizing and welcoming it. Twitter having the right to do it and we as a society supporting their actions are separate from each other. But people like to muddy the waters by claiming that it isn&#x27;t &quot;censorship&quot; because it&#x27;s a private corporation. But it is censorship on their platform, and again, the support for the censorship <i>in general</i> is the disturbing part. It&#x27;s not as if the people supporting Twitter&#x27;s actions are saying &quot;we should only censor people on Twitter&quot;...they want it everywhere that there is a platform.<p>There&#x27;s also voices that say &quot;well, it&#x27;s Trump, and he is the President, so there should be an exception because he can influence a lot of people.&quot; Taylor Swift has as many followers (~88M) on Twitter. Do you think if she started saying similar things as Trump, people wouldn&#x27;t be calling for her censorship too? Can Taylor Swift start a civil war as easy as Trump can? Probably not, but who makes the determination of &quot;you are censored because we believe people will listen to you&quot; ?<p>Controversial speech only seem to be acceptable so long as nobody listens to you. Is that what we want?')
