Item(by='fastball', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608267948, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25463447, text='Yep, this is exactly how I feel.<p>When I was a teen, I was annoyed by how locked down iOS was, so I participated heavily in the jailbreak community. Jailbreak exploits, apps, mods, themes, repos â€“ you name it, I got involved. So every time Apple made iOS harder to jailbreak, I&#x27;d get annoyed. I&#x27;d swear eventually I&#x27;d give up on iOS altogether and move somewhere else.<p>But in the end, the opposite happened. I got older, and I realized that really, truly, if I was being honest with myself, I didn&#x27;t need all the &quot;openness&quot; that I was spending so many hours working towards. As time went on, the fiddling I was doing in deeper levels of the OS became more and more unnecessary. All the openness did was make my device less stable and less secure (except in the case of comex&#x27;s JBM2&#x2F;PDF exploit, which was patched by jailbreakers before Apple had released 4.0.2, but I think that is the exception that makes the rule).<p>And I guess maybe that is why I&#x27;m not as worried about these changes as other hackers are. Apple started out with a locked-down iPhoneOS that didn&#x27;t even have a 3rd party App Store. You couldn&#x27;t get more closed. Time went on and Apple made it harder and harder to open, but added more and more functionality. I was worried about the trajectory when I was younger, but now I&#x27;ve just bought an iPhone 12 Pro and it&#x27;s the best phone I&#x27;ve ever owned, and I don&#x27;t even care enough about jailbreaking to check if I can. So I&#x27;m not worried about macOS either.')
