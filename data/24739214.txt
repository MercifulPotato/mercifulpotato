Good that they also filter the exhaust air. The FAQ says nothing about safety measures though.<p>Questions would be: does the helmet automatically open in some way if the battery runs out? Is it &quot;default open&quot; and only held closed while battery power is available?<p>If not and the battery runs out and you try to breath in this thing, the dead space [0] is liters instead of hundreds of milliliters.
