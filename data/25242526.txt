Are you going to boycott McKinsey? Write to the same congress representatives that companies like McKinsey personally finance and wine and dine and call in for favors?<p>Do share, we are all curious what is this collective action that will somehow lead to enlightenment of &quot;building a common understanding of what the problems are and what should be done about them.&quot;<p>Billionaires are the untouchable class of people. They don&#x27;t answer to anyone. They quite literally own and run the country. I don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s difficult for the rational person to get this through their heads. The last thing you will see is them being in any kind of trouble about it. We can discuss the failing of a company like Enron another time. They really fucked the dog and in much the same way as Jeffrey Epstein hanging himself in a high security prison, pissed off other billionaires who are the only people who can get some sense of action out of the legal system on each other.')
