The floor plan of the car matters a lot. The main selling point of big estate cars (Volvo V90, E-Class T-Modell, Skoda Superb) is the rectangular shape of the boot, coupled with a flat floor with the seats down. The metal loading lip is also at the level of the floor, making access easy. Some also have additional storage compartments under the boot floor, and even specially designed extra-size fuel tanks.')
