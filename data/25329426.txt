Item(by='spideymans', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607316765, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25328844, text='&gt;Many iOS apps can now be run on MacOS via IPA files, e.g. native Slack iOS client app instead of bloated and memory-hogging web&#x2F;electron client.<p>I expected iOS apps on the Mac to be absolute trash (and they are... at least by Mac standards), so there&#x27;s really something to be said about the state of the web when the iOS variants of these apps (running on a Mac) <i>still</i> provide a better UX than the web variants.<p>I know when Twitter for Mac came out (another unoptimized iOS app running on the Mac), I installed it and never once looked back at their bloated web client. And I know that if I could get the apps for Gmail, Youtube, Netflix, Reddit and other popular websites on my Intel Mac, I&#x27;d likely never go back to their web versions either (seriously, Apollo for iOS is <i>so much</i> better than the Reddit website).<p>The open web is important. But until the web provides a UX of comparable quality to native clients, users will understandably flock to closed app sandboxes when given the opportunity. Great web apps do exist, but us haphazardly bolting on framework after framework is killing the performance and UX of the web. Sticking our heads in the sand about this isn&#x27;t doing the open web any favours.')
