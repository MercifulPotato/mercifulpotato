I take a much bleaker view of it. Those jobs are gone permanently and many of the new jobs we see on the lower skill end of the scale are ghost jobs that ONLY exist because it’s cheaper and quicker to just pay people to do those things than to automate them, but once the cost of development&#x2F;automation has been paid for we’re going to see millions of low wage jobs disappear at a MUCH faster pace than we have to this point.<p>Job losses are only going to accelerate for the foreseeable future across most industries and they won’t be replaced by anything or at most a small fraction of what was lost.<p>Instead of the Jetsons (everyone’s jobs get simpler and simpler until they’re trivial, which seems to be what you’re leaning towards) we’ll have huge swaths of people that have so much time on their hands the time value of labor will drop to almost $0.')
