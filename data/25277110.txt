It has full E2EE support, and the developer is funded to work on it full time.<p>&gt; I.e., implement the difficult parts of Slack really, really well<p>Yup.  The balance between features and core stability is Hard, but hopefully we&#x27;re getting the balance right (at last).<p>Hydrogen (hydrogen.element.io) is an example of a ludicrously lightweight, stable, but not-yet-featureful Matrix client fwiw, as an example of what the balance looks like for &quot;implementing the difficult bits really really well&quot;.')
