The intruders were police officers (this doesn&#x27;t, or shouldn&#x27;t, give them carte blanche to shoot people)<p>2. The police announced themselves as police before entering, which is in dispute.<p>Further, the opportunity to bring manslaughter charges was never provided. The prosecutor declined to present murder or manslaughter to the Grand Jury.')
