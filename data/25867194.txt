Facebook&#x27;s users are more conservative than liberal. Twitter is constant screaming of all political affiliations. YouTube is famous for being the place where our relatives fall down the right-wing conspiracy rabbit hole. The thing that paints a target on your back is your platform being a landing pad for the people banned from other social networks and basically nothing else. I don&#x27;t care how conservative you are Goat was a cesspool. And it wasn&#x27;t because the people on it were conservative but because it was where people too vulgar for Reddit went. &#x2F;r&#x2F;popular might bleed dark blue but Reddit hosts plenty of active conservative communities that aren&#x27;t &#x2F;r&#x2F;TD.<p>The argument &quot;we have law enforcement are courts for that&quot; is disingenuous as best unless you want the gov&#x27;t to start employing hundreds of thousands of internet cops tied into the moderation tools of every platform. Without platform moderation there are literally zero practical consequences for online death threats, harassment, hate speech. It just doesn&#x27;t happen. There is no one to call. Your local police won&#x27;t take you seriously and have zero power to do anything even if they did. In spirit I actually agree with you but saying &quot;throw it to the legal system&quot; without any plan to make it work just feels like you don&#x27;t actually want any moderation and know that this would accomplish that.')
