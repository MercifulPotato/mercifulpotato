Aviation is full of scrutiny. Aircraft maintenance checks happy every 500 flight hours. Engines get overhauled completely every 1,500 hours.<p>Maintenance and scrutiny ensure safety.<p>If the Max has received, at a guess, 200x the scrutiny of any other plane in history, then I&#x27;d wager it is the safest.

Do pilots have such deep knowledge of other planes which almost assuredly have latent bugs which rarely or never crop up due to exceedingly rare conditions?')
