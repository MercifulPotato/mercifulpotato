In recent years, I&#x27;m fairly regularly too broke to eat adequately. As a consequence, I fast or semi-fast part of most months.<p>I&#x27;ve slowly gotten healthier. Fasting or semi-fasting is not the only reason by any stretch of the imagination.<p>Anecdotally, it&#x27;s gotten easier as I&#x27;ve gotten healthier.<p>I read once (or heard from someone) that if you cut calories by 80 percent -- a figure not shown in their chart defining their terms -- it triggers the &quot;starvation&quot; response. Your body thinks you are starving, much as if you weren&#x27;t eating at all.<p>I have found that semi-fasting -- eating maybe 20 percent of normal calories -- has fasting-like benefits for my condition while being much, much easier to endure as someone with a real serious and incurable medical condition.<p>This is absolutely not medical advice of any sort for anyone. I am not a doctor. I&#x27;m a person with a chronic illness running my mouth on the internet.')
