If not, your product does not have to be plugable. Also if you end with multiple interfaces with only one implementation you should start with classes and extract interfaces when needed.<p>And I think the Java abstraction root problem comes from the way of doing &quot;unit-testing&quot; at the class level. Your users don&#x27;t care about your application architecture: they want functionalities. Method and class level unit testing is just fossilizing your code and giving you some kind of feel-good number. You should be able to drop all your code, start anew with a new stack and have your tests still usable. Refactoring should never mean having to rewrite tests.')
