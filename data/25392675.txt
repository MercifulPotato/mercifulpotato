This is what &quot;having free speech in society&quot; has always meant.<p>The government will also punish people who commit crimes against you merely because they dislike your words, which frees you to say things you might otherwise keep to yourself.<p>What you <i>don&#x27;t</i> have a right to do is amplify your message using the massively powerful social-media megaphones which are created and owned by tech companies. If you want to amplify a message that these companies find strongly objectionable, you&#x27;ll have to build your own megaphone, or find one owned by someone with different views from Google&#x2F;Facebook&#x2F;Twitter.<p>That said, I wonder if it&#x27;s sufficient to reduce the amount of amplification rather than outright censoring things the company disagrees with. For example, YouTube could let conspiracy videos be hosted but leave it up to viewers to discover them rather than recommending them in search or &quot;related videos&quot;. It seems likely that censoring will have unintended consequences.')
