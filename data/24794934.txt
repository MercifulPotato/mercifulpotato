Item(by='vgrocha', descendants=2, kids=[24795203, 24795545], score=3, time=1602800805, title='Ask HN: Recommended monitor to reduce eye fatigue', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='I tried tweaking my monitor setup by reducing brightness, contrast, blue light (i.e. setting a warm color tone), but I still feel my eyes get tired from looking at the screen for long times.\n(Note: I recently had an eye exam and everything was ok)<p>I was wondering if HN would have monitor suggestions to address this. I have seen some companies that claim that their monitors reduce eye strain, so also interested if people have had experience with that (e.g. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.viewsonic.com&#x2F;library&#x2F;tech&#x2F;best-monitors-eye-strain&#x2F;)')
