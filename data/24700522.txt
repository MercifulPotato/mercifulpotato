Item(by='DCKing', descendants=None, kids=[24702255], score=None, time=1602006790, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24700411, text='I do think that there will still be  some people interested in ECC detection and reporting, but that&#x27;s not really why I&#x27;m interested in ECC memory. The dividing line &quot;enterprise = error correction with monitoring &#x2F; non-enterprise = silent error correction&quot; is much more sensible than &quot;non-enterprise = no error correction at all, good luck&quot; IMO.<p>Isn&#x27;t the primary reason why people are looking into diagnostics is because it&#x27;s very hard to determine whether ECC is working in the first place? Because it depends on the particular hardware setup? If the spec states that <i>all</i> DDR5 is supposed to have internal error correction anyway, then I&#x27;m happy to take for granted error correction is working until I read about the scandals of non-spec cheap DDR5 :)')
