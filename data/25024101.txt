You may note that exceeds the total number of Americans who have not already tested positive, which gives a pretty good hint that model can&#x27;t actually reflect reality for that long.<p>Additionally, the 10M number is the number of people who have tested positive, not the number who have been infected, which is probably several times higher than that even.<p>So yeah. I doubt we have even two more doublings ahead of us, at least as measured by hospitalizations (positive tests are a bad measure because early testing was very lacking). Less than one wouldn&#x27;t surprise me.')
