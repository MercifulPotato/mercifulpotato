Child migrants who came here alone were processed like other migrants.<p>No, that isn&#x27;t how it works. The policy is that children gets torn away from their family if the family gets prosecuted for a crime. That policy existed long before Trump. The only thing that changed under Trump was removal of lenience against parents, meaning parents now got prosecuted at same rate as other border crossers.')
