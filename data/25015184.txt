Did I miss it? Do you have a timestamp? And I agree on all points that he makes. The only thing related to BLM protests is that he mentions some folks asking to kiss their shoes or asking others to knee, but even in those cases he is careful enough to clarify, that he doesn&#x27;t thinke they are actually BLM protesters. And they are jerks for sure no matter what their skin color is.<p>Regarding evidence I have a couple of thoughts - I don&#x27;t think the situation was such that required publishing the evidence. If Carol or someone else would question the claims, showing the evidence would be necessary. (I don&#x27;t count uberfemenist allegations since they are utterly disrespectful). Moreover, even if Bret doesn&#x27;t have the evidence (like for the conversation with Carol over the phone), it doesn&#x27;t mean that he should never tell about the story. Obviously we don&#x27;t have to believe it either. Moreover, my impression is that Bret himself isn&#x27;t very willng to dig into this story, it is mostly Eric pushing him.<p>I don&#x27;t quite get what other claims he isn&#x27;t able to back up. What did he claim about covid or 9&#x2F;11 that he wasnt&#x27; able to back up? I only saw him questioning the explanation give about one of the buildings collapse. By unity theory - do you mean his physics theory? Whell, I haven&#x27;t paid attention to that, but I&#x27;m not sure how are you supposed to back it up? If it contradicts the observation&#x2F;experiment, or is self-contradictory, it is bust, but what does it mean to &quot;back it up&quot;?<p>Where did he made the claim about 3 Nobel prizes? He said that Bret might have had one in the video that is linked multiple times from the uberfeminist blog, but I haven&#x27;t actually heard about the other two.<p>p.s. it is quite tedious to type that much, if you want we can chat by voice&#x2F;video, just drop me an email by appending gmail to my nickname.')
