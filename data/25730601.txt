We were tricked into spending trillions of dollars and thousands of lives invading a nation that had nothing to do with it and we gave some of the less savory government agencies a lot of power which they still have not returned.<p>I think the public is right to be hesitant to play the knee-jerk reaction game this time around considering how well it turned out last time.')
