This is a socket activation REST API. This API has a compatibility mode that implements the &quot;Docker API&quot; meaning podman can be setup to listen on the docker.sock and launch containers. We also have the more advanced Podman API for support of concepts like Pods. The API should be able to work with docker-py based scripts and Compose. We are getting lots of community support in fixing up our inconsistencies.<p>This is a fully open source project and we love to get contributions.')
