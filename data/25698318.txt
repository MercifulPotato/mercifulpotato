It is simply not possible to &#x27;say&#x27; something while you are sitting on the toilet to 70 million people within a few seconds.<p>The idea that &#x27;a platform&#x27; and &#x27;speech&#x27; must be treated the same is ultimately a kind of class warfare -- its a false comparison that serves to benefit the rich (in this case, rich in terms of platform reach) by pretending that any attempts to place restrictions on the use of mega-platforms must necessarily imply new restrictions on the speech of the vast majority of people without such reach.')
