It&#x27;s essentially a cron-ed rsync (Dropbox is built around the same concept internally).<p>Recall is primarily a file server. The analogy that I have is that it&#x27;s a zero-config FTP server with a web client with a nicer UX. Auto-sync of select files is on my roadmap, but at this point it&#x27;s just a &#x27;remote access to your files in a browser&#x27;.<p>Another big diff is that Syncthing is open source, so it&#x27;s security and privacy are verifiable. Recall is closed source at this point (although you could peek at the JS client to figure out how it works), and I&#x27;m not yet ready to make a promise to open it in the near future. So, be aware.<p>Thank you for your kind words, I really appreciate that!')
