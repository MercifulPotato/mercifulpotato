Democrats still don&#x27;t like the electoral college even when they win. The real margin in this election would be over 5 million instead of the hundred of thousands if the EC didn&#x27;t exist.<p>And in this case the Republican claims of misnformation and conspiracy have seemed so outlandish and baseless it&#x27;s hard to take any of them seriously.<p>Like videos of ballots being burned, that turned out to be sample ballots printed from the internet.<p>Or the false rumor that ballots marked with sharpie were being disqualified in Arizona when their own election officials repeatedly cleared that claim.<p>Or the baseless claim that Republican observers were not present for the counting of ballots in Michigan or Pennsylvania - they were.<p>Or the willful misunderstanding of how ballots were being tallied and reported.<p>Or that mail in ballots fraudulently skewed Democratic after Trump spent months telling his supporters not to trust mail voting, then complaining when those mailin ballots were legally counted after November 3rd.')
