Item(by='v64', descendants=None, kids=[25242674, 25241842], score=None, time=1606601970, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25240130, text='&gt; I don&#x27;t understand how not to think like this, because every real success I&#x27;ve fought for and won came as a result of believing my life was over if I didn&#x27;t succeed. In some cases I really would become poor or have no future if I didn&#x27;t succeed, so it grants too much legitimacy to the method.<p>I&#x27;ve approached this by taking the stance that life should be process-oriented, not results-oriented. Sometimes you can do the right thing and still lose. Sometimes you can do the wrong thing and win. &quot;Success&quot; is often just luck with a nice backstory written after the fact. That isn&#x27;t to downplay anyone&#x27;s hard work, but often it&#x27;s luck that provides the opportunity to work hard for something worthwhile in the first place.<p>It&#x27;s entirely possible that in your life, you could have succeeded and still ended up becoming poor due to circumstances beyond your control. It&#x27;s also possible that if you had ultimately failed, circumstances would not have turned out the way it so obviously looked like they had to play out.<p>Ultimately, you can only control yourself in this universe. If you&#x27;ve done everything you could do and gave it your best, really did all you can, then regardless of the outcome, you should be proud of yourself.')
