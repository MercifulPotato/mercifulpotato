I&#x27;ve been using it for years.  I do worry that it might be abandonware at this point, but it works very well.  I keeps all the metadata (current position, bookmarks, etc) in the AudioBooks folder (where you store your audiobook files) so it&#x27;s trivial to back it up, move to a new device, or seven set up sync.')
