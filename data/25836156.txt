The only thing (from my naive understanding) that SSPL limits is a business (Like Amazon) from offering Elasticsearch as a service. If an organization (Like Amazon) wanted to use Elasticsearch internally (to say, power some part of their shopping platform), they are free to do so with this license.<p>It&#x27;s essentially protecting Elastic&#x27;s business model, which quite honestly, should be the bare minimum offered by any open source product.')
