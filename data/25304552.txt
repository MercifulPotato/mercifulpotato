You don&#x27;t have to be exploitative to be a billionaire, it&#x27;s simply a byproduct. There are only several thousand billionaires on earth and you&#x27;d be hard pressed to find any one of them without some sort of scandal involving their workers or consumers.<p>Pinpointing what is &#x27;objectively&#x27; wrong with a subjective essay is hard, which is why most people are attacking the subjectivity itself, and I think that&#x27;s healthy to do.')
