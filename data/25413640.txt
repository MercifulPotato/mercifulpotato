I&#x27;m not saying I&#x27;m normal but perhaps I can provide some perspective. Even before I went fully remote 2 years ago I took a combination of bicycle and train to work here in Seattle where public transportation is okay at best. Before that I biked 10 miles one way to an office in Missouri after selling my car.<p>I don&#x27;t depend on cars for my lifestyle so if I do have a car I want it to be one I enjoy taking to the store or driving to the mountains or whatever. They are cool machines and driving can be fun.')
