She did not express anything malicious and she corrected herself (at least partially).<p>It sounds like your colleague was doing something anyone would do (assessing someone by the social strictures they are familiar with) and did something wrong (devoted effort to it in a hiring context, said something aloud.) Yes, everyone does this sort of thing -- in American society overall we don&#x27;t have good names for the subtle side of our class system, so we can&#x27;t express the puzzle as clearly as some other societies, but we do see the world (consciously or unconsciously) along these lines.<p>When I hear people say inappropriate things -- usually less fraught ones like marital status -- I point out that they cannot say such things. It serves as a reminder of proper procedure. I do not escalate the situation if they seem to be acting without malice and, like the person in your story, seem to desire to do better.<p>(Full disclosure, I am a white-presenting man.)')
