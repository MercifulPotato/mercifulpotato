The drawback is that all the most common infrastructure <i>requires</i> you to be all-in on GKE and the google stack. If you want to use Cassandra or Postgres, for example, you either manage it yourself or use the google options. The problem with this is that you basically give up all the benefit of having a multi-cloud approach by following this approach. However! If you have a bunch of legacy systems sitting on an on-prem set of self-hosted hardware finally you can mix and match between the on-prem stuff and the GCP managed cluster.<p>ACG sounds like it can be used to manage hosts and containers; so it&#x27;s more like enhanced k8s &#x2F; EKS than a meta layer above kubernetes. This is just my take on this product based on how the marketing lingo talks about it. I&#x27;m much more familiar with AnthOS')
