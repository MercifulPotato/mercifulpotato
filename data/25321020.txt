And if there are no unused acres, then it&#x27;s best to work on getting more productivity per acre to <i>make</i> some unused acres.<p>The agricultural sector is in dire need of a kick in the rear to encourage better land efficiency; LVT is one heck of a kick.<p>&gt; Farm land just sits there.<p>Then it ain&#x27;t a farm, in which case all the more reason to sell off that land and make it available to someone else.<p>&gt; It doesn&#x27;t &quot;cost&quot; the local town&#x2F;county anything.<p>It imposes an opportunity cost on everyone who <i>would</i> more effectively use that land, including other farmers with better methods (and also, more broadly, anyone else wanting places to live and&#x2F;or work and&#x2F;or play).')
