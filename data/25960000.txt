Where &quot;wrong&quot; is not a legal concept full stop.<p>So too in the case of the GME thing, if not this thread; I suspect that there is a lot of implicit meta-argumentation going on,<p>and that some of what I see in this thread appears to be missing (or more likely, dis-missing) that, to engage in &quot;tree&quot; level quibbling.<p>(All said, I do agree words and their meaning matter; and that when we want to use them informally, because specificity in some domain is not germane to our argument, we would do well to be explicit about that...)')
