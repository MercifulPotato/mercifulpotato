I&#x27;ll answer this, but then I&#x27;ll leave this thread.<p>I can&#x27;t speak from the context of someone who has schizophrenia because as far as I know I don&#x27;t have it. So I&#x27;ll speak more generally.<p>&quot;Get busy running&quot; is a mindset. It was a reference to &quot;Get busy living&quot; from Shawshank Redemption (Great movie). I don&#x27;t know your situation, or how horrible it is to live with schizophrenia. I just hope there are still things you can control in your life. No matter how small or minuscules they seem, focus on that. Focus on the things you can do better.<p>There is nothing wrong with wanting help or helping other people. However, from the perspective of an individual(who is suffering&#x2F;disadvantaged) it&#x27;s a safer bet to focus on things you can control.  So, yes, I am putting the ownership of your life, in your own hands. Isn&#x27;t that empowering? I find it is. Also, it doesn&#x27;t have to be alone. Maybe, the way to help yourself is you find people that can help you. Allowing people to help and accepting help is big.<p>No one asked for life. You&#x27;re just given it. All the beauty and suffering. I said a race, but there is no finish line. You try or you don&#x27;t. To everyone who is trying to make the world a better place. Thank you. I support you. I want the same thing. I&#x27;m trying to help in my own way. You might not agree, but that&#x27;s okay.<p>lol I hate how philosophical and cheesy I sound, but that&#x27;s what I feel.')
