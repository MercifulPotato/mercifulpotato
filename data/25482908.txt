They used to call &#x27;storage share&#x27; just &#x27;Nextcloud&#x27;, but moved it to the new name for licensing reasons.<p>I don&#x27;t know what type of hardware they&#x27;re running their Nextcloud instances on, but I&#x27;ve been using calendar&#x2F;contacts and public file sharing (since Firefox Send went down) on the cheapest plan for a while now and it&#x27;s fine. I also dabbled a bit in using Nextcloud&#x27;s maps, video calling, bookmarks and rss reader applications and it all works OK, although I didn&#x27;t stick to them because they&#x27;re not the most rich in features. I had to Hetzner email support a few times and got a helpful reply within 1-2 work days, sometimes quicker, which I thought was fine.')
