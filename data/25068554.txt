For keeping on planes, and keeping the past version alive as a local copy. But honestly I didn&#x27;t create it for that reason I think. I can&#x27;t remember exactly now without using my power to think about it more...but basically I think I created it to just see if it was possible. I was doing lots of work in Chrome DevTools at the time and the idea suddenly came to me, and I wanted to see if it would actually work. This project has constantly surprised me by how much &quot;legs&quot; it has. People just love it. And the first version took me very little time to do. It&#x27;s weird, other things that take a lot of time are not so popular. Utility or popularity with others has nothing to do with hard work, nor the amount of work, I think.')
