Despite that it’s far behind the M1 in GeekBench single core and multicore scores.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;browser.geekbench.com&#x2F;v5&#x2F;cpu&#x2F;search?q=4900H" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;browser.geekbench.com&#x2F;v5&#x2F;cpu&#x2F;search?q=4900H</a><p>Now as you shown it’s way ahead in Cinebench 23 Multicore benchmark. Let’s assume that’s more representative of real world use, and that being a process behind it will add 15% higher performance when AMD makes a 5 nm successor. That would increase its Cinebench Multicore to roughly 12,700, roughly 60% higher than the M1.<p>But all Apple has to do is come out with an M1X with eight Firestorm cores. That’s a multicore performance in the same range as the best possible 5 nm AMD CPU, and a TDP barely half of the AMD CPU. And far higher Cinebench single core, and GeekBench single&#x2F;multicore ratings.<p>Obviously to swap Firestorm for IceStorm cores they need more transistors or something else has to go (on chip GPU?).<p>And Apple won’t be making 20 hour MacBook Airs out of this M1X, but they will be able to make 14 hour MacBook Pros with faster discrete GPUs.<p>And they are about 6 months from doing exactly that. Which is likely going to before AMD 5 nm, so top of line 4900H laptops get smoked on all Cinebench and GeekBench scores while using nearly double the power.')
