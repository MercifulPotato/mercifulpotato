Item(by='jimhefferon', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602871600, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24802598, text='A course in logic is often offered in a Phil Dept, perhaps as a way to meet liberal studies requirements (that&#x27;s where I took it, and where the course is at the school where I now teach).<p>The equivalence of A =&gt; B and ~B =&gt; ~A is taught in every college and university CS program I&#x27;ve ever seen, as part of a standard course that may be called something like Discrete Math.  I teach this course out of a book by Rosen and another popular author is Epp.  This equivalence is also, as many other posters noted, perfectly natural to a person with a technical bent.<p>But I understood the piece&#x27;s author&#x27;s point to be that they are looking for a certain maturity.  When we teach, we see that there are stages of competence through which students pass.  First they are able to ape the required work on a sentence-by-sentence basis, but not whole problems from start to finish.  Next they are able to reliably work entire problems, but only in a context (for instance, they can do induction in the Induction section but outside of it they are easily confused).  Finally, with enough practice, they have a larger view and can select the appropriate tool for the job when there are a lot of tools lying around, as well as apply that tool.  (FWIW, I take the posters here saying that the author didn&#x27;t prompt well enough to be recognizing those stages, implicitly.)')
