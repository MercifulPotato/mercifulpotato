You either go elsewhere that doesn&#x27;t serve you poisoned items (alternatives), or boycott eating out all together if such alternatives don&#x27;t exist.<p>The belief is that the general media teaches you useful information from current events that impact your life. It doesn&#x27;t. I&#x27;d rather read a &quot;year in review&quot;, or something on a longer time frame, than follow things too closely.<p>For specialised knowledge, there are professional journals for that sort of thing. But mass media &quot;news&quot; is not useful at all, so I&#x27;ve taken the policy of cutting it out. Mental health and general life perspectives have been vastly improved.')
