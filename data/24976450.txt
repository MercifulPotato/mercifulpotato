I know this sounds like some insane flippant remark, but I saw a video where he talked about the election forecast as a martingale bounded between 0 and 1 and then made some claims about variance with these bounds to back up his claim against Silver.<p>For his claim to make sense you would have to view probabilities as linear, which is not simply not how probabilities work. An event that has a 0.01 chance of happening is an <i>order of magnitude</i> more likely than one that has as 0.001 chance.  However the different between and 0.5 and 0.501 is essentially negligible (hence probability is not linear because 0.001 does not mean the same everywhere).<p>I&#x27;ve generally given Taleb a pass as a bit of a crank that doesn&#x27;t care about the philosophical interpretation of probability, but after seeing him misunderstand probability in such a major way I&#x27;ve started writing him off entirely.<p>edit: I should add I&#x27;m not particularly more convinced that \nSilver really understands all that much either, just that this is all two very loud people that don&#x27;t know much. Neither should be taken seriously. This isn&#x27;t Bradly Efron arguing with Andrew Gelman.')
