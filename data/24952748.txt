(in jest)<p>I understand why, though some of us think of decaf &quot;coffee&quot;, much the same way others view white &quot;chocolate&quot;.  At some point, the thing you modified it to be, isn&#x27;t representative of the original thing.  IMO, it should not be called coffee or chocolate, even with a descriptive adjective up front.<p>This is a minor nit to pick, but still, for those of us with a strong love of (addition to) coffee (or chocolate), its an important distinction.')
