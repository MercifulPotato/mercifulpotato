Nowadays I ask for coffee, or beer. You end up with kilo&#x27;s of coffee beans, and enough alcohol to get you killed. But, at least it&#x27;s not more stuff.<p>Who needs random stuff? Most people don&#x27;t, so they make up lists and do shopping for each other. It&#x27;s a waste of time to me.<p>Kids want stuff, and don&#x27;t have money, so presents are wonderful and exiting! But why would you want gifts for adults? They even made it a ceremonial obligation at specific moments like birthdays or Christmas,<p>A spontaneous gift can be fun, someone who knows you well can buy you nice serendipitous gift. But Christmas shopping.... horror! :)')
