Are the total bytes of text, pictures, and video produced by the news media some significant fraction of the total bytes output by humanity? I&#x27;m not sure but also I&#x27;m not sure why it matters.<p>I wonder why people seem to be surprised&#x2F;upset&#x2F;perturbed at news media polarization. Humans read the news for fun&#x2F;excitement&#x2F;engagement&#x2F;etc. The vast majority don&#x27;t have to read the news, they choose to. They choose to read the news over engaging in some other activity that might be more fun&#x2F;etc. Therefore the news competes with all other fun things to do. Opinion and polarization are more fun and exciting and outrage-inducing than dry, unbiased, fact-based reporting - so you see more and more of the former and less and less of the latter.<p>This is because of how humans are. This isn&#x27;t because there are mean content producers. The content that wins is a reflection of humanity. Generally we like to consume content that invokes emotion; facts are boring.<p>As an aside, I watch (with what I wish wasn&#x27;t a touch of schadenfreude) as people get upset at the decline of the newspaper industry. I guess it turns out that humans don&#x27;t really care about journalistic ethics - they just want a hit of dopamine. The noble-ness of journalism IS noble and to be lauded, because it prescribes a standard that goes against the grain of the typical media consumer.')
