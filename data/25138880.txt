That&#x27;s generally speaking, I&#x27;ve purchased and sold ATI cards and others in that time, and my list of GPUs is a long one. The end result? I do not have strong opinions on each brand. A hard truth is that too much changes over time to be brand loyal.<p>My most stable card was my Radeon 5870, I bought it on launch day and installed every single WHQL release on it that they ever produced. One game had an issue, but it also had the same issue on NV. I think I used that card daily for nearly 8 years.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t worry about stability or crashing on a new Radeon card, but rather if the details about it meet what you need. How are you using it- CUDA, VR, 4K, etc. I still lean Nvidia but I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to purchase a 6800XT after looking into my particular needs.<p>Same thing applies to CPUs. You can&#x27;t really go off benchmarks, you really would need to benchmark what you&#x27;re doing with it to matter at all. If you can&#x27;t afford to buy them all and test, then your use-case probably doesn&#x27;t matter enough to even investigate, buy whatever suits you. For me, the 16GB included on these cards is very attractive but I&#x27;d need to do in-depth research on these new Radeons and their VR performance (which has tended to lean NV, but can improve over time) to make a final decision.')
