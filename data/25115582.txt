It was conceivable, even if unlikely, that officers in China or Russia (USSR? :) ) or someplace else are mostly hereditary, and I saw no need to raise that issue.<p>&gt; So clearly, if kodah meant what you claim they meant, they would be really really really wrong, like ludicrously wrong. &#x2F; As such (and this is my point), it&#x27;s probably better to assume that the kodah didn&#x27;t mean that.
