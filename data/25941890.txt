There are pretty large variable costs to run a service like this.<p>WebRTC is peer-to-peer, architecturally. But if you run the service you pay for bandwidth for users behind firewalls (because you need to forward the audio&#x2F;video through TURN servers) and for calls with more than 3 or 4 people (because you need to offload some of the cpu&#x2F;bandwidth from the clients).<p>Bandwidth and media server CPU set the floor for what you need to charge.<p>As a SaaS, you can charge per &lt;usage&gt; or charge per &lt;user&gt;. Each pricing model is good for a different subset of your customers. With fairly large variable costs, usage-based pricing is easier to model for you, but not necessarily for your customers.<p>For example, your (developer) customers that charge a flat rate per &quot;seat&quot; per month for their products will have trouble projecting what their margin will be if you charge them per video minute.<p>The industry Jitsi&#x2F;8x8 competes in is gradually moving towards $0.0015&#x2F;minute as the rough cost of video for customers with significant volume. So one way to look at Jitsi&#x27;s pricing model is that they are projecting an average of ~4 hours of video per month per unique user. ($0.35 &#x2F; $0.0015 &#x2F; 60). Which seems ... low?<p>This is separate from the question above about how they track unique users, which I agree is really interesting!<p>Also, and again separately from Jitsi, there&#x27;s also a long history of not-so-transparent pricing in the telecommunications world. One of the major SaaS video platforms advertises peer-to-peer calls as free on their service. And they are, if you don&#x27;t count the TURN bandwidth they bill you for.<p>(Disclaimer: as the cofounder of Daily.co, a YC company that competes with this Jitsi service, I think about variable vs per-user pricing way too much. tldr; we can almost always do better for you than any of our competitors, partly because we&#x27;re happy to talk to you and put together custom pricing based on your use case. But it&#x27;s also true that most of our customers, especially our largest customers, don&#x27;t select us primarily based on price. Empirically, we win on ease of use, video quality, API flexibility, and developer support. So under-pricing isn&#x27;t an optimal business strategy, either.)')
