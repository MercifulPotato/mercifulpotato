It made us all on the same page, believing the same facts and entertained.  Radio had to be pretty much all good.  A kid listening to old radio shows laying in front of the console was in pure heaven.  Facebook, etc. is purely detrimental to humanity like cigarettes or meth.<p>I’d post the references but there are simply too many.  I’ve never seen a study that didn’t find Facebook, Twitter, etc. detrimental to mental health.')
