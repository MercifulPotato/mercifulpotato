No other country has produced companies that are even remotely comparable, and the US produces them regularly. Assuming, of course, that one’s preferred alternative doesn’t involve serving the CCP.<p>Maybe some folks prefer it that way, but they seem all too happy to compartmentalize the reality of the situation and let their ridiculously permissive (and coddling) employer pad their bank account, make them gourmet meals, babysit their kids, and do their laundry.<p>Google screwed up by creating an environment that fosters perpetual children. They’re fools to put up with this behavior. Walkouts should be a one way door. Call their bluff. They will not quit in any significant numbers. Not once they realize how everyone else lives.')
