He did AI research and published papers at MIT, also he taught a (or more) Deep Learning course at MIT with lots of participants, the lecture recordings are available on YouTube. I think it&#x27;s quite clear he knows his stuff and isn&#x27;t a bullshit artist at all.<p>He is well prepared for the interviews, he listens intently and asks important and curious questions to high profile researchers. The discussion is often at a level (of technicality) that I haven&#x27;t seen anywhere else for a very very long time.

If you are interested in AI discussions, I&#x27;m pretty sure you&#x27;ll find tons of interesting people on that list.')
