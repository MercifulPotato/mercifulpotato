Poles are exceptionally adept at duplicity and censoring their history. Chopin, Konopnicka were likely gay? LALALALALA I CAN&#x27;T HEAR YOU! JÃ³zef Bem converted to Islam and still acted like a Polish patriot? Let&#x27;s talk about something else. Such and such poets or composers etc were jewish? You&#x27;re either a Jew or a Polish Catholic, obviously. Poland never attacked any countries. Poland didn&#x27;t initially try an alliance with Hitler and annex a part of Czechoslovakia. The word &quot;pogrom&quot; doesn&#x27;t come from Polish, no no. And before &quot;pogrom&quot;, &quot;tumult&quot; wasn&#x27;t used as an euphemism. Aggression towards immigrants doesn&#x27;t contradict Christianity. Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth was perfect and it collapsed only because it was attacked by neighbors. All countries bordering with Poland love Poland. Poland is the fountain of innovation, it&#x27;s only a coincidence the most famous Polish people lived outside Poland.<p>There&#x27;s literally a common phrase &quot;Poland is the Christ of nations.&quot; - Mickiewicz, the chief poet. You can only be the Christ if you&#x27;re without fault.<p>edit: this post is getting downvoted :D. I was never good at Polish <i>doublethink</i>, cared too much about facts.')
