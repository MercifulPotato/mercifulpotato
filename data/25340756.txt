The article opens with a discussion of a person predisposed to falls falling while holding a sufficiently sharp straw. The same could have happened with a knife or a pair of scissors or a fork. Hell, it could have happened with a sufficiently stiff plastic straw or bamboo straw—even a bubble tea straw.<p>The Starbucks recall the article mentions relates to a product defect unrelated to the above incident. The same recall could have been issued for _any_ utensil, thermos, or other durable item that Starbucks sells.<p>The article also cites dental risks, and almost parodies itself: “Just like we tell people not to chew on pens.” Well, yeah. I could also chew on my silverware and I&#x27;m certain my dentist would disapprove. The note about failing to clean the straws is probably the biggest risk to the average consumer, but the same risk exists with literally any reusable utensil or cup.<p>That article feels like it&#x27;s trying hard to fish for a reason to be concerned about metal straws.')
