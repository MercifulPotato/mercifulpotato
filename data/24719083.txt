Item(by='krapp', descendants=None, kids=[24719590], score=None, time=1602165090, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24718967, text='&quot;hacker politics&quot; is in the eye of the beholder. There&#x27;s no clear delineation between &quot;politics&quot; and &quot;hacker politics&quot; in an age when Facebook can be used to organize a genocide.<p>One could say that many Trump stories are &quot;hacker politics&quot; because of Trump&#x27;s unprecedented use of social media, and the effect that social media as a whole has had on the American political landscape since his election, leading to the &quot;fake news&quot; phenomenon and controversies about the influence of social media platforms and their ability to manipulate public perception. The investigations into Trump&#x27;s relationship with Russia, Wikileaks and the DNC leaks certainly touch on &quot;hacker&quot; themes and Assange specifically. And a strong case could be made that stories about gender and racial disparity in tech and programming count as &quot;hacker politics.&quot;<p>Yet again, many such stories are more likely to be flagged than anything to do with Assange exclusively. &quot;hacker politics&quot; is not the standard actually being applied here, rather it&#x27;s aggregate political bias. Do you think a story about, say, an Antifa or BLM hacking group would stand on technical merit alone?')
