Alternatively, explain how it&#x27;s worse to have less kinetic energy.<p>You can reference this visual comparison of rifle cartridges to see what I mean: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;1source.basspro.com&#x2F;news-tips&#x2F;hunting-information&#x2F;7482&#x2F;use-rifle-caliber-chart-pick-right-ammo-hunting" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;1source.basspro.com&#x2F;news-tips&#x2F;hunting-information&#x2F;74...</a><p>Assault rifles were designed to allow soldiers to carry more bullets. It started with the Germans in WWII, who found that with mechanized warfare, infantry engagements were at closer range so they didn&#x27;t need big heavy cartridges anymore.<p>Note that the .30-06 is a hunting cartridge today but it was also used in the main American battle rifle in WWII, the Springfield 1903. There&#x27;s also the .308 which is commonly used in hunting and also various military battle rifles and sniper rifles. No infantry soldier would claim either is less effective than the 5.56.')
