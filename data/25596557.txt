Item(by='seppin', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609445160, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25590941, text='&gt; I do not have any idea what you consider to be journalism<p>Not being part of an information warfare campaign of an autocratic country&#x27;s intelligence service, as we have definitive proof Wikileaks was. The fact that you keep saying this is fine and totally par for the course (also weirdly repeating that the DNC&#x27;s personal correspondence about ordering pizza and shit-talking each other is &#x27;politically relevant&#x27;) makes me think you are either far too partisan in your admiration of Assange to discuss this objectively or you just don&#x27;t understand what the journalism industry is. I don&#x27;t really care which is true at this point.<p>You are also misrepresenting what Zaid has said, repeatedly. Being a whistleblower is not an easy thing and not without consequences, but Snowden didn&#x27;t even attempt to become one. Which is why referring to him as such is misleading at best, and cynically misrepresenting what happened for ideological reasons at worst.')
