Who really supports it? Surely not inland or eastern states, that are very orthodox, and I doubt it&#x27;s Indian or Chinese immigrants who have their own and rather sophisticated philosophy (I mean hinduism and such) and I doubt it&#x27;s high-tech whites who at most politely ignore slurs in their address. This draws a rather depressing picture of our &quot;culture&quot; if I may use this word. The said delusion is really just a policy enforced at the very top, i.e. in places like DoD and WH. Twitter creates an illusion of majority, but I bet that if this majority were to organise a picnic, they would fit on a smallish park.')
