During this meeting we talked about how to easily detect easily stalkerware without installing very technical apps nor doing forensic analysis on them. The initial concept was to develop a tiny kiosk device based on Raspberry Pi which can be used by non-tech people to test their smartphones against malicious communications issued by stalkerware or any spyware.&quot;<p>I think it&#x27;s a great idea. I&#x27;m going to check in with a friend who has to deal with stalker ware-infected phones at a womens shelter she volunteers at to see if they&#x27;d like me to build&#x2F;send them one.')
