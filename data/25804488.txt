An example of this is the behavior of service personnel in the US compared to my native country, every time I go there I almost want to tell them to tone down the niceness, but of course there&#x27;s no point because I realize I&#x27;m the odd one out.<p>Of course I appreciate the effort of being &quot;nice&quot; but when you&#x27;re not doing it out of genuine care for someone I&#x27;d much rather just be treated in a neutral way, like you&#x27;d treat any human being you encountered that you knew nothing about. I don&#x27;t much enjoy being treated as an old friend by someone who wouldn&#x27;t lend me five bucks, and I don&#x27;t enjoy being asked polite questions that require elaborate answers when you really don&#x27;t want to listen to the answer and your eyes glaze over within the first seconds.<p>Adults have left their insecurities behind them and should understand they&#x27;re not, at least initially, the friend of every human being and shouldn&#x27;t have a problem with being treated in a professionally reserved way.')
