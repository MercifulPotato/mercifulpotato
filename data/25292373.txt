Even for Oem&#x27;s a year ago you could barely see an Amd build now days at least half or more are Amd. \nBut the biggest indicator for me that Intel has started hurting is what Intel is saying to the press. If intel sales were not hurting they would not need to do some of the shit they are saying to the press.')
