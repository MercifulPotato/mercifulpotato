Here&#x27;s some old (2005) data: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bjs.gov&#x2F;index.cfm?ty=pbdetail&amp;iid=653" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bjs.gov&#x2F;index.cfm?ty=pbdetail&amp;iid=653</a><p>- 20% of people in US had contact with police in the year.\n- 9&#x2F;10 people reported police acted properly\n- 44 million people with interactions, only 1% of those had violent conflict involved with the interaction, that&#x27;s 440 thousand incidents<p>Hell, even the left-leaning WaPo tried to use data to buttress their&#x2F;your argument and it&#x27;s just plain embarrassing: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;graphics&#x2F;investigations&#x2F;police-shootings-database&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;graphics&#x2F;investigations&#x2F;polic...</a><p>- 1000 people shot by police in 2019\n- they actually removed the numbers for unarmed, because it was so dismal for their message\n- less than 50 &quot;unarmed&quot; black people killed by police in 2019<p>Take an honest look at these numbers and then please try again to justify your position about how there&#x27;s a &quot;high chance that the individual will end up shot by the police&quot; because by the light of the data you&#x27;re living in a fantasy land.')
