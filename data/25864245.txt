To buy Parler&#x27;s contract claim, you&#x27;d have to believe that Amazon&#x27;s lawyers are so stupid that they set out a TOS for the world&#x27;s largest hosting provider that didn&#x27;t give AWS the right to boot customers, which is something AWS --- really, every hosting provider --- has to do all the time. You almost have to not know anything about the hosting business to think there could be a case here.<p>But if you need to read a judge laughing Parler&#x27;s claims off, well, now you can. Real &quot;based&quot; energy in excerpting the AWS AUP in their complaint and clipping it right before the clause that gives AWS the right to terminate service without notice to customers who violate their AUP. The judge, uh, noticed.<p>(As the judge points out, among the many problems with Parler&#x27;s restraint of trade argument, there&#x27;s the fact that AWS doesn&#x27;t host Twitter&#x27;s feed.)')
