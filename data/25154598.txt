I&#x27;ve been a weekly reader for over 5 years now and I always find their analyses of my own country (Canada) more eloquent and poignant than our own media. I do recommend carefully choosing which articles to take in without a grain or tablespoon of salt. They have excellent practices but they still have an agenda and a world-view through which they frame things. Sometimes I think I&#x27;m being smart and reading between the lines but as the thread&#x27;s target article aptly points out: I&#x27;m so swamped with information I never really go down the rabbit hole of proving&#x2F;disproving my thoughts on articles.<p>I see the paper as a friend who I find annoying in a few ways but that I nevertheless appreciate and generally trust.')
