If you burn lithium to turn a generator, I&#x27;d argue it&#x27;s not much more a battery than burning oil to turn a generator. If you wanted a battery, you&#x27;d need a non-generator variant. That is where I&#x27;d differentiate.<p>Could also use Flourine and burn CO2, might be a viable carbon sink. Flouroalkanes from burning CO2 would be organically inert, don&#x27;t deplete ozone if released and don&#x27;t bioaccumulate. Only downside is they&#x27;re very good greenhouse gases if you don&#x27;t burn them down to the alkanes that are solid or liquid are normal temperatures. Those you could easily bury deep below the earth.<p>The only issue is obtaining a shitton of flourine to burn your carbon with and then not blowing yourself up in the process.<p>(Also yes, Flourine will burn CO2 and act as the oxidizer)')
