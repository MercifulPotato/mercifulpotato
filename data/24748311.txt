For the people out there that have: I&#x27;m sorry.<p>The &#x27;plot&#x27; is akin to <i>24</i>, in that there is a good guy that kill bad guys. But the writing style, the aggressive use of exposition, the terrible dialog, and the total lack of logic in scene construction make the book just terrible. The part where the protagonist blinks out the message &quot;Airstrike now. 35 41 46 N &#x2F; 51 25 23 E&quot; (the coordinates for Tehran) is comically unrealistic. If you actually put that into morse code you get : .- .. .-. ... - .-. .. -.- . &#x2F; -. --- .-- .-.-.- &#x2F; ...-- ..... &#x2F; ....- .---- &#x2F; ....- -.... &#x2F; -. &#x2F; -..-. &#x2F; ..... .---- &#x2F; ..--- ..... &#x2F; ..--- ...-- &#x2F; . You try blinking that out.<p>I&#x27;ve no idea who his editor was or who his ghostwriter is, but good Lord, Ben really needs to get better at spotting grifters. That book is hot garbage.')
