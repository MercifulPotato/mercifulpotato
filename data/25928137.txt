Sandboxing is about security.<p>Containers are mainly modern chroots.<p>&gt; And also it seems processes and workflows are stuck in the 1990&#x27;ies further preventing progress<p>Quite the opposite, especially in Debian. The distribution has been driving a lot of innovative projects including reproducible builds.<p>&gt; So some kind of base system + app store<p>A curated archive of software, reviewed by trusted packagers and thoroughly tested by a large number of users? It&#x27;s called APT and existed a decades before &quot;app stores&quot;<p>&gt; where the app developers can push sandboxed stuff<p>No thanks, I&#x27;ll never trust upstream developers to sandbox their own stuff.
