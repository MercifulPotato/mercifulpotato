It all depends on how they integrate with the rest of the grid which is something rarely considered when I hear speeches about having more and more renewables in the future<p>Once you decided to stop nuclear and go wind&#x2F;solar, what do you do when it&#x27;s 8pm in winter and there is no wind? =&gt; You fire up your coal&#x2F;gas plants<p>The answer could be &quot;storage&quot; but right now, as you can see from the stats, this option is not favored and I believe there are good reasons. As you can imagine, if storage was an easy solution today, Germany&#x27;s emissions would be much smaller.<p>Hopefully it becomes a more viable solution in the near future but at the moment we&#x27;re still far from it')
