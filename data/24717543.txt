Item(by='dustinmoris', descendants=None, kids=[24717984, 24717911, 24717649], score=None, time=1602150778, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24717482, text='Well the UK chart also shows that:<p>- Influenza and Pneumonia are counted as one, because the majority of Pneumonia deaths are due to Influenza<p>- Influenza and Pneumonia deaths have been SUBSTANTIALLY lower ever single month in 2020 than the five year average<p>- Of the deaths where both influenza and pneumonia, and COVID-19 were mentioned on the death certificate, the underlying cause of death was counted as COVID-19 in 95.8%<p>So basically this alone already highlights the gross overestimation of COVID-19 deaths. I feels plain wrong to attribute almost all deaths to COVID-19 when the person also had Influenza when it is evident that we&#x27;ve seen so many less Influenza deaths this year. Clearly we&#x27;re not giving Influenza enough credit in being the cause of death which is wrong IMHO.<p>Also further below when you look at the age distribution, the vast majority of deaths happened in 80+ year olds, even more in 84+ year olds, which makes one really think. COVID-19 is not nearly as much of a threat to the vast majority of the population as we are made to believe. It seems the people who are dying from COVID-19 are those who have reached an age which is well beyond the average life expectancy of a first world country.<p>Not saying that COVID-19 isn&#x27;t a threat, it is, but it&#x27;s not like the Spanish flu which was killing predominantly young people or the plague which was wiping people of all age groups.<p>EDIT: Typos corrected.')
