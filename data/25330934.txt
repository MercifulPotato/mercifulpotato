The widely quoted figure of \n  10,000 containers lost every year [1] was the basis for\n  reports by organisations ranging from Friends of the Earth \n  to the US Congress.\n\n  But the World Shipping Council (WSC), a trade body that\n  represents 90 per cent of the global shipping industry,\n  disputes that number [2].\n\n  Based on surveys of its members the WSC reported that for\n  the years 2011, 2012, and 2013 there were around 2,683\n  containers lost each year [3]. Combining that data with\n  surveys going back to 2008, the WSC reports that excluding\n  ‘catastrophic events’ the number of containers lost every\n  year is a mere 546.\n</code></pre>\nHmmm, the wikipedia page says the same thing too, just after the initial 10k quote:<p><pre><code>  A more recent survey for the six years 2008 through 2013\n  estimates average losses of individual containers\n  overboard at 546 per year, and average total losses\n  including catastrophic events such as vessel sinkings or\n  groundings at 1,679 per year [.]</code></pre>')
