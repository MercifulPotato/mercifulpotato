I was definitely being radical on purpose — perhaps to highlight what seems to me as a blatant reality that our  can’t go on forever (and that we can work towards remodeling so it doesn’t happen that way).<p>Instead, I see downvotes and the parent comment received a straw man argument. I wouldn’t be surprised if I was being seen as an « integrist », except trust me — I’m not. Please, let’s discuss and not fight against one another. I know HN is much better suited to that than some other platforms. :)')
