On the other hand, there is not much to discuss:<p>&gt; And while Iâ€™m certain now that CentOS Linux cannot do what CentOS Stream can to solve the openness gap, I am confident that CentOS Stream can cover 95% (or so) of current user workloads stuck on the various sides of the availability gap.<p>I am not sure anyone felt &quot;stuck&quot; on CentOS 7 or CentOS 8 (of course, now they do).<p>Also, from <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.itprotoday.com&#x2F;linux&#x2F;community-concerns-prompt-red-hat-drop-centos-centos-stream" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.itprotoday.com&#x2F;linux&#x2F;community-concerns-prompt-r...</a>:<p>&gt; [...] Fedora for example, do have a lot of bidirectional community involvement. Unfortunately, CentOS was never like that. It was always a community of users, so that that contribution model was mostly one way.<p>So I don&#x27;t think they are wrong here but it&#x27;s their fault. Canonical benefits from developers using Ubuntu on their laptops and private servers, maintining PPAs etc. Nothing prevented RH to give RHEL for free to developers sans support to get a similar effect. I don&#x27;t think Stream is going to cut it. I run Ubuntu LTS or Debian on my VMs because they are largely in sync and I have confidence I can apply my experience in a commercial environment. CentOS stream will have little to do with RHEL 7 environments you&#x27;d encounter in the enterprise. I think HPC community will migrate to Rocky Linux around 2024, at least the academic part.')
