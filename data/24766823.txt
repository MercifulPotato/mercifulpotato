Let&#x27;s say you sweep from left to right over the elements sorted by their left bounds. For each element you encounter you check if it collides with any of the active elements. While doing so, you check if the active element&#x27;s right bounds is left of the current sweep line. If so, it cannot collide with any of the remaining elements, so you can remove it from the active elements. This way the number of active elements usually stays small and you have to check each element only against few other elements.')
