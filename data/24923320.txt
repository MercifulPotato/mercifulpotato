There are some great write ups.<p>Also have you considered buying ZSAâ€™s new Moonlander keyboard? Despite using an ErgoDox EZ for more than a year now, I feel the outermost keys on the keyboard are still uncomfortable for the pinky fingers and the overall thickness of the latter makes for a slightly unnecessarily raised wrist position which the Moonlander solves with its smaller outermost keys and thinness respectively. The angle adjustable thumb cluster also seems more ergonomic.\nOne thing to note though from your current layout is that the Moonlander has four fewer keys, so one has to plan their key map afresh accordingly!<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;people.ergodox-ez.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;people.ergodox-ez.com&#x2F;</a>')
