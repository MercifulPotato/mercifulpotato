They&#x27;re the only place I can still go to in 2021 that doesn&#x27;t feel like getting a window into the dumpster fire that is other social networks like Twitter. The author is also quite right that they shut down viral pathways, which prevents the worst offenders. If I don&#x27;t want to see politics on Reddit, I&#x27;ll never see politics on Reddit.<p>That said, I kinda scoff at the author&#x27;s casual diss of Craigslist and assessment of their advantages. Craigslist has 50 total employees, nearly a billion in revenue, and a strong mission. It&#x27;s not like people haven&#x27;t tried to take them on before. Reddit will not be the next Craigslist any more than r&#x2F;CMV will be the next Reddit. People go to Reddit because it&#x27;s easy to see good content and not see bad content. I 100% attribute that to the ability to mod, downvote, and have community-based subscriptions. The author has a pretty good sense of what makes Reddit good, but has a horrible sense of what makes Craigslist bad.')
