For C code, software without its dynamically linked libraries won&#x27;t even load past the linker, and in their view, a judge&#x2F;jury will see the program as a single work rather than two independent works.<p>This court case will not define what is a derivative work or when two combined works should be seen as independent of each other. It may explore the limits of what is copyrightable and what is fair use, which is interesting in terms of API&#x27;s and compatibility but less so for defining the limits of the GPL as an copyright license.')
