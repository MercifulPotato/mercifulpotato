They don&#x27;t decrease them.<p>It may seem obvious to a coder that &quot;Well, you just submit a pull request.&quot; -- so obvious that it literally <i>goes without saying</i> -- but it was not obvious to me that this was how I should try to tell an open source project &quot;You have a typo.&quot;<p>I spent probably two or more hours yesterday reading articles, writing and rewriting a question that I never posted on HN, etc. It was vastly more time and effort than it took to submit the pull request to correct the typo.<p>I&#x27;m trying to say: Coders need to help non-coders move those things mentally out of their way. They need to find a way to succinctly tell non-coders that they don&#x27;t have to jump through all those hoops and spend hours and hours reading through documentation and looking up procedures and joining email lists.<p>If a writer sees a typo and wants to correct it, they can skip all that stuff and just submit a pull request. It isn&#x27;t hard. It doesn&#x27;t take long and you don&#x27;t have to spend hours and hours doing your homework to find out how to do it.<p>I started to fill out the form and got a pop-up message &quot;This field is usually less than 50 characters...etc&quot; So filling out the form was the best way for me to learn how to fill out the form.<p>And no one ever told me that. They just tried to assure me &quot;We are friendly. We are welcoming. You can join our email list.&quot;<p>That just adds a long list of tasks and work to my end of the equation that makes it look to me like &quot;It is going to take a zillion hours of homework and prep work and networking before you will ever be allowed to suggest a change to the documentation, like correcting a typo.&quot;<p>Having experienced it that way for years, I think that is a huge and unrecognized barrier to participation for non-coders. Having gotten replies for years that just made it look to me like &quot;Yep, you need the equivalent of a four year degree from a university before you can correct a typo.&quot; I&#x27;m telling you that&#x27;s probably a primary reason you see so few non-coders helping with things like documentation.<p>You need a sound bite that strips all that away and tells people &quot;See a typo? Submit a pull request!&quot; That&#x27;s the part non-coders don&#x27;t understand and aren&#x27;t being told.<p>In my opinion as a non-coder who has literally spent <i>years</i> on Hacker News and <i>years</i> wondering &quot;How in the heck does a non-coder get involved with open source???&quot;')
