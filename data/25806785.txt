This never solved anything.<p>It is all text here and there are plenty people who repeat over and over that they are off reddit. They still repeat bs because it&#x27;s a circle jerk and you&#x27;re being punished for not following it. But HN is text too and following OPs recommendation won&#x27;t help at all.<p>I think the opposite is the way to go. Flood trains you to see bs before it reaches any regions which are relevant for decision. I see that constantly when I watch my parents shopping on amazon and trying to avoid those prime dark patterns the put all over the process. They have to THINK about it. Literally stop and look on all those buttons, links, symbols where I just flow past it without even having to read more than a word. It works.')
