My older son is fairly stoic and in 9th grade; he&#x27;s doing pretty well in school (A&#x27;s and B&#x27;s).  My younger son is in 6th grade and hates it; plus, he is having a hard time adjust to the multiple subject &#x2F; multiple teacher concept in middle school (his grades are horrible).<p>I feel like the school system, in my area, has made zero curriculum adjustments and is just trying to pound a square peg into a round hole.  In times such these, I think schools should dial back on remote work load and focus on math and english and try to make everything else lightweight and fun.  Maybe also make electives completely optional.')
