The samples are x10 larger than I understood at first. However, please keep in mind that the subset of white ph&#x2F;patients is almost 4 times larger than black ph&#x2F;black patient. Data fitting seem questionable from there on. 4x is not that large of a scale but still analyses should have been more nuanced from here.  For example, hospitals are not considered a variable at all. I would think that it is a major one')
