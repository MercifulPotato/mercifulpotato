It is explicitly focused on Classical, and its filtering is focused on what you&#x27;d want out of a Classical-focused search.<p>For instance, with Glass - there are 171 albums on Idagio.\nAnd it breaks them down with works, instrumentation, ensembles, soloists, genres (piano solo, chamber, secular vocal. etc.), conductors, and recording date.<p>If you want to compare the 22 piano solo albums that Jeroen van Veen has recorded of Glass&#x27;s music - easy to pull all of them up quickly.<p>Their encoding is also vastly superior to Spotify or (yikes) YouTube Music. If you have a decent signal-chain for listening, high-quality components, and enjoy Classical... Idagio is head-and-shoulders above the rest.')
