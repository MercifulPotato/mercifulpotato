We looked them up all the time.  Voters were expected to be able to know exactly where their elected officials lived. It was also one way of verifying that they actually lived within their district.<p>But because basic knowledge has become weaponized and abused by nutjobs, the general public now feels this is a threat. How much society has changed in a very short time.')
