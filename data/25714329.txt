I lived an entirely sedentary lifestyle for the first 30 years of my life, hated all sport and physical activity. Dated a girl who taught me the joys of exercise and movement and I&#x27;ve been hooked on running for the past 4 years.<p>Takes some time to build up a base, and of course you need to be careful if you are quite heavy initially like I was. If you just listen to your body and don&#x27;t overdo it, it all comes together pretty naturally. While bad form is a risk, a lot of what I&#x27;ve read seems to indicate that your body will naturally find a running gait that is optimal for your body and minimizes impact. Running without headphones also helps, just listen to your footfalls and adjust your stride to minimize impact. (I can&#x27;t find any studies on this, but I can&#x27;t help but feel that a lighter footfall is likely minimizing impact on joints somehow)')
