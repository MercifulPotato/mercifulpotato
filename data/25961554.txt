I only have the itch (and time) to throw together a small web app about once every 6 months.<p>A better rebuttal is, do you make a [small] outdoor irrigation system or fix a [simple] head gasket &quot;once every 6 months&quot;? I added the adjectives to better compare to his stated &quot;small web app&quot;.<p>I think it&#x27;s reasonable to expect someone who &quot;throw[s] together a small web app about once every 6 months&quot; to be able to do it without googling, but it isn&#x27;t how software development is taught. When studying something to master it you start with the basics and do them over and over until you understand them. We don&#x27;t (tend to) do that in software development, I think for two primary reasons: 1) there&#x27;s more &quot;important, urgent&quot; things to do and 2) things change so quickly that probably half of what you learn today will be unused in a year (of course if you learn the very basics those rarely change, but I&#x27;m talking about the things we all know change so frequently, but were good decisions at the time)')
