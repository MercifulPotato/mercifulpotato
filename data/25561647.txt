It&#x27;s a huge problem that is nowhere close to solved. I worked as a founder in the ed tech space for around six years and sold two profitable companies, so hopefully I can give you some insight after checking out the actual game.<p>I really think you need to introduce each concept sequentially with periodic reinforcement, as it is impractical to expect any student at any level of education to read through an entire embedded Google Doc with instructions before playing the game. I sincerely believe you could take this concept to an actual product if you work on the engagement and adaptive learning aspects.<p>Just to get this out and validate the concept is an achievement in itself. I worked on all kinds of failed prototypes before finding one that worked. I am sure you guys are going to do great things!')
