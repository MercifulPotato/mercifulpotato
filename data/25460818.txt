He isn&#x27;t sitting on billions in cash that he stole from people and can easily just trickle down to his employees (that&#x27;s not how companies work).  The free market decided that the company he formed and ran was worth X and X changes on a daily basis depending on how it&#x27;s being run.  That money came from people who gave it to him freely.  He isn&#x27;t exploiting workers that can&#x27;t leave at any time...they aren&#x27;t slaves.  Bezos&#x27; wealth comes because he created Amazon and I think many people are helped by Amazon and use it frequently (myself included)...including millions of people during COVID that would have otherwise not been able to go out and get the goods they need.<p>Amazon employs a ton of employees that make a lot of money (higher level than the warehouse or delivery drivers).  What better conditions do you suggest?  Safety or compensation?')
