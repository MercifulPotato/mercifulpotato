The problem is, if you ignore ethics, which of course says a lot about your priorities, still two fold.<p>This is offensive and I suggest you re-read my post (as well as the HN comment guidelines). I am not ignoring ethics, I specifically mention informed consent. I also have no idea what you mean by &#x27;so you never asked anyone&#x27; - this is a hypothetical??<p>&gt;The goal is to get millions vaccinated, not just a few elderly so that some people can go out partying again without feeling bad.<p>You&#x27;re also strawmanning me pretty hard here.<p>&gt; But this small benefit would have caused tremendous issues in a couple of weeks &#x2F; months.<p>Not even sure how you come to this conclusion (you seem 100% certain that distributing the now-proven safe mRNA vaccine early would have caused tremendous issues, somehow).<p>You seem to want to be aggressive to me and strawman me as somebody who doesn&#x27;t care about covid victims (my grandmother is 85 and has serious comorbidity risks thank you very much) so I am not going to respond further but I suggest you focus on arguments, not insults and dismissive comments. You can go to reddit and much of the rest of the internet for that.')
