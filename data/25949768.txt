And if you arbitrarily lump things together, you can probably find an arbitrary number of victims. BLM is connected to socialism, so I guess you could count the 100 million dead in the Chinese Culture revolution and so on.<p>2) In the same vein, there seems to be only one actual victim of protester violence at the capitol, and that one also looks more like an accident (got hit in the head with a thrown item, which is of course a stupidly dangerous attack, but also common at BLM riots)<p>3) That&#x27;s not CHAZ cooperating with authorities, but authorities cooperating with CHAZ. Just because &quot;your people&quot; welcomed the secession, doesn&#x27;t make it any more democratic.<p>Also, there are videos from the capitol of security staff chatting with the protesters. So I guess they were also cooperating, and hence, by your logic, democratic.<p>Anyway, let&#x27;s end here. There really is no point. It is just always interesting how warped people&#x27;s perceptions can be.')
