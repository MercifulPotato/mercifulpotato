They found these high-low frequency neurons in a number of different network architectures, and at around the same network depth in each case. I wonder how this insight could be useful. Can you train a network layer by layer and then connect the pre-trained layers? Like maybe train a &quot;high-low frequency detector&quot; layer on generated inputs of high-low frequency images, and then somehow put it 1&#x2F;3 of the way into a network, maybe one whose other layers have been trained similarly to recognize other features.')
