I had a few job interviews where they didn&#x27;t understand my request to change the keyboard layout... or the computer was too locked down, or whatever.  That, and typing on literally anyone else&#x27;s computer is a pain, unless they&#x27;re kind enough to let you install Dvorak.<p>That being said, this year I decided enough was enough, and I worked to relearn QWERTY. Initially it was really hard, but after a few weeks, I managed to get to a comfortable speed.  Here is an image showing my QWERTY averages since March of this year: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;RESfuFS.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;RESfuFS.png</a> My average has plateau&#x27;d around 80wpm, which is a great speed, and I managed to do that without sacrificing my Dvorak speed, which sits at 125wpm. Finally, to throw a wrench into it, I also decided to learn Colemak this year... and with enough practice I&#x27;ve gotten to the point where I can switch between the three without any issue.')
