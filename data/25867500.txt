Item(by='Melting_Harps', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611282246, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25864421, text='&gt; American software engineers should form a special interest group.<p>It could be that one of the most prominent of the FAANGs is actually supporting things like this [0] under the threat of their lower paid warehouse workers unionizing. But also consider that Google is also going after its tech people who were involved in Unionizing and recently investigated an AI ethicsist [1].<p>I think its clear, most SWE have it (too?) good with amazing salaries and benefits to placate them into indifference or apathy on the matter and go to great lengths to keep them in an infantile servile cocoon&#x2F;echo-chamber while at work, all while they create these abominations on privacy, free speech and the Human psyche while much of the rest of the World&#x27;s working class&#x2F;Industries suffer with under or unemployment altogether, so why risk it?<p>Especially since so much of the labour is through H1 visas who can control and dictate the terms of their employment with the simple decision to terminate them and leave them out in the cold rather easily.<p>It&#x27;s concerning that even Tesla has been so anti-Union if I&#x27;m honest, and speaking as someone who has been in the Auto Industry, mainly German, most of it is highly unionized outside of the US.<p>It was the Big 3&#x27;s fault for being complacent and relaxed about innovation that made it non-competitive and was highlighted in 2008 financial crises how bad it had gotten.<p>I&#x27;m not in favour of Unions unless as an absolute last resort, as in the case with FAANGs devouring of the Market share and its consolidation of the competition. I personally think having Unions only made the situation in 2008 worse for the Big 3 due to wide spread corruption and incompetence from the executive board, design, and engineering departments: but the core of the problem with US car manufacturers is with having a mediocre product in comparison to the rest of the World, rather than it solely being a union based Industry and thus a sure failure.<p>That much is clear and had been the case outside of pick up trucks since the 70s as Japan, Germany and now Korea have eaten the US&#x27; lunch (marketshare) in total national and international deliveries&#x2F;sales YoY and DoD.<p>In the end it didn&#x27;t stop Ford from still offering union based jobs, declining a bailout and they simply deciding to stop making cars now and focused on their stronger selling trucks, SUV products and some EV stuff, some of which is still in the works. They also had a massive marketing push for their Mustang and GT line up in Motorsports that made it rather successful. Though I think GM had more success with its relaunch of the Charger.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t buy any of it myself, but I commend their efforts and still it shows that the &#x27;Unions are the source of all evil&#x27; that many Tech based conglomerates push is not true, especially for Mega Corps like Amazon and Google who have severe and outright horrible labour problems.<p>0: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vice.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;article&#x2F;5dpkad&#x2F;amazon-launches-anti-union-website-to-derail-alabama-union-drive" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vice.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;article&#x2F;5dpkad&#x2F;amazon-launches-anti-...</a><p>1: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnbc.com&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;21&#x2F;margaret-mitchell-google-investigating-ai-researcher-awu-concerned.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnbc.com&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;21&#x2F;margaret-mitchell-google-inv...</a>')
