Then I think it was last year (2019) when it was removed without warning. But like I said Samsung probably buried that info in 5000 lines of an update notification.<p>I can understand new devices being sold would not have the device enabled due to some patent or legal issue. But to have Samsung disable a physical device on a two year old phone is frustrating. I bought the phone I own it Samsung shouldn&#x27;t allowed to do such a thing or at least make it more obvious and give the option to opt out of the change.')
