But I think it also requires the reader to understand pointers pretty well, which, frankly, the majority of developers (who tend to work with interpreted or GC&#x27;d languages that don&#x27;t have pointers &#x2F; pointer arithmetic) probably don&#x27;t have much familiarity with.<p>If a beginner C programmer reads this code, they might not understand until they have a little more experience under their belt.  But I think that&#x27;s ok; if we limited ourselves to writing code that beginners in the language can easily understand, we&#x27;re going to miss out on a lot of important, useful techniques.<p>I do absolutely agree that cleverness should be avoided.  We should optimize for later readers of our code.  But I don&#x27;t really see this as falling into the &quot;clever&quot; camp, at least not in way we mean &quot;unmaintainable code&quot;.')
