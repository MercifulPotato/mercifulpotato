I&#x27;m a generalist software engineer with a strong belief in diversity of thought. Learning as much as I can in diverse domains is one of my daily goals. The more diverse mental models I can build for solving problems, the happier I am. I&#x27;ve worked in factories, delivered pizza, done professional lawn care, gone through a dev bootcamp, and worked as a developer at a health startup. I also try to diversify my hobbies as much as possible as well. I like making art with code, building circuits, dog training, exploring aviation, growing basil, teaching kids how to work with robotics, and much more.<p>I have about 3 years of professional experience, and many more years of hobbyist experience. I have strong opinions, weakly held, and the humility to change my mind according to the evidence as it presents itself.<p>I&#x27;m looking for a role preferentially utilizing Elixir or Python at a company where I would have the opportunity to embrace my generalist skillset and wear a few hats at a time.')
