It absolves them of legal liability for the content posted by their users, providing they moderate illegal content properly.<p>&gt; Should 230 remove the right for companies&#x2F;individuals&#x2F;platforms to have a say in the content they publish?<p>If they wish to be afforded the legal protections offered by 230, yes. It is a choice - not an obligation. A trade-off.<p>&gt; Should platforms not be able to make decisions about how they moderate their own platforms?<p>They should be able to, but, again, accepting the responsibility of being a platform rather than a publisher means that there should be limits to what can be considered inappropriate. There is certainly no easy answer for where that line is drawn, but it does need to be drawn. A heavy-handed moderation policy can effectively become publishing requirements.')
