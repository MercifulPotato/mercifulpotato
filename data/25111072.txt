While it would be easy to write one that works with a server, I loved the idea of hosting and running one for free.<p>Thus, I wrote this URL shortener which does not need a backend to work at all. It uses GitHub issues as a &quot;database&quot;, and unlike most other URL shorteners that do not need backends, this one doesn&#x27;t need a # prefixed to the alias. (i.e. short URLs look clean like this: nlsn.cf&#x2F;1 instead of looking like this: nlsn.cf&#x2F;#1)<p>I haven&#x27;t had the time to work on it more but do let me know what you guys think! Thank you and hope yall enjoy it!')
