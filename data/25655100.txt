They&#x27;re probably recommended because that narrow set used to make up a bigger fraction of the sci-fi readership. Dying Earth is incredibly puerile and laddish. <i>Eyes of the Overworld</i> and <i>Cugel&#x27;s Saga</i> obviously have very little plot. They&#x27;re just these repetitive picaresques where it&#x27;s one hallucinatory thing happening after another, and none of it matters for more than a scene. It&#x27;s kind of like Cartoon Network&#x27;s Adventure Time, but without any lovable characters whatsoever.<p>And then, of course, there is &quot;The Murthe,&quot; in which the hero must defeat a sorceress who is turning wizards into women.')
