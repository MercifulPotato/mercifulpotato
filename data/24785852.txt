Unpredictable for user which is pretty low bar or unpredictable using best known mathematical techniques and available hardware. Wouldn&#x27;t the second category be more less CSPRNG?\nAs for first category and examples given. Requires is a weird question. Strongly requires as in it&#x27;s impossible to make any game or visual effect without it - no. But in case of some design choices you might want some amount of unpredictability. You might want player not to fully predict enemies next move, or you might want a certain graphical effect which varies some parameter randomly within some distribution. Using a very poor pseudorandom generator there might became visible once it gets used in large amounts for placing objects spatially in the form of streaks, shapes or other patterns that wouldn&#x27;t appear if true random or better quality psrng was used.')
