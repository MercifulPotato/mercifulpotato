The American version is based on the US constitution, while the other is based the European declaration of human rights.<p>Human rights in the EU is not limited to stopping government from doing bad things to citizens, but rather give fundamental rights to which a person is inherently entitled simply because she or he is a human being. The right to not be discriminated against is thus not limited by who is doing the discrimination, and it can limit peoples freedom to not associate with people if the reason behind the non-association falls within discrimination laws.<p>The US federal and state laws has also similar laws that limit companies from making completely free choices in regard to who them want to associate with. They are however not fundamental rights, and not as broad as the European versions.')
