I did not put any conditions (like &quot;means tested&quot;) on such enhancements.<p>My post advocated for, in simple terms, &quot;spreading the money around widely&quot;, in order to increase economic stability, reduced poverty and economic inequality.<p>I also implied that doing so would, over the long term, create an economy with less inequality by increasing the share of a (growing) pie by those with the least.<p>And that&#x27;s somehow &quot;Randian?&quot;<p>I guess one (or both) of us need to go back and re-read <i>Atlas Shrugged</i> and <i>The Fountainhead</i>, because IIRC the changes I suggest are completely antithetical to those expressed in Rand&#x27;s writings.<p>Edit: Added clarity WRT to the impact of increased wages&#x2F;enhanced safety net vs. UBI.')
