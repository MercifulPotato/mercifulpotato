That&#x27;s significantly higher than the federal rate set by the Census bureau at $14k&#x2F;year for a single worker with no other household members. A 2 earner household each pulling in $18k a year, or $36k a year, in the cheaper parts of the US is not an easy life, but its also difficult to call it a poverty. That&#x27;s why many government studies of this type will use household income and size, rather than an arbitrary cut off.<p>I&#x27;m don&#x27;t really know what to make of this number. I know what they are trying to express, but it doesn&#x27;t seem well done.')
