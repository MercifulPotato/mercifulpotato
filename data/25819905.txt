It seems pretty common to have &quot;parallel&quot; consciousness among tulpamancers, though I think it depends on how you define and measure that.<p>Our sense of &quot;continuous consciousness&quot; is already an illusion, built from a series of moments.  There are a lot of things about the brain&#x2F;mind like that that I think make tulpas less unbelievable the more you think about it.  Another is that there is a lot of diversity among &quot;normal&quot; brains.  If someone can rotate a 3D shape in their head and you can&#x27;t, you could say one of you has a &quot;real mental issue,&quot; or just acknowledge the diversity.  Also, a lot of our &quot;thinking&quot; is not conscious; it seems like we experience certain thoughts as &quot;our thoughts that we are consciously thinking&quot; because some process picks out a thought here and there and presents it that way.  If another process were to come along and pick out a different 1% of our ongoing thoughts and present it as a coherent stream of consciousness, conforming to a certain personality, it could be another consciousness.<p>I don&#x27;t think the brain&#x2F;mind has one CPU and one program counter and that&#x27;s that, and anything else is an illusion; I think it&#x27;s got lots of cores and lots of threads, and if anything the idea that there&#x27;s one hardcoded main thread is the illusion.')
