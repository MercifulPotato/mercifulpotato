I&#x27;ve been bitten by the lack of such feedback wrt Firefox ESR. My frustration would have gone away completely if the package manager told me, &quot;Hey, we don&#x27;t have the volunteer energy to properly package this complex piece of software and its various dependencies. If you install it, it&#x27;s <i>your</i> job to deal with any problems arising from the discrepancy between Debian&#x27;s support period and Mozilla&#x27;s support period.&quot; As it is, Debian&#x27;s policy advertises a level of stability (or &quot;inertia&quot; as people on this thread seem to refer to it) that isn&#x27;t supported by the exceptions it makes for what are probably two of the most popular packages-- Chromium and Firefox.<p>* do not package software that is vendored upstream<p>I can understand either route, and I&#x27;m sure there are reasonable arguments for either side.<p>What I <i>cannot</i> understand-- and what I find borderline manipulative-- is pretending there&#x27;s some third option where Debian volunteers roll up their sleeves and spend massive amounts of their limited time&#x2F;cognitive load manually fudging around with vendored software to get it in a state that matches Debian&#x27;s general packaging policy. There&#x27;s already been a story posted about <i>two</i> devs approaching what looked to me like burnout over their failed efforts to package the same piece of vendored software.<p>Edit: clarification')
