And the alternative of hoarding unproductive assets is preferable?<p>&gt; <i>houses...a lot of it is its value as a scarce asset that is somewhat resistant to inflation.</i><p>The reason houses are expensive has nothing to do with being resistant to inflation. They get expensive when the supply of the land they sit on gets used up relative to the number of people who want to live in a given area.<p>Houses in rural Kentucky aren’t expensive at all, because nobody wants to live there. That’s the main factor driving prices, not some inflation hedge. If the only reason people bought houses was to hedge inflation, they’d be better off buying stocks which are even more productive and produce returns <i>above</i> inflation.<p>&gt; <i>this is not a great allocation of resources and is an incredibly inefficient way for saving to work.</i><p>After reading this, I could not be more confused.<p>So you’re saying that, the inflation mechanics of fiat is bad because it encourages people to invest in productive businesses and build useful real estate? And it’d be more efficient for society if everybody kept a useless stash of gold bars in their basement and took no risk?<p>How would this make less people want to live in SF and houses suddenly cheaper?')
