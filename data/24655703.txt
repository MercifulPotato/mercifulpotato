None of these algorithms, or as they call them - &quot;AIs&quot;, are yet capable of adding detail (be it spatial or temporal) in a way that actually makes it look believable. It&#x27;s all approximation, a very, very poor approxiation. I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;ll reach that level one day, but for now, we are far away from it.<p>Add to that the fact that those film scans are rarely shared in their original framerate and you&#x27;re getting an absolutely terrible result.')
