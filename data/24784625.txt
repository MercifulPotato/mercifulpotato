It seems they started with a narrative and fit the facts to it.<p>I&#x27;ve taken the trainings referred to in the article and I never once thought they were designed to dissuade discussions about antitrust issues. A more banal interpretation is that Google wants to create a culture that emphasizes creating good products not at the expense of competitors.<p>I&#x27;ve never felt inhibited about having conversations with employees about these issues. The fact is that most of the employees I&#x27;ve discussed these issues with don&#x27;t think Google is violating antitrust regulations.<p>My personal opinion is that a certain segment believe that Google should just be broken up because their data collection practices whether or not there are any real antitrust violations and just see this as a tool to accomplish that end.')
