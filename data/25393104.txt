Like orders of magnitude off. You&#x27;re also assuming the risks of catching COVID are known and minor, but the risks of a vaccine are unknown and possibly off.<p>In reality it&#x27;s the inverse. We have well over a hundred years of research into how vaccines interact with our bodies, as well as similar knowledge of things like manufacturing safety, injection best-practices, etc. While the exact mechanism of the mRNA vaccines is new to vaccines, it&#x27;s been studied very closely in tens of thousands of people over several years (there have been several mRNA vaccines in the pipeline, but due to less immediate advantages their approval is slower going). It&#x27;s mechanism is new for vaccines, but well understood.<p>COVID on the other hand is a virus where some of the immediate, worst effects are known and feel safer. But that&#x27;s completely not true. The immediate effects we know are very dangerous (As a 39yr old male, I stand a 1&#x2F;2000 chance of dying if I get the disease) and you&#x27;re not factoring the risk of unknown long-term effects, which are unknown. It&#x27;s entirely possible that damage done from the virus could have long-term hidden consequences that we won&#x27;t know for many years.<p>So then you&#x27;re left with your risk of catching the virus. Of course, this varies greatly based on behavior and region. You may feel safe, and you may indeed be relatively so, but of the hundreds of thousands of people who found out they tested positive today I&#x27;m willing to bet a good chunk of them felt just as safe as you.')
