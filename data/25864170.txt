Item(by='testmasterflex', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611262810, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25862280, text='Thanks! Sure. Circuit boards are easy. Many suppliers. The tricky part is the casing. Currently we are using Toolless that mill the units with CNC. Thatâ€™s pricy per unit but we can order lower number of units. \nIf we reach enough funding we go for injection moulding. This is the way to go. Start small and expensive, worry about cutting costs and scaling later.<p>We have already built a final prototype that looks and works like final product together with our plastics manufacturer. \nCircuit boards from Pcbway currently but larger order will come from other company most likely. Again there are many. And same with injection moulding; lots of companies do it.<p>I think we will reach crowdfunding goals but if not we may get external funding.')
