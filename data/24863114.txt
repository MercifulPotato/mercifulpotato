(I haven&#x27;t upgraded the app because I&#x27;d rather any bugs be ironed out first.)<p>I think there should be more details on what customers get with either Pay-Once (which all existing purchasers get), and&#x2F;or the Membership.<p>If I were a new user, I would think that Pay-Once means that I&#x27;m set for life(time of the product) (seeing as how it&#x27;s equivalent to slightly under 3 years of membership payments), but the comments here sound like there&#x27;s a basic feature set that new users would have to pay ~$30 for at first, and newer features would be restricted to people who commit additional regular annual payments.<p>It&#x27;s <i>very</i> confusing.')
