When these strategies blow up in their faces, it wipes them out completely, to the level of requiring bailouts.<p>Not a single hedge fund has gone bankrupt from GME, much less gotten a bailout. I can virtually guarantee you that none will. Melvin was down 53%, but still has more assets than they did in the beginning of 2020. They got an external investment from another hedge fund, but that&#x27;s hardly going bankrupt, and certainly not a bailout.<p>Besides Melvin, not a single other major hedge fund lost more than 20% on Gamestop, let alone went bankrupt.')
