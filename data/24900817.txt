Ratcliffe has also alleged that Russian interference may have benefited Trump&#x27;s 2016 rival candidate Hillary Clinton more than it benefited Trump. American intelligence agencies, the Senate Intelligence Committee and Robert Mueller have maintained that Russia interfered to help Trump. A week before Trump&#x27;s announcement, Ratcliffe had argued that the special counsel investigation put Trump &quot;below the law&quot; because it declined to exonerate Trump. Later, Ratcliffe claimed on Fox News that the special counsel investigation&#x27;s report was not written by special counsel Robert Mueller, but by &quot;Hillary Clinton’s de facto legal team&quot;.[63][8]<p>Democrats asserted Ratcliffe was unqualified and too partisan to serve in such a role, which is historically considered relatively nonpartisan.[64] Some Republicans also privately expressed discontent with his selection and concerns about his ability to be confirmed.[65] However, Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr and Senator John Cornyn expressed confidence in him.[66][67] Democratic senators including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Ron Wyden, a member of the Intelligence Committee, said that Ratcliffe’s only qualification for the office appeared to be &quot;blind loyalty&quot; to Trump, noting that he has promoted some of Trump’s conspiracy theories about the Russia investigation and has called for prosecution of Trump’s political enemies.[68][63] Several former members of the intelligence community expressed concerns that Ratcliffe&#x27;s appointment risked politicizing intelligence work.[5][69] They expressed fear that with Ratcliffe as DNI, Trump would in effect be assuming personal control over the intelligence community, which would then be expected to tell him only what he wants to hear.[70] They stressed the need for intelligence to be &quot;candid, truthful and accurate even if it is unpleasant and does not confirm to the biases of the president&quot;.[8]')
