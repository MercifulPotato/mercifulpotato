Epik&#x27;s marketing material explicitly mentions both &quot;fully transferrable&quot; and &quot;convertible to dollars&quot; - this combination means that you&#x27;re intentionally running a service that can be used for money transfers, and thus you need to ensure KYC (know your customer) and AML (anti money-laundering) compliance or shut down that service.')
