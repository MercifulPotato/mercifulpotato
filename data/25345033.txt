If you&#x27;re going too fast, pull the nose up, too slow, push the nose down. If you&#x27;re sinking too quickly, add throttle, sinking too slowly add throttle. This is the reverse of what you&#x27;d normally think in airplane controls. Push the stick down to point the nose down and sink faster. But, Chuck Yeager&#x27;s advice was that intuitively, you actually get better control of the glide path by thinking about throttle as up&#x2F;down rate and stick up&#x2F;down as speed control.')
