There are a lot of Ripple gateways, like Bitstamp, with long issued IOUs accessible in the Ripple network. Since one can find a route to swap for XRP it’s sort of an exchange, and not one that knows whether you’re in the US or not in some cases, until you go to cash out. But that means they’re still facilitating trade of a potential SEC violating security to US citizens in the meantime, perhaps. Or are all these exchanges closing their gateways too? Defaulting on IOUs? Probably hasn’t happened yet but that would really signal the end of XRP. Guessing it’s going to get worse for Ripple.')
