He makes a <i>very</i> solid case that capitalism can&#x27;t really do anything else -- he doesn&#x27;t just ask the reader to take this on faith (I would have hated it if that were the case).<p>The book does use a lot of such analysis, which can be pretty offputting if you&#x27;re not used to it<i></i>, but each such example is really cogent and well supported, so overall I found it a pretty phenomenal aggregation of history and very solid analysis&#x2F;math for how we think about what&#x27;s sustainable and what isn&#x27;t.<p><i></i> His pattern in the book tends to be 1. strong assertion =&gt; 2. actual argument =&gt; 3. repeat assertion; I did find myself reacting to the first assertion there negatively because they often sound like overgeneralizations at first, but in each case he really did support them.')
