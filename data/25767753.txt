Construct your light cones, see the results.  Warp drive, wormholes, whatever, they all produce CTCs.  You can look into it if you don&#x27;t believe me.<p>2) None of the <i>matter</i> in the universe was expanding, the <i>spacetime</i> was.  You&#x27;re not the first person to think of this.  Probably the first question that popped into anyone&#x27;s mind when variants of the concept were being kicked around.  Anyway, the expansion doesn&#x27;t generate CTCs because there&#x27;s no information and&#x2F;or matter to circle around, it&#x27;s just the stretch between these.<p>Now, you&#x27;ll probably ask about -- well, why can&#x27;t we shrink spacetime selectively to get around all of that?  Ah, that requires some exotic matter, matter with negative mass-energy.  No, anti-matter does not have negative mass-energy (first thing people reach for).  In fact, we&#x27;ve never found anything with negative mass-energy and that concept itself raises a ton of fun paradoxes which I could get into.  And you still get CTCs.<p>There&#x27;s probably a large tree of arguments out there on the Internet somewhere which addresses all of these common objections.')
