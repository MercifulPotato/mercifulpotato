After spending two months in a new city, everything was immediately shut down and I was stuck working at home in my 13x13 room I rented.<p>The room I slept in was my office and my dining room as well, not to mention my entertainment room. Instead of seeing all my coworkers (who I was fond of) every day in the office, I now saw my small team during our 15 minute stand ups, which would only occur about 2 or 3 times a week. I saw the gas station clerks more.<p>I hated it, and I didn&#x27;t really have a support system. I&#x27;m in my final year of university now (that work experience was an internship), and I will definitely look primarily for places that will have an actual office environment.')
