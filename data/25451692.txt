They&#x27;re First Amendment, tort, and Section 230 issues.<p>First Amendment issues are hardly specific to tech companies. We have partisan media conglomerates, news outlets, academic institutions, event companies, foundations, religious organizations, and so on. All of those affect the political process. Few are shocked by that notion.<p>If you want a political explanation for the wave of antitrust suits, you could just as easily look to the side bringing the suits---repeatedly, a bunch of Republic attorneys general---as to the companies on the receiving end. I happen to be very sympathetic to unrolling the Chicago School ideological grip over competition law. And I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised to see some interesting settlements come out of these suits. But it&#x27;s not hard to make a case that violations of these laws are widespread, not just in tech, but that the choice of who to pursue in the current moment largely comes down to partisanship.<p>&gt; They are controlled by and for foreign powers.<p>Not sure what you&#x27;re on about. Last I looked, these are public companies. Their top stockholders are founders and investment firms.')
