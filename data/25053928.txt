The OP has a well paying job and a skill set that allows him&#x2F;her to make this choice. They are placing their family above status of living here which seems like a reasonable thing. I do not understand what I see as hate in your comment?<p>I also hit the tech lotto, have a nice house, etc. and am planing to leave. I worked my ass off for 20 years (with the last 10 being 50+ hour weeks, 150K+ miles per year travel, 2 weeks a month not with my family) to have the opportunity to play in that lotto. Does that make me someone to hate?')
