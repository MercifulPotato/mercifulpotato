For some reason he was always looking over to Phil Wadler, apparently looking for approving nods, but there were none to be found :-)<p>I hear what you are saying. I also find it unfortunate that something simple like UI is so fragmented. But then again, maybe UI is not so simple after all. The current paradigm that SwiftUI copies and evolves is that of React, and it just didn&#x27;t exist 20 years ago. Funny also that this new paradigm was invented for the web first. While a lot of web stuff is crappy indeed, this is one of those examples where it produced a superior paradigm that is now copied and evolved outside of web as well, for example by SwiftUI, also by Flutter.<p>That&#x27;s just how progress looks like.')
