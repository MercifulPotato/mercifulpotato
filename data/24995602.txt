Additionally, you don&#x27;t &quot;break userspace&quot; for millions of forms online that no longer work as the developer intended.<p>However, I&#x27;m skeptical that we need to encode this at all into the standard, since setting the `disabled` attribute on the submission button after submission is pretty much test case #0 of any serious online form development.<p>Amusingly, things have gotten a lot better since 2015 when this was written. That blob of JQuery is now replaced with binding the `disabled` attribute to `isSubmitted` state on your React-based webform. An interesting glimpse into the web-that-used-to-be.')
