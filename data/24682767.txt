A list of lists is also exactly what you would expect:<p><pre><code>  list of lists: \n      - \n          - first sublist \n          - goes here \n      - \n          - second sublist \n          - is here \n</code></pre>\nproduces<p><pre><code>  {&#x27;list of lists&#x27;: [[&#x27;first sublist&#x27;, &#x27;goes here&#x27;], [&#x27;second sublist&#x27;, &#x27;is here&#x27;]]}\n</code></pre>\nI don&#x27;t think either of these are hidden.  Yes, explicit examples would be nice, but assuming things not shown are impossible seems strange to me.  Would you assume Python can&#x27;t do lists of dicts, or lists of dicts of dicts?
