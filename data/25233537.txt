It&#x27;s not to be compared to regular bikes, but other ebikes, because the property of being an ebike is the primary purpose, and anything is auxiliary. In this case, commuters want lightness in their bike so that they need to carry less and the bike range is higher (F = ma, where one wants to reduce mass).')
