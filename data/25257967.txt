You should be getting around 40% of your calories from carbs.<p>The problem is that some foods have nothing but carbs, and if you eat a lot of those, you&#x27;ll either consume too many calories overall or fail to get necessary nutrients. So eat fewer white, starchy foods like potatoes, and more leafy foods, squashes, and other colorful foods.<p>Similarly, whole grains bring a lot of vitamins and fiber, while refined grains like white rice are reduced to just the starch. It&#x27;s just fine that those whole grains also have carbs in them. That&#x27;s actually a good thing, becuase you do need calories for energy. You just need more than that.')
