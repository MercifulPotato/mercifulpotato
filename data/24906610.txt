The intranet is hosted on-prem servers.<p>Can anyone share their experience.<p>Amazon Worklink: \nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;aws.amazon.com&#x2F;worklink&#x2F;<p>With Amazon WorkLink, employees can access internal web content as easily as they access any public website, without the hassle of connecting to their corporate network. When a user accesses an internal website, the page is first rendered in a browser running in a secure container in AWS. Amazon WorkLink then sends the contents of that page to employee phones as vector graphics while preserving the functionality and interactivity of the page. This approach is more secure than traditional solutions because internal content is never stored or cached by the browser on employee phones, and employee devices never connect directly to your corporate network.')
