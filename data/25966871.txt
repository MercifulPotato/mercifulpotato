They are there just to muddy the water, and to give the ex-professor a soapbox for name-calling.<p>The evidence is presented in a deliberately confused order, and very selectively. New evidence is not permitted. Wikipedia is ruled by people like that, now. We have to wait for them to die before we can have pages not somebody&#x27;s hobby-horse.')
