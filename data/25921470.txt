Control groups are no-treatment if no approved treatment exists, or current standard of care if there&#x27;s an approved treatment. That&#x27;s standard practice.<p>&gt; It seems that whenever a perfect placebo be permissible, that is what is being used rather than the current standard of care.<p>If by &quot;perfect placebo,&quot; you mean &quot;no treatment,&quot; that&#x27;s not correct, and is considered unethical.')
