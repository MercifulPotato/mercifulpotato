Item(by='slg', descendants=None, kids=[25754447], score=None, time=1610486109, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25753283, text='&gt;I think the climate science, reporting, and advocacy seems pretty good (at least with respect to bias)<p>Doesn&#x27;t this blow a hole in your whole argument?  If there is little bias in this climate change coverage and conservatives still object to it, what makes you think they will accept any form of objective truth?<p>&gt;Consistency, consistency, consistency. It&#x27;s not enough to be honest or well-behaved once, it has to be a protracted effort over time. On the basis of this one event, a reasonable person wouldn&#x27;t conclude that NYT is genuinely aspiring toward honesty and neutrality, much less someone who tends toward paranoia.<p>You aren&#x27;t going to get an argument from me that the mainstream media is perfect on this.  However I think it is clear that centrist and left leaning media is much much better about this than right leaning media.<p>&gt;I don&#x27;t think that &quot;the right&quot; has ever been this detached from mainstream epistemology in the first place--I don&#x27;t think our institutions have ever been as compromised as they are now, at least not on a left-right axis. But there&#x27;s probably no reason to limit our case studies to corruption of a left-right nature; we could equally look for any institution that lost the trust of a group of people and then gained it back (in part or in full).<p>Fair enough, but the loss of trust needs to be linked primarily to a <i>perceived</i> lack of truthfulness and I can&#x27;t think of any examples of that either that aren&#x27;t linked with an <i>overt</i> lack of truthfulness.  Right now any bias in reporting, no matter how small, is magnified and even truthful and completely objective reporting is seen as biased.  I simply don&#x27;t know how you regain trust after that when the problem is more exaggerated in people&#x27;s perception than in reality.')
