Item(by='coder543', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603843888, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24913307, text='Related but semi-random: it slightly annoys me that force-with-lease goes through the entire effort of force pushing if it thinks the remote is identical to the local. It’s not going to change anything either way, and it could save me the second or two of waiting on it to do nothing. If local is already identical to the last known state of the remote, and I’m trying to force push, the actual error is that I didn’t edit the local branch in the way I thought I had when I decided it was time to force push.<p>(I realize there is a possible error message case if the remote has changed... but I don’t feel like this command is the best one to use to discover whether the remote has changed, if you have no changes you actually intend to force push.)')
