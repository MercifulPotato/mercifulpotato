There were various factors that led to success. The BAs were probably most integral. We also held regular week-long workshops with the customer to work on the backlog, with the architect&#x2F;tech lead (me) and dev team leads all present too. There was a group of pilot users, that always had access to the latest features. And of course, we used automated tests.<p>Any big corp, like Deloitte, should be able to deliver a relatively simple website, even if it has multiple integrations with legacy systems. And they should be able to advise and steer the customer if they are woolly on what they actually need - there is only so much blame you can put at the customer&#x27;s door when systems like this are a disaster.')
