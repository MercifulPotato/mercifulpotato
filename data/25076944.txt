Item(by='jlokier', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605224932, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25076729, text='&gt; You realize that you literally have to turn off the network connection completely to prevent dozens of companies from getting this information every waking moment<p>I do.  (A look at my comment history would show I know quite a bit about networking.)<p>Again, the question being addressed, or actually the assertion being challenged, was: <i>&quot;hashes of the binaries I run don&#x27;t exactly reveal any sensitive personal information about me&quot;</i><p>I replied to show that those hashes do reveal that information.<p>But I threw in that how the hashes are sent (revealing the IP constantly) also reveals sensitive and personal information.<p>You might think that&#x27;s inevitable, maybe so trivial it doesn&#x27;t merit a mention.  But in fact it isn&#x27;t.  It&#x27;s purely a consequence of a technical decision.  There are many ways Apple could perform the hash check without revealing your ephemeral IP to Apple.<p>Still, you asked what I thought was &quot;how does sending your hash to Apple reveal where you go?&quot;.<p>Since you asked, I answered.<p>But perhaps I misunderstood your question, and you were asking how does Apple having the hash reveal where you are, not the act of sending it to them.<p>Fair enough.')
