I think this is a pretty good selling point for StaticBackend, for a few reasons:\n1) what if you get too big for the hosting?\n2) what if the company goes go out of business!\n3) what if the company determines that hosting you is against the T&amp;C (see the Parler thing this week, for example, although I completely agree with AWS&#x27; decision there).<p>I don&#x27;t think self-hosting is really a good idea if you can avoid it, but a lot of people are soothed by the idea that they could, if they really needed to.')
