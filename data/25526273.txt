Different situations care about different aspect of sex&#x2F;gender.<p>In sports, it isn&#x27;t really relevant what a person thinks about themselves. Gender is used as a proxy for expected performance envelope - you don&#x27;t want to mix people with radically different characteristics, because that would not make for fair competition. I&#x27;m guessing that eventually we&#x27;ll stop talking about &quot;men&quot; and &quot;women&quot; teams, and figure out new terms that directly reference the relevant biological characteristics.')
