You can just go read them. I don&#x27;t see where they say &quot;if trades are made with customer cash and not on margin you don&#x27;t have to account for them in the equity group collateral requirement&quot;. That also wouldn&#x27;t make much sense; the clearinghouse protects participating firms from <i>each other</i>, not just from their customers.')
