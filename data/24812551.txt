I see this argument all the time from otherwise intelligent people and its amazing to me. Why bother making murder illegal? It will only stop law abiding people from killing anyone, and criminals will still murder people! Yes I know this is a reducto fallacy, however the argument you&#x27;re making is fundamentally that no laws should ever be created for anything since some people are going to end up breaking them. The argument I hear commonly sited is that guns are easy to get in Chicago, or Mexico, which both have very strict gun restrictions. Although this is true, it fails to take into account that the guns are so easy to get because of the incredible lax rules in the nearby suburbs&#x2F;across the boarder. The reason guns are being used to kill people in Mexico is because how stupidly easy it is to get them in Texas.<p>The police in the United Kingdom DONT HAVE GUNS, because the general populace dont have them and the number of per capita gun deaths is &lt; 1&#x2F;1000 what it is in the US [1].<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_countries_by_firearm-related_death_rate" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_countries_by_firearm-r...</a>')
