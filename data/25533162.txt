How much did you tip? How much money do you have in your bank account?&quot; and it turns out I tipped a very small fraction of the money in my bank account despite &quot;the delivery driver risking his life to deliver nutrition you require to survive&quot; then you might be well within your rights to ask me to justify this behaviour of mine contradictory to my stated morals and see if the argument extends.')
