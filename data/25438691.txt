The test scores correlate with ability to perform well at _early_ phase of language curricula â€“ but this is exactly the phase when the learners are still using the &quot;general processing mechanisms&quot; to process language, and not the mechanisms specialized for language that get engaged when they gain fluency years later.<p>Sadly, this is underappreciated in the general psychology and linguistics community. Some researchers in Second Language Acquisition research community are more concerned about this kind of mis-interpretation and confusion of different meanings of &quot;language skills&#x2F;aptitude&quot;.')
