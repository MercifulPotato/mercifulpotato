It sounds like a business idea <i>I would have</i> and then come to realize how labor intensive and inefficient the entire thing was.<p>At the same time, I wonder why there is not a well developed, well documented cross-compiling toolchain available for (whatever you are doing with a mac build server) ?  Why not use your local (laptop) mac to do the dirty work and then run a (very complicated) cross compiling chain on a much cheaper, non mac, cloud instance ?')
