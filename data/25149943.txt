For instance, I say &quot;I&#x27;m going to the bank&quot;.  But really this means &quot;I&#x27;m going to a branch of the bank that I bank with&quot;.  The same occurs with words like theatre, mall, etc.  I kind of think this is a holdover from a time where towns only had one theatre, one bank, one school, etc.<p>It would be correct to have a conversation like:<p>&gt; Let&#x27;s go to the mall.<p>&gt; Which one?<p>&gt; I don&#x27;t know.  Do you have a preference?<p>Then we have places like &quot;school&quot;, &quot;work&quot;, &quot;home&quot; where we drop the &quot;the&quot;.  If we say &quot;I&#x27;m going to the school&quot; this implies that we&#x27;re going for a different reason than normal where we&#x27;d say &quot;I&#x27;m going to school&quot;.<p>Proper names don&#x27;t usually have &quot;the&quot; in front of them but then we say &quot;The Ukraine&quot; and &quot;The Philippines&quot; and &quot;The Yukon&quot; as if we&#x27;re distinguishing them from other Ukraines.<p>My wife is non-native English speaker so I encounter this a lot.  I understand the confusion of this.  Plus a lot of other languages don&#x27;t think this way.  When you grow up in a language where you don&#x27;t care about specificity while you&#x27;re talking, it becomes pretty difficult to start thinking about it later in life.')
