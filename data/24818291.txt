Sure, you need to know Python, SQL, Data Warehouses, Data Modeling, etc., but to me by far the biggest problems have to do with the entire architecture i.e. How do you extract data from potentially unreliable data sources, pull that data into some staging area, build further workflows that base off of this raw data to reliably update or create data warehouses&#x2F;marts or deploy ml models. How do you allow everyone in your company to access and work with the data in a compliant and secure way? How do you test any of this? How can distributed teams, sometimes technical, sometimes more business oriented interact with the architecture and add&#x2F;control data and release it into the overall company data stream? Has anyone found a reliable and maintainable way to setup CI&#x2F;CD for company data architecture&#x2F;pipelines&#x2F;projects?<p>To me these are the big problems. And if anyone has any resources for any of these topics I would be super interested, since I deal with these problems daily :)')
