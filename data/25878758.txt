I live in a &quot;democrat-run city&quot; to use a phrase popularized by the weird right, and people here say Merry Christmas if someone says Merry Christmas to them or they know each other from church, and say Happy Holidays if you don&#x27;t know the holiday someone celebrates and they&#x27;re not wearing a Christmas tree sweater. It&#x27;s a pretty easy algorithm. I don&#x27;t think anyone feels like Christmas spirit is lacking.<p>Your last few sentences are right: the people I know who are outraged about the war on Christmas are Christians of a certain type who feel like they have not received what has been promised to them. They&#x27;re well-off, have houses built for them in nice new suburban developments, have a couple cars, don&#x27;t seem like they&#x27;re hurting for money or jobs, but they&#x27;ve just really got a chip on their shoulder about other people getting what they deserve.<p>I&#x27;m probably re-centering a category right now :) This was a very interesting article and it&#x27;s fun to try to find all the examples of this I can.')
