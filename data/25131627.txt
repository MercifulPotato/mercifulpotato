It&#x27;s a fascinating behavior.  I nitpick all the time, though I don&#x27;t actually post the nitpicks unless I really believe it&#x27;s relevant.  Usually I find such comments to be non-productive, as you mention.<p>And yet, even though I often believe nitpicks to be unnecessary parts of any discussion, I also believe there is a certain value to the kind of thinking that leads one to be nitpicky.  A good programmer is often nitpicky, because if they aren&#x27;t they&#x27;ll write buggy code.  The same for scientists, for whom nitpicking is almost the whole point of the job.<p>It&#x27;s just an odd duality where nitpicking is good for certain kinds of work, but fails to be useful in discussions.')
