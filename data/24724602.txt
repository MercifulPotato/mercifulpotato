The API does not make a guarantee about functionality. If I have an endpoint &#x2F;foo and later &#x2F;foo increments an internal counter by 1, the API remains unchanged. Documentation supplements and is not part of the API per se, which is an important distinction. The fact that Documentation and an API are being referred to in conjunction, was a failure that software will suffer for more than the lifetime of my children.')
