I&#x27;m making it out to be a factual argument about the causes of the present political situation, which it very much is.<p>You seem to be unable to separate evaluation of the factual causes and effects of political situation with moral evaluation of the involved actors.<p>&gt; The point is when all levels of government align under one party, which has leaders, it becomes more like a dictatorship.<p>Not really, especially with the jungle primary system which limits the ability of party leaders to control candidate selection in districts where the other major party fails to maintain competitiveness, and especially not where the people retain the powers of initiative, referendum, and recall, and entities outside the dominant party (including, but not limited to, the second place party) are able to bring issues directly to the people through those avenues against the desires of the dominant party.<p>&gt; I donâ€™t care how bad you personally consider the Republican party, there are those who consider Democrats the same way<p>I have said a word (in this thread) about how <i>bad</i> I consider the Republican Party, only how <i>poorly chosen</i> their recent electoral strategy has been for the realities of the State. There&#x27;s other states (and, though to a far lesser extent, other times in not-too-distant California history) where I would say the same broad kind of things (with different details about the problem) about the Democrats.<p>&gt; but when one side becomes to strong you are forced to essentially agree with all positions of that dominant side.<p>Maybe, in some abstract sense, but not on any concrete sense that actually has any bearing on the actual situation in California.')
