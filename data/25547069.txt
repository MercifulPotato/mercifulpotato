If I&#x27;m calling for information, your documentation has failed to make that information accessible (it either wasn&#x27;t documented, or not easy enough to find). If I&#x27;m calling to resolve an issue (technical or billing), it would have been a lot better if it didn&#x27;t happen in the first place.')
