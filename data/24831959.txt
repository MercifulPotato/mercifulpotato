Several friends host their own servers and more recently matrix p2p is rapidly maturing to dump the need for servers at all for many use cases.<p>Federated systems allow people like me to choose to host a server for my own family in my own home closet rack so data shared between my family and I never leave our network.<p>Still others can host matrix as a Tor hidden service where it will be very expensive to even learn who to target.<p>If all participants are using Tor and not using identifying information like a phone number, then bulk deanonymization becomes very expensive, particularly if many small highly targeted social circles roll their own.<p>Signal does not give users a choice but to trust one SPOF setup built under a one size fits all threat model that flows all IP metadata to one place which can leak information regardless of any encryption.<p>I don&#x27;t want a world where one central party holds all communications metadata in one place under one legal jurisdiction with one proprietary memory isolation technology under one threat model.<p>Moxie here likes to point out that email demonstrates all the things that can go wrong with federated systems, but if had chosen the popular alternative of letting a single party take over this whole class of communication, we could all still be using AOL.<p>Internet messaging will outlive us all, and if we advocate everyone lock up their communications with one (even benevolent) dictator, it won&#x27;t end well when the next dictator is not so benevolent.<p>See: pretty much every social network in China and Russia that is now under state control in spite of early promises of privacy by founders.')
