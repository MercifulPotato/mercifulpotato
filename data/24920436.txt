I actually don&#x27;t see any reason to learn C anymore unless you are interfacing with older systems or doing stuff where you need to drop out of Rust&#x27;s guardrails (if you&#x27;re new to systems programming you&#x27;re gonna wanna avoid unsafe code as much as possible).<p>It&#x27;s just a lot harder to write broken programs because of how screamy the compiler is in Rust. You will spend more time getting your code to compile but it will have fewer errors (and be multi-threaded+memory safe by default).<p>I think most production software that is written de novo today will be in Rust over C&#x2F;C++. It&#x27;s just not comparable in my opinion. Like, when we implement stuff we can have logic errors but eliminating the entire class of buffer&#x2F;array&#x2F;pointer failures is extremely useful.')
