Poor people in London are simply far more poor, even though London is far more wealthy than east Germany.<p>What I was initially pointing at was, if you think about the portion of pay one gets, and the portion of pay that goes to the state, I think high taxation is often worth the money in terms of quality of life, because it delivers goods that are simply beyond anybody&#x27;s budget otherwise. Jeff Bezos can&#x27;t go on a 4am walk through LA without a shadow of worry, but I can do that in my city. That&#x27;s a tangible freedom that I can buy with my paycheck, and he cannot really buy with his.<p>Obviously money on its own doesn&#x27;t solve deeper issues - and Europe has a lot of problems, especially around questions of nationality and belonging. But I think in the narrow sense, of what you get for what you pay, high tax - welfare state societies are generally competitive even for very high earners, just because they deliver a lot of things that you literally can&#x27;t pay for, no matter how rich you are.')
