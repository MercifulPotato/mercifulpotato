Some notable players in the industry tried to convince others to do this (e.g. Waves). It didn&#x27;t work.<p>Plugin makers, DAW makers all refused to go down that path, despite the possibility of liberating their highly complex, deeply technical products from the whims of Redmond and Cupertino.<p>At that time, Linux already had better latency than OS X or Windows. It would have provided access to faster, bigger systems than anything you could run OS X or Windows on, and access to ARM &quot;early&quot; too. The industry could have actually convinced people that they need specialized computers, not off-the-shelf laptops and desktops to do this stuff (still largely true). But more or less nobody wanted to play.<p>And now, in 2020&#x2F;2021, just as when the PPC-&gt;Intel shift happened under Jobs, because Apple tells them all to dance, they will.<p>It&#x27;s sort of pathetic, even if all &quot;understandable&quot; from various points of view.')
