Item(by='2pEXgD0fZ5cF', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608673049, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25508176, text='I keep reading an often repeated defense of the game: That there is a diamond hidden under all the bugs and rough edges.<p>I played through the whole game and got probably lucky when it came to bugs because I did not experience that many game breaking ones (though DID encounter them which taught me to save very very frequently) and I am lucky to have a high end PC so while performance was really terrible I still managed to get ~60fps on highest settings, most of the time.<p>It is not, it is not amazing even without the bugs. I have a strong suspicion that the people who praise or defend it so tenaciously played only the longer prologue, which lasts a few hours depending on your speed, maybe a few hours further. The quality of that part is way better than the rest and from that point on the quality will continue to drop the closer one gets to the finale.<p>The game has massive problems that are just not related to bugs, it just tries so many things and does all of them mediocre. Many redundant and useless game mechanics. UI navigation is terrible, there are game design problems. The open world is hollow and lifeless and the behaviour of random NPCs does not even reach GTA 3 level in some ways, to put that into perspective. There is nothing to discover or explore in the open world part (except pretty screenshots sometimes) and every interaction in it (that is: outside of story missions) with characters works through audio calls and text messages.<p>I am not saying that it is absolutely <i>terrible</i> without the bugs, there is some fun to be had when everything works, but removing the bugs would lift it up to &quot;pretty ok&quot; at best, and I do regret the time investment and purchase. Seeing the opinions split into these two extreme opinions &quot;amazing&quot; and &quot;absolutely terrible&quot; just feels weird.')
