You would have to plan it properly: (e.g. rain fall, solar hours, land area, soil quality, rivers, and so on) and put in more work outside. But where there&#x27;s a will there&#x27;s a way. Even without homesteading 1 mil would go a long way if you purchased cheap property and didn&#x27;t fall into the rent trap.<p>In my current situation I could do it with less than half of what you have. But I&#x27;d personally get bored. Good luck with the retirement.')
