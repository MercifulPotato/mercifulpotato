That&#x27;s why my development machine is on a rolling release, but my servers run Debian stable with as few out-of-repository extras as possible.<p>As another code monkey-cum-sysadmin, I very much second this: my servers are Debian stable without non-free, and there&#x27;s damn good reason for that.<p>I can appreciate GP&#x27;s argument, and I&#x27;ve been there, pulling down CL libraries for playing around on my development machines. But what GP leaves out is that more often than not, those distribution-external packages <i>break</i>, and if I was relying on them, I&#x27;d be left holding the bag.<p>I do agree, there is a problem (that the LWN article goes into), and it definitely needs attention. Distributions might be able to handle newer ecosystems better.<p>But for all the awesome whizbang packages of NPM, QuickLisp, etc, developers need to realize that sysadmins and <i>especially</i> distro maintainers have to look at the bigger picture. Maybe consider that if your software introduces breaking changes or needs security updates on a weekly basis, it isn&#x27;t production ready.')
