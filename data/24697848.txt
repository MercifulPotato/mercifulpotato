I&#x27;ve always lamented the fact that big brands need very little creativity in product naming. Though Google is sometimes but often lazy, I can at least ascertain some reason behind their product names:<p>- The really boring ones like Google Docs, Google Maps, Google Talk, even GMail and Inbox, etc. were all potential generic B2B products so there&#x27;s an incentive to make it as simple (read: boring) as possible. Even your Executive Emeritus couldn&#x27;t second-guess what Google Docs does.<p>- Nexus, Pixel, and Stadia were all competing for a demographic that needed to catch attention; as names these aren&#x27;t boring at all. &quot;Google Phone&quot;&#x2F;&quot;Google Smartphone&quot; will be dead even before it launches against iPhone.<p>- Kubernetes kinda falls between the two. It&#x27;s a B2B product but it introduces a completely new concept so it needs its own name. Plus they made it a standard so you can&#x27;t slap the big G before it.<p>Now, &quot;Programmable Search Engine&quot; just sounds like a product name concocted by naive CS-undergrad seniors[1]. Did no one suggest &quot;Google Search Appliance Plus&quot; (no more confusing than &quot;YouTube Red&quot;)?<p>[1] My CS undergrad senior batch would&#x27;ve named this &quot;Programmable Search Engine <i>System</i>&quot;. God forbid anyone think what we&#x27;re doing is not related to software engineering.')
