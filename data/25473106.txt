Stuxnet), and are becoming less secure as other technology advances.<p>&gt; We need technological solutions for this problem, not new international laws or, holding nations accountable and so on.<p>While I do agree that technological solutions are better, why shouldn&#x27;t we have international laws that deter this kind of behavior? I&#x27;m sure that nations (and private actors) will try to exploit weaknesses regardless, but why not have consequences when they&#x27;ve been caught?<p>We can&#x27;t only put blame on inadequate tech, similar to how you can&#x27;t only put the blame on a bad lock on a front door. Those with malicious intentions should face appropriate consequences for actions that harm others.')
