There is effectively no information about the position you would be applying to. The only offer is asking for “A typescript developer with experience using React, Apollo, Node, GraphQL”. This tells me nothing about the position. How much experience do I need? How much do you pay? What other benefits are available? Where is your office located &#x2F; what’s your stance towards remote work (and what will it be post-covid)? What will my typical day look like? Do you use source control and CI&#x2F;CD? Do I get a company laptop or do you expect me to bring me own? I need to know answers to questions like those before I even think about sending a job application.')
