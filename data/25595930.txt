The presence of CVEs in software is a sign of maturity, not insecurity.<p>It really depends, depending on both the complexity and scope of use of the project, and whether the rate of CVEs is decreasing.<p>Flash had CVEs regularly for years.  I would say it was getting more mature, but the rate they were coming out and the fact that they just kept coming indicated to me not that the project was maturing (at least not at a rate I was comfortable with), but that either the programmers were inept, or more likely, that earlier design decision lead to very hard to reason about security and made it extremely hard to harden prior to exploits being discovered.  Neither are conclusions that made me want to use that software.<p>OpenSSL fell into a similar situation a couple years back.  Seeing all the CVEs that were coming out, once could reason &quot;this is just a mature project&quot;, but the truth (exposed by numerous people doing audits) was that the code base and developer process was a dumpster fire.<p>&gt; The key element is to realize that security issues are just bugs, especially in the context of C software.<p>They are, but not all people and projects produce the same quality and quantity of bugs.<p>All this is probably how you already see it, just not quite spelled out in your prior comment.  I just thought it was important to make that distinction obvious. :)<p>P.S. This is somewhat divorced from the context of whether systemd is a good code base or not.  I didn&#x27;t intend for this to be an implicit assessment of systemd, I&#x27;m not making any judgements on it here.')
