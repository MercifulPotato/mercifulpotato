GPL license cannot compel the copyright owner to do anything.<p>Unless licensee in question has also contributed to a published revision of original licensor&#x27;s code. And for that to work (remember the wording &quot;preferred form for modification&quot;), you need a form suitable for modification by a skilled stranger with little prior exposure to said work. You would otherwise get different preferred forms of modification of each contributor, which is unworkable.')
