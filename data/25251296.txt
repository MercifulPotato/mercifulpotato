Haven&#x27;t played in a very long time and enjoyed this. This applies to most Mahjong Solitaire implementations but my only feedback is how I always imagine if I had to physically shuffle and tile the board up to play and how there&#x27;s no way all tiles would have the same orientation. Meaning, yes left&amp;right would be the long sides but a seven dot might be 3 over 4 or 4 over 3. Having the same orientation makes the game much easier.')
