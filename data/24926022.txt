Even a generation or two ago, if a dalit drank from a glass, they would throw the glass out rather than wash it. Even progressive Indians who say everyone is the same regardless of caste would flip out if their child wanted to marry a dalit. You condition children like that from birth you will obviously get more than a few people with messed up opinions on dalits. Brahmins being at the top of the caste system have even stronger traditions regarding caste and what not (thus a stronger chance of indoctrinating their children with a more messed up version of the caste discrimination that other high castes also practice)')
