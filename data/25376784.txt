Knowing if I had covid was critical information. If I had covid, going to a hospital or clinic for help was safer (for me) I can&#x27;t catch covid twice. If I didn&#x27;t have covid, I was already sick and getting covid on top of that would be a serious danger to my life.<p>I got close to needing to go to the hospital but decided not to. Turns out that was a good idea, I didn&#x27;t have covid (PRC test).')
