However the UK opted out of it (and Schengen), which makes this a non-argument for Brexit.<p>One thing the UK could have done but never did, was to require EU citizens to move out if they were jobless for 3 months. Given this, it&#x27;s mind-boggling that part of the reason some voted for Brexit was to get foreigners out. One can say the UK purposefully didn&#x27;t opt for less globalism in this case.<p>Another similar example is the &quot;red-colored passports&quot;: a minor issue that got blown out of proportion, but the UK could have had them without leaving the EU.')
