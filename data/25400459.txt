The essay was about earnestness.<p>Tangentially - if you read the emails, texts etc. found in discovery for Brin, Schmidt etc., they are secretly entering a cartel the DOJ would break up to forbid direct recruitment <i>of their own workers</i>.  Even the people who are doing all of the work to supposedly &quot;make the world a better place&quot; are being screwed by the effort, never mind people outside the company and the externalities on the way to that greater profit.')
