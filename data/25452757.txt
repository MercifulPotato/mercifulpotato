So I&#x27;ve only been using Dart in this app (stack), if I need to add server components (which eventually I likely will) I&#x27;ll write those in Elixir and&#x2F;or Rust (i.e. languages I already know).<p>Nothing against the idea of server-side Dart, I just don&#x27;t see a reason to bother with it. I&#x27;ve never really been sold on the idea of using the &quot;same language&quot; for both frontend and backend. I (try to) prefer the right tool for the job; which for my requirements, this time, is mostly how I ended up with Dart and Flutter... and I&#x27;ve been pleasantly surprised. It is the first cross-platform desktop language &amp; sdk pairing I&#x27;ve used that I, <i>personally</i>, don&#x27;t totally hate. Every other time, I&#x27;ve just said &quot;fuck this&quot; and gone and implemented it whatever the native SDKs were.')
