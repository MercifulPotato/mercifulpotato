You are still playing their game. You are still playing a rigged game and you are still losing.<p>I understand your sentiment but that&#x27;s a pretty overbroad assessment.   There are obviously non-pro traders people killing it, and a lot more than a blip, tons of people have bought and sold out of their positions, average schmoes.  There will be a ton of bagholders and losers, and expired options &quot;Loss Porn&quot;.  But to say that EVERYONE is a loser in a rigged game is too bold a statement.  Maybe, Most will be losers in the rigged game.')
