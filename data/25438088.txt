The issue is that the communication to the body of some information isn&#x27;t fully understood yet and might never be, which prevents third-party lenses as well as adapters from working properly.<p>If you were to make a camera that is fully open, maybe even modifiable on the info it sends to the lens and what information it wants back, then you would get aftermarket adapters for Canon EF (you could also make one yourself with publicly available info). Sony E would be a tougher nut to crack, but there is a fair bit of info already out and there are already E mount adapters feasible.<p>So yes, maybe trivial is hyperbolic because of the Sony E mount, but very feasible.')
