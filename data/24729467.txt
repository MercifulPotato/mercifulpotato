From the Nvidia example, 0.1165 KB&#x2F;frame even at buttery smooth 60fps ( I could literally hear Apple market the crap out of this ), that is 7KBps or 56Kbps! Remember when the industry were trying to compress CD Audio quality ( aka 128Kbps MP3 ) down to 64Kbps? This FaceTime Video Call is using even less!<p>And since the NPU and FaceTime are all part of Apple&#x27;s platform and not available anywhere else. They now have an even better excuse not to open it up and further lock customers into their ecosystem. ( Not such a good thing with how Apple are acting right now )<p>Not so sure where Nvidia is heading for this since Not everyone will have a CUDA GPU.')
