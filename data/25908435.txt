I&#x27;ve thought software was crap as long as I&#x27;ve used it. Part of the problem is there are so many dimensions in which the software can be crap: unapproachable&#x2F;overengineered, badly documented, inconsistent, slow or unstable. The software could absolutely be some of the best in the world and still be terrible on one or more axes.')
