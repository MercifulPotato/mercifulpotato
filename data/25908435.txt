I&#x27;ve thought software was crap as long as I&#x27;ve used it, and I believe I can find a bug (or at least what I would consider a bug) in about five minutes using any software. Part of the problem is there are so many dimensions in which the software can be crap: unapproachable&#x2F;overengineered, lacking in features, badly documented, inconsistent, slow, unstable, etc. The software could absolutely be some of the best in the world and still be terrible on one or more axes.')
