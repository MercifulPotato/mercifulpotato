I&#x27;d say that&#x27;s the only consistent way to do it, if you want to preserve the semantics of JS objects. Lua does pretty much the same.<p>&gt; Saying that they&#x27;re objects is not reasonable.<p>This is a fair point, in the alternate universe where JS objects have different semantics.<p>&gt; in most languages lists are objects, and they don&#x27;t also do key-value pairs at the same time<p>This is a <i>dynamic</i> language we&#x27;re talking about. You are very welcome to think dynamic languages are inferior choices, an opinion that I personally would share, but that&#x27;s a discussion for another time. In the context of JS, that behavior is neither unreasonable nor inconsistent.')
