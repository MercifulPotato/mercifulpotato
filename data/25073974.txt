I took the question as to why a percentage is charged for card transactions at all. The additional 0.5% is most definitely a &quot;because they can&quot; type of pricing and that&#x27;s more an economics theory discussion. The market has shown a willingness to put up with that pricing and therefore a value proposition is set so until something changes no reason to price differently if the market is willing to pay a model with a much higher margin. I don&#x27;t necessarily agree but that&#x27;s a sound short-term business decision. I know from experience that sometimes going into a market with an established pricing model, however unfair, with a better pricing model for the customer can be bad for business and result not only in less profit per sale, but fewer customers making the buy decision because of the pricing model expectations that have already been set by the market. It baffles me, but I&#x27;m no economics major.')
