They serve similar purposes, but in my case described above, an actual hire will occur or it won&#x27;t.  Job fairs, at least the ones I&#x27;ve been to are more like an advertising kiosk in a mall where no one you&#x27;re talking to has any authority of any kind let alone deciding whether or not to hire you on the spot :)<p>Also, at a job fair you have no idea what the day to day life will be in your new position.  In my scenario, once you are or aren&#x27;t hired you will have already lived the life you will be living if you are hired.')
