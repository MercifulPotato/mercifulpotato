Take, for example, that the President of Iran is a relatively powerless figurehead whose electoral transitions hide the constancy of the Supreme Leader&#x27;s control over the nation. Consider also that the candidates who run for that office must be approved by the Guardian Council, which means that an election for the Iranian presidency is not free even if it is conducted fairly.<p>I think Iranians have a greater problem with their government than does the US establishment.<p>This fact is also true of Venezuela, another country that I assume would fall into the basket to which you refer. Both Iran and Venezuela have a large diaspora. The Iranian diaspora consists largely of people whose families were well-established prior to the Revolution of 1979; many of those people and their children are now doctors, lawyers, and engineers in other parts of the world. Comparatively speaking, the Venezuelan diaspora did not come from the upper class, as the middle class rather than the upper class was gutted in that country, and many of the people who have taken buses across South America in the past eight years or so arrive with nearly nothing. Many beg in order to pay for food and shelter, some resort to crime, and others leave behind a work history in a specialized field to work basic jobs (such as running a burger stand, or selling beers at events).<p>Those Venezuelans, too, have a far greater problem with their country&#x27;s regime than does the US establishment.')
