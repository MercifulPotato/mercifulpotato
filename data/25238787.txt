If I may be a bit tacky on HN--oh brother didn&#x27;t I travel like a king that day! :P It was also the last half of a longer route so it was really a pleasantly surprising luxury to be able to stretch my legs like that.<p>Granted, that was an Emirates flight, already known for its luxury. If my experience with Eurowings is anything to go by, I don&#x27;t know if $260 USD would be worth two seats, a blanket, and a pillow. Buying a second seat might be a wiser way to get a bit more comfortable.')
