If I know where they are I can use Cmd+D or multi-select to just find those quick rather than crafting a nice regex find-replace query with &quot;only in selection&quot; etc.<p>Ligatures:  It&#x27;s SUBJECTIVE.  I dunno why you&#x27;re throwing out ad hominems like &quot;only for frontend developers who like &lt;things I think are bad&gt;&quot;.   I am looking at code for 8-12 hours a day.  If ligatures make the code nice to look at, why the heck do you care what my code looks like?  My ligatures aren&#x27;t being pushed into your environment.<p>This is like judging someone as &quot;lesser&quot; than you because they like a different mouse because it&#x27;s comfortable for them...')
