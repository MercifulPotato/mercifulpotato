Item(by='zinx', descendants=0, kids=None, score=2, time=1603210062, title='A story on starting an app with React Native to publishing on App Store', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='Hi , I’m Rishi(https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;thelifeofrishi), before quarantine I didn’t know anything about react native. I was familiar with react though. I started working on this diary app which I started just for practicing native. I never thought to publish it considering my track record of abandoned side projects and I thought I would just learn from it. Where it went real crazy is when I started to write code, React native and then being able to use tailwind with RN, it got me so interested I started working on the project taking PTO from my actual work sometimes.<p>3 or so months later, today I released the app on AppStore and planning to release it for Android too.<p>About the app: it is a diary app, lets you write diary entries through text or voice recorded entries. I’m a designer so I’ve did my good to make sure it looks good.<p>Here’s the link if anyone wants to check it out -\nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;in&#x2F;app&#x2F;maazi-personal-diary&#x2F;id1535320472<p>PS: Thanks RN and Expo team for making apps easier for us.')
