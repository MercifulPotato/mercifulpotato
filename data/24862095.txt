According to <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;mmwr&#x2F;volumes&#x2F;69&#x2F;wr&#x2F;mm6919e5.htm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;mmwr&#x2F;volumes&#x2F;69&#x2F;wr&#x2F;mm6919e5.htm</a>, there were 32,107 deaths in NYC in March-May, an excess of 24,172. There are about 8.4 million people in NYC, according to the Goog.<p>That would mean that, normally, there would be about 9 deaths&#x2F;10,000 residents. In those two months, though, there were about 38 deaths&#x2F;10k. The other 99.62% survive. Yay, you!<p>&quot;<i>Nobody said they don&#x27;t. There&#x27;s a difference between something being serious and worthy of attention, and it being the sort of existential threat that would justify disrupting civilization to the extent we have.</i>&quot;<p>&quot;existential threat&quot;? &quot;disrupting civilization&quot;?')
