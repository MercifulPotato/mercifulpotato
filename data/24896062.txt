Do i put them in a disadvantage because they are part of that group or because a large part of that group wouldn&#x27;t fit the requirements i have.<p>Lets say i&#x27;m looking for someone doing voiceover. Someone without an accent. That would probably put a lot of non-native english speaker in a disadvantage. Would you argue, that i&#x27;m discriminating against them or have racist intentions?<p>In this diversity session they would then argue my knowledge that non-native english speaker are put in a disadvantage by this requirement was the reason to put it in and therefor i&#x27;m racist.')
