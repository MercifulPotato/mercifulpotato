You gave up too early, accepting the salaryman fantasy of steady growth if you just “work hard.”\nIf this works past 50, you are 80th percentile.  Past 55? 98th percentile.

Perfectly acceptable or ignorable at 20-38.  Lethal &gt;48.<p>You need to own the economic value of your output as early as possible.  Read that sentence again.
