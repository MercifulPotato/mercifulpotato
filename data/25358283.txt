I was known to be that kid who read Newspapers top to bottom of all pages, so that is that.<p>I am the same way. This makes it very hard for me to skim books or even sections of books because it feels like I’m “cheating” and not really finishing the book properly. This also makes it hard for me to quit books halfway, even if I don’t enjoy it.<p>I know that both of these things (skimming and knowing when to quit early) are vital skills for readers, but my completionism borders on obsessive.')
