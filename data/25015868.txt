It&#x27;s been my experience that in most organizations the buck stops with a product owner&#x2F;manager. I can&#x27;t think of a worse person to be deciding if we have time in the sprint to refactor. I advise teams to go up as high as you have to in the organization until you find someone incentivized to deliver value over a longer time horizon, someone who will feel the consequences of too much tech debt. Often no such person exists. At this point it should be clear to everyone what the future will look like and they can make their own personal career choices.')
