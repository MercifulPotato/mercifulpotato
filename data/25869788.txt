I am one of about 5 engineers to help invent both globalstar and iridium.<p>I don&#x27;t think this kind of warning is a helpful part of the conversation.<p>If you want to make an argument against Starlink, fine, go ahead and make it. But what is the use of the admonition for someone to &quot;think carefully before they respond&quot;?<p>It seems to be the only real effect that is intended to have is to deter additional conversation.<p>Anyway, I&#x27;m going to go ahead and ignore your warning, and the credentials you present: I think Starlink is going to be a commercial success. If they solve the satellite interlink problem (which, admittedly, is a big problem), I think it will be a viable path to delivering a global internet solution.')
