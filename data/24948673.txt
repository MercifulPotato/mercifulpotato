Item(by='jcranmer', descendants=None, kids=[24961628], score=None, time=1604111248, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24946847, text='&gt; you end up with a lot of items not moving when they should, since the cell in front of them is still full even though it&#x27;ll empty later this tick.<p>That&#x27;s actually not as big a problem as you&#x27;d expect. You would end up with 1-tick gaps, but at 60 ticks-per-second, those kinds of gaps don&#x27;t end up being an issue, especially when you&#x27;ve got a backed-up buffer that has some natural hysteresis waiting to fill that gap.<p>&gt; And what would you do if you want the entirely full loop to not jam? It sounds possible, probably even simple, but I haven&#x27;t seen how.<p>Compute the graph of connectivity at entity construction, precompute a topological iteration order, and handle each strongly-connected component as an individual entity. Or maybe you could do it with merely a list of elementary cycles; it would take some work to figure out what you want the semantics of loop motion to be if a belt is in multiple loops.')
