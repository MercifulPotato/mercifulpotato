We took some simple idea we had in mind and tried to create a mobile application that we thought we be nice to have. That was really nice, and we now spend a few hours every week discussing it and doing a bit of work on new features or bug fixes.<p>Sharing a hobby like this was something new for us, and it works surprisingly well. At the beginning it felt like work and was a bit tensed, but we are now at a point where it feels just very nice to spend a bit of time on the project when we feel like it. We don&#x27;t treat it as a business, so I guess that helps.<p>It&#x27;s not something for every couple, but that worked for us during the past few months. And we started a more complex project since then.<p>In case someone is interested, the app is named &quot;HabitCat&quot; and is a simple way to track habits. Nothing very original, but as I said, we made it because we like to work on it together :)<p>Android: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;apps&#x2F;details?id=com.noodlesoup.habitcat" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;apps&#x2F;details?id=com.noodlesoup...</a><p>iOS: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;app&#x2F;habitcat-track-your-habits&#x2F;id1523991719" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;app&#x2F;habitcat-track-your-habits&#x2F;id1...</a>')
