It&#x27;s essentially balance&#x2F;tradeoffs&#x2F;etc.<p>That trading off thought process isn&#x27;t the same as the ACCEPT|REJECT process of the axiomatic mind.<p>I think a person who says &quot;quit&quot; is really saying that the very question of trading off heuristics of value <i>isn&#x27;t applicable</i>.<p>It&#x27;s a bit like Poisonous|Edible, or Gold|NotGold. There&#x27;s nothing to be traded. A Copper apple is Poisonous and NotGold. No two ways about it.<p>That reasoning only works when the concepts (Gold, Edible, etc.) are natural kinds -- or otherwise disjoint and universal classifiers.<p>In life, situations fall both into the ACCEPT and REJECT categories, into both GOOD and BAD, into both VALUABLE and WORTHLESS. These concepts are heuristic ones, and not disjoint &amp; universal.<p>The attempt to apply this &quot;disjoint, axiomatic, ...&quot; reasoning to <i>life</i> is a recipe for catastrophe.<p>EDIT: my point about principles vs. cases, is that i take: def. heuristic &quot;a resemblance amongst cases&quot;;  and def.., principle &quot;a universal rule which disjointly classifies cases&quot;<p>..ie., a slightly more extreme meaning to &quot;principle&quot; than is in general use')
