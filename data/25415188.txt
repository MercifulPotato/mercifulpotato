If you want to protect yourself from inflation you have to deploy that capital productively or alternatively be close to the source of the inflation (the central bank). If you are actually doing productive work then workers will see their incomes grow and if workers are underpaid relative to assets then wage growth will continue until both assets and incomes are roughly on par. After that assets will keep up with inflation. The benefits to workers massively outweigh the benefits to asset holders.<p>When you consider that the central bank is just blindly handing out money to public companies it&#x27;s basically the opposite. It&#x27;s actually perverting and distorting the economy because the money isn&#x27;t going where it is truly needed. If you are rich this is what you want. You want to have lots of money and a workforce that works for peanuts to make your relative wealth even bigger.')
