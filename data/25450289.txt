I don&#x27;t want to be limited to my small living room or whatever setting I&#x27;m in. When I&#x27;m in the real world outside of my house, I can&#x27;t imagine what AR would bring that wouldn&#x27;t be completely utilitarian, like replacing my phone&#x2F;watch with a virtual device, holochat calls, maybe add more trees, etc. But, I&#x27;m also not very imaginative.<p>What do you see in the future with AR?')
