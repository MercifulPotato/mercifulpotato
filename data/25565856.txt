Item(by='SlipperySlope', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609207544, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25565288, text='Back in 2015 FinCEN (US Financial Crimes Enforcement Network) issued guidance that an administrator of a digital virtual currency had to be a Money Services Business and file Suspicious Activity Reports, perform Know Your Customer and comply with Anti-Money Laundering regulations.\nSo Ripple filed and became an MSB in the 50 US States. So far so good.<p>But Crypto is more than a payment method. Obviously it is purchased in hopes of capital appreciation and that makes it a Security.<p>Accordingly, Ripple should have filed a S-1 security disclosure application with the SEC BEFORE issuing XRP.<p>Failure to register XRP as a security should lead to big fines.<p>So why does the US SEC leave Bitcoin and Ethereum alone?<p>Because there is no central administrator that issues and redeems the tokens.<p>Ideally, crypto tokens should file with the US SEC and their exchanges should be MSBs - like Coinbase.<p>Meanwhile Coinbase is pursuing becoming a dealer in registered securities because crypto tokens are both payment tokens and securities. In addition to filing suspicious activity reports to FinCEN, Coinbase will file insider trading reports to the SEC.<p>Fully regulated Crypto is not a bad thing - unless you are an anarchist or criminal. Fully regulated crypto plugs easily into the existing payment and security networks, bringing huge efficiencies and trust.<p>Sad for Ripple but a good lesson on how not to launch and run a token.')
