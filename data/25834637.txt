Driver issues naturally sorted themselves out over time, performance became less of an issue as computers got more powerful, and the annoyances with Vista&#x27;s security model could be solved with some tweaking around the edges. There wasn&#x27;t much incentive to jump from the Windows ecosystem, as there was no doubt that Microsoft could rectify these issues in the next release of Windows. Indeed, Windows 7 went on to be one the greatest Windows release ever, despite being nothing more than a tweaked version of the much maligned Vista.<p>Intel&#x27;s problems are a lot more structural in nature. They lost mobile, they lost the Mac, and we could very well be in the early stages of them losing the server (to Graviton, etc...) and the mobile PC market (if ARM PC chips take off in response to M1). Intel needs to right the ship expeditiously, before ARM gets a foothold and the x86 moat is irreversibly compromised. Thus far, we&#x27;ve seen no indication that they know how to get out of this downward spiral.')
