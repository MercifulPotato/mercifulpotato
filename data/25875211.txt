(there&#x27;s always a but)<p>1. they had a bug with Mojave which made it disconnect, especially with Zoom calls with many people (I imagine CPU issue?)<p>2. There&#x27;s no way to control &#x2F; switch off the camera from the app. The phone is still on with the app open and camera is working<p>3. I&#x27;ve got a nice holder, and used a dedicated older phone, but still it was a hassle, because you want to use the back facing camera -- to avoid seeing yourself. And then starting the app is effectively &quot;behind&quot; the camera. It&#x27;s awkward.<p>4. They charge a yearly subscription fee. I can understand why, but in the long run I&#x27;m not sure it works out in their customer&#x27;s favour financially.<p>I eventually gave up and got a Logitech Brio. So far I&#x27;m pretty happy.')
