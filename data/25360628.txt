A lack of exercise screws with the body&#x27;s feedback loops, undermining its &quot;metabolic flexibility&quot;: its ability to handle sugar and fat efficiently. Let&#x27;s take a look at just one perverse feedback loop.<p>When your body has a glucose spike, it is very important that its billions of muscle cells are willing to say &quot;yes&quot; to insulin and uptake that glucose. Otherwise, the body lacks an efficient disposal mechanism. If you don&#x27;t contract muscles throughout the week, insulin production has to go up to yell louder at muscle cells to please, please take the glucose. High insulin levels also sends two messages to fat cells: 1. do not release current fat stores for energy, and 2. absorb glucose to create more fat. When all that glucose finally is taken up by cells, and if insulin does not fall quickly enough, fat cells do not release energy (because insulin is telling them not to), and so the body becomes hungry even though it has excess fuel available.<p>Our bodies evolved under the conditions that we exercised to an extreme quantity everyday. Without exercise, its energy management systems get all nutty. Some level of exercise is important to avoid perverse, counterproductive feedback loops that undermine our goals.')
