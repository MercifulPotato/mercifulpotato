Mine is nearly the opposite.)<p>[1] Quintilian even finds value in exercising criticism of popular examples (because of course, even way back in the first century, The Old Days Were Better. Elsewhere Quintilian complains that people in his day only repeat a Cliff&#x27;s Notes knowledge of greek authors instead of reading the originals in full.)<p>&gt; &quot;It will even at times be of value to read speeches which are corrupt and faulty in style, but still meet with general admiration thanks to the perversity of modern tastes, and to point out how many expressions in them are inappropriate, obscure, high-flown, grovelling, mean, extravagant or effeminate, although they are not merely praised by the majority of critics, but, worse still, praised just because they are bad.&quot;<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.perseus.tufts.edu&#x2F;hopper&#x2F;text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2007.01.0059%3Abook%3D2%3Achapter%3D5%3Asection%3D10" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.perseus.tufts.edu&#x2F;hopper&#x2F;text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%...</a><p>and makes a good point about a pedagogical advantage to criticism of works other than one&#x27;s own:<p>&gt; &quot;I will venture to say that this particular form of exercise, if diligently pursued, will teach learners more than all the text-books of all the rhetoricians: these are no doubt of very considerable use, but being somewhat general in their scope, it is quite impossible for them to deal with all the special cases that are of almost daily occurrence. The art of war will provide a parallel: it is no doubt based on certain general principles, but it will none the less be far more useful to know the methods employed, whether wisely or the reverse, by individual generals under varying circumstances and conditions of time and place. For there are no subjects in which, as a rule, practice is not more valuable than precept.  Is a teacher to declaim to provide a model for his audience, and will not more profit be derived from the reading of Cicero or Demosthenes? Is a pupil to be publicly corrected if he makes a mistake in declaiming, and will it not be more useful, and more agreeable too, to correct some actual speech? For everyone has a preference for hearing the faults of others censured rather than his own.&quot;<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.perseus.tufts.edu&#x2F;hopper&#x2F;text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2007.01.0059%3Abook%3D2%3Achapter%3D5%3Asection%3D14" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.perseus.tufts.edu&#x2F;hopper&#x2F;text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%...</a><p><i>Im demang tili peroba pash im demang finyish vide fit.</i>')
