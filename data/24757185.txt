I’m personally skeptical of these minority-report PhD calls to action because I think they prescribe a direction rather than raising the actual things to be considered by local jurisdictions to make a good decision.<p>And it’s really hard to even get agreement on what to consider in order to decide! For instance, a strict utilitarian assessment needs to consider (and opine) on the following questions:<p>* Does full lockdown, which it is agreed would reduce COVID deaths, increase or reduce net deaths <i>over the same period</i> in all cause mortality (poverty, depression, abuse, etc)?<p>* Does full lockdown increase or reduce net deaths <i>over some longer period of time</i> for all cause mortality?<p>Then we get to the really hard stuff, in two directions: first, cultural:<p>* Will full lockdown + contact tracing be implementable in the US &#x2F; UK?<p>* If so, are the privacy and government centralization harms worth the benefit?<p>* If not, are the privacy, government centralization, and mortality related harms &#x2F; benefits worth the tradeoff?<p>Second, in ‘softer’ terms:<p>* Will lockdown disadvantage certain members of society? (see the “K shaped recover” for lots on this.<p>* Are those harms short or long term, and are they worth the lifesaving that (may&#x2F;will&#x2F;definitely will&#x2F;probably won’t) result?<p>Again, this is all presuming we agree to be utilitarian about this, (which I am not particularly inclined to be personally).<p>And, crucially, the answers to these questions is going to vary based on how much control a given government has right now, how much trust citizens have in their governments, how good the social safety net is, how protected &#x2F; enforceable the borders surrounding the lockdown are — it’s impossible to get a global answer here.')
