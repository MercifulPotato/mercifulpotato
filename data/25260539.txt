But, I do have hobbies and side projects and it does matter to me that my output is <i>useful</i> to someone.  If I make a unity asset, or an effects pedal, I want someone to use and enjoy it, otherwise it feels like wasted time.  Maybe the author is using money as a proxy for usefulness?  I think that above a certain point material goods stop being that interesting to most people.  You can explore the world on a motorcycle on a budget of 1000 dollars and have just as much fun as doing it in a private jet.  Probably more.  But to do interesting things and feel like ones work is appreciated is a fundamental human urge.')
