AWS did not do this instead giving them 24 hours.<p>Edit:<p>Reading AWS terms does appear to give them the right to terminate. not ashamed to be proven wrong.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aws.amazon.com&#x2F;agreement&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aws.amazon.com&#x2F;agreement&#x2F;</a>')
