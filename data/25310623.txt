The images&#x2F;videos they&#x27;re scrolling through are now big, front, and center. Many probably don&#x27;t ever venture into the comments to begin with, of if they do, they&#x27;re just seeing if the top comment is a good joke or not.<p>It really depends on the type of consumer.  I don&#x27;t post to reddit anymore, but I&#x27;m not looking to consume memes and videos.  When I go there I&#x27;m almost always looking to consume a comment thread about something (say some weird feature of some motherboard), and the new UI is atrocious for that.  I either switch to old or I don&#x27;t bother with it.')
