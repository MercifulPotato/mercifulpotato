So switching styles is not simply a matter of changing the \\documentclass at the top, contrary to what one might expect.<p>I&#x27;ve had mixed luck with switching styles: when the styles are very similar things tend to work better…. Yeah my problem with LaTeX in contrast to plain TeX is that it&#x27;s too hard to understand what&#x27;s going on, and one gets all those package conflicts… I agree with you about the cross-references and bibliographies being the main benefit of LaTeX; I imagine one can get by with a more lightweight macro package like eplain or opmac, though I haven&#x27;t tried them much. Ideally IMO one would do these things separately (and <i>generate</i> TeX files that have the cross references simply hard-coded) and not via the macro system, but haven&#x27;t tried that much either.')
