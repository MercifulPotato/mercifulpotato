It was still there, but so weak compared to NiCd that the claim wasn&#x27;t really disputed. Lithium are at least another step of that size better than that, if they have memory effect at all. If they do have a tiny little memory effect left it&#x27;s probably smaller than the extra cell aging one deep cycle would cause compared to to two smaller cycles of the same total capacity, as least as long as the smaller cycles are taking place somewhat close to nominal voltage. That would at least make memory effect irrelevant for all practical purposes.')
