Consider a simple enum class defined in a package: two versions now have two different enum objects which may not compare equally. Maybe a function from module A would return Enum.A and pass it to module B, which would then compare A.Enum.A to B.Enum.A, which fails. Super confusing.<p>So yes, Python’s import system is dynamic enough to do crazy things, but I don’t see how we can ever retrofit that into Python.<p>Regarding dependencies installed into a project-local directory (node_modules): that’s a virtual environment. Just more flexible.')
