Hear me out, judging by the internet, American people seem to always need someone to put on a pedestal; Mueller, Sanders, Fauci, AoC, Dolly Parton, I am not eloquent enough to explain it but it seems to me that people are always looking for someone to worship and hold as their saving grace where in fact, the issues they&#x27;re facing are complicated and no single hero is going to solve them.<p>I don&#x27;t know, has anyone else noticed this?')
