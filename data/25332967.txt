I&#x27;ve been mildly successful with growing a following on instagram, but it takes too much of my time and the few ads I&#x27;ve bought have all but fallen flat.<p>Looking for information or guides that delve deeper than surface level information, guru BS (scam &quot;courses&quot;) or air-headed medium posts has been difficult.  I would pay someone to do this, but I can&#x27;t justify a spend of more than $2-3k per project.  Interestingly, Indie Hackers is one of the worst offenders.  I basically don&#x27;t see Indie Hackers as worth my time anymore as a resource for early startup info.<p>Anyone else encounter this problem of failing to use marketing affectively with their side project &#x2F; early startup?')
