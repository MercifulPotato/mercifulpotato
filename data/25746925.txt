If you look at a the map by county, I think it gives a decent picture: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.usatoday.com&#x2F;in-depth&#x2F;graphics&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;10&#x2F;election-maps-2020-america-county-results-more-voters&#x2F;6226197002&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.usatoday.com&#x2F;in-depth&#x2F;graphics&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;10&#x2F;electi...</a><p>This is one from 2016 and is red-blue binary. It is perhaps the most illustrative: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blueshift.io&#x2F;election-2016-county-map.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blueshift.io&#x2F;election-2016-county-map.html</a><p>This makes peaceful resolution very difficult, as we&#x27;re dealing with two groups who largely live apart from one another, with different geography, culture, and social mores. I think it&#x27;s important to emphasize, there are a lot of people who genuinely believe that systemic voting irregularities influenced our last election, to the point of having changed the outcome, and don&#x27;t view Joe Biden as having been legitimately elected. Furthermore, they believe that the courts, especially the Supreme Court, refused to even hear their case, and that Congress would in no way give their grievances with the process an open debate, before accepting results they viewed as fraudulent. This puts them into a position of desperation. The videos of people being arrested at the airport do not help: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=lxwJ5HXSzuA" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=lxwJ5HXSzuA</a><p>Given the geography. I expect to see red-hats (Trump people) going into the cities where the blue-hats (centrists) and the black-hats (Antifa&#x2F;BLM) live, and then retreating into the rural areas, where supportive sheriffs are more likely to run interference against other law-enforcement agencies. To some extent, this is what we already saw at the Capitol Building, as well in places like Kenosha where people like Kyle Rittenhouse came from out-of town (albeit within reasonable driving distance) to the city where violence was occurring.<p>EDIT: better link<p>EDIT 2: The phrase &quot;I&#x27;ve thought a lot about this&quot; suggests that one has thought more of themselves thinking about the issue, than about the issue itself.
