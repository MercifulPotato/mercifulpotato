I canâ€™t deal with that!<p>Sadly, the author has this backwards. Reading music has almost nothing whatsoever to do with the music theory (admittedly gobbledy-gook) in the first paragraph.<p>If you&#x27;re a coder, you can do music theory. You might choose <i>not</i> to, and that&#x27;s OK. But don&#x27;t make it out to be harder than it is. There are lots of places to start.<p>The problem with not reading music is not that you won&#x27;t be able to understand music theory. It&#x27;s that it is very hard to find anyone who will explain it you (in person or in writing) without the terminology (and conceptual skeleton) of western notation and 18th century western tonal harmony. Neither of these things are actually central at all, but good luck avoiding it if you were ever to try.')
