Notably one couldn’t do addition or subtraction with a slide rule;  we used pencils for that.<p>When more precision was needed, I and my fellow engineers would break out our copies of CRC’s reference tables. The better log tables allowed calculations to 5 or 6 significant digits. Using these were not unusual and all of us learned to use them in high school (before 1970 at least).')
