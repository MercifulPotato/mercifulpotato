You&#x27;re getting &quot;extra value&quot; from it every time you use it!<p>Just, no. By &quot;extra&quot; value I mean &quot;extra <i>extra</i>&quot; value - in case of software, new features &amp; updates (which, of course, could also bring <i>no</i> extra value to you, but they do at least <i>in theory</i>).<p>Btw, I&#x27;m not objecting to choice. You want to avoid paying up-front cost for your knives, buy subscription instead? Be my guest! But if the company is <i>forcing</i> you to do this, then it&#x27;s obviously a good (profitable) deal for them, and a bad deal (scam) for you.')
