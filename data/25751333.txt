But <i>why</i> would I be talking about their free speech in the first place?  More to the point-- if the dealers <i>fueling</i> those benders <i>only</i> ever wanted to talk about free speech-- while at the same time doing piecemeal censorship of the most shocking things their addicts say-- shouldn&#x27;t I surmise it was a cynical, last ditch effort of drug dealers only looking to cash in and avoid responsibility?<p>Edit: clarification')
