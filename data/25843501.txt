Item(by='JMTQp8lwXL', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611127397, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25843190, text='&gt; people just assumed it MUST be true because the CCP MUST be evil.<p>Whether or not assertions about Ma&#x27;s whereabouts are true or false, the conclusion holds in either case. The predicate for westerners is largely, yes, the CCP is evil. But most aren&#x27;t so reductionist as to say, that means {random bad thing} happened to Ma.<p>Intentional or not, the phrasing reads like a defense of the CCP -- because regardless of the CCP&#x27;s actions towards Ma, the CCP has historically gone through with some internationally questionable acts. Or that, because the CCP didn&#x27;t do anything bad to Ma, the CCP isn&#x27;t bad. It&#x27;s the phrasing that&#x27;s concerning, and it taints the interpretation of rest of the comment. That&#x27;s how Westeners will read this.')
