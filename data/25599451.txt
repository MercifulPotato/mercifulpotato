Bitcoin currently powers almost none of the world’s transactions, yet consumes all that energy.<p>The entire us consumes 75 twh in a year, the same as bitcoin’s global energy use.<p>Of that, the <i></i>entire<i></i> commercial sector is about 12 twh. That’s not just banks. That’s every company. Banks alone are surely far less. Maybe 2-3 twh? And the us is 15% of global gdp. So, global finance might consume about 14-32 twh.<p>Again, that is while doing all of global finance. Bitcoin powers a rounding error of transactions yet consumes 75 twh.<p>There’s just no comparison energy wise. My math could be off by several orders of magnitude and bitcoin would still consume more if it were actually powering the world’s transactions.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eia.gov&#x2F;energyexplained&#x2F;us-energy-facts&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eia.gov&#x2F;energyexplained&#x2F;us-energy-facts&#x2F;</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;digiconomist.net&#x2F;bitcoin-energy-consumption" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;digiconomist.net&#x2F;bitcoin-energy-consumption</a>')
