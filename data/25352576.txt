I only listen to smaller indie bands on Spotify for a month. I give Spotify my £10 for the month.<p>Does my £10 go to those smaller bands? No. It gets given to Lady Ga Ga because she got 100 bazzillion listens that month. Even though I never listen to her music.<p>Spotify should work out who you’re listening to and give them a direct slice of what you have paid, rather than putting everyone in a pot together and dividing by number of plays.<p>It would be fairer, but it would mean the bigger bands earn less, and expose the fact that streaming really isn’t making anyone enough money.<p>How could it when I’m now paying only £10 a month for what used to cost hundreds?<p>But it’s better than piracy!')
