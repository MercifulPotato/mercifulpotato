Money is simply an abstraction layer over something like direct bartering which has liquidity problems that increase with the complexity and number of goods &amp; services on offer. I might agree that capitalism is about &quot;winning&quot; and money is used to keep score, but not that money is intrinsically tied to that game. And there might be a better abstraction layer you could place over people&#x27;s time &amp; effort than either money or direct bartering. Command economies are one option, but economies seem quite a bit too complex for that to be a feasible alternative at the moment. There&#x27;s probably other options, but I&#x27;m certainly not smart enough to think of something new on that topic.')
