If anyone familiar with Germany authors can comment I&#x27;d love to be reading more historical fiction by actual Germans (Kerr is English, I think). I&#x27;m familiar with Thomas Mann and Hermann Hesse (and of course, Goethe), but looking for authors a little more approachable than these greats. All Quiet On The Western Front was more in this category of an approachable read.<p>tldr; looking for recommendations from more recent German novelists translated into English because this American has a hard time finding them.')
