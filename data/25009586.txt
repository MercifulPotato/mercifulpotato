The idea is that it&#x27;s good enough - while not punishing your users as much.<p>The difficulty can be scaled in a predictable way - it&#x27;s similar to rate limiting but less all or nothing. We&#x27;re about to release automatic difficulty scaling per IP, so if many CAPTCHAs are requested&#x2F;submitted from a single IP the difficulty increases exponentially. Also being able to set the initial difficulty for your usecase and audience is something that should help.<p>Aside from that there&#x27;s some more measures on the roadmap: using lists of known-to-be-datacenter IPs, and reputation lists such as [2], as hints to increase the difficulty.<p>But you&#x27;re right - it will still be affordable to attack any CAPTCHA, FriendlyCaptcha is no exception. Proof of work approaches have downsides too.<p>The main ideas behind FriendlyCaptcha vs ReCAPTCHA:<p>* The user experience is superior. It can happen in the background while the user is doing something else. There is no labeling task.<p>* We don&#x27;t have any incentive to collect user data or track users (GDPR compliant, no tracking cookies etc)<p>* It&#x27;s as easy to add as ReCAPTCHA to your website. The API is a near copy of ReCAPTCHA&#x27;s API. You can host the JS code yourself, or even bundle it. With recaptcha it must be third party.<p>* It works in any browser less than 8 years old (IE&gt;=11), although of course it&#x27;s much slower in old browsers that don&#x27;t support WebAssembly.<p>* It doesn&#x27;t have inherent accessibility problems (poor eyesight&#x2F;hearing doesn&#x27;t matter).<p>* Open source at its core [3], the SaaS wrapper is not open source.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24921288" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24921288</a>  \n[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.stopforumspam.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.stopforumspam.com&#x2F;</a>  \n[3]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;friendlycaptcha&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;friendlycaptcha&#x2F;</a>')
