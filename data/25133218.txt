I specifically stated that the newborns died as a result of lockdown restrictions. This is objectively true. Whether they were physically prevented or not is irrelevant (and doesn&#x27;t make reverse the damage to the families).<p>For whatever reason, the sheer disorganisation and lack of communication resulted in death.<p>You erroneously stated that I claimed they died as a result of being denied entry to the state, a claim I never made. Would they have died with zero travel restrictions? Very likely not.<p>Functionally, being denied entry to the state and one side not bothering to even try to enter them into the state is a distinction without a difference (either way, they die).')
