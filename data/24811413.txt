As others have mentioned, this is largely considered a falacy nowadays.<p>The most obvious argument against this is that you can very easily conceive of something but be unable to articulate it. You can _think_ something but be unable to _put it into words_. Given this, it stands to reason that thought =&#x2F;= language.<p>Similarly, new words are coined all the time to refer to new and original ideas, these ideas must - if you believe language dictates what we can conceive - be impossible to form.<p>If you&#x27;re interested in this subject, I can <i></i>strongly<i></i> recommend The Language Instinct by Steven Pinker. (It&#x27;s available on Kindle and there&#x27;s plently of 2nd hand paperbacks online too.)')
