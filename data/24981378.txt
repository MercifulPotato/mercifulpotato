ITER is expected to cost around $65 billion total. Fusion is just a REALLY hard nut to crack. I think estimates put research costs on the order of $5-10 trillion dollars. That&#x27;s with no guarantee of positive results either. It could be as much as $30 trillion dollars before we see commercially viable reactors.<p>For that amount of money we can tap the planet&#x27;s mantle for geothermal energy, build liquid salt thorium reactors, and pay for everyone&#x27;s health care with some left over to fund a nice 6th generation fighter jet.<p>Fusion energy is a worthy goal for humanity. However, barring some synergistic results from super conduction and plasma research causing a spot breakthrough, I doubt we will see commercial fusion this century.')
