I was kinda happy about Trump talking about pulling out of all the foreign wars.<p>Then I thought about it a bit more, and realised (and the last four years have shown) that if America withdraw, the Russians and the Chinese will move right in, and while I&#x27;m not a major fan of American imperialism, I&#x27;m even less of a fan of the Russian or Chinese flavours.<p>And the US built the UN and all the other multilateral organisations post WW2, so yeah they work for the US, but they&#x27;re also pretty good for everyone else.')
