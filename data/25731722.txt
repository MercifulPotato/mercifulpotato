Like what others have said here, our expectations have become so low that it is commonly expected that the things we buy will only last a year or two before we end up throwing them away. This can be easily resolved if people simply paid more money for better quality products and brands that ensure repairability and longevity. But, of course, as time has shown, cheapness has won over consumer behavior. I&#x27;d consider this a market failure. I&#x27;ve always thought that this failure could be corrected by simply increasing the cost of disposal (&quot;throwing things away&quot;) via some kind of tax. When my vacuum cleaner, my toaster, or even my coffee maker dies, throwing it away costs very little money. So little money that it is better worth my time to simply dispose it in the trash and buy a new one. But if I find disposing them to be costly, I&#x27;ll certainly reconsider my options.')
