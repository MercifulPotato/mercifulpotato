The only thing it&#x27;s half-good for is discovery because it shows thumbnails of the videos and links to related videos.<p>Useful things that I can&#x27;t do on through youtube&#x27;s web interface:<p>1 - archive videos (so many videos have been taken down and would be lost forever to me had I not had an offline archive of them)<p>2 - quickly play through a ton of videos on demand, offline, without waiting to load the video (and the ads) -- skimming through dozens of offline videos takes seconds, but I&#x27;d have to stare at my browser loading forever to accomplish the same thing through a web browser<p>3 - make use of many useful features of powerful media players like mpv... just yesterday I needed to invert the colors on a screencast because I was watching it at night and the video&#x27;s white window background was blinding me.. I could do this instantly in mpv, but absolutely impossible on youtube<p>4 - remix the video or otherwise alter it to my needs using powerful offline video editors.. youtube&#x27;s offerings here are again a sad joke in comparison (as are most web tools compared to offline tools)<p>5 - not have to sit through a single stinking ad<p>If youtube could have just offered simple download links for their videos this would not be a problem.<p>But, no, they need you to be glued to their website and bound hand and foot to their service for as many hours of the day as they can bleed out of you.')
