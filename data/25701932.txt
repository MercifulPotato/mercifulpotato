You start going against the &quot;party line&quot;, you risk getting defederated or, if you&#x27;re an user on someone else&#x27;s instance, having your instance&#x27;s admins pressured to ban you on the threat of the whole instance getting defederated by others. And it&#x27;s a significant threat, because as much as Mastodon is distributed, people still want to stay connected to the major instances.<p>I myself moved from Twitter to Mastodon a while ago and very much enjoy it, but I also try to not say anything there that would attract interest of the defederationists.')
