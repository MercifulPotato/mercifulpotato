Even though they have a smaller risk of getting seriously ill, that could be an effective way to lower transmission.<p>That is:<p>1. Immunize the age group that is dominating in the hospitalization statistics, then\n2. Immunize the age group is accounting for the majority of transmission, then\n3. Immunize the rest.')
