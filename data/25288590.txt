Thinking up cool new stuff that your product can do is fun. And, once thought up, it&#x27;s hard to put that feature aside. &quot;Wouldn&#x27;t it be cool if it did this...&quot; is easy and fun. Managing the ensuing bloat and complexity is hard and not fun.<p>I&#x27;ve done it a hundred times, little driveby features like Dark Mode that take a couple hours to implement (but no customer asked for). Then 3 months later it breaks randomly from a dependency update and it&#x27;s another 2 hours to fix it. Then it adds half a day to creating a new feature that people actually did ask for. And so on. The cost of that little thing adds up and up.<p>I&#x27;m starting to think that product design time should be handed out as a reward, rather than seen as work.')
