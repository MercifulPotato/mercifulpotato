I&#x27;ve always had what could be called somewhat of a &#x27;jittery&#x27; or &#x27;high strung&#x27; personality.<p>In my 30s, I started taking a low dose of Ritalin, and it made a hell of a difference.  For the first time in my life, I was actually, fundamentally calm.  I gathered some pretty detailed data over a pretty long period of time, and there was an iron-clad correlation: when the Ritalin was in my blood stream, my blood pressure and heart rate were lower.<p>&gt; most ADHD people develop tolerance to medication over long periods of time<p>From the beginning, in order to defend against this possibility, I always took the meds sparingly, only on work days, and not all of them.  For a number of years, I organized my schedule around taking the meds three days a week.  On those three days, I did most of my deeper, focused software development.  On the other work days, I&#x27;d focus more on meetings, digging into operational issues, troubleshooting, basically everything except deep focused software development.<p>Prior to starting the meds, I had many successful years in technology at various organizations.  That continued after the meds, but with one big difference: while I was able to sit down and focus before the meds, it took an enormous amount of effort and energy.  I&#x27;d come home from work and immediately nap for an hour before waking up with enough mental energy to go about the rest of my evening.<p>On the meds, my total ability to focus was roughly the same, but it didn&#x27;t take nearly as much energy.  A 9 hour day at work would not leave me drained.<p>I&#x27;ve always had the fortune of having the prescribing docs break up my maximum daily meds into many small dosed tablets, which gave me a lot of flexibility.<p>Thankfully, after all this time, the meds still work very well for me.')
