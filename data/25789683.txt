I think most players in this market would agree that Coinbase, for all of it&#x27;s failings, is unlikely to be planning an exit scam at this point.<p>It doesn&#x27;t disprove the whole thesis, and some elements of it might have merit, but at least one element of it seems weak to me.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;coinmarketcap.com&#x2F;currencies&#x2F;usd-coin&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;coinmarketcap.com&#x2F;currencies&#x2F;usd-coin&#x2F;</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;coinmarketcap.com&#x2F;currencies&#x2F;tether&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;coinmarketcap.com&#x2F;currencies&#x2F;tether&#x2F;</a>')
