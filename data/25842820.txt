However, you probably want to be stingy about this as your engineer is in that range.  Your engineers are supposed to be providing business value and looking at $10K&#x2F;year costs probably isn&#x27;t worth their time.<p>At the $1M&#x2F;year mark, you already have an engineer on this full-time <i>anyway</i> so it makes sense to have some hardware you actually own in a colocation facility somewhere.')
