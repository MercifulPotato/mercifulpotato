Dropdowns, modal&#x2F;lightbox, concertina, slideovers, toggles, popover, transitions, no problem.<p>Hacks with :checked are well known, but you can do a <i>ton</i> of stuff with :focus-within, :invalid, :target, :hover, &lt;details&gt;&#x2F;&lt;summary&gt;&#x2F;[open], grids&#x2F;flexbox&#x2F;visibility, and the adjacent-sibling selector.  &lt;dialog&gt; is almost there, although it still needs a JS activation hook.<p>It feels really good to have a complete application UI that works with JS disabled, and I can still progressively enhance it with JS for necessary perversions of HTML like ARIA etc.')
