Anyone with any sort of understanding would have known in April the only way out was a vaccine. Why weren&#x27;t tracking apps made then? Why weren&#x27;t rollout plans made then?<p>And I know, they didn&#x27;t know the details. You don&#x27;t need to know the specifics to know that you are going up need a tracking system, a notification system, some sort of order of priority etc.<p>My state is still discussing who is after medical workers.<p>People are dying! Businesses are closing! Why is this being treated with the same urgency that seems to plague the DMV.<p>This isn&#x27;t car registrations, these are lives!')
