It&#x27;s widely known to be curated, and it seems the majority of Apple users appreciate the curation. It&#x27;s possible you didn&#x27;t know the state of the ecosystem when you purchased the device and agreed to the terms, and it&#x27;s unfortunate you only had 14 days to discover it before the return window closed, if you purchased directly from Apple. Perhaps they will make an exception for you. I&#x27;ve heard they occasionally allow returns outside of that window. Some people have luck selling their devices, and report they retain high resale value.<p>Non sequitur: My first VCR was a BetaMax. We got it on sale without knowing much about the technology. Once we had it a few days, I really wished it handled VHS tapes, as that&#x27;s all the movie rental stores had. We returned it.')
