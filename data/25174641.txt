Specifically:<p>David Edgerton, <i>The Shock of the Old: Technology and Global History Since 1900</i> (2006).<p>Andrew L. Russell and Lee Vinsel, <i>The Innovation Delusion: How Our Obsession with the New Has Disrupted the Work That Matters Most</i> (2020).<p>You won’t agree with everything in those books, but they will make you think deeply about old technologies and the stories we tell ourselves about innovation.')
