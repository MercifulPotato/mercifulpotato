Such situations are awful since innocent human being was put through suffering and by the system which should protect innocent people. But this is not rule that governs juridical system, people do make mistakes - you cannot judge whole system by mistake made by random Joe, no system would stand such test. I prefer to be judged by state judge than by angry crowd or self appointed police. Mainly because even state judge and police are accountable for their actions, whereas crowd or self appointed guards may be difficult to find after actions are done.')
