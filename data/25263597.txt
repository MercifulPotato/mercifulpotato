Is this work public somewhere perhaps?<p>I&#x27;m currently working on a similar technique (though with smaller blocks, currently ranging 64-1024 bytes - basically any 5 power-of-twos) for a lock-free allocator intended for real time embedded systems. I use a 32-bit word for each 1024 byte &quot;page&quot;, and have a tree structure inside of the word (it takes 31 bits to cover 5 power-of-two ranges).<p>My code (which only allocs and never frees at the moment) is here:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jamesmunns&#x2F;bitpool&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jamesmunns&#x2F;bitpool&#x2F;</a>')
