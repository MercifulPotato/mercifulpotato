I work at Google, and the publication approval process doesn&#x27;t normally take to weeks. Any Google employee can verify this, and others have, both in this thread and on twitter. There&#x27;s some documentation that asks for 2 weeks, but it&#x27;s not followed, and inconsistent application of policy is absolutely a concern in a case like this.<p>A summary of the events, as best as I can tell, is the normal presubmission review was done. After the paper was approved and submitted, someone, whether this was upper management or some other entity, did some additional review and required that the authors withdraw (?, but retract is the wrong term) the paper.<p>From what I know, both firsthand and from other sources[0], while not spotless, the issues with the paper were mostly nitpicks and fairly straightforward to resolve. That they <i>weren&#x27;t even provided</i> until some escalation from Dr. Gebru is strange. That even after they were, sort of, provided, she and her team were not given the option to address them in the paper, is extraordinarily strange.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;MachineLearning&#x2F;comments&#x2F;k69eq0&#x2F;n_the_abstract_of_the_paper_that_led_to_timnit&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;MachineLearning&#x2F;comments&#x2F;k69eq0&#x2F;n_t...</a>')
