ClearML (formerly trains) is a ML&#x2F;DL development and production suite, it contains three main modules:<p><pre><code>    Experiment Manager - Automagical experiment tracking, environments and results\n    ML-Ops - Automation, Pipelines &amp; Orchestration solution for ML&#x2F;DL jobs (K8s &#x2F; Cloud &#x2F; bare-metal)\n    Data-Management - Fully differentiable data management &amp; version control solution on top of object-storage (S3&#x2F;GS&#x2F;Azure&#x2F;NAS)\n</code></pre>\n2. That last part about Data Management? That&#x27;s new. Bunch of other <i>very handy</i> tools built in.\n3. To celebrate the name change we are launching a FREE hosted server (of the type that you can spin up on your own since it is OSS) with secure login. The free tier supports collaborations of small teams - an industry first.<p>So give it a spin, I would post it on showhn but there is a sign-up page.<p>I&#x27;m here for questions and complaints, or on twitter @LSTMeow')
