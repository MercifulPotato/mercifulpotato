Most americans only have access to 1 or 2 ISP, but anyone can create and host their own website.<p>Next up, look at the other side of the equation. Are you ok with websites banning child pornography? What about ISIS recruitment videos? Now, what about doxxing people or posts from QAnon recruiting people to raid the Capitol? Clearly you accept a line somewhere, you wouldn&#x27;t want to live in a completely lawless internet where AWS hosts child pornography, you just don&#x27;t agree with the exact position of the line then?<p>Yes they have power, but they&#x27;re not stupid, they&#x27;ll never ban half the internet, it just doesn&#x27;t make sense, either monetarily, morally or from a popularity point of view. I personally don&#x27;t buy any of the slippery slope arguments, they seem to be thrown there by people who just want the line to be in a slightly different position.')
