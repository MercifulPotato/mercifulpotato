They suck so much that I reached the conclusion that using git submodules was the way to go, and saw “just copy the header file” in readmes of modern projects. The pkg managers are hard to install and configure, don’t integrate well with the tooling, don’t support most stuff, have out-of-date documentation, and are just buggy.<p>Cpp API design also seems to suck. Doing a simple curl request is bloody complicated.')
