A gram of HFCS is anywhere from 42–55% fructose, which is the same as what you’d get from an apple.<p>But I think there may be something to the <i>dose</i> of HFCS.<p>Fructose has to be metabolized in the liver, and there’s an upper bound of how much it can break down at once. (I believe 50 grams.) Which, if you’re eating fruit, is fine; the fiber slows down digestion, and also you’re probably not eating like 6 apples at once.<p>But oh man, look at an energy drink, or a sugary coffee drink. I am from Midwestern white trash stock, and during my obese younger years, I would frequently drink a 44oz Big Gulp of Mountain Dew. That’s a shotgun blast of fructose, and my gut instinct (hah) says that there’s a dose-response curve going on here.')
