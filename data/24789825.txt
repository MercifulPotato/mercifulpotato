But this year I had some time and money to spend so I bought a cheap FDM 3d printer and honestly it&#x27;s good enough for most uses.<p>Depending on the material, color, lightning and size of the part - usually you don&#x27;t even notice the layers, and in many cases even if you do it doesn&#x27;t matter. For example I&#x27;ve printed big boxes for our bikes out of black PLA and they look fine - you wouldn&#x27;t see it&#x27;s 3d-printed unless you stare at it from 1 meter under good lightning.<p>And when you need a different finish you can always paint it. I&#x27;ve printed about a dozen plant pots of different sizes because my wife bought 10 ceramic pots and liked them very much and couldn&#x27;t find similar ones anywhere. We painted them and they look identical and you don&#x27;t see the layers under the paint.<p>I don&#x27;t even print with the smallest layer size possible because it takes too much time and difference between 0.1 mm and 0.2 mm or even 0.3 mm is negligible in practice, but the printing time scales almost linearly.<p>Depending on what you use it for YMMV.')
