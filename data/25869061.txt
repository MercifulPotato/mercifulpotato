The article title is misleading. In fact the article body quotes the Google spokesperson as saying it&#x27;s not a threat.<p>* &#x27; Ms Silva described the ultimatum as a &quot;worst case scenario&quot;, adding: &quot;It&#x27;s not a threat. It&#x27;s a reality&quot;. &#x27;<p>Note the authors description as &#x27;ultimatum&#x27;, while the plain language of the quote is &quot;it&#x27;s not a threat&quot;.<p>I&#x27;m not the biggest Google fan these days; but from what I know how Google operates [1], I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a threat either. I think Google would genuinely have to stop providing search.<p>[1] Google -as a search engine company pushes traffic to your site, which you can choose to monetize or not as you see fit. On their side the company monetizes their search engine by means of advertising in this case. If you ask for the traffic AND both sides of the money, there&#x27;s no profit left for the search engine provider anymore, and they will be forced to shut down (in that region).')
