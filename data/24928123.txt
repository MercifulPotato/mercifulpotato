Century and more ago only upper classes were having debates&#x2F;arguments&#x2F;discussions because only they had the option to try to control their fate by trying to win  those debates (and those white males had less diverse set of opinions then we have in the society today). The rest of society was consumed in daily grit for survival, they had no impact on decisions and whatever decisions were taken it  was for them akin to a weather or geological events. These days everybody can participate, thanks to economic development and communication tools and especially social media. Though not everybody has sufficiently trained mental toolset to handle it.<p>&gt;Everyone is so hostile and eager to end other people.<p>Couple centuries ago disagreement could easily end up as a duel resulting in a death and losing a political fight may have had more severe consequences than just losing an elected office. These days usually only ego is damaged. And even that - in the current environment criticism is equaled with harassment (so egos are safe and happily growing large and larger...)  Thus as a result in particular proliferation of alternative facts, etc. Kind of multiverse of quantum mechanics.')
