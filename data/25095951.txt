(I imagine it&#x27;s mostly for defrosting?)<p>Our microwave, an excellent almost-20-year-old Daewoo, has a rotary timer knob (endless turn, digital); a start button that also acts as a +30s button if you haven&#x27;t used the timer knob beforehand (and that can be cued up multiple times); and a stop button. The buttons are tactile nubs rather than flat buttons. Those are sufficient and perfect for me.<p>It also has a single button for power selection, another for clock setting, and another button that has something to do with presets or weights or... actually I have no idea. I use the clock button twice a year and after a power outage.')
