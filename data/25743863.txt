Item(by='pizza234', descendants=None, kids=[25743954], score=None, time=1610439909, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25743446, text='&gt; Here in Germany, most homeless people could not even start to work because you need a legal residence to get a bank account (getting paid in cash or via check is illegal in Germany), so they cannot accept the Arbeitslosengeld (Hartz IV).<p>This is not specific of Germany&#x2F;EU, and it&#x27;s actually a principle of pretty much of any society. Countries can&#x27;t just give away residence and money for free. If one belongs to EU, getting residence is easy; if not, the visa conditions apply. Therefore, you&#x27;re talking about illegals (and&#x2F;or refugees), which is a different matter.<p>It&#x27;s actually funny (in a tragic way) that countries like Germany or France took the highest number of refugees during the crisis (official stats: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ec.europa.eu&#x2F;eurostat&#x2F;statistics-explained&#x2F;index.php&#x2F;Asylum_statistics" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ec.europa.eu&#x2F;eurostat&#x2F;statistics-explained&#x2F;index.php...</a>), and citizens still complain.<p>In other words, ironically, countries may as well block entrance to asylum seekers, or throw homeless away out of the borders, and the public opinion will be negative regardless.')
