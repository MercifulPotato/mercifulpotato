Privacy-preserving systems go out of their way not to have it.<p>You may have some kind of public policy or archaeological argument in favor of the vulnerability, but then it&#x27;s hard to see how the same argument doesn&#x27;t suggest we should compromise the entire confidentiality of every email; after all, that would make research a lot easier.')
