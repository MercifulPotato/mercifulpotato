It reproduces the sounds on a lower pitch so that human beings can hear it. With this machine he hears roses scream as his neighbor cuts them. The next morning he hears a tree scream when he cuts into it with an axe. He calls his doctor excitedly and asks him to come over at once. The doctor comes and Klausner says he wants him to listen to the tree&#x27;s screams. He starts cutting into it with an axe and a large branch begins to fall. They barely get out of the way in time. He asks the doctor if he heard the scream but the doctor will not say that he did. Klausner is very upset and demands that the doctor paint the two gashes with iodine.</i><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.newyorker.com&#x2F;magazine&#x2F;1949&#x2F;09&#x2F;17&#x2F;the-sound-machine" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.newyorker.com&#x2F;magazine&#x2F;1949&#x2F;09&#x2F;17&#x2F;the-sound-mach...</a>')
