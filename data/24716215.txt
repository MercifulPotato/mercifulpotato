I don&#x27;t know if DSHEA covers websites&#x2F;apps&#x2F;digital products -- probably not -- but I would be very surprised if there wasn&#x27;t similar legislation covering websites, apps, and digital products<p>Note that DSHEA does prescribe language for safely discussing the effects of non-drug therapies. It&#x27;s called structure-function language -- OP should definitely read up on it (better: talk to a lawyer versed in these matters, and note that I am not a lawyer, none of the above is intended as legal advice)')
