It&#x27;s a complex issue and I appreciate the source.<p>China is putting people into forced labour (or concentration) camps en-mass. Its arrested or exiled thousands of HK democracy protestors. Its going backwards on democracy and rule of law. Not to mention causing the largest pandemic of the 21st century (so far). Its support for North Korea is another whole mess. Oh, and it almost started a war with the neighbouring nuclear power.<p>If people are satisfied with that, they&#x27;re pretty socially bankrupt imho.<p>What&#x27;s more likely is that with absolute control of the media, the vast majority have no idea what&#x27;s really going on. They&#x27;re just reassured about how awful every other country is.<p>In fairness, the camps and the plague weren&#x27;t a thing till after the 2016 end of the survey. Xi Jinping only really ramped up his authoritarian storm in the last few years.<p>I wonder how the average citizen there would react after an hour of straight forwards factual updates on the domestic situation.<p>All this aside, I am glad they have eliminated extreme poverty. That is progress, socially as well as economically.')
