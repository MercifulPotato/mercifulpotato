It&#x27;s very fast while running many applications, no CPU throttling, excellent thermal control.<p>- VS Code Insiders works well for Web, Nodejs, and Ruby.<p>- iTerm, Alfred, and Dash all work as expected.<p>- Homebrew support is excellent.<p>- Only a few issues with needing to re-install updated Ruby gems or Nodejs packages due to incompatibility issues from native C extensions, i.e. FFI (ruby), Sharp (nodejs), libvips (c++).<p>- CPU intensive tasks are very fast compared to a 2015 MacBook Pro.<p>- Input&#x2F;Output is limited, and you will probably have to buy a dock and deal with display issues if you want more than one external monitor. I am still dealing with this.<p>Overall I would recommend, compatibility is 95% excellent. The feel of the Mac is satisfying and problems can be solved within an hour most times.<p>If you need many monitors for your work, you many want to wait until the compatibility improves, or buy a dock and roll the dice.')
