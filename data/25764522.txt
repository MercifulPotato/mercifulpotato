That phrasing was deliberate: you don&#x27;t want to trust the OEM&#x27;s slider in the first place, just be <i>able</i> to add you own.<p>So, am I addressing a strawman? What OEM <i>impedes</i> you from adding a slider? Well, actually, Apple says it&#x27;s not recommended to use a webcam cover because of how they designed it. <i>That</i> is poor design and security practice.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23795163" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23795163</a>')
