You said nobody was making a case for GameStop being a good stock, and the other comment pointed out that the single most popular name associated with this trade has been doing exactly that.<p>You also quoted the SEC saying that manipulating a stock price to cause a short squeeze is illegal but also that short squeezes occur naturally. Expecting a short squeeze and intending to profit off of it is not illegal.<p>You make the point that some people on wallstreetbets made comments that crossed the line on manipulation. I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s true, but if you see a few problematic comments out of millions it&#x27;s obviously absurd to say that a stock mustn&#x27;t be bought because of them.<p>Ironically, you are criticizing what is clearly not manipulation (valuing GME highly and expecting to profit off of a coming short squeeze) in order to defend what clearly is manipulation (banning a million retail investors from taking one side of a trade at a critical moment).')
