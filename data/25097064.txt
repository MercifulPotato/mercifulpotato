I personally know at least one person who is considering not buying one next time around just because of this incident. Some people use tools that lock them onto a Mac, but most of that is just people that have to develop for Macs (and they’re stuck no matter what Apple does, because they need to <i>test</i> on Macs). The iOS&#x2F;App Store monopoly arguments are one thing, but 10% is a monopoly now?<p>Just because a company sells a product that has some things one might want that no other market players bother combined with some things that they don’t like, doesn’t mean they’re “exploiting a monopoly”.')
