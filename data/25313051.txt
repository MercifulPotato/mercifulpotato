The universalist ethic is also the same; i.e. letting other parts of the world have differing ethical views on certain issues is unacceptable and must be eliminated. There cannot be more than one opinion on X social issue, just as there could not be more than one interpretation of Christianity.<p>I think we are still in the power-building stages. There is no real alternative to Facebook&#x2F;YouTube&#x2F;etc. yet. But say, 30 years from now, there probably will be. Combined with increasing governmental hostility, we&#x27;ll probably see a deeply fractured internet, undercut by a (semi-illegal) totally open one.')
