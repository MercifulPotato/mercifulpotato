If a person can learn bunch of algorithms and apply them to custom problems they probably can do quite a bit with computers. And it shows that they probably can learn new stuff rapidly as well. I don&#x27;t get why so many developers hate Leetcode. I love it personally, I think it&#x27;s great. And also, I think people are just lazy and don&#x27;t want to learn new stuff so they whine instead. I don&#x27;t think whining will help them.')
