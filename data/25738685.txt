They are public company now. Which means they aren&#x27;t lying to some potential players, but instead they are lying to the investors.<p>They made promises about work environment that weren&#x27;t fulfilled.<p>They blatantly lied about previous gen consoles performance. PC gamers are used to games not running well, but main appeal is that games usually run within the baseline. CP2077 is unplayable on PS4 and XB1.<p>CP2077 isn&#x27;t TW3 level of unfinished. I think CDPR has bitten off more than they can chew.')
