But in the end Python and Lua became better replacements for those two specific areas (that&#x27;s at least how it went in my case, I did lots of Tcl in the late 90&#x27;s and early 2ks, but then switched to Python for &quot;cross-platform-scripting&quot;).<p>There&#x27;s still no proper replacement for Tk GUIs as far as I&#x27;m aware though, even Python uses it for building quick&#x27;n&#x27;dirty cross-platform UIs.')
