Like, we&#x27;re supposed to feel <i>lucky</i> that we whave ARQ. Ridiculous.<p>It&#x27;s not really anything to do with encryption or indecipherability, but all about spectral efficiency, and most of that really comes down to coding. I can pop open fldigi and generate a 64QAM signal really easily, but actually coding the data to ship over that pipe starts getting into some pretty arcane territory.<p>Think about just how good a modern cellphone is - 100+ megabit connection in the palm of your hand, competing for spectrum with hundreds or thousands of other devices, with a handset power of less than 1 watt (usually). There&#x27;s nothing inherently magical about it, it&#x27;s just not something that there&#x27;s a lot of FOSS work around.<p>I&#x27;ve been working on deep diving on this a lot lately, I really think there should be more open source libraries around coding, but I have a funny feeling anyone who gets good at this gets snatched up by someone in the 3GPP consortium.')
