As you said, you cannot be &quot;free from contradiction&quot;.<p>On the other hand, there are many ways to stymie speech which don&#x27;t involve outright supression. Some of the things that Twitter does to stop certain speech are better than other ways -- I think it&#x27;s good when they can be explicit about what they are doing and why they are doing it. It might be better business for them to be non-partisan as they provide a platform for people across the world but that is also their choice.<p>However, if for example, I was an admin on HN and had some special ability to put emphasized disclaimers below your comments about how they were mistaken and you were wrong, I think you would be right to feel like I was biasing the discussion and that it was unfair. An advocate for free speech (to the extent that I am) would be against this, since it does not create a good environment for discussion.<p>As I said, it kind of depends on the particulars and the context, but I kind of think about it like a debate between two people with a moderator. If the moderator is neutral it is preferred by the audience.')
