And even so, the margins are not huge - at most about 2&#x2F;3 and 1&#x2F;3, and usually closer - so the idea of &quot;red states&quot; or &quot;blue states&quot; doesn&#x27;t quite make sense, I think.<p>EDIT: I ran the data - looking at the 2020 results (and rounding off Maine to D and Nebraska to R), &quot;blue&quot; states have $64B agricultural exports and &quot;red&quot; states have $73B agricultural exports. So the answer is that while red states export a bit more, it can hardly be described as one feeding the other.')
