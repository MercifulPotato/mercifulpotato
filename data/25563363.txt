We&#x27;re looking for someone professional who can get the job done without being a pain to work with.<p>You don&#x27;t have to show up with exaggerated, faked interested in the company or industry. In fact, it can come off as very fake if a candidate shows up and pretends they&#x27;re supernaturally excited to work in our industry that they just learned about 2 days prior.<p>However, you can&#x27;t expect to show up to a job interview and ooze disinterest and boredom and still be considered for the job.<p>Don&#x27;t think of it as getting excited to work for a company. Think about it as getting to know your potential future coworkers. If you need to become emotionally invested in a company before applying, I&#x27;d strongly recommend that you work on breaking that habit before it makes your job search artificially difficult.')
