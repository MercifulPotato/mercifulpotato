And the block chain\n&gt; will always be there, it will always be public, and it will always be\n&gt; subject to further analysis.  And we are learning that analysis of that\n&gt; record is sufficient to destroy any pretense of anonymity or\n&gt; pseudonymity.<p>Yeah, privacy is a joke on blockchains. Perhaps that is why actually private coins like Monero are having such &#x27;difficulty&#x27; getting adoption on mainstream platforms, with shitcoins getting preference. I suspect that if coinbase tried to add Monero, they would get a very angry letter from the CIA&#x2F;FBI (perhaps this already happened, they have been having &#x27;technical difficulties&#x27; adding it for years now).')
