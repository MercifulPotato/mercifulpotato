Item(by='simiones', descendants=None, kids=[25130903], score=None, time=1605648412, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25127879, text='All of those only make sense to me if a commit is a finished work item.  If I&#x27;m committing just because I want to switch branches or pull, most likely what I&#x27;m committing is not meaningful in any way. If I squash later, it doesn&#x27;t really matter, the reviewer will see one commit anyway, so committing often or not didn&#x27;t help.<p>And sure, it&#x27;s easier to ship small features than large ones.  But it&#x27;s harder to follow one complex change as a series of short patches than one big, self-consistent change.<p>So to me, commits should be as often as possible, sure, but that is normally once a day or once every few days for serious features &#x2F; large bug fixes. I usually want to pull or switch branch much more often than that.<p>And related to release time: typically we have a single main branch that serves multiple projects. When one of these projects is close to a release, they cut off a release branch that is feature frozen, in order to fix any remaining bugs and thoroughly sanitize it. In the meantime, other teams continue merging features into master as they are ready. Bugfixes normally also go into master first, and they are then cherry-picked into the release branch (or branches,  if there are multiple releases overlapping). So for us, during this release window, cherry-picking is something that every team member does constantly.')
