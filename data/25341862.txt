In most countries it&#x27;s illegal, but it&#x27;s also not tested as part of the emissions tests (particulate matter in general is not tested, other than &#x27;is there black or white smoke? nope, you pass&#x27;).<p>Above this mileage it will become clogged and need to be replaced. If it isn&#x27;t it will increase fuel consumption, reduce power, and damage the engine if left long enough. They are not off-the-shelf parts you can buy (not that they couldn&#x27;t be, but nobody buys them), so you need to get a &#x27;reconditioned&#x27; one which isn&#x27;t going to last anywhere near as long. For â‚¬2500 or more for parts and labour it doesn&#x27;t make financial sense, especially when your car is probably valued at a similar amount.<p>I live in a city center next to a relatively busy road and whenever I replace the filters in my apartment ventilation system every 3-6 months they are always thick black. We don&#x27;t really have any heavy industry in this city, so I assume most of that is from vehicles.')
