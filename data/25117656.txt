If it’s not free and knowledgeable, it’s not consent.<p>I certainly didn’t realise that DKIM can be used as a non-repudiation signature, I’m sure most people using email don’t.<p>Thus there’s no consent and I would say that non-repudiation has been sprung on me.<p>The duration has nothing to do with it. Just because you can keep a camera hidden in someones room for an extended period of time doesn’t mean it’s ethical or consensual to record them.<p>Finally statues of limitations don’t protect people from a trial in social media. Social media is just as capable as the justice system of destroying a persons life. Unfortunately Twitter doesn’t have a statue of limitations.')
