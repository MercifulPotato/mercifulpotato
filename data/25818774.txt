How could people do something so insane, in a command-economy with strong rigid line-of-command issues?<p>If you had told me scientists in the US would be able to send anthrax in the mail to members of the government, because they were pissed off with things, I&#x27;d have said &quot;but that would never happen&quot; -Except, it did kind of happen. Anthrax leaked out because somebody with access to secured disease facilities in the US, decided to do something. Something reprehensible, but they did.<p>So if you tell me its theoretically possible a gain-of-function experiment happened, And that all this behaviour from the Chinese government was after-the-fact fears about uncommanded, unacceptable risky behaviour in a lab, I maybe should be open to saying &quot;ok: it is certainly possible people do bat shit crazy (hah) things&quot;<p>I don&#x27;t actually think a GOF experiment is at the root of this problem. I think its zoonotic, not manufactured, and I think seeking to write the lab into spread of a zoonotic disease is seeking to make political capital because of anti CCP feeling or trade wars.<p>Like diseases spread because farming and food practices are high risk for disease transmission. its sort-of Occams razor to say &quot;it just happened&quot; because we have good evidence it does just happen. Demanding this be seen as a smoking gun of human mediated lab-experimentation, I think is silly.<p>I would be asking Virologists and Geneticists: Does a Gain of Function experiment leave fingerprints in the DNA and RNA that we can track down?')
