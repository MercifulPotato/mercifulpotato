Item(by='DoreenMichele', descendants=None, kids=[25688799], score=None, time=1610131299, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25685395, text='I vaguely recall some article about bathtubs being given to poor people in Appalachia who had no running water (in like The Great Depression of the 1930s). They would put them on the front porch and use them to store coal, which got mocked by others as them being &quot;ignorant fools&quot; who didn&#x27;t understand what a bathtub was for rather than seen as evidence that bathtubs are essentially useless for bathing if you lack running water.<p>If we nominally have <i>free</i> care available to everyone but there are systemic road blocks that make it essentially impossible for most people of color to access, this is one of those things that falls under &quot;White-splaining.&quot;<p>&quot;Oh, you just do x and it&#x27;s free&quot; only x is nigh impossible to accomplish if you aren&#x27;t a fairly well off White person is one of those things that falls under &quot;systemic racism that Whites don&#x27;t really want to understand.&quot;<p>There&#x27;s a classist forum that charges $5 for membership and claims this is merely to prevent bots from signing up and is not intended to keep out poor people and all you have to do is ask and they will give you a membership for free if it&#x27;s a financial hardship. And then the mods make sure to be openly assholish to poor people so poor people won&#x27;t ask.<p>When I went to gift a free membership for a &quot;sock puppet&quot; account to an existing member who had said in MeTa she couldn&#x27;t afford one but needed one for privacy reasons, the mods were quite assholish to me about the entire thing every step of the way in every way possible, including telling me <i>after</i> I had paid &quot;She could have a free second account now for that purpose just for asking&quot; -- something they also hadn&#x27;t volunteered to her when she said in MeTa she wanted one and couldn&#x27;t afford it.<p>It&#x27;s important that it was in MeTa because that&#x27;s the only part of the site the mods are required to read all of, so you can&#x27;t say they just didn&#x27;t see it. They saw it and declined to inform her &quot;Oh, that&#x27;s also free for the asking if it&#x27;s a financial hardships for you. That policy is not only for initial accounts. If you need a sock puppet for privacy and safety reasons, just message us.&quot; And then offered to refund me my $5 that I had paid to gift her the account while I was still homeless.<p>They also did not offer to hook me up with a second account for free. I had eventually paid for a second account for myself while homeless and they didn&#x27;t offer to refund me $5 at that time either.<p>I had used the ability to leave anonymous comments a few times and they messaged me to let me know I was a bad girl and a fuck up who was misusing the system as most people only ever left one or two anonymous comments in the entire lifetime of their membership. Nowhere was there any instructions that you should only do that once or twice. It was just the social norm that most people who participated a lot and had privacy concerns had a second sock puppet account for that purpose.<p>Rather than going &quot;Oh, she&#x27;s extremely poor and can&#x27;t afford a second account because she&#x27;s homeless&quot; they treated me like I was misbehaving. I had no idea I was doing anything &quot;different&quot; until then in part because I was shunned socially because of the extremely toxic classist environment that was openly hateful to me where the mods actively encouraged other members to bully me.<p>People of color are painfully well aware that the rules are often de facto different for them. People of color often are not notified that X can be had for free or are oblivious to the ways in which it&#x27;s not really free if you don&#x27;t already have access to a great deal of infrastructure that Whites have access to on a routine basis and people of color often simply do not have that infrastructure already in place, much like people in Appalachia who can&#x27;t take a bath even if you give them a free tub because their shack has no running water.<p>Saying &quot;It&#x27;s already free...if you can check this box that requires a personal jet to check off&quot; means it&#x27;s not actually free to most people. It&#x27;s only free to the current Haves.<p>Such policies mean that a lot of &quot;freebies&quot; in the US amount to perks for the mostly white Haves, not basic healthcare for all people, regardless of socioeconomic status or skin color.')
