Those of us used to doing are really bad at, and demotivated by, the justifying.<p>Sorry, I should have book marked it.<p>--<p>Finally listening to Graeber&#x27;s Utopia of Rules. It&#x27;s kinda blowing my mind. Like a firestorm in my head.<p>Graeber&#x27;s The Democracy Project has even more radical, useful explanations. His distinction between &quot;rational&quot; (following the rules) and &quot;reasonable&quot; (doing what&#x27;s right, fair) gives voice to something that&#x27;s been plaguing me for decades.<p>Graeber supplies more of the puzzle pieces for how capitalism (in the USA) came to mean corporatism, and how these paradigms necessitate the Kafka&#x2F;Brazil (movie) style bureaucracies we all hate.<p>It&#x27;s really an amazing time to be alive. I came of age reading Peter Drucker, Buckminister Fuller, Donald Norman, and many other humanists. (The conclusions of the proto-libertarian stuff never made sense to me. I always thought of myself as whatever the leftist version of libertarianism would be. Same complaints, different conclusions. I had no idea that makes me an anarchist. It took me reading Graeber to finally start understanding what Chomsky&#x27;s been talking about.)<p>Looking back, I truly didn&#x27;t understand how far out of the mainstream their notions were. The humanists made sense to me and I guess I assumed everyone was on the same page. Alas, I&#x27;ve always been an outsider in my own land.<p>With the rise of post-capitalism and renewed interest in direct democracy, empathy, participation and so forth, my world is finally starting to make some sense.')
