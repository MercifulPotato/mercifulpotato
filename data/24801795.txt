I can remember quite clearly my teacher in uni saying: &quot;So do you think companies go for diversity because it&#x27;s &#x27;the right thing to do&#x27;? Hell no!, they do it because it&#x27;s proven to increase productivity&quot;.\nIn situations where there is low offer of particular skills in the job market compared to the demand, &quot;culture&quot; will serve as a means of propaganda&#x2F;enticing for future candidates and also for retaining current employees and not losing them to competitors.')
