Nevertheless, it&#x27;s not the whole story.<p>The title seems to imply that this is a random sum of money given to the US while it&#x27;s actually a payment to victims of terrorism attacks sponsored by a previous dictator. It&#x27;s quite sad that current sudanese people, which were also victims of the dictatorship have to give away this money. What&#x27;s the alternative then? Should non-democratic nations when changing government lose their debts? And their gains? If so then it&#x27;s impossible to trade with them or maintain any commercial relationship and this would justify for example blocking trade with Cuba, which I think it&#x27;s an error. If the people of non democratic countries are victims of their government is then a military invasion justified?<p>I&#x27;m not endorsing the payment BTW but I don&#x27;t think that the answer is as simple as some people pretend.')
