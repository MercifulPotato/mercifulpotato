Play all your tapes and capture the <i>raw</i> tape signal to your computer. This will only require 45 GB per hour, i.e. almost nothing. Process the signal after the fact, with perfect field&#x2F;line sync correction, whatever audio compression&#x2F;limiting&#x2F;equalization you want, etc.<p>VHS only has 3MHz bandwidth, let&#x27;s don&#x27;t pretend that a software-defined VTR is not practical.<p>Answering your actual question: S-VHS vs VHS deck should not make any difference for playback of VHS cassettes. Cassettes recorded in S-VHS cannot be played on a VHS deck, so that would be an obvious difference.')
