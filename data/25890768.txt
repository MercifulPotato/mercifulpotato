In that regard, I agree with GP. Personally, work is work and I don&#x27;t go there to small talk with every single person who is incredibly unlikely to mesh well with me. Worse is when they come out with the &quot;but you can change&quot; arguments, when I&#x27;m fairly satisfied with the few great friends I have outside work.<p>I too find the need to be friends with everyone quite privileged, and worse, trying to force one&#x27;s world view onto others. Some people just don&#x27;t have the luxury of surrounding themselves with people of a largely similar mindset they can bond to in a work environment. Friendship is not something I wish to lower my standards for. Maybe the definition of what constitutes a friend is just different, too. I have high standards for a friend. An acquaintance, not so much. You could be an acquaintance just by saying &#x27;hi&#x27; every week.')
