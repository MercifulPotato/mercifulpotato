Each case simply implements the opcode. You have an array of bytes for the memory, and some emulated devices (e.g. trigger a screen update when the framebuffer memory gets changed, or set the instruction pointer to a handler when a key gets pressed.)<p>It gets hard when instructions need lots of decoding, or you have 3d graphics hardware to emulate, or if you have something like a BIOS, or if you want to JIT.<p>I&#x27;m actually eyeing implementing a console on an FPGA as my holiday project, with something like Chisel.')
