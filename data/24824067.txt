For example, in the app I work on when you first load the page it shows you a login form. While you&#x27;re filling that in your browser is busy prefetching some assets (components, styles, icons) you&#x27;ll need after you&#x27;ve logged in. It reduces the waiting time when you&#x27;re using the app by a few seconds.<p>(To answer the obvious &#x27;what a waste if the user fails to log in!&#x27; criticism, that&#x27;s fewer than 0.2% of log in attempts. Most people benefit.)')
