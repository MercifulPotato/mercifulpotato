First you have to make a distinction between public and private persons. And then there is also the distinction between maliciously defaming someone, and passing on things you heard in good faith.<p>If you heard that your neighbor Bob is a creepy pedo, then warning other people is frankly natural. If you dislike Bob and make up a rumor about him that should be illegal.<p>For powerful public persons the balance is different.
