By turning off the permission checks, you replace all of this communication with the equivalent of &#x27;return true&#x27;.<p>Unless you&#x27;re running a multi-department enterprise-wide Jira ($deity have mercy on your soul), you&#x27;re better off eliminating permissions entirely and controlling access to the instance at the network. In other words, if only your developers need access to it, <i>do not</i> add your developer user group to the various site permissions, set the permission to everyone instead, and ensure only your developer&#x27;s subnets can touch it in the first place.')
