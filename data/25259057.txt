Most high-performance use cases are multi-threaded now, so the single-threaded performance delta isn&#x27;t that significant.  The Apple chip is really built for running a snappy GUI: in most of those cases, you need to run ~1M instructions super fast on one thread for a short time.  Intel has historically had the crown on this metric, but not any more with all of their problems.')
