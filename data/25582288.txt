Both Twitter and Facebook was only launched that year. Only a handful of people had mobile phones with internet. Both the amount of photos of people were low, and also the avenues people could take to find others were narrow and few.<p>I played PerplexCity back then and engaged with the hunt for this puzzle amongst others (e.g the cube!). For my part, it was mainly word of mouth with Japanese friends or colleagues over the years until I forgot about it. Occasionally every few years something happened to get people interested in this puzzle. I believe community members put up a reward for solving this.<p>Just as back then the web resources were few, those that were created have mostly disappeared. Wikis, a few hugely active forums, chat rooms etc all individual websites all lost.<p>I&#x27;ve been wondering whether its possible to have Alternate Reality Games in today&#x27;s mobile phone and social media land.')
