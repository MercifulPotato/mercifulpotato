The frontend continues to be server generated. PJAX style partial page updates is (mostly) dynamic enough. The maintenance burden of operating a JavaScript frontend is too high to justify for a 1-2 person team.<p>The second thing I’ve done is avoid containers. VMs work fine for many types of applications. That’s especially true if provisioning and configuration is mostly automated. A product like Google Cloud Run looks interesting for a few low-volume backend services that I operate. Containers are a good fit there because it simplifies operations rather than increases complexity. The core infrastructure will remain VMs for the foreseeable future.<p>I began doing Ruby and Ruby on Rails (RoR) development in 2006. Ruby had been around for awhile but the growing popularity of RoR was driving a lot of changes in the ecosystem in those years. It was a fun time but I was working for a large company that allowed me the time to keep up with everything. I see today’s frontend and container ecosystems in the light of that experience. I’m now more content to wait it out and let the dust settle as much as I enjoy learning new technology.')
