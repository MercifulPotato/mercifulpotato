You can do it across multiple cells. I don&#x27;t like the drag and drop method of moving cells. Switching between notebooks is faster if you normally use multiple large notebooks at the same time. I am biased against JavaScript heavy UI. I just have had so many bad experiences with single page apps. The only problem I have with notebooks is the mathjax J&#x27;s seems to cause the browser to hang on opening or running large notebooks. But it was the same in labs, but even worse with the tabs being handled by the UI instead of the browser. Switching back and forth between tabs and having to wait for them to render was annoying. I gave it a good go for a while recently, but the find and replace in classic notebooks is just so good I couldn&#x27;t make the switch permanent.')
