I am thinking of things like Discord servers and the like. I like HN, and Reddit subreddits like &#x2F;r&#x2F;sysadmin but these discussions feel too structured (e.g. have to remain on-topic). Something more relaxed, casual, and instantaneous would be more ideal for what I&#x27;m looking for.<p>Thank you!')
