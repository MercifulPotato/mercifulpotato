And no, I am not talking about monospaced fonts here.<p>I&#x27;m not into web design but I think the core problem here is lack of accepted terminology and even awareness that this type of font is a thing.<p>The article certainly brings awareness to something I didn&#x27;t know is a thing but seems very useful.<p>My mind wants to say &quot;weight invariant&quot; or &quot;style invariant&quot; but those suggest the thing doesnt look any different rather than just the size not changing with other characteristics.<p>It&#x27;s probably obvious that I don&#x27;t like &quot;uniwidth&quot;, but at the moment I can&#x27;t think of anything better that isn&#x27;t super wordy, like &quot;font with style invariant width&quot;.')
