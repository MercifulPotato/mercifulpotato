After 3 days of working heads down we built the MVP of Eatalo.<p>We then went out door to door to all the local restaurants in our area to &quot;promote&quot; the service. The results were encouraging, with a high adoption rate and great early feedbacks, which allowed us to iterate and finally make the product better. It took us 2 weeks of hard work to build the final app now we are ready to launch it worldwide!')
