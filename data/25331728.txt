It makes clear we&#x27;re updating a -&gt;head pointer in one case and -&gt;next in the others.  I like the elegant version, too, since it can update both kinds of pointers in one fell swoop, but you have to grok that p starts as a head pointer and later becomes something&#x27;s next pointer.<p>I&#x27;d say C syntax for double pointers is a lot less kind than the syntax for single pointers.  Your version thankfully lacks any line like so, without making me think about parens<p><pre><code>    p = &amp;(*p)-&gt;next;</code></pre>')
