This demo uses &quot;depth peeling&quot;, which is a fancy term to just mean rendering the model in a few different frustum slices along the view direction, and using the previous framebuffer content to accumulate reflection.<p>The whole purpose of this trick is to abuse the rasterizer! I struggle to see how compute shaders would make this faster.')
