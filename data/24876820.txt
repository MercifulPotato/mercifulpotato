Both are probably something you can reverse engineer... if that’s how you want to trust your package manager I guess? Idk I only learned that the patching was a thing because it failed when I tried to install an “unsupported” package. I was alarmed by trying to track down what was happening and saw the patch has no explanation. I was more alarmed when yarn2 tried to apply the patch even with pnp disabled.')
