My grandparents came &quot;illegally&quot; from Europe. Caging their kids would have caused outrage. They are outraged at trees dying in their parks but its ok if entire cities drown elsewhere. White mentally deranged criminal =&gt; &quot;poor kid&quot;, black criminal &quot;those uncivilized people&quot;. We want tax cuts but we also want massive social security and medicare payments.<p>And the worst of all, the mental gymnastics to justify Trump&#x27;s actions.<p>I raised my voice and have only cursory ties with them. My entire life is ahead of me and I don&#x27;t want to go back to their era of bigotry. These boomers will die in 15 years but I can&#x27;t leave their racist, sexist and selfish legacy to myself and my children.')
