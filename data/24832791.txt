Healthcare is available for contract workers already (obamacare&#x2F;covered CA). PTO is irrelevant for contract work, and not just rideshare&#x2F;gig contracts (the whole point is that you can accept work when it is convenient for you).<p>The only potential area of &quot;benefits&quot; I can see that might need some rethinking for the gig workforce is sick leave (I don&#x27;t want rideshare drivers continuing to work while sick just so that they can make rent, so it would be nice if they could accumulate some amount of sick leave proportionate to the number of hours they drive).')
