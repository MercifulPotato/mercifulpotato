But there is still something to be said for designing systems where it&#x27;s not possible for those negative incentives to exist, whether or not there is any current intention of taking advantage of them.<p>Of the tens of thousands of people who had a hand in shaping macOS today, it&#x27;s impossible to say what their collective intentions were in all the decisions they made. So I think it&#x27;s useless to talk only about the intentions you can prove just by looking at their formal decision-making process. That is why we need to be working to protect privacy at every level with a &quot;defense in depth&quot; approach.<p>And of course it goes without saying that all major vendors have issues like this and could be working harder to make sure that these incentives don&#x27;t get created.')
