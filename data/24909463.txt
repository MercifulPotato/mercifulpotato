Item(by='ssijak', descendants=1, kids=[24909693], score=1, time=1603818726, title='Ask HN: Do you have a system for learning and remembering important stuff?', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='Lately I become really bothered on how much and how fast we forget things if that knowledge is not immediately needed for the current tasks.<p>And taking into account how many interests all of us have, and general information overload I am sometimes anxious because I can not learn enough about the things I love and even if I do, that knowledge is slipping away constantly if it is not used.<p>I am a software engineer and there are so many tools, topics, libraries, languages and other things to learn and master (and not forget). It is constant battle with the endless streams of new things, platforms, updates and such. But I also have strong interests in other fields (science, astronomy, physics and math in particular, startups, etc).<p>I read alot, 50-70+ books per year and countless blog posts and other materials, and as I said, I am becoming annoyed at how much we are bad at remembering long term. Usually I am satisfied with remembering 1-3 main points of a book with vague reasons&#x2F;support for those points.<p>So I wanted to track and organise my personal knowledge and stumbled on Zettelkasten which seems like a reasonable system. (Obsidian app looks nice for it). But I somehow have a block on how to start with it when there is a blank slate (I kind of struggle with perfectionism and &quot;blocked by planning&quot; problem sometimes).<p>I&#x27;ve also started with making my Anki decks. Which seems to be working well and seems useful. I&#x27;m also thinking that some Anki cards would stream to Zettelkasten in a slightly longer form when I go through them enough times.<p>Which systems do you use and how do you battle this problem?')
