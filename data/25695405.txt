Moving forward, when any particular platform grows to the point where it becomes a candidate&#x27;s primary means of being heard (the next Twitter&#x2F;Facebook), those companies effectively gain the power to change the outcome of an election by censoring and demonizing that person, and doing the same to the people who support that candidate.<p>Imagine in the future if a company bans and demonizes a political opponent that they don&#x27;t like because that candidate violated an arbitrary ToS - regardless of whether the candidate was right or wrong in violating those terms, due to the company&#x27;s influence and reach, would it not, for all practical purposes, count as election interference?')
