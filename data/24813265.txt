Item(by='josefx', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602967993, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24810045, text='&gt; Was it worth rewriting those scripts in C++?<p>Mostly for development, I ended up invoking the script quite often and had to wait for the results. In production the input it ran on only changed once a week, so there was no need to run it often.<p>I most likely tried to run it with Pypy first, thought I am not 100% sure on that. If I ran into a similar issue today I would first try to compile it with Cython as I already try to use type annotations in every new script I write.<p>&gt; What made you pick C++ over e.g. go or rust or C#?<p>Most of the project was already C++ and I only had to link in an Xml library for some of the output.')
