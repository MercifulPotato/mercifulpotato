Act accordingly.<p>The ceo is trying to get someone in at a lower cost to take-over your work. Do you think it will work before the site crashes or a hard bug arises?<p>Inform the investor and take the money out, be honest to him. He will not like this.<p>He will wait to invest again ( or inform other investors), untill the CEO has proven he can do it, which he probably won&#x27;t.<p>Ask the cofounder to take on a loan if that&#x27;s possible ( perhaps less than the equity), he thinks you are disposable.<p>Get out and don&#x27;t help out. Have the same contract with you as you do now, but take 10% of his equity, if you think it&#x27;s going to fail.<p>Don&#x27;t fix anything untill he signed, don&#x27;t create a bug before you leave.<p>It&#x27;s a normal thinking pattern of narcissists and it ressembles &quot;the expert beginners&quot; POV.<p>There are more opportunities, don&#x27;t try to spend a lot of time on it anymore.<p>Ps. This will probably go to court, if it&#x27;s worth it.')
