I don&#x27;t write Perl anymore either, though.<p>When Python started gaining traction, I was so incredibly turned off by the fans of the language that I swore I would never write code in it.  That was 1998.  If Python was 10% as good as those people were claiming, it would be humankind&#x27;s greatest achievement for the next 1000 years, and it isn&#x27;t.<p>Please note that I&#x27;m not saying anything bad about Python here, only its advocates in the late 1990s.  I still have a bad taste in my mouth because of those conversations, over 20 years later.')
