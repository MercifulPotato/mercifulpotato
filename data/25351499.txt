Item(by='asdfasgasdgasdg', descendants=None, kids=[25353633], score=None, time=1607462441, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25350658, text='&gt; Yesterday&#x27;s SG argument at SCOTUS brought up many of the reasons why the judicial has historically, and should continue, to stay out of foreign policy matters.<p>If there is anything generically less convincing to me than a lawyer&#x27;s presentation of arguments favoring their client&#x27;s point of view, I can&#x27;t think of it.<p>&gt; Whether the judge agrees is sort of circular logic here, not affirmation.<p>So, I&#x27;m not clear on whether you&#x27;re claiming that the president in fact does have the powers you&#x27;re ascribing to them, or if you&#x27;re saying they ought to, or if you&#x27;re saying they have historically.<p>If you&#x27;re saying the president <i>does</i> have that power, well, that&#x27;s is the contested question. The most recent update we have from the entity that has the power to decide -- the judicial branch -- is that the president does not. If you&#x27;re saying they ought to, well, that&#x27;s just like, your opinion man. :) If you&#x27;re saying they have historically, I confess some ignorance on the matter, but I&#x27;m not familiar with any recent examples of retaliatory expropriation like this in the United States.')
