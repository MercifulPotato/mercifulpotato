For example Hangouts (RIP) and Matrix both support letting people find you by number without using it as a primary identifier.<p>I assume that using numbers as identifiers has two main benefits 1. easy (insecure) auth 2. it forces everyone to provide you their number so that lookup by number works better.<p>Of course I don&#x27;t find these worth it. I have had 5 numbers so far and there is a decent chance I will switch numbers again. I don&#x27;t like having an identifier that is tied to my physical location.')
