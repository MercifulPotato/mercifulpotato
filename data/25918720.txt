Last night I had the misfortune of experiencing a comcast outage.  Although I live in the city, my neighborhood has horrible cellular coverage.  Comcast serves their outage data through their account management portal which happens to be a massive, bloated, slow javascript app.  It took minutes to load on my phone to find out if there was an outage.<p>All of this for something that should be no more complicated than entering a zip code and getting back a small page with information about whether or not there is an outage.')
