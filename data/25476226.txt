I would agree with you that premature is before you know what&#x27;s slow. But if you have a CI Profiling run showing a few hotspots it&#x27;s not premature anymore. Still people quote this adage.<p>Further there are things you should know are usually performance issues, that I would expect you to avoid entirely, except with good reason. Using O(NÂ²) or worse algorithms on big collections when there are much faster alternatives in the standard library of your language for example. I don&#x27;t think these good habits are premature optimization.')
