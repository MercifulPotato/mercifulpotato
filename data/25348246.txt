My ears don&#x27;t work with the majority of in-ear style audio devices out there for some reason-- my left ear is fine but everything falls out of my right.<p>Back when I flew a lot, I could have my IEMs in but not listening to anything and I could barely hear the engines.  There was a crying baby behind me and I didn&#x27;t know until I took them out (while listening to music almost as quietly as my phone would go).<p>It goes without saying, but they&#x27;re also incredibly comfortable too.')
