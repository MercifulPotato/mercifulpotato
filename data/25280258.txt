Not because of some immaturity, need to compensate for something missing in life, just a desire to have a good car that does on the road exactly what one wants, whenever one wants and covers all one needs from it. Sticking with it for 10+ years, having it serviced at good unofficial mechanic, so it costs +-same as crappy cars people buy new for much higher prices. Which means simply not caring about the cost, in face of overall added value to life.<p>It brings <i>long term</i> happiness. Satisfaction. Its just great. One of best investment in quality of life I ever did.')
