I wonder if an argument could even be made that didn&#x27;t even a personal fantasy&#x2F;wish fulfillment scenario.<p>K, here&#x27;s one, whether or not you accept it.  I don&#x27;t think the world would have SpaceX or Tesla were it not for the existence of billionaires.<p>Elon Musk already had a billion before founding&#x2F;buying these companies.  If he had &quot;maxed out&quot; and couldn&#x27;t make any more money, I think there is a good chance he wouldn&#x27;t have taken risks on these companies.  I think we are better off with the existence of companies like these.<p>Even if you don&#x27;t like Tesla or SpaceX, these are just examples. There are a lot of other companies that would not exist as well, especially if you consider the potential scarcity of funding in this scenario.  And without their existence we would all be worse off.<p>There are downsides to having billionaires too, but it&#x27;s pretty disingenuous to pretend there aren&#x27;t upsides as well.')
