This is partly because I have substantial bias of my own. =)<p>The statement that tipped me towards thinking you were defensive about Apple was here:<p>&gt; One of the problems is that most of what people call ‘bugs’ or relevant ‘information’ about Apple is actually false.<p>No one challenged this, and you just dropped it there like it&#x27;s a fact.  I don&#x27;t know that to be true at all, and even if it were, I don&#x27;t think it justifies Apple&#x27;s behavior towards a developer trying to inform their users about their efforts to work around a bug on the platform. Users knowing about a flaw in their device&#x27;s OS is highly relevant to them, and indeed may inform whether they want to purchase such devices again. I believe Apple is wrong to try and prevent developers from communicating this through the app store, but I read your comments as defending it.  I won&#x27;t try and argue that Apple doesn&#x27;t have a right to do so, however.  I think they do, and this is precisely why I don&#x27;t buy their products.')
