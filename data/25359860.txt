Someone else mentioned this, but an assistant at a much lower hourly rate would likely be of value. I would try to do a cost&#x2F;benefit analysis, maybe starting with the following questions:<p>- What is this individual’s billable rate? \n- Is the administrative work something that could be done by someone at an hourly rate significantly less than the billable employee?\n- Would freeing up the billable employees time from administrative work allow them to work more billable hours?\n- What would the expected loss in billable work completed be if the employee was terminated or left?\n- Etc.<p>I’ve done these calculations before, and while as a manager it is a bit irritating to have an employee not do parts of their job, there may be a business case for accommodating it.')
