And yes, I often hear people saying “you can still do that in x or y” but the point is that Go does it better than most languages because it was purposely designed with those goals in mind - hence exactly why it suffers from expressiveness, state of the art features et al. And I say this from 30 years of experience writing and managing enterprise software development projects across more than a dozen different languages.<p>Go might not be cool nor pretty, but it’s extremely  effective at accomplishing its goal.')
