A mass consumer economy ensued.<p>Given the state of consumer indebtedness now, I think our economy is actually underperforming because there is not enough demand due to low wages.<p>The problem with Fordism is that if you are a manager, there are strong incentives for your firm to defect from paying high wages. If you are the only firm doing this, the consumer economy still hums and you have larger margins.
