It also integrates with the package manager - zypper creates pre- and post- snapshots when installing updates, and the snapper utility makes it easy to roll back if your system is busted after installing an update. It&#x27;s saved my bacon on multiple occasions.<p>(btrfs also used to be the default for &#x2F;home, though that changed at some point. When I made a new install last year the installer suggested xfs by default.)')
