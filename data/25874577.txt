I would never try to plot a course from charger to charger. That sounds annoying and dangerous.<p>I also highly doubt that charger networks would scale. Right now there are already busy gas stations by every exit on the highway. Imagine how overloaded they would be if it took an hour to fill up the tank.<p>A plug-in hybrid still makes more sense. They&#x27;re far cheaper than any electric car, have all the advantages of an electric car for short trips, and have all the advantages of a gasoline car for long trips.<p>Electric cars are usable. They are not yet practical.<p>(By the way, as you may see from my other comments, I consider Tesla a criminal enterprise. It is possible I am dismissing the Supercharger network a little too easily.)')
