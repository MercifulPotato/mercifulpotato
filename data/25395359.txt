So, according to [0], about 6% of the covid related deaths have only covid as a cause.<p>According to [1], there have been 291,522 covid related deaths since Jan 21 of this year, and according to [2], there were 2,977 fatalities in 9&#x2F;11.<p>All numbers are rounded to the nearest whole number. EDIT: Except for the 6% and final results, for obvious reasons.<p>291,522 * .06 = 17,491 deaths with no related comorbidity. This number happens to be still ~1.7 times the number of drunk driving related deaths in 2017.<p>Finally...<p>17,491 &#x2F; 2,977 = 6 times the number of people who were killed by 9&#x2F;11 with no comorbidities.<p>---<p>Now, lets do the math for this past week.<p>16,308 * .06 = 978.48 deaths with no comorbidities.<p>2,977 &#x2F; 978 = 3 -- So last week was equivalent to one third of 9&#x2F;11 for deaths with no comorbidities.<p>As deaths are expected to climb, we can expect to have at least the equivalent of 9&#x2F;11 every three weeks for a while.<p>And <i>none</i> of this math includes those who were mostly fine, but happened to have a small condition that was lumped in, causing them to not be counted in the 6%.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thehill.com&#x2F;opinion&#x2F;healthcare&#x2F;514915-is-us-covid-19-death-count-inflated" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thehill.com&#x2F;opinion&#x2F;healthcare&#x2F;514915-is-us-covid-19...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;covid.cdc.gov&#x2F;covid-data-tracker&#x2F;#cases_totaldeaths" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;covid.cdc.gov&#x2F;covid-data-tracker&#x2F;#cases_totaldeaths</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Casualties_of_the_September_11_attacks" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Casualties_of_the_September_11...</a>')
