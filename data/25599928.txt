Apparently I&#x27;m never allowed to tell these stories because it&#x27;s never appropriate at any time, ever. But they&#x27;re real and they happen, and I have more. That is also a reality, but people don&#x27;t want to hear it.<p>My underlying point was that it&#x27;s too broad to say that you&#x27;ll be negatively discriminated against for setting strict boundaries. Some (more progressive) places will let you get away with more based on your ethnicity or gender.')
