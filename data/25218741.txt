Applications are sandboxed, and Apple should just defend those sandboxes. So Whatsapp cannot access your contacts unless the system allows it to, after asking the user. An App cannot just install printer drivers either.<p>But inside that guarded sandbox, Apps should be basically free to do. Apple shouldn&#x27;t be able to ban an App because they don&#x27;t want to have a development environment in it.')
