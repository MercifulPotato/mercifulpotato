There is a recent meme in American politics that says that someone arguing that both sides are the same is a bad thing. Because they&#x27;re actually arguing in favor of one of the sides in some hidden manner, or because not picking sides only supports a bad status quo, or something like that. Anyway, it&#x27;s bad and you got to downvote it.')
