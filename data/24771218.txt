They are boring slabs with annoying demand of mental attention. The cool kids are using simple open hardware to tap into p2p networks. The old people are recycling 4g tech with 3d printed mods for fun and to save money. Economy is sinking daily and the only option to buy new hardware is to finance it for life, so we avoid to do this.<p>Seriously now, my last phone is SE. \nI am old apple user.\nI plan to buy cheap Android phone for Important apps. Actually Apple of now is what I don’t trust or like. I feel that this boring, politically correct, cunning corporation is exactly the opposite of the original Apple idea and ethos. This started years ago with whole Semi-Pro trend, but now is in a full swing, not listening of pro users, milking 30 percent everything, basically is a company for “fashion people” with polished marketing. My money are safe:)')
