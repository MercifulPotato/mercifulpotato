They&#x27;re comfortable for closed, but they still do get ears&#x2F;head warm over time. This is in contrast to HD600. The sound is also like night and day difference.<p>&gt;I&#x27;ve heard they leak audio and didn&#x27;t want to annoy my coworkers.<p>At healthy (as in low and plenty sufficient) volumes this is not an issue. The reason I use closed headphones in the office is the other way around: I can hear my coworkers and they&#x27;re louder than my music is.<p>&gt;so maybe I should re-consider open-backed headphones if they breath better. Thanks for the suggestion!<p>You&#x27;re welcome. I&#x27;m confident you can&#x27;t go wrong with HD600, they&#x27;re legendary all-rounder, neutral-tuned, uncolored headphones, and at their price they&#x27;re a steal, but do watch&#x2F;read some reviews before making the call, for your own sanity.<p>Do note that HD650&#x2F;660S are less neutral and near-universally considered worse by reviewers, on both subjective and objective (measurements) metrics, even when more expensive. And the lower end HD599&#x2F;etc models aren&#x27;t even comparable on a level field, in neither sound nor build. (HD600 are modular and built like tanks. The parts are compatible with 580&#x2F;650&#x2F;660S and sold individually, for the worst case and unlikely scenario of breaking anything)<p>They&#x27;re 300 to 600Î© impedance across the frequency range, so they do benefit greatly from a headphone amp, but will still sound great even from an anemic source.<p>If you end up feeling like buying a dac&#x2F;amp combo to get that extra, perceivable improvement, do look into &quot;Audio Science Review (ASR)&quot; community for no-bullshit hard measurement driven reviews. There&#x27;s excellent solutions that do not break the bank, and a lot of hocus-pocus that measures like shit and yet has outrageous asking prices.')
