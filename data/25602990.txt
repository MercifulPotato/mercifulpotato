Why would copyright law only apply to smaller players, yet not to Google? If that is not selective&#x2F;arbitrary justice (therefore, no state of law), then what is?<p>I&#x27;m all for changing the status quo, but I doubt that this can ever be the right way. Especially considering Google&#x27;s nature and track record.')
