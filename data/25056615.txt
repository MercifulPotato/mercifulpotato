Item(by='acqq', descendants=None, kids=[25057079], score=None, time=1605083963, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25054054, text='&gt; spelling rzeki as реки, rather the more phonological жеки.<p>I&#x27;m disappointed if it&#x27;s not phonological, if it were, I believe that would be the biggest advantage of the whole approach.<p>Were the authors aware of these issues? Was it really to &quot;build the bridges&quot; or did they simply miss some nuances while making the examples?<p>Edit: Now I&#x27;m trying to check and I find on the page &quot;р̌еки&quot; with the mark, that actually keeps the phonological information, if I understand. So it seems it&#x27;s <i>not</i> &quot;реки.&quot;<p>Edit2: I&#x27;m discovering that the default rendering of the page as I saw it didn&#x27;t show much of the text (!) -- I had to turn on the &quot;reader&#x27;s mode&quot; -- so the р̌ is from the older attempt, not from the new one presented on the page. So now I see: &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t propose transcribing it to ж, for the same etymological reasons: rz comes from softened r, while ż comes from softened g. The fact that it sounds very different does not change that fact. Therefore, we simply use рь (and not this weird creation from the 19th century, р̌).&quot;<p>I really like щ instead of szcz etc. Now I understand how &quot;user unfriendly&quot; the Latin representation of Polish is (for somebody not knowing the expected pronunciations).')
