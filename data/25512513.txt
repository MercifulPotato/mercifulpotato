I think comments like these are mostly based on we, as a &quot;technical cofounder&quot; cheering section, want to see happen in the world. What&#x27;s important about that is that the outcome for this particular person is an externality to us. If the whole company blows up and all equity is worth zero, that&#x27;s great for the cheering section, even if it&#x27;s obviously worse for the technical cofounder.')
