(asking as normal USB pass-through doesn&#x27;t work for a shared VM, see [0])<p>I hadn&#x27;t even considered that. Connecting USB devices remotely works well with vSphere, but never tried that with Workstation. They are going to completely removing the hostd engine from VMware Workstation. That would indeed also include that part and it is most likely not easy to get that working without hostd.<p>[0] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;kb.vmware.com&#x2F;kb&#x2F;2005585" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;kb.vmware.com&#x2F;kb&#x2F;2005585</a>')
