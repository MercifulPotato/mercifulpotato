I call it the &quot;idiot button&quot;, as in &quot;I&#x27;m an idiot, I pressed this button by mistake&quot;<p>Ages ago, on a previous car, it was stupid easy for me to hit, for whatever reason.  I got pissed off enough I ended up taking the fob apart and destroying the contact over that button.<p>Thankfully my current car has an option to turn off the beep on lock, and doesn&#x27;t have a panic button.')
