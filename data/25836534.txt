Intel ISA operates at a very slight penalty in terms of achievable performance per watt, but nothing in an absolute sense.<p>I would argue it isn&#x27;t time for Intel to switch until we see a little more of the future as process nodes may shrink at a slower rate. Will we have hundreds of cores? Field programmable cores? More fixed function hardware on chip, or less? How will high-bandwidth high-latency gddr style memory mix with lower-latency lower-bandwidth ddr memory? Will there be on die memory like hbm for cpus?')
