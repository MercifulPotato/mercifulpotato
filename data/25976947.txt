Default-public services like this probably have an easier time being decentralized. It&#x27;d actually be nice to see thoughtful integrations between these three IMO.<p>The greatest advantage Signal has is probably doing same-day updates for all clients while being dead simple to use well. A decentralized protocol could achieve these things, but none have yet. Still I hope someday soon we can have everything be decentralized, but like the blog post says, we can&#x27;t let the perfect be the enemy of the good.')
