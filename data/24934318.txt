Consumers want the latter, companies <i>usually</i> want the former.<p>For starters there&#x27;s inflation, so if I spend $10 today and 20 years from now they revoke the license or whatever and give me 10 2040-dollars, that&#x27;s not going to be the same buying power as the $10 in 2020 dollars.<p>Second, the media landscape may have shifted by then.  If the only company in 2040 that can give me another, comparable &quot;indefinite rental license&quot; or whatever is charging $100, I want Amazon to pay _that_.')
