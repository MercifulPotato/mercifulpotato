But black swan events (covid, for example) and fraud attacks (card cashers etc etc) are major issues.<p>This might be mitigated by the dominant form of payments in the regulated marks you mentioned being debit cards, which in some ways flips the equation on risk around.<p>However, this might not sit well with consumers. Lots of people in the US like credit cards because of the substantially superior risk profile they present (to the cardholder).')
