I collected this information every hour for the entire year of 2020. The information collected include system loads, process snapshot, memory snapshot, performance of simple commands, IO performance, how full is the filesystem.<p>I am working on analyzing this data to figure out the usage patterns, interesting stats about processes such as cpu intensive vs, memory intensive processes etc. Also trying to map the activity to the time of day, day of week, month etc.<p>I am hoping this will turn out to be useful in particular because the year 2020 turned out to be interesting.<p>Once done, I am hoping to anonymize and publish the data on the web for anyone to do finer analysis.')
