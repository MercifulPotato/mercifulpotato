The idea is that anyone can make an image recognition app without coding. The app could be used as an object recognizer or a visual dictionary.<p>The app has image management and content management features for creators. Then public users can use its search function. If you have a team, you can manage access control within the app.<p>We are not in the situation where we can make automatic sign-up yet. Though the product is ready, our idea in terms of business is still very early. For now, you all can try our app, just give me an extra step to create an account for you.')
