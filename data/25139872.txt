It&#x27;s an interesting idea, but something where there will need to be a lot of research before it is viable. It&#x27;s unclear if you can create a decent modern fighter that is also a sea plane. However, if you could, using those with a seaplane tender would be much easier from a logistics standpoint than the EAB. Even if you can&#x27;t make a decent fighter seaplane, having a seaplane tanker would be very helpful for extending the range of the carrier air wing, as mentioned in the link.<p>For the drones, it&#x27;s complicated. Airborne refueling has been a thing for decades, but off the top of my head there&#x27;s never been airborne re-arming. But even if you had that you would still need to land for maintenance. But still you could probably keep these drones in the air for multiple days, maybe even a week at a time. But the logistics of managing so many tankers gets complicated fast. Check out the Black Buck raids for an example: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Operation_Black_Buck" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Operation_Black_Buck</a> . And that&#x27;s just for a bombing raid, if you want to maintain a combat air patrol you&#x27;ll need even more tankers running continuously, and a bunch more fighters since for every one on station there will be multiples coming to&#x2F;from a base or a tanker. I think long-range drones will definitely be a part of future warfare, but I think you still want a carrier to base them. I think all you need to do is move the carrier further away from anti-ship missile platforms, and increase the striking range of the air wing to compensate. There&#x27;s a very lengthy write up on this if you are interested: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;csbaonline.org&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;documents&#x2F;CVW_Report_Web_1.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;csbaonline.org&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;documents&#x2F;CVW_Report_Web_1.pd...</a>')
