Extend the template again and specialize it for some other type.<p>The two resulting derived classes are not the same, and you cannot have a function that accepts the base template with a wild card type and pass both types into it.<p>In Java, you can do: void myFunc(List&lt;?&gt; list); and all List objects with any type can be accepted by this method, in addition any class that extended List can also be accepted into this method, such as ArrayList&lt;?&gt; or whatever.<p>As far as I&#x27;ve seen, this is impossible in C++, unfortunately.')
