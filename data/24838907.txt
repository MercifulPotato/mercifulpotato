I don&#x27;t like the idea of a backdoor as much as anybody else, but this notion that you merely have to have a key to access everything is strictly false.<p>This may only be true specifically for systems that allow anybody (or some broad set of untrusted people) to see other people&#x27;s encrypted data. For most architectures backdoored E2EE is still more secure than no encryption. And obviously if there was a backdoor people wouldn&#x27;t use&#x2F;design systems that allow for easy collections.')
