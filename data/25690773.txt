They are not on YouTube now. Just looked at them. Honestly, the riots this summer were a bunch of drunk teenagers who were letting off steam. Once the liquor store got raided the mood changed from anger to a big party. The MAGA capital riot actually looked to have a similar party vibe. They just casually all became felons in the process.')
