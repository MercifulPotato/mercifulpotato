It only requires proof that the defendant said the defamatory statement &quot;with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not&quot;.  <i>New York Times Co. v. Sullivan</i>, 376 U.S. 254 (1964). (This is important because Rudy probably didn&#x27;t care one way or the other about Dominion&#x27;s reputation; they were just collateral damage as far as he was concerned.)')
