Does a person with less than 100 IQ <i>want</i> to be educated by your definition of educated?<p>---<p>Alternative theory regarding power&#x2F;politics:<p>The only thing that&#x27;s happened in the last 100 years as far as I can tell, is introduction of new ideas has outpaced the human birth&#x2F;death cycle in most places on earth.<p>When this happens, people who utilize new ideas to gain power are at odds with people who already have power but aren&#x27;t ready to transfer it using the natural birth&#x2F;death cycle.<p>This causes a great deal of friction. If you don&#x27;t want the friction to be lubricated by human blood, those who have power need to have the humility to step down and let the younger generation utilize new ideas to keep things moving.<p>American politicians are incredibly arrogant, they think the populace is going to put up with another 4-8 years of 70+ year old dinosaurs and their dinosaur friends in Washington fine dining their country to irrelevancy. Hopefully we don&#x27;t end up using human blood to resolve this friction like we&#x27;ve done historically.')
