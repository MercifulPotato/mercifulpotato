High insight density. The presentation are often 60+ pages, and you can spend hours playing with each concept in every &#x27;slide&#x27;. His talks are rabbit holes.<p>Raymond Hettinger tweets snippets of code that are delicious. His talks are really useful, too. Specifically, the one entitled &#x27;Beyond PEP8&#x27; which focuses you on the impact you can have by zooming out of details and concentrate on good design.<p>This is something I&#x27;ve been using. I write code that uses a yet to be API, and ask myself and colleagues if it makes sense for them to use it.<p>For example, I&#x27;m writing a Python wrapper for MinIO&#x27;s admin command line interfaces &#x27;mc&#x27; and &#x27;minio&#x27; which the Python client lacks.
