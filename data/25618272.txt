I named the language as such\nbecause, since the beginning when I saw some of initial presentations by Rob\nPike specifically, and some others&#x27; presentations and blog posts generally, they\nhad an air of ego when dismissing others&#x27; opinions and concerns, and appeared to\nsay &quot;these are our decisions, that is how it is, and if you don&#x27;t like it, Go\nF<i></i>* Yourself&quot;. So the project name was a GoFY to them back, from me.<p>I&#x27;m sure it looks a great language from afar, and for newcomers. But as a\nseasoned developer who has seen a few other languages in thier lifetime, you\nwill quickly begin to see the problems with the language and the ecosystem\naround it.  The astute among you may notice that in my [post yesterday][] I\ndid not claim to be an expert in Golang; it&#x27;s hard to be an expert in something\nthat&#x27;s fragile, flaky and full of special cases. For the same reason I\nnever took up using MySQL; I have heard enough stories of its flakiness and\nspecial cases that it never looked like a solid technology to me. I openly and\nwhole-heartedly recommend learning and using [Postgres][] to anyone who would\nlisten.<p>[post yesterday]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gurjeet.singh.im&#x2F;blog&#x2F;persistence-perseverance" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gurjeet.singh.im&#x2F;blog&#x2F;persistence-perseverance</a>\n[Postgres]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.postgresql.org" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.postgresql.org</a><p>Fortunately I did not invest any more time in it other than to document a few\ntimes in section [&quot;GoFY Desired Differences&quot;][differences] as to what I would\nlike to see different in the GoFY language, which in turn would make it better\nthan Golang, at least for long-time systems developers like myself. I am glad I\ndidn&#x27;t burn any oil on it because creating a new language, even a fork, is\nneither easy nor quick.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;golang&#x2F;go" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;golang&#x2F;go</a>\n[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;gurjeet&#x2F;gofy&#x2F;tree&#x2F;gofy" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;gurjeet&#x2F;gofy&#x2F;tree&#x2F;gofy</a>\n[differences]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;gurjeet&#x2F;gofy&#x2F;tree&#x2F;gofy#gofy-desired-differences" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;gurjeet&#x2F;gofy&#x2F;tree&#x2F;gofy#gofy-desired-diffe...</a>')
