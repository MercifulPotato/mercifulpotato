From my perspective the ongoing exodus towards EVs is due to EU enforcing incredibly strict emissions standard, basically from this year every manufacturer has to have a fleet average of 100g of CO2&#x2F;km traveled, with very heavy fines paid for every single car sold above that level(it has already led to Mercedes completely stopping sales of AMG vehicles since September until the end of the year, because they are so badly over the threshold), and then in few years the required average drops to 75g of CO2&#x2F;km and then 50g. Those targets are bonkers, and impossible to achieve on pure ICEs(the 100g target is maybe <i>just</i> possible, but definitely not the 75 or 50g ones). So every manufacturer who sells cars in EU has to innovate and has to move towards PHEVs and BEVs, because otherwise it will be simply impossible to sell any cars at a profit over here. VW of course knows this and that&#x27;s why there is such a strong push from their entire group towards electric vehicles.<p>I have no idea what impact the US market had on this, but from my perspective it was zero - just like American manufacturers have pulled out even further from EU, European manufacturers are simply cutting out all models that are hard to sell in US due to their regulations.')
