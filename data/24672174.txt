It is extremely common for children with Bipolar to be misdiagnosed as ADHD.<p>Depression is usually easier to diagnose accurately. Schizophrenia can be hit or miss, depending on severity. In my case (I&#x27;m bipolar), psychosis was so much a part of my normal life that I was completely blind to it and my external symptoms weren&#x27;t severe enough to be recognizable.<p>For just ADHD, There are also other classes of medication that can help. Atomoxetine, bupropion, guanfacine, and clonidine are alternative medications that work differently than first line stimulants.')
