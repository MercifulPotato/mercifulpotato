This is completely backwards.<p>Poor whites DO focus on economic issues. That&#x27;s why Trump was able to promise bringing back manufacturing &amp; coal jobs to win over a large segment of voters.<p>The problem is that all of the Democrat&#x2F;liberal&#x2F;left-wing (whichever label you prefer when discussing the core American political divide) completely denies the existence of poor whites and explicitly rejects helping them. For the past 50 years all of the focus on social justice and structural inequalities have been focused exclusively on the urban poor, racial or sexual minorities, etc.<p>If you&#x27;re a poor white kid from a trailer park in West Virginia, you might face all the expected problems - poor education, widespread substance abuse, lack of role models, lack of resources... but there&#x27;s no college scholarships for you, nobody trying to admit you to their university, nobody trying to hire you or promote you.<p>I spent 2 years as a social worker in West Virginia. The poor whites I worked with weren&#x27;t racists and weren&#x27;t stupid. They were just born into poverty and a system which pretends all whites are privileged oppressors.')
