To me this is the worst thing you could ever do. Talking via streams to say `cat file.txt | grep ERROR | wc -l`  is cool. But you could do SOOO much more, if programs would actually output structured data streams. You could connect standalone applications much in the same way as Visual Scripting, where you plug inputs and outputs together and mix them with operators (think of Unreal Engine&#x27;s Blueprint, just for command line tooling).<p>It&#x27;s a true shame that Linux did not develop a well defined CLI metaformat that defined exactly what parameters are there, what&#x27;s their documentation, their completion, what outputs does a program produce based on the parameters you provide, etc. You could do true magic with all this information. Right now you kinda still can, but it is very brittle, a lot of work and breaks potentially with each version increment.<p>I think it stems from the design failure to build your app around a CLI. Instead, you should build your app around an API and generate the CLI for that API. Then all properties of structured data streams and auto-explore CLI shells come for free.')
