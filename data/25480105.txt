Maybe you could ask your father how he feels about it.<p>I see and experience the same things you do, and I choose compassion and kindness (my mantra with strangers is: trust, care, help). I can&#x27;t change other people or the world, but I do choose how I respond to them. I can defy the evil, unhappiness and despair in the world. What I&#x27;ve learned is that it is so much better for me, and for the other people, and for the situation - it doesn&#x27;t solve every problem, it&#x27;s not the entire solution, it doesn&#x27;t even work every time, but it moves the needle; perhaps most importantly, I think it sets an example and inspires others - imagine a world without the compassionate people. Compassion is armor: When people act like jerks, usually it&#x27;s because they have their own problems, their are overwhelmed, they are afraid, etc. You and I act like jerks too. Have compassion on them and on yourself - life is hard.<p>&gt; never interact with this kind of people forever<p>Whatever kind they are, they are everywhere. We all need to find our peace of mind, but at the same time I don&#x27;t want to withdraw: What am I living for? To avoid? More people are more opportunities to live.')
