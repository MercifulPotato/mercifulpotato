It exposes his superficial level of understanding and lack of deep programming knowledge.<p>Would you hire him based on this? I wouldn&#x27;t.<p>To end on a positive note, some advice to the author:<p>Programming is a field where you can&#x27;t really hide your skill from people that are better than you. This means that &quot;fake it till you make it&quot; isn&#x27;t a viable strategy. Embrace precision in your writing and avoid guesswork. If you&#x27;re guessing about behavior, state so (or better, do research so that you don&#x27;t have to guess). Ideally, you produce technical posts that go deep, have something to say (about the problem at hand or yourself) and are not mere regurgitations of surface-level knowledge. If you don&#x27;t have something interesting to say, say nothing.')
