For one thing, a page listing only the &quot;fathers&quot; of fields doesn&#x27;t speak much to whether the majority of scientists are of the same background.<p>And even then, your page lists 19 people, 10 of which are clearly not Arab, with one other person of unknown origin. Only 8 of the ones in the list were Arab.<p>A bigger list is here:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_scientists_in_medieval_Islamic_world" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_scientists_in_medieval...</a><p>But it would take me too long to categorize each. I did click a bunch, and again - the majority were not Arabs.<p>Edit: I see my original comment was imprecise. Saying &quot;much of the golden age of science in the Islamic world was not performed by Arabs&quot;, does not mean there were no Arabs involved, but that a lot of it was by non-Arabs. However, I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if the <i>majority</i> were non-Arabs.')
