Its now a money-making device... a financial instrument. With most people pointing out how much money they&#x27;re making instead of how many issues they&#x27;ve solved.<p>Ah well. At least I learned GPU compute from this experiment. I thank the BTC community for this. (at least, those who were actual nerds and liked solving problems). The OpenCL code written by the BTC &#x2F; Eth &#x2F; Monero &#x2F; etc. etc. communities was clean, usable, and easily experimented upon.<p>I got what I wanted out of the cryptocoin community. So its been worthwhile. It also taught me the importance of community values: seeing the nerd paradise corrupt itself into financial interests taught me a lot about human nature, and the evolution of communities.<p>Its not so much that &quot;the nerds&quot; got corrupted. The community got corrupted as money became more and more the focus. It makes me wonder how VCs keep a &quot;technology culture&quot; at the forefront of the actual financial markets (like YCombinator).')
