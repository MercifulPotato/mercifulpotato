It&#x27;s for the non-specific case of keeping the code clear, understandable, and bug-free. The style was chosen for these reasons, not because it is more performant. It just happens to also be more performant than the layers of indirection that also harm understandability.<p>For a procedural code base, avoid subprocedures that are only called once.<p>For a pure functional codebase, e.g. Haskell, locally-scoped single-use functions can be beneficial.')
