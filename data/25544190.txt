All the auditors are saying is that you have to use a FIPS approved algorithm. The FIPS people have real cryptography experts who research this stuff on a daily basis that also help set the security standards for the entire U.S. government. The author is coming along here saying they are using something else that’s not approved by FIPS (for good reason I might add) and they’re mad the auditors won’t let them simply because “everyone else is using bcrypt”.')
