A lot of AAA games are designed with every moment being a handcrafted experience. That is, some sort of scripted thing is happening that couldn&#x27;t happen organically by normal mechanics. Older AAA titles tended to just produce a solid set of mechanics and just let them speak for themselves.<p>But there&#x27;s plenty of good stuff that still leans into that approach.')
