Item(by='wayoutthere', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605456331, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25100256, text='&gt; There is a chance you could do here what powerline adapters do, and use the ground wire to communicate. But they are notoriously inconsistent and there&#x27;s any number of reasons it wouldn&#x27;t work<p>This is exactly how Insteon works in conjunction with a wireless mesh. I&#x27;m extremely happy with my Insteon setup -- it&#x27;s just a matter of replacing light switches and outlets with a bit of re-wiring on 3-wire switches (no new wires to run, just bypassing one of the switches so only one controls the light). The Insteon-branded hub is fine for a few light switches, but if you&#x27;re doing a whole house and need something that can handle more complex configuration I would go for an ISY994 controller (don&#x27;t know if anything newer exists but it&#x27;s been rock solid for the last 5 years).<p>All that said, it was expensive and probably not worth it. I spent $4k on a somewhat large house and I was able to justify it as a learning experience for in-home IoT device use cases -- but I&#x27;m not sure there&#x27;s much benefit to doing a whole house with it over just a couple rooms.')
