It&#x27;s a fear I&#x27;ve had even though I&#x27;ve been a top performer the entire five years I&#x27;ve been professionally working.<p>Maybe it&#x27;s because I grew up poor or because I think things are too good in tech and about to crash any day.<p>My antidote? $100k in liquidity. Preferably not invested in the NASDAQ.<p>If tech crashes, you can take your liquid $100k and move to Thailand, Spain, Portugal, Turkey, etc. In these countries, you can live well for a decade, sometimes even thirteen years off just $100,000 USD.<p>I know $100k isn&#x27;t much and it certainly isn&#x27;t the $1M - $3M people want for retirement in the US. But it&#x27;s enough to have peace of mind.')
