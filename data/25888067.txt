I mean that anything you say that is publicly accessible can be used against you. Consider that you are charged with, I don&#x27;t know, theft of a Coke. And you have a twitter account where you say you love Coke so much, but hate that its so expensive. This could very well be used against you, as it goes to a general motive. In the same way, HN discussions are wide ranging and could be used by a prosecutor in a similar way. And indeed, just posting here at all on a site with &quot;hacker&quot; in its title is inherently risky.')
