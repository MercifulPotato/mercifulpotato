The fact that someone worked their whole life while living in Finland is accounted for. I.e. the link you&#x27;ve shared includes average amount of accrued pension for each birth year. So if someone was born in 1960, joined workforce around 20 y.o., worked for 40 years they would have in average about â‚¬1414. If they continue to work until retirement earning 6K, their pension will grow to 1.9K.<p>If this 4K&#x2F;mo is easily achievable only if you have another pension from a more generous country, then it is not proving your point much.')
