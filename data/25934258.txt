I have done a fair bit of work working with organizations to identify ML use cases. When we looked at it from a business process perspective, honestly it didn&#x27;t go very well. Trying to find company process specific interventions, especially in the format of building a funnel to priortize which to move forward, rarely surfaces unique or game changing ideas. We usually ended up generating a list of things where either ML played a minimal role, something more simple would have been better, or you&#x27;d need AGI.<p>What I&#x27;ve seen work better is a product approach, where ML is incorporated as a feature (rarely but possible the centerpiece) of a full solution for an industry that provides a new way of doing something and the value that comes with it. The caveat is that this is hard and takes up front R&amp;D and product market fit research that any product would. It doesn&#x27;t happen in a series of workshops with representatives from the  business.<p>This Dropbox story is an obvious counterexample, and really looks like the mythical &quot;low hanging fruit&quot; that we always want to identify in ideation workshops. But I&#x27;d be careful trying to generalize a process for identifying ML use cases from it.')
