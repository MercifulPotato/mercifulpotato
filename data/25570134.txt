Your IDE won&#x27;t have syntax highlighting and auto completion for it, and a lot of developers nowadays seem crippled without those. Linters and semantic checkers won&#x27;t understand it. Nor will debuggers. There will be no mocking libraries or makefile rules for it. The list goes on and on.<p>These are problems that every new non-domain-specific language has to address. It&#x27;s quite a lot, and most of it is pretty tedious compared to designing the language itself. So even those who try to create DSLs often skip most of the &quot;extra&quot; bits, and other developers learn to hate DSLs.')
