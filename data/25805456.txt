Item(by='dkarl', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610830760, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25804590, text='I think in any community that is gratified in some way by a belief, there&#x27;s a spectrum from actually believing at one end, to enjoying the camaraderie and enjoying the belief as a conscious fantasy at the other end, and I think people who inhabit the &quot;conscious fantasy&quot; end can slide towards the &quot;true believing end&quot; via suspension of disbelief, like people do while enjoying a movie or a role-playing game.<p>When the community is something like a sci-fi fandom community, people on the actually believing end of the spectrum would be considered mentally ill, while people on the camaraderie-and-fantasy end are considered well-adjusted.  In a religious community, it&#x27;s more complicated, and people on either end of the spectrum might be accepted or stigmatized depending on the religion itself and the point of view of the beholder.<p>Either way, if you think of fandom communities and religious communities as analogues, you wouldn&#x27;t expect these communities to go away until people can no longer get gratification they want from them.  I don&#x27;t know how that can be accomplished.')
