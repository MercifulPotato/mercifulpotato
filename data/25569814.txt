One could argue that Data Scientists working with libraries in Pythin are already using a DSL, just with an escape hatch into the general-purpose world.<p>I don&#x27;t think proper vertical DSLs should be made marketed towards people who are comfortable working in a general-purpose language. I see them as a way to help non-technical domain experts work on code instead of specification. Limiting the possibilities of what one can write, like with MPS&#x27; projectional editor, is a feature here and not a bug.')
