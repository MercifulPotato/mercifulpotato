Honestly, I don&#x27;t get why these were not made mandatory for all kinds of appliances. There are even locking variants available if vibration is of concern.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what you mean by the second sentence but you can&#x27;t use most appliances made for Europe in America and vice versa. Most electronic appliances depend on the input voltage and supplying 240V can easily cause a fire. That is true for almost all electronic appliances (water heater, fan, washing machine, etc) but not true most &quot;computer related devices&quot; such as a monitor, PSU, charger. Since those devices already operate on a much lower DC Voltage, they often have transformers (not sure if that&#x27;s the right word), that can scale down the current from either 120 or 240. [0]<p>That being said, a mandatory IEC connector (and it&#x27;s variances) would help a lot to cut down unnecessary e-waste. Instead of throwing away a device because the cable is damaged, you can easily order a replacement that is around $2 and high quality, instead of relying third party cords that might have bad wiring from a non reputable brand. The reason they are not mandatory, though, is that most companies like to have their own connectors so that you either overpay for it or just buy a new device.<p>[0]: You should still always read the specs on the input current for the device though. It is dangerous to rely on the fact that similar devices can operate at 120V&#x2F;240V because yours might not. You can usually see the specs on the website&#x2F;packaging or usually near the input plug.')
