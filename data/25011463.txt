Once I discovered that Ctrl-L can bring up the url&#x2F;file path I found it at least usable, but still not pleasant.<p>Am I using it wrong? Can I change the default system wide somehow? Is there a design document which can finally convince me that this is generally a good idea, just not for me?<p>Also, some Gtk apps had&#x2F;have tearable menus, a shame these went out of fashion. Is there something fundamentally wrong with that, too, or can this be enable globally for Gtk, and maybe even Qt apps?')
