That minimizes the burden on everyone else, trying to guess what is permissible and having to cut things up to satisfy the licensing bureaucracy.<p>It reminds me of the situation where we have crappy TV box sets where the music gets replaced because the concept of a home-video release wasn&#x27;t even on the radar to consider when the original series was prepared and paid for.  Again, the license should have been paid for and exhausted at that point.<p>I really believe the ultimate answer is a mandatory (presumably state-run) IP clearinghouse-- whether you want to pay 10 cents to buy cover for the neighbour&#x27;s TV audio bleeding into your livestream, or a bajillion dollars for &quot;every movie ever made&quot; to populate your streaming service, there should be a way to cut out the complexity of &quot;who do I speak with&quot; and &quot;what do I do if they&#x27;re dead&#x2F;unreachable&#x2F;intentionally uncooperative&quot;.  Twitch writes a cheque for a few hundred grand a month to for blanket coverage, and the IP cartels fight behind the scenes to slice it up.')
