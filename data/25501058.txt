Sure, the motor is far simpler than an ICE. But there&#x27;s still a cooling system, with pumps and hoses and heat exchangers. Those are all parts. There&#x27;s still seats, with sensors and motors and mounting rails. There are steering assemblies, with linkages and actuators for power steering. There&#x27;s the whole infotainment system, which contains just as many parts if not more as an iPhone would have. So when comparing the idea of a car having an order of magnitude more parts and complicated supply chains its still true even with an electric car.')
