Other parts of CA are terrible. As you&#x27;ve pointed out it&#x27;s both smoggy and hot. Coming from FL where there are only two seasons, I call Bay Area&#x27;s weather &quot;air conditioning&quot; weather. It feels like you&#x27;re in a really nice climate controlled building, but outside with sun. That said, it&#x27;s not going to last with climate change. Air quality is already taking a beating with all the forest fires, and it&#x27;s getting hotter and hotter. Pretty soon, it&#x27;ll be no different from what people think of today as SoCal weather.')
