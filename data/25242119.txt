They are using nitrogen gas, effectively displacing oxygen and asphyxiating the patient. This is massively important because of how inhumane poisonous gases tend to be, and how humane death by inert gas is.<p>While it&#x27;s listed in the article as an example, no-one has ever actually been executed via nitrogen asphyxiation (though it is used in slaughterhouses in some countries). The only sort of executions by gas which have actually been performed in the US used hydrogen cyanide; no such executions have happened since the 90s, but it&#x27;s still on the books in a few states. Hydrogen cyanide is indeed the active ingredient in Zyklon B. This rule would appear to allow the federal death penalty to use hydrogen cyanide in certain states where it&#x27;s still legal (though it&#x27;s hard to imagine that they actually would; _horrible_ optics, and it&#x27;s extremely inhumane).')
