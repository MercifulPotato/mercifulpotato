Nice to see you here. \nI first learned of Fr. Reggie while looking for something on the Marquette theology webpages, so I&#x27;m ever grateful to whoever posted his info there.<p>I was impressed with how he bore with good humor the inability of his order to care for him when his health declined. That&#x27;s a degree of holiness that I don&#x27;t find easy to enact.  I&#x27;m sure there was more than this, but not knowing him well, this is what I saw in brief encounters.')
