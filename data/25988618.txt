Personally, I am head over heels for Casio as well. You can have a great Casio collection (MDV-106 Duro, G-Shock, A168) for under $100. Casio has sold their original black G-Shock virtually unchanged for decades; you can pick one up for $45 at Amazon or WalMart and a lot of folks consider that watch as important as anything Rolex has ever done.<p>While I admittedly <i>was</i> quickly &quot;addicted&quot; to watches, climbing the ladder of luxury watches held zero interest to me. It was just so obvious to me from the beginning: you can literally spend as much as you want and you&#x27;ll never be happy. Cars, hi-fi gear, it all works that way.<p><pre><code>    Their beauty combined with their flaws puts people on \n    the never ending, wallet destroying quest for the holy \n    grail. And the diminishing returns from jumping from a \n    &quot;budget&quot; watch of 3-500$ to a &quot;nice&quot; one of 2-3000$ are\n    ridiculously small.\n</code></pre>\nI never felt this pressure, but many do. The nice thing about this hobby is that nobody gives a shit what you&#x27;re wearing.<p>The average person just sees that you&#x27;re wearing <i>a watch</i>, unless you&#x27;re wearing something super gaudy.<p>Watch people... well, they&#x27;re kind of like car people. The prices for truly top-end stuff are <i>so</i> astronomical that nobody can afford it anyway, so folks just focus on little niches that interest them. Your average car nut has a collection that is more &quot;quirky&quot; and &quot;surprising bang for the buck&quot; than &quot;this is the ultimate car, bow down to me.&quot; Similar with watches: it&#x27;s generally not like a pecking order where people with $5000 watches look down on people with $500 watches. People who really like this stuff tend to just appreciate cool watches, whatever &quot;cool&quot; means to them.')
