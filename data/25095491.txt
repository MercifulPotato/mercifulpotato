Pretty much by definition, the organization is structured so that its <i>current</i> projects have sensible homes, but when a totally new project comes up, it is unlikely to fit perfectly anywhere in that structure. If it did, it wouldn&#x27;t be totally new!<p>None of the options for dealing with this seem great. I&#x27;ve seen &quot;internal incubator&quot; type things which are designed to come up with new ideas, but honestly I&#x27;m not a fan of these. The structure incentivizes prototyping new &quot;left field&quot; ideas, but those ideas are likely not to gain any traction, and if they do, it is likely to be a mess to transition them into real projects within the more normal operations of the organization. And it does nothing for projects that are clearly important from inception, even if new; the &quot;left field&quot; incubator is not the right place to put something that isn&#x27;t a crazy idea being tested but something known to be important.')
