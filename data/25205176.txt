I&#x27;d say every time I&#x27;ve fired up the profiler to try to speed something up I&#x27;ve gotten a surprise and rarely is it because of inefficient code on my part.  (And the only one of those I recall is where I used n^2 routines knowing n was small--only the use had evolved, when I wrote it n was generally around 20 and almost never over 50.  When I got asked to look into it there was a case where n was around 2000.)')
