Even then, it&#x27;s clear that quite a few interviews I&#x27;ve gone on have been &quot;fake&quot;, in the sense of being useful for EEOC stats, but with no <i>bona fide</i> intention to hire.  Which is frustrating, because at the end of the day, interviews are themselves unpaid work.<p>These days, I&#x27;ve &quot;solved&quot; the problem by just taking lower-paying jobs.  No one I work with really understands what I do--they just know that when they bring me the harder problems, they generally get solved.  It&#x27;s kind of nice in a way to be king, even if it is in a puddle.<p>Fair or not, the market always wins.  And if the market tells you that you&#x27;re not wanted, best to go elsewhere.')
