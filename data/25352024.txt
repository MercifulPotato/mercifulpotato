I&#x27;ve been using Vavr&#x27;s Option type in Java a lot lately (having banned the use of null from my code), and I don&#x27;t have any issues with it.  I avoid Vavr&#x27;s pattern matching because I find the syntax to be clunky (not a criticism of the Vavr developers; I think what they&#x27;ve done is impressive within Java&#x27;s syntax limitations).  I do miss pattern matching in general, but I don&#x27;t find using Option to be any more difficult without it.  And no, I never use Option.get(); I have an ArchUnit test set up that will fail the build if anyone tries.<p>On the flip side, I <i>do</i> find Option a pain to use in <i>Rust</i> sometimes, which does have pattern matching.  I think that&#x27;s a function of the borrow checker making some things harder to express.  So perhaps it&#x27;s not Dart&#x27;s missing pattern matching that would make Option hard to use there, but some other feature (or missing feature) of the language or type system?')
