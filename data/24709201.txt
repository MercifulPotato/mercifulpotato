I don&#x27;t want to spend my precious spare time fixing my tools, which for something as basic and ubiquitous as a trackpad should just work already. For how many decades have trackpads existed? Why are we still shipping broken trackpad experiences, and why is it me, the end user, who is being told that if I don&#x27;t fix it myself then I don&#x27;t care enough?<p>In any case, a non-kernel developer fixing it in a day of coding is IMHO wildly unrealistic. While I have 20 years of programming experience, I have zero experience with kernel development--which some of the most complex software in existence--let alone input stack development. I don&#x27;t even have the domain vocabulary to <i>describe</i> the problem. A lumberjack might know how to cut wood, but that doesn&#x27;t automatically make him a carpenter.')
