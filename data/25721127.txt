I tend to try (key word) to use the strongest form of someone&#x27;s argument (not that I think you&#x27;re talking about their weakest form).<p>But what I was originally going to say is that the language gets really fuzzy really fast. Like you could argue that sex education is a form of persuasion (though I wouldn&#x27;t say coercion) and is easily argued as a form of population control. But I think many of us would call that beneficial. I&#x27;d say the same with free&#x2F;cheap and easy access to forms of birth control. I&#x27;d say that enables more choice. But if we&#x27;re talking about a counseling center that guilt trips someone into having the child or not having the child I&#x27;d call that coercion and I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s right. But others would call that persuasion and education. So I think this gets messy really quick and a bit of expanding on the thought for clarification is needed.')
