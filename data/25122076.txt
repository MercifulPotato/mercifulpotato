Should it make more sense to optimize my current life and try to stay alive as long as possible?<p>If i&#x27;m reincarnated, should i start to make the current world a better place to life for the risk of me being reincarnated somewhere else?<p>Should i spend my time and effort of trying to find a mechanism to keep my knowledge and try to reconnect with my previous me?<p>Of course all funny interesting thoughts, at the end of the day, i saw enough people around me living a normal life, dying and thats it.<p>But i&#x27;m curious when we create an AI what logic it will come up to kill or not kill itself.')
