Why somebody who cares enough about their laptop to get it to repair (if you have plenty of money, more likely you&#x27;ll get a new one) not care about getting it back?<p>This would prove that gmail indeed sent the e-mail, but it wouldn&#x27;t prove that the e-mail wasn&#x27;t created few minutes earlier.')
