What model number was that? DD-WRT has been ported to the Archer series but if you&#x27;re talking a ZyNOS based router then you&#x27;re probably out of luck. Those ZyNOS devices are the real bottom end of the market though.<p>This brings back memories :) <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ixo.de&#x2F;info&#x2F;zyxel_uclinux&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ixo.de&#x2F;info&#x2F;zyxel_uclinux&#x2F;</a> Sure, we are talking about low-end (real bottom) devices and date models here. I cannot recall the model number, but I think we both agree that routers that cannot run linux exist, although not very common (anymore).<p>&gt; Any OS designed around kernels, memory safety etc would be useless in general for constrained devices.<p>How about QNX then?<p>&quot;QNX is a commercial Unix-like real-time operating system, aimed primarily at the embedded systems market. QNX was one of the first commercially successful microkernel operating systems. As of 2020, it is used in a variety of devices including cars and mobile phones.&quot; - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;QNX" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;QNX</a><p>They are &quot;aimed primarily at the embedded systems market&quot;, their latest release is from &quot;7.1 &#x2F; July 2020; 5 months ago&quot; and they are operating their business model since 1982.')
