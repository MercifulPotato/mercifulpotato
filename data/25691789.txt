Parler is an app that, regardless of its intentions, is used to promote far right extremism and many of the people on the platform promote terrorism and facism. These people don&#x27;t care about free speech. Their lives suck and can&#x27;t conceptualize the fact that its not black people&#x27;s fault or other&#x27;s fault for their crappy life. Its the people they vote for and their immediate surroundings (so probably parents) that are at fault.')
