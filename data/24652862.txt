Item(by='leetcrew', descendants=None, kids=[24660087], score=None, time=1601569650, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24652640, text='&gt; Literally half the pins are missing on charge-only cables.<p>okay, but unless you know which pins are missing, how do you know you&#x27;re not looking at a data-only cable?<p>&gt; From me, because my partner bought an USB-C to 3.5mm jack converter that refused to work with &quot;this device only supports official huawei converters&quot;. That, and two completely different cables with almost disjoint functionality look _the same_. If they mandated color coding or anything else to be able to physically determine what cable is what, I wouldn&#x27;t complain.<p>this sounds like more of a huawei issue than a USB-C issue. if a manufacturer is just going to refuse to support a standards-compliant cable, you&#x27;re out of luck either way. color coding would be nice though, they could have made that mandatory rather than recommended. I&#x27;m sure companies like apple wouldn&#x27;t give a fuck either way and would just go with whatever looked aesthetically pleasing, USB-IF cert be damned.<p>&gt; That all said, the _charging_ story is decent enough, everything else is garbage.<p>what &quot;everything else&quot; is garbage? there are higher speed variants, but you seem to already consider it reasonable to look at pins, so that shouldn&#x27;t be a problem for you. thunderbolt support doesn&#x27;t need any special pins; it just needs a high quality cable, which is analogous to the charging situation for this and the previous generation.')
