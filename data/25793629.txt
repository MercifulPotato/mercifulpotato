I&#x27;m not a fan of gold because you can&#x27;t do anything with it, but at least people have valued it for millennia. If tomorrow, the world goes mad and decides that AAPL isn&#x27;t worth anything and I can buy all the shares for a trivially small price, it&#x27;s still a company with billions in assets making billions per year. If people wake up tomorrow and realize bitcoin is a slightly less useful version of a first edition Charizard, you&#x27;re kinda out of luck.<p>Oh, and it might have systemic security issues that haven&#x27;t surfaced yet.
