It&#x27;s much slower to create a .tar.xz file with the default settings, but also saves a considerable amount of disk space.<p>Side by side comparison right now between a full system file tree backup of a mediawiki server, the .tar.xz file is about 1.8GB, the .tar.zstd file is 2.15GB. The same thing in traditional .tar.gz format is obviously even larger.<p>From the research I&#x27;ve done on common uses of zstd it&#x27;s much better suited to applications where very high speed of compression and decompression is a major requirement, but absolute smallest file size is not. Typically as a replacement for gzip.')
