You need to stay hydrated or you&#x27;ll face fatigue, muscle problems and generally perform worse.<p>Trained athletes will be able to drink much less but that is because their bodies are more efficient, they still need to hydrate for maximum performance. The 1 hour rule isn&#x27;t set in stone and you can go 3-4 hours without drinking but it has many drawbacks.')
