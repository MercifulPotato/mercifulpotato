You can read this sentiment of it just about everywhere. For simplicity - take it as exactly that: a drug that induces the feeling of the happiest warmth imaginable<p>Then, realize, some people come from absolutely fucked and broken lives. Being beaten and raped by their own family members they have to live with (sometimes for years) - if you&#x27;re not aware that things like this go on - I&#x27;m mostly happy for you. But yeah, this is very much a thing.<p>Then put together what it has to be like being a person coming from an absolutely broken place and having never had the slightest emotional warmth and happiness in your entire life, and finding something relatively cheap and easily sourced that takes away all of that pain for some amount of time.<p>Then, realize, that tolerance to this euphoria inducing drug grows rather quickly, what you find on the street gets laced with shit like fentanyl, etc - and it&#x27;s not hard to see why countless deaths occur.<p>Also, somewhat unrelated, but you sound like you&#x27;ve never had much of a bout with <i>extreme</i> lasting physical pain. Shit can get unfathomably intense.<p>For better answers perhaps, look to the bluelight forums.')
