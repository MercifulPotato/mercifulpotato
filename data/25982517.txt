When I was working in Switzerland a long time ago, one of the comments I heard frequently is that I am not like other Indians - I dress well, speak well and I am tall. I would consider it as a &quot;racist&quot; comment, but not something that would get reported. One of my other friends from India felt similar, if he is not dressed in a suit, he would be treated differently. I doubt he would report it either. You are different and will be treated differently. Jariel made a similar point above - you are constantly aware that it is not your country. I do not feel the same in US.')
