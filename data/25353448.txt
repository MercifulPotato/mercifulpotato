Clothes are probably going to a big return to store once things reopen, since fits can be all over the place between or even within stores. (Yes, online experiences offer relatively hassle free returns, but I still consider waiting for a few days only to get something with poor fit or cheap and then waiting for it to be received at returns more painful than just trying on clothes in person.)')
