If you see the same hash from &gt;10 distinct IP addresses in a 24 hour period, save the search terms.<p>That&#x27;s just off the top of my head, I have no reason to think they&#x27;re doing it exactly like that. The point is that you&#x27;re claiming that we shouldn&#x27;t trust DuckDuckGo because you can&#x27;t think of a way that they could securely and privately do what they do -- but that&#x27;s just your intuitions, for whatever they may be worth.<p>I also don&#x27;t really buy the worries you have with the last two questions, e.g.:<p>&gt; How do you verify that DuckDuckGo does not secretly cooperate with more powerful coercive actors?<p>How would you verify that for <i>any</i> centralized service, open source or not? I think your security concerns go a bit beyond what most people interested in critiquing &#x2F; improving DDG can reasonably expect to achieve.')
