The concept of &quot;limbic resistance&quot;, as brought up by Andrew Huberman when talking about Goggins, is really fascinating [0].<p>The concept that doing things that you hate doing is &quot;exercising of the muscle of willpower&quot; is very revealing. It&#x27;s something I&#x27;ve tried to do adopt, and it&#x27;s been a very powerful motivator in getting me to work out and reduce procrastination. As banal as it may sound — like the father in Calvin and Hobbes saying &quot;it builds character&quot; — it&#x27;s also a great way of framing it.<p>And I assure you I&#x27;m neither a<p>&gt; <i>&quot;troubled teenager who took my latest shower 3 weeks ago&quot;</i><p>or a<p>&gt; <i>&quot;middle-age professional of some sort who cannot close his trousers anymore because of additional calories brought on by family life&quot;</i>.<p>Your comment doesn&#x27;t paint you as a very positive person. Of course, it&#x27;s fine if you&#x27;d like to be that way, but my question is: why? What good does writing a comment like this do you (or me, or anyone reading it)? To me, these sorts of despondent and cynical comments seem to come from the very types of people you think listen to Goggins.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=ujz29rQvDvA" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=ujz29rQvDvA</a>')
