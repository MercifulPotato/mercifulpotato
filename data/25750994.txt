Item(by='slg', descendants=None, kids=[25751321, 25751232], score=None, time=1610475487, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25750618, text='&gt;Personally I think these movements are the natural result of pivoting our epistemological institutions from truth-seeking to progressive political advocacy.<p>What institutions are you claiming have shifted from &quot;truth-seeking to progressive political advocacy&quot;?  It seems to me that the reason these institutions appear more progressive is that American conservatism is becoming less and less in touch with the truth.  There are countless examples, but the two most obvious ones are climate change and the politicization of basic COVID precautions like mask wearing.  When you stake out the claim that acknowledging climate change is a progressive viewpoint, the National Weather Service is going to start looking progressive when it reports facts.<p>&gt;when the right asks, “how do we know that racism and not crime rates belies police shooting disparities?”<p>The problem is that when these questions are answered &quot;the right&quot; just dismisses the answers as biased.  There is little to no way to satisfactorily answer that question in a way that will change people&#x27;s minds if they already believe that police are justifiably harsher against Black people because Black people commit more crime.')
