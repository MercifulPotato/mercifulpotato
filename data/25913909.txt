Intel processors wouldn&#x27;t be good for gaming, still there would probably be a set of games for casual gamers where they might suffice.<p>As per my understanding NNENC isn&#x27;t present in all GPUs since it is not something that all gamers would require. And since this is not something that most people want it&#x27;s not clearly advertised in CPUs.<p>So to further clarify here is the task: To render graphics 2d or 3d on an APU and then compress this with HW accelerated encoding. The video stream can then be transferred via say Wifi to the VR device or phone.<p>I am so curious as to whether there is an APU that supports this. While state of the art APUs obviously always will lag behind a dedicated GPU, there are performance advantages for example since there is less latency while they share the same ship etc..<p>Obviously my aim here is not to figure out the perfect gaming rig, but rather try to figure out what APU could support VR over wireless so to speak. Which might be sort of nieche but I&#x27;m sure could solve some category of problems.')
