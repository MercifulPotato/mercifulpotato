What I discovered is that most larger companies simply don’t do this schedule because the larger a company is the higher the competition. That’s why I only use CL for applying to jobs because I have more leverage to negotiate my hours.<p>Also, even though you may be able to start part-time, as the company grows, you will become a more integral employee, and your responsibilities will grow which materially implies you’ll be expected to go full time eventually. The best way to get around this is to work 5 days a week but fewer hours each day.')
