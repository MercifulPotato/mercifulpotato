Local and State governments and representation are important parts of the Republic.<p>Dollars are just numbers in a database. Will you give me all your money? Or is it only certain &quot;made-up&quot; things that are important to you?<p>&gt; Do you seriously not see how that can lead to disproportionate representation of some views?<p>Yes, and straight up popular vote leads to the same thing. That&#x27;s why we have a system that is a combination of popular vote and state vote.<p>* The People are represented by the House.<p>* The States are represented by the Senate.<p>* Both are represented by the President.<p>Seems like a well-balanced system to me.')
