But in another sense, you can&#x27;t just throw unsafe around things. Unsafe doesn&#x27;t turn off checks. Unsafe adds new unchecked constructs. This means you can&#x27;t have written a bunch of code, run into errors, and just toss unsafe {} around it. You&#x27;d have to actually re-write it with unsafe constructs in the first place.<p>You <i>can</i> very much do that, if you want. But it&#x27;s not a <i>trivial</i> escape hatch.')
