Would you suggest Ransomware is good? Because it also creates jobs. As do Nigerian email scams and Ponzi schemes.   &quot;Creating Jobs&quot; doesn&#x27;t mean something is good for society.<p>&gt; You are also sort of missing the point. We are trying to make ads relavant for everyone, but even if it&#x27;s relavant, you don&#x27;t click on everything you see.<p>Apparently you are missing the point here. Whether you see it or not, Facebook and google&#x27;s marketplaces <i>by nature</i> serve advertisers, not me. Advertisers don&#x27;t give a damn what advertising is &quot;most relevant&quot; to me. What they care about is which demographics are most profitable to their brands.<p>&gt; We are trying to make ads relavant for everyone<p>So long as Google and Facebook put the advertisers in control of who sees their advertising, any assertion that the system is designed to serve us is bullshit. People don&#x27;t see advertising that is <i>relevant</i>, they see advertisements from the people who pay google&#x2F; Facebook to see their message. Those two things are not equivalent and never will be.')
