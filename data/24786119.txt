There is dozens of bot channels that have nothing better to do at the moment but post videos that look like news channel broadcasts with a semi-convincing TTS reads various news regarding conspiracy theories (ie, &quot;Bill Gates about to be arrested over 5G-Corona&quot;).<p>They post videos at almost hourly pace, distributed over several channels and each video has a unique image to it (ie, different logos, different TTS settings). If normal well researched content had to compete with that, it would loose by being buried under the sheer mass of bot generated bullshit.<p>And that isn&#x27;t even counting the number of videos produced by actual humans that are just as bad.<p>A lot of conspiracy theorists aren&#x27;t above threatening violence and law suits (usually libel) against those exposing them or simply posting the truth, I&#x27;ve heard of multiple instances of that occuring, atleast one in-person.<p>This isn&#x27;t two sides arguing peacefully about one position or the other, it&#x27;s one side being violent and disrespectful to the other. &quot;Flattening&quot; the discovery of other content is basically asking the otherside to be not-violent and stand back so that the violent side can have their say.<p>Sometimes violence comes from both sides of the debate too (ie, US politics) but that doesn&#x27;t make the amount of disrespect by people purposefully lying or spreading lies any better.<p>Free speech, as I see it, means that you can express your opinion freely without repercussions unless it&#x27;s advocating for violence against people or groups of people. If you&#x27;re talking about facts, those should not fall under free speech under the simple premise that facts are either provable or you should say that you have no proof or you should expose them as the opinions they are.')
