Item(by='Torwald', descendants=None, kids=[25469992], score=None, time=1608312319, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25467864, text='In this comment I want to provide three basic thoughts, that I think are having the potential to be helpful for Rukshan in his blogging endeavour.<p>The first one is about due diligence and the two times we have to make a first impression.<p>In the last section headline Rukshan has made a typo. He wrote &quot;statistics&quot; when he obviously meant to say &quot;static.&quot; Now, typos happen, but they don&#x27;t help with that first impression. A blog is a written thing, which means the art an craft of writing is essential to it.<p>The second time we make a first impression is when we open our mouth. Translated to the blog this means, the first impression the reader gets of the quality of the writing.<p>Obvious carelessness like typos in headlines are not helpful.<p>In the mentioned section headline there seems to be a typographic glitch as well, since &quot;site&quot; is not set in bold, unlike the other two words there.<p>If you state that it has become more difficult to start a blog, well, then even more so would it suit you well to get the basic polishing right.<p>The second thought I want to provide is a comment about the overall perspective on blogging presented here. When I read the headline, I thought: this must be about writing, about gaining traction in linkage, about building readership. Since it is on HN, maybe even about how to build a business around a blog. Instead it is about the one thing that doesn&#x27;t count at all: what kind of blogging engine you are going to use.<p>Now, nearly every new blog has this reflection, I guess because the new blogger just went to the process of choosing a blog engine, decided on a theme and all that. But it&#x27;s hardly important. Why do I say so?<p>Because, let&#x27;s see, what is the work in a blog?<p>If I write 1k of blog posts and submit 25 of them to HN, have 100 of them on reddit and design my own theme. Compared to that workload, installing the engine and theme amounts to virtually nothing.<p>What I am trying to say is this: ultimately it is more helpful to see a blog as something else then just a piece of software.<p>This brings me to the third thought I want to offer.<p>I understand that a certain blogging engine prompts you for a stupid slogan. So Rushkan goes like &quot;Rushkan&#x27;s brain on the internet&quot;, which prompts me to ponder what he means with that. Is this meant to say, he sees his blog as a sort of external brain online? Or does it mean that he shared thoughts about the internet? Not hard to guess, but not clear either.<p>Then he has the double mention of his name there: &quot;Rushkan&#x27;s blog&quot; above &quot;Rushkan&#x27;s brain.&quot;<p>So, a bit of polish there would be good as well. Now, I personally think that it was a wrong path, that a certain bloggin engine took us on, with requiring titles for every entry and having that slogan prominently there. But it is what it is, how could a good slogan be written?<p>It should be written as such, that the right people want to immediately read it because it rings a bell.<p>Think about how the mother of all tech blogs did it so well: &quot;News for nerds. Stuff that matters.&quot;')
