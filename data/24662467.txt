Still I believe they barely overlap (privacy and freedom of speech). It&#x27;s a grey area. For instance, I can violate your privacy and not telling it to anyone (peeking through your window), and I can also tell something about you in a community without violating your privacy (give an opinion, or take you out of context, or plainly lie, or defame you).<p>Or you can input all your info in my website, then I get hacked and all your personal info is now in a torrent somewhere (to mention something that has nothing to do with freedom of speech).<p>They overlap perhaps but I might just call it <i>gossip</i>.<p>So I don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s a <i>either freedom of speech-or-privacy</i> battle, where one is the solution to the other, or the problem to the other.<p>Invading privacy is punished in most countries, and gets more serious if the info is published. The real problem is that doxxing and posting personal information in a community goes unpunished right now. The solution may be something I would never want, that is, non-anonymous internet access. At least paparazzis were known, they have a face and a name. You can sue them, and in case, punch them in the face if that&#x27;s your thing.<p>It&#x27;s true there is also a problem with the <i>mob</i>, but there is little that can be done about it. I recall the two guys making &quot;dongle&quot; jokes in a conference and getting fired when it reached Twitter.')
