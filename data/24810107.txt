If &gt;90% of your serious coding is in one language, you&#x27;ll become desensitized to its bad parts but you&#x27;ll be <i>hyper</i> sensitive to anything that seems inconvenient in any alternative. I&#x27;ve seen this over the years with Fortran and C coders. C++ coders do it to C all the time. Lisp coders are notorious for it. It&#x27;s Selective Perception 101, counting the hits and ignoring the misses. We&#x27;re all prone to it, and have to correct for it.<p>If you <i>really</i> want to compare any two languages, you have to give both a more than casual try, and keep an open mind throughout. Otherwise your conclusions are likely to be unhelpful at best.')
