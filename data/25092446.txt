How can you not see that as an achievement?<p>None of the computers getting the M1 today previously let you put in PCI cards or do any of the stuff you claim is needed other than expand the memory.<p>A14 only made to do one task at a time is just not true. iOS itself runs multiple tasks and writing software utilizing multiple threads is something you do all the time in iOS. I have written more multithreaded code on iOS than on a desktop. Why? Because using grand central dispatch is a must when dealing with all sorts of low latency web APIs you access. I don’t have that issue when building desktop apps.<p>These Apple laptops have always had few ports. Don’t blame M1 for that.<p>I do however wish the Mac Mini had more ports.')
