Item(by='throwaway0a5e', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603909878, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24922124, text='I give her 40% odds of beating the headline charges.  Not a chance in hell she&#x27;s walking away without at least a misdemeanor of some sort though.<p>On one hand:<p>It&#x27;s not exactly a stretch to imagine her boyfriend doing it on her behalf or something similar.  A middling defense lawyer should be able to create enough doubt (barring some unreported facts that are damning for the defense).  If the government&#x27;s processes are so broken that this could happen as they say it did then she deserves to walk free for giving them the free audit.  If she&#x27;s really such a bad person they&#x27;ll catch her again for something else.<p>On the other hand:<p>Hillsboro county is the second worst jurisdiction in NH in which to be accused of committing a crime against the government (Cheshire county is hands down the best any day).  It&#x27;s going to be almost impossible for a jury to not have at least a few people who take the view &quot;I don&#x27;t care if she did it, there&#x27;s a reasonable chance she did and someone must pay for this&quot;.  This is assuming it goes to jury trail (only a moron would go for a bench trial when the crime is against &quot;the system&quot; though).')
