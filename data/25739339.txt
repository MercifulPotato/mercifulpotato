It&#x27;s one thing to release something buggy and promise to fix it later... but that console release was more akin to a bait-and-switch. It was not playable and any product released that like deserves regulatory action. You can&#x27;t sell something for $120 that does not work out of the box and take a &quot;we&#x27;ll fix it later&quot; attitude.')
