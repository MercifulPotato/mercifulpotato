It’s fake money that’s about as practical to use in the real world as Monopoly bills.<p>The whole ‘intrinsic value’ argument doesn’t sway me anymore. USD has no intrinsic value, neither does holding any shares of the GLD ETF for all intents and purposes. Let’s just call bitcoin what it is - a fiat currency that cannot be printed by governments. It has no intrinsic value, but that makes it a unique financial instrument in my opinion. What is 1 BTC actually worth? There is no cap at the top or bottom. It is definitely unique, I don’t understand the seething hate some people have for it.')
