Weâ€™re a bootstrapped, profitable company started back in April of 2011. We are a remote company with a mostly US-based team. We are very customer-centric: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.facebook.com&#x2F;followupboss&#x2F;reviews" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.facebook.com&#x2F;followupboss&#x2F;reviews</a> and our customers love our product.<p>Working closely with the original architect of the iOS and android app you will contribute by building new features right away. Learning how and why customers (mostly real estate teams) use Follow Up Boss will take time and the sooner you bridge that knowledge gap the sooner you will be able to contribute to the strategic vision for the app. We work in 4 week cycles with a 2 week cool-down in between. The cycle is dedicated to customer facing value. A recent project was to add group texting. The cool-down is for bugs and technical debt. Current cool-down efforts have been to migrate existing Java code to Kotlin.')
