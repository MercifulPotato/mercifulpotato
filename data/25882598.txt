I am a Game Pass subscriber and find myself playing _many_ more indie games with it than before. It&#x27;s easier for me to pay for the service and effectively amortize the cost of paying for indie games which is, at least how I would put it, inherently risky.<p>Before I would pay $5, $10, or $20 for games with a chance I&#x27;ll like them - some are worth way more, some worth way less. With Game Pass I have a &#x27;sunk cost&#x27; so I download and try out games much more eagerly and find myself enjoying many more indie games than before.<p>I have seen an interview where an indie dev said that Microsoft covered their entire development cost for a game to get it on Game Pass, leaving their sales on other platforms to be &#x27;pure profit&#x27; in a sense.<p>I am not having a great time with the &#x27;traditional publishing&#x27; model of the industry right now. If it gets shaken up, that seems like a benefit to me, not a drawback.')
