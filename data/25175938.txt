It looks like a string, and acts like a string, except that in some places it is not a string: for example `typeof s` returns “object”! Same problem for Boolean, Number, etcetera. Yes casts are ok, but it is easier to just say never use the value object keywords because you can end up with very wierd bugs a long way from where the value object was created.<p>Another example:<p><pre><code>    let x = new Boolean(true);\n    console.log(x === true);\n</code></pre>\nGives false.')
