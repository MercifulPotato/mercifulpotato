And over a couple of years of (failed) scheduling&#x2F;optimizing techniques, I learned a thing or two that I would like to share.\nThe approach OP used in her article is undoubtedly, a great way of looking at your footprints. I used to do a similar (revising over time) thing, but looking back on how much time i &quot;wasted&quot; and how little i was &quot;productive&quot;, was not worth the effort.\nOver time, I&#x27;ve changed and perfected (well, kind of) this approach to a new way.<p>The New Way*\nI divide my day in 3 sections. The first one, Morning Drill, from a set wakeup time (it really helps) until breakfast. I comprises things like regular morning routine, say exercise, freshening up, etc. It give me a good start into the day. I prefer not to do anything &quot;productive&#x2F;work-related&quot; in the morning. Next, I take up my todo list for the day (i manage is using Todoist), understand my priorities and think of a general direction of the day, is it going to be a work-day or a fun-day?. I&#x27;m strict about my list, but not so much that I would not talk to anyone till i&#x27;m finished. I like to play it cool. The third section, i&#x27;ve finished all i had planned today, so i can do anything i want, read a book, go out with friends, and other cool stuff.\nThis kind of summarises a day.<p>&gt; All of us live at least partially on autopilot, so bad habits tend to sneak up and stay unnoticed.\nI love keeping notes, and reading old notes and revising your day, really helps for such a thing.<p>Results of new approach:\nWhen I go to bed, I sleep sound realizing the day wasn&#x27;t a complete mess as opposed to drooling over &quot;I&#x27;ve not been productive enough&quot;.<p>All in all, this was a wonderful article with beautiful insights and a magnificent approach of data science in daily life.<p>Conclusion:\n&quot;The more you focus on productivity, the less you make it.&quot;<p>PS. I have been following *this approach for over 5 months now, and I&#x27;ve never been better.')
