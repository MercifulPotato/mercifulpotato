It is just that typically when people propose stopping taxing corporate profits, they offer nothing to replace the tax.<p>One of my pet ideas is to stop taxing income&#x2F;profits of limited liability companies completely. Instead make the the companies issue a certain percentage of their stock to the tax authorities annually. For public companies, Tax authorities just sell the shares in exchange. For private ones, the shares would be auctioned publicly.<p>Outcomes:\n- No negative tax cashflows to companies. Ever.\n- No need for creative tax accounting. Only ones left to fool with accounting are the owners of the companies.\n- Strong incentive to simplify corporate structures. Any company owned by a company would add to tax burden of the ultimate owners.<p>(For private companies, it might be nice to allow them to ask to postpone the auctions for e.g. 5 years if they want to keep the control of the company but are short of cash to buy the stock from the auction)')
