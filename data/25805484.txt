I&#x27;ve done a number of CRUD apps in Rust at this point and I have to say the frameworks I&#x27;ve used have made it dead simple. So simple actually that I loathe having to do so in other languages. The ecosystem beyond just the web portion is truly amazing, something like serde is a wonferfully powerful tool.
