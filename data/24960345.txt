It&#x27;s a fairly famous, old Christian epic poem from the 11th century.<p>In it, I remember it depicted a Christian knight and an Islamic paladin with diametically and fundamentally opposed views (this was written in the middle of the Crusades) sitting down and sharing a civilized meal together and having a conversation.  This is what a civilized dispute looks like.  Later they might have fought each other to the death for their religion, but they were still capable of reason and civility.<p>Note that both Christian and Islamic sides were accusing each other at the time of cruel atrocities - and yet the Christian ideal of tolerance includes the possibility of civility with everyone, regardless of what the sides think of each other.')
