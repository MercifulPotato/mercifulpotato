S. Elliot is absolutely the last thing I want to see. When I want to maintain a large system quickly, I want to be treated like I&#x27;m 5. I don&#x27;t want Shakespeare. I don&#x27;t even want Shakespeare for Dummies. I want &quot;Dick and Jane Process a Customer Order.&quot;<p>I absolutely agree with the author that when I say &quot;This code is unreadable,&quot; I actually mean &quot;I havenâ€™t spent enough time trying to read,&quot; but time is something I don&#x27;t have. My coworkers and I will likely read the same code many times. We only have so much time to spend reading code. Code that takes a lot of time to read is bad. We do not have time to keep studying the code until it is no longer unreadable.<p>We are more than willing to invest quite a lot of additional time writing the code to make the time it takes to read the code as low as conceivably possible. Heck, with a small handful of exceptions, I will happily trade quite a bit of performance for simplicity.<p>Sure, if you&#x27;re Terje Mathisen, and you&#x27;re writing Quake 3, and Polyhymnia or Velvel Kahan descend from Mt. Helicon singing of inverse square roots and the number 0x5f3759df, and you happen to be trying to optimize a 3D game engine, sure, write poetry. Ages and ages hence, we shall read of your algorithm by the fireside and slowly smile as a blog explains to us why it is brilliant. Sing on! But if you&#x27;re writing a normal program that&#x27;s gonna be maintained frequently by normal people, you call security. That muse does not have a badge. She does not work here. There is a clear &quot;no children of Mnemosyne&quot; sign in the lobby.')
