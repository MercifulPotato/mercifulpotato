Writing out a plan for any project taking around a week or more is always worth it. Use it to establish scope and priorities. Keep a &quot;Questions&quot; section that you whittle away at as you seek out feedback. Make the body a hierarchy of design tasks and implementation ideas. Track revision history and keep it up-to-date.<p>You now have a great way to get sign-off from peers + management, an execution plan, a task breakdown for ticket management and historical documentation on what happened and why.<p>2. <i>Be terse</i><p>Is that email looking a little long? Write a &quot;TL;DR:&quot; section at the top and then see what you can delete. If it&#x27;s nothing, leave the &quot;TL;DR:&quot;. Otherwise you may find you&#x27;ve included a lot of intermediate thinking and people only need to know the conclusions.<p>3. <i>When learning something new, keep a dedicated list of &quot;this looks like magic!&quot; items</i><p>Use your &quot;down time&quot; to research items on this list instead of refreshing your favorite news aggregator. Ask your peers and mentors about them. Notice when tangental issues come up and spend a few extra minutes seeing how they&#x27;re related and how that might yield some easier answers.<p>4. <i>When you want to ask for help... defer clicking &quot;send&quot;</i><p>Whether its an IM or email, write it up on the side first. Start with your question and follow-up with what you&#x27;ve already done to walk through finding the answer to save the person the effort of starting from step one or pointing out the obvious thing you overlooked. Often this will lead you to answering your own question. If not, still wait 15-30 minutes (if you can) before sending it and work on something else. In that time you&#x27;re likely to think of something you overlooked and avoid interrupting anyone.')
