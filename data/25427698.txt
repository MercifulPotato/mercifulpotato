I have found SourceKit’s performance in complex projects, especially those where there are a lot of third-party libraries or frameworks you’re linking against, to be pretty disappointing. Especially when you’re working with many ObjC dependencies.<p>Like many of Apple’s developer tools, if you stick to the happy path, performance is great. Practically that means compiling your source into a single Swift module and keeping the number of modules low. If you are a “basic” iOS or macOS app with just a couple of 3p libraries things work great. Real world projects are drastically more messy...')
