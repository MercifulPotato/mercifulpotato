I&#x27;m not conservative, not even close, but I do blame Facebook and Twitter for picking winners and losers and alienating conservatives.<p>A free speech obsessed person myself, I&#x27;ve been keeping a close watch.  In the old days, hate speech to block meant, imminent harm.  Today, someone saying I don&#x27;t feel Safe has become an acceptable argument.
