This is not what&#x27;s happening, and again I am trying to understand a reason why you think this is the case.<p>&quot;If deemed unacceptable, you are relegated to the outskirts and often denied access to say, credit.&quot;<p>I&#x27;m sorry again, but this is also not only untrue, but betrays a fundamental misunderstanding of how the Internet works.  Any Internet accessible website is accessible from any browser at any time from anywhere in the world (excepting actual censorship taking place in some countries, e.g. the Great Firewall of China).  This is what your &quot;freedom of expression&quot; guarantees, not access to the popular pages on the Internet.<p>The city center example is completely wrong because it imposes a false difficulty at visiting a restaurant outside of the city center that the restaurant cannot overcome.  This is precisely the opposite of true, since any browser in the world can visit any Internet accessible website with the same level of effort.  Your restaurant can still be walked into at an instant, anywhere in the world.  Accessibility is a fixed value, and it&#x27;s nearly zero.<p><i>Discovery</i> of your speech is not a human right, however.  I&#x27;m sorry if that violates your expectations, but it&#x27;s true.  You aren&#x27;t guaranteed a right to be heard, only a right to speak, and on the Internet you will always have that right, again due to how the Internet works.  It&#x27;s a global network of interconnected computers, there will always be a place to express your thoughts and provide them to the world, one URL away.<p>I&#x27;m trying to give this more thought as our argument gets longer, as per HN guidelines, but I&#x27;m having a hard time keeping that goal clear.  I would appreciate it if you tried to meet me somewhere in the middle here, to try and understand why I&#x27;m explaining things the way that I am.')
