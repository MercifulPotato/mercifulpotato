The real issue is selection effect vs. advertising effect<p>SEO traffic benchmarks don&#x27;t measure the right ting or show real ROI. FB or Google  don&#x27;t want you to measure the right thing.<p>Traffic to the website has licks, purchases and downloads that are happening anyway (selection effect) and clicks, purchases and downloads that would not have happened without ads (advertising effect) mixed.  Only way to differentiate between the two is do real experiment where you divide target groups in two sections and show only the other group the ads.<p>When you do this experiment correctly, you find out that online ads are usually wasted money for any established brand and lower than expected value for less known brands.')
