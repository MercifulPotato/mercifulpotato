Look at how we are here on HN with the CCP is bad&#x2F;CCP is vilified debate. No one is going to convince me that the CCP isn&#x27;t committing genocide and I&#x27;m not going to convince anyone that the CCP is. (Dang, this is not me trying to start a nationalistic flamewar: I actually deleted a comment I wrote earlier after reflecting on what it was doing.)<p>I don&#x27;t know. I really do want to understand the other side&#x27;s ideas but we need a better method than debate because debate is fundamentally about winning. Try it with your partner: if either side wins everyone loses.<p>Where my wife and I find the love and communion is when we soften. And if we&#x27;ve been quarreling a lot often the thing for us is taking a psychedelic together and then crying our eyes out in a long embrace. Very healing and the furthest thing I can imagine from debate.<p>I don&#x27;t know how to love someone who advocates for a country doing genocide. Or who says the satellite photos we see are not evidence of genocide. And I&#x27;m using this most extreme example to illustrate that there may not be a point of reconciliation: only people feeling good about winning.')
