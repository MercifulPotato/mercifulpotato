The legal code and associated regulations are so lengthy no one can read all of  them. The tax code alone is 2,600 pages and associated rulings 70,000 pages.<p>When you have so many laws, they can be applied selectively depending on your political status, or to benefit the regulators or their friends. We just caught the sheriff of Santa Clara extorting citizens for tens of thousands of dollars to get concealed carry permits, which is why many people carry illegally, just like criminals.<p>Creating a law where non-disclosure of the smallest feature opens you up to government regulators harassment is another avenue for graft and corruption. Like when the EU selectively prosecutes US companies, or US regulators selectively harass companies not in lock step with the current administration.<p>I think if you really need a nanny state to protect you from your own decisions you should be required to give up all your decisions to the state.')
