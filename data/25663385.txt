That&#x27;s their prerogative. Same rules allow people who live year round in expensive recreational vehicles to vote, also.<p>Different organizations define residency differently. There is no single accepted way to prove residency. Sometimes a drivers license does the trick. Usually to get a a drivers license you need a utility bill or a lease. To get in-state tuition you need to prove a year of residency. Proof of residency for state taxes is more complicated, and varies by state. Residency is different than domicile, etc. As someone who has moved around a lot I&#x27;ve bumped into quite a bit of this.<p>There&#x27;s nothing in the constitution saying that a person needs to own or rent a house to vote.')
