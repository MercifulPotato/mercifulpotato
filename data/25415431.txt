Do they scan the skies? Do they have sound&#x2F;vibration pattern detection? Satellites?<p>Update:\nIn the article I see:\n&quot;Still, we have no idea what early warning system triggered the alert. America&#x27;s infrared early warning space-based sensing layer stares at the earth from many vantage points in orbit day and night. Historically, it provides the initial warning of a ballistic missile launch via detection of the missile&#x27;s hot boost-phase plume. These satellites, especially the newer ones, can also detect a greater variety of infrared events, as well, including artillery fire, aircraft crashes, smaller missile shots, and even the launches of cruise missiles. &quot;')
