The Wikileaks cables contain marked classified government information that is still considered classified by the US government. (I will not debate whether or not the basis for their classification is valid.)\nAWS provides service to the USG, and having unsecured classified anywhere on their servers likely violates the terms of service (between the USG and AWS).<p>The leaked emails from Hunter Biden&#x27;s computer were not classified.  (Well, at least they weren&#x27;t marked as classified by a USG entity.)  The computer was not &quot;hacked&quot; to obtain the emails either.  It was left unclaimed in a computer service shop.')
