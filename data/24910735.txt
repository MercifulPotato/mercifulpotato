Apparently the way to do this is to use the traefik file provider option, but at this point I&#x27;ve been trying to get that to work for a month and I have no idea why traefik doesn&#x27;t recognize the port.<p>Do you have any recommendations for someone looking for this setup? As I said I&#x27;m willing to scrap my current setup, but would still like to be able to have it all run in docker-compose and not renew the certs by hand.')
