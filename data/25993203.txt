At least the number times the &quot;last updated&quot; column appears on SQL server stats [1] leads me to believe it collects stats async with updates to the table.<p>The only system I&#x27;ve heard of that relies on up-to-date statistics for correctness is snowflake (long but interesting talk here [2]), where having accurate max&#x2F;mins for each micro partition is really helpful for cutting down the amount of data in the large range scan queries common in BI. I&#x27;d guess that being a BI system, snowflake can get away with higher row update latency too.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sqlshack.com&#x2F;sql-server-statistics-and-how-to-perform-update-statistics-in-sql&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sqlshack.com&#x2F;sql-server-statistics-and-how-to-pe...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=CPWn1SZUZqE" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=CPWn1SZUZqE</a>')
