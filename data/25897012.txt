The Israelis pioneered this long ago, or so I have been told, by relatives who were taught Hebrew in the 70s when studying there. Hebrew as spoken today (aka Modern Hebrew) was a new language that won by vote (to IIRC Russian, Yiddish, German and others) when the country had to decide on a national language, and they needed a way to teach people uniformly.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ulpanor.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ulpanor.com&#x2F;</a><p>That being said, as they learned via Ulpan as adults in their 20&#x27;s and spent only 1-2 years there, none of them speak beyond a few words of Hebrew once I was in their lives decades later up until now. Twas quickly forgotten. I went through conventional language education in Arabic from early teens (it was my desired hobby because of my obviously vibrant social life, hehe) to college and speak it so-so until this day, but I have many friends and family of my own who speak Arabic.<p>So more than anything: increased exposure is key and few people will correct humor you with your method if it takes longer as an adult, and it definitely will! haha')
