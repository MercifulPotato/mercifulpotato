I love it!<p>It is easier to design digital circuits when you have a whole catalog of 7400 and 4000 series gates, than it is using individual transistors.  It is easier to wire a house when you&#x27;re not making wires and switches with a hammer and a forge.<p>I welcome this new higher level of abstraction, and am willing to pay the cost in terms of CPU and Memory to get there, just as I&#x27;m willing to waste transistors or copper wire to have something done and working.')
