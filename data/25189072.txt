I can&#x27;t think of a single example that doesn&#x27;t have a large energy component. \nFor example, health insurance is made up of the cost of paying people and creating medicines - and ultimately, it comes back to food, extracting raw materials and paying down debt, all of which are affected by the price of energy.\nSo dropping energy costs will eventually make most stuff cheaper (or make more money for rich people :( )')
