This changes the literal size on-disk, but it doesn&#x27;t change the logical unit.<p>In fact, the delta chains used by Git for space compression have no direct relation to the object model DAG. From the perspective of a user using Git, these deltas are completely invisible.<p>Edit: perhaps to help this point... If Git stores an object using a delta, that doesn&#x27;t change the object ID of that object compared to storing it uncompressed.')
