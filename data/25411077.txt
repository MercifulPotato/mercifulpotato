Is there any real-world basis for that premise?<p>From basic supply and demand:<p>1. a downward pressure on wages emerges from workers competing with workers (competition among suppliers of labor)<p>2. an upward pressure on wages emerges from employers competing with employers (competition among consumers of labor)<p>And, <i>ceteris paribus</i>, some equilibrium wages emerge.<p>The minimum wage ostensibly exists to interfere with #1 (though usually framed as protecting workers from employers), assuming the minimum wage is set above the would-be equilibrium wage.<p>But what if the minimum wage is set below the would-be equilibrium wage? Perhaps the minimum wage instead serves to interfere with #2 by allowing a point of collusion among employers, and thereby keep wages artificially <i>low</i>.<p>Is anyone aware of any research on this?')
