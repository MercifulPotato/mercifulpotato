I like cleaner city air for everyone, reduced CO2 etc, adding this tax will make EV choice a lot harder as you’ll be hit with a tax larger than your fuel bill total, especially if you charge off your own solar and for people who buy a second hand EV just to drive around town. A 2.5c per km is equivalent to doubling the cost of a lot of EVs, example 2015 Nissan Leaf 24kWh does ~100km on a full charge of say 20 kWh, at 15c per kWh you are looking at $3 fuel and $2.5 tax. 15c is low but with combo of solar (which is very common in Australia) or off peak this is pretty reasonable. What isn’t reasonable is that level of tax for something that has more general benefits for trying to generate such a small total of revenue at such an early stage of sales. There are so many other ways this tax could be generated in relation to cars that would encourage uptake of these cars while still reducing impact on lower&#x2F;middle income earners, I think this is a very poorly thought out tax.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;environment&#x2F;2020&#x2F;aug&#x2F;19&#x2F;electric-vehicle-sales-triple-in-australia-despite-lack-of-government-support?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;environment&#x2F;2020&#x2F;aug&#x2F;19&#x2F;electric...</a>')
