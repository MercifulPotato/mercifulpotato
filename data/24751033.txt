I sometimes wonder if I would have made a few different choices if I had read this book in my early 20s. Probably not, but it is a nice dream.<p>Also, a short fiction masterpiece by Tolstoy on life and death is &quot;The Death of Ivan Ilych&quot; [3]. It has some excellent plot twists. I remember feeling like a ping-pong ball in the hands of the author; whatever he wanted me to think, I did.<p>1: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;The_Kingdom_of_God_Is_Within_You" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;The_Kingdom_of_God_Is_Within_Y...</a><p>2: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;A_Confession" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;A_Confession</a><p>3: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;The_Death_of_Ivan_Ilyich" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;The_Death_of_Ivan_Ilyich</a>')
