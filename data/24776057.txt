Whilst you&#x27;ll get some new viewers from the people who&#x27;ve heard it&#x27;s a classic or those showing their kids a movie from &quot;their time&quot;, but the majority of viewers will be those who&#x27;ve seen it before and want to watch it again, and given the age of some of these classics they likely already own it on DVD etc.')
