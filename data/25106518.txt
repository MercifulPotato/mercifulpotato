It looks like the solution is to use annotations to specify a property as being ignored.<p>The intended behavior is to serialize all fields of an object (some properties have backing fields, others don&#x27;t). You wouldn&#x27;t serialize properties themselves for the same reason a getter&#x2F;setter on it&#x27;s own wouldn&#x27;t be serialized - only the data stored.<p>Put simply, I would say C# has the wrong default behavior here.')
