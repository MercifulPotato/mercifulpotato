Most of my monitors have two different size VESA mounts, and my monitor mounts use the smaller size, meaning I have 4 extra screw holes on the back of all my monitors, and conveniently nearly all the VESA mounts take standard M4 bolts.<p>If your VESA mounts are close enough together, you can just drill holes directly in the RPi case and mount it to the back of the monitor.  If they&#x27;re too far apart, use the mounts to put in a plastic or wood bar, then drill holes through the RPi case and the bar (while not attached to the monitor), then mount the case to the bar and the bar to the monitor.<p>I&#x27;ve looked at doing similar in the past, but I wanted to make the mounting block along the bottom of the monitor with the SD card exposed.  That way I can set up a series of SD cards to test with.  Want to test something on Ubuntu 18.04?  Cool, switch monitor 2 to input 2 (the RPi) and then swap the SD card out to the Ubuntu 18.04 one and you&#x27;re ready to rock.  It&#x27;s not as easy as a Docker container, but I&#x27;m often using the GPIO pins and I don&#x27;t have the desire to try to make GPIO pins work in Docker.  It might not even be that hard, I just don&#x27;t feel like adding another step to my troubleshooting.')
