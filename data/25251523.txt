Wages are set by supply and demand, and the labor market is still very much location dependent. Companies who need local workers are forced to pay the rate required to attract and keep them, and that cost is a lot higher in some places than others.<p>The company doesn&#x27;t pay someone in San Francisco more than someone in Kansas because the San Francisco worker has a higher cost of living, they do it because the San Francisco worker would go work for someone else for more money if they didn&#x27;t. The worker in Kansas doesn&#x27;t have that alternative option.<p>Now, as more and more companies become primarily remote employers, we will likely see the location based variance for workers diminish. However, this is likely to mean that the higher cost of living places see their wages decrease more than lower cost of living places increase.')
