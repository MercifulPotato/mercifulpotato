I sympathize, but honestly if I went into a .com.au forum and complained because the people there were talking about Australian politics, I&#x27;d be ridiculed mercilessly. And for good reason.<p>It&#x27;s the same as if you complained that we&#x27;re all writing in English, and you&#x27;d prefer that we didn&#x27;t. Porque todos los articulos y comentarios estan en ingles?!? Debemos tener mas contenido en espa√±ol! Es un comunidad global, no?! La gente aqui asuma que todos los lectores son anglos? Es un barbaridad!<p>Oh, wait. No it isn&#x27;t. HN is an American website hosted on American servers catering to Americans and there is NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT. You&#x27;re insinuating there is and requesting the mods act accordingly. I disagree.<p>Seriously, I don&#x27;t speak for the mods, but I don&#x27;t recall it being stated anywhere that HN &quot;serves the global community&quot;. In fact I just double checked the FAQ. It doesn&#x27;t. HN has mostly been a site meant to cater to Silicon Valley tech startups for as long as I&#x27;ve been using it.<p>Let me know when ycombinator.com.au is up and running and we&#x27;ll join you there and not talk about American laws. Until then...')
