There are plenty of circumstances where synchronous comms are warranted, such as when matters are urgent for all parties or when the respondent has a reputation for losing track of async comms.<p>Editing to add:<p>I agree that &quot;hey&quot; and &quot;hi&quot; etc. are terrible openings. However, openings (incidentally also discouraged by the linked article) such as:<p>&gt; × &quot;Hello, are you around?&quot;<p>&gt; × &quot;hi sophie - quick question.&quot;<p>&gt; × &quot;You got a sec?&quot;<p>are absolutely fine in that they imply a level of urgency and need for synchronized communication. If someone&#x27;s ideologically against it and <i>inflexible</i> towards accommodating urgency <i>where appropriate,</i> it&#x27;s a productivity red flag.<p>And I&#x27;m speaking as a modestly introverted manager who tries to avoid sync comms unless absolutely needed, but the thread seems to have gone off the deep end by arguing that sync comms are absolutely unnecessary.')
