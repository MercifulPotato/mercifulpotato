But I&#x27;m very strict about framing issues in terms of them item.<p>For example, I recently got a shattered ceramic cup.Amazon had padded the contents of the outer box, but the inner box the actual cup came in had no padding whatsoever... paper thin with no clearances.<p>There was never a hope that thing would ever have reached me in one piece, regardless of what Amazon did to package it and so I framed the negative review like that.<p>It&#x27;s something that a prototypical instance of the item would share as a shortcoming. Amazon can&#x27;t fix it, only the manufacturer boxing it can')
