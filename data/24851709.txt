The main thing is that this 4 hour chunk of time is uninterrupted by checkpoints and transfers and whatever else. It&#x27;s relaxing rather than stressful.<p>People tell me the reasons that everything is more expensive than in Switzerland is because (a) the US is bigger, so infrastructure cost more [and flights scale easier], (b) the US is bigger, so  city-to-city distances eat more of day up, or (c) labor unions make costs higher. But is (b) a real problem if you can work on the train? And I don&#x27;t really get (c).')
