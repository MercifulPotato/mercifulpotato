This is what I argued against when the initial request was made (we also had over the air upsates) but it was interestingly the _most_ &quot;security conscious&quot; customers that had requested this - they specifically wanted us to mail them either replacement microSD cards (the disks on the machines) or USB sticks. The machines themselves verified the contents and we also offered a way for customers to download the images directly and verify, but most customers just opted for snail mail. &#x2F;shrug.<p>Several of these companies also had strict email attachment filters that we were instructed to get around by just appending `.allow` to the filenames. There was tons of this type of stuff that we encounted which really highlighted that corporate security at many companies is just theatre.')
