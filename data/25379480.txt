We as techies &#x2F;developers see problems from our perspective (too high of a cut, arbitrarily limiting what apps can be distributed, no third-party payment processing etc). And those are legit concerns.<p>But in a typical “customer harm” perspective I think it’s very hard to make a case.<p>Apps aren’t really that more expensive on iOS nor is the catalog smaller.<p>However much we want a freer iOS experience, competing App Stores will just make iOS like modern gaming with a crappy custom App Store for each vendor. It would be more reasonable to have easier side loading for enthusiast or stuff Apple doesn’t want in its store.')
