No doubt this is an allergic immune response to terrorism. The actions here on a different level than what&#x27;s going on in Hong Kong, possibly because of this:<p>&quot;In July 2009, riots broke out in Xinjiang in response to a violent dispute between Uyghur and Han Chinese workers in a factory and result in over 100 deaths. Following the riots, Uyghur radicals killed dozens of Chinese citizens in coordinated attacks from 2009 to 2016. These included the August 2009 syringe attacks, the 2011 bomb-and-knife attack in Hotan, the March 2014 knife attack in the Kunming railway station, the April 2014 bomb-and-knife attack in the Ürümqi railway station, and the May 2014 car-and-bomb attack in an Ürümqi street market. Several of the attacks were orchestrated by the Turkistan Islamic Party (formerly the East Turkestan Islamic Movement) which has been designated a terrorist organization by several countries including Russia, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the United States, in addition to the United Nations.&quot;<p>No doubt the efficiency that makes China so effective at arresting the spread of covid also makes atrocities like the concentration camps occur which will no doubt affect many many innocent bystanders. It is questionable whether or not this over-reaction will be effective, but despite this we know that China conducts these atrocities with the goal to end the violence once and for all under any means necessary.<p>The question is, is a successful quelling of all terrorism worth crossing the line?<p>Keep in mind the United States likely killed and harmed much more innocent bystanders with its&#x27; own allergic immune response to 9&#x2F;11. It just didn&#x27;t happen on our soil. We&#x27;ve crossed the line in the past as well.')
