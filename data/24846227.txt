A lot of game engines do this nowadays and it works quite well. It doesn&#x27;t eliminate synchronisation completely, but it does simplify things a good bit.<p>Ideally, any shared data is immutable (and modifying it would then need to be done in a coordinated synchronised fashion) while most mutable state is only ever owned by one task&#x2F;thread, with ownership explicitly passed between them as others need access, unique_ptr style. Reality doesn&#x27;t always match with the ideal though.')
