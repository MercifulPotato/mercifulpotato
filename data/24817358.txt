Moving to a location with a nice quality&#x2F;standard of living with housing available far below my income so that it&#x27;s not a financial burden. Everyone has a different goal - a small, modest house in a nice place to live is all many of us ask. And not being in debt.<p>&gt; Home ownership (especially for $500k+) is heavily subsidized in the USA<p>A <i>really nice</i> house (nicer than mine for sure, even a brand new build) here is 250k. 500k buys a <i>lot</i> of house here (miniature mansions in some places), there are plenty of nice places to live in the USA for 150-250k. I just checked Zillow, where I grew up half way across the country (where parents still live) is the same prices as here. Not everyone lives in an overly expensive housing market or wants a massively large house&#x2F;land.')
