PEGs are as well-specified as CFGs, they just work in a different way. One of the strengths of PEGs is that they&#x27;re never ambiguous. That does mean that order of alternates is important, and sometimes you do have to fiddle with that order when translating something like ABNF. But what you get in return is never having to deal with a parse forest, let alone punting on that problem by just reifying the greedy parse as the correct one.<p>I&#x27;ve written a tool that converts a declarative specification of a PEG grammar into a parser, although I haven&#x27;t released it yet. It works great, I&#x27;ve used it on a number of real-world structured data formats.<p>Edit: cut out the first paragraph after checking the user name. Hi TQ.')
