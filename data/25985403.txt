I have like a 50% success rate between DFU, UF2, and whatever the Arduino IDE does (varies by chip).  Meanwhile, SWD&#x2F;JTAG works for me 100% of the time, and is faster.  I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.<p>The downside is that it requires $6 in hardware (or $20 if you splurge on a J-LINK EDU) and so I guess it takes quite a few encounters with &quot;60 seconds of poking around at reset buttons frantically for what should have been a 1 second operation&quot; before that $6 is worth it.  GDB on your microcontroller code is also occasionally useful.  I think hobbyists should just give up on stuff designed to &quot;make it easy&quot; (but only works half the time) and use the tools that people use for their day jobs, especially when it&#x27;s only a few dollars investment.')
