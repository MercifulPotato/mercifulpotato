So I&#x27;d assume that every day some machines are being compromised at Microsoft (like anywhere else with lots of employees and stuff like Google, Facebook, Amazon,...) - it&#x27;s just not that unusual these days.<p>The question is if any of these leads to lateral movement and access of sensitive information or modification of data and stuff. No company is required to tell you about every single piece of malware they find in their networks - unless something &quot;bad&quot; happened. Maybe we should require more transparency in general.<p>I guess investigations will show what happened or is happening still.')
