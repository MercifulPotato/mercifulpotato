Understanding logic leads to <i>much</i> cleaner code. People who don&#x27;t understand logic make the code I&#x27;ve had to clean up. Things like taking a &gt; 500 line function with a complex set of nested conditionals, pulling them all out, and realizing that it could be &lt; 100 lines with no nesting or only one level below the top by properly placing guards at the top of the function.<p>I have worked with programmers who have no understanding of logic, I never want to work on their code again. It&#x27;s a remarkably simple skill to develop and should be part of every CS students&#x27; curriculum.')
