I&#x27;d approach the title as &quot;when is x10 possible?&quot;<p>- insight of a far simpler or faster etc implementation (e.g. better choice of modularity, factoring out hidden commonality, dynamic programming);<p>- insight about a better way to achieve the end result - might be no code at all<p>So I&#x27;m talking about insight. What personal qualities lead to insight? (note that there isn&#x27;t always a better way to be found, so personal qualities don&#x27;t guarantee it)<p>- be really really smart. Especially, large working memory, to be able to see connections. Or at least be able to load in (cram) the information temporarily.<p>- the ability to step back and notice the bigger picture. Executive function.<p>- ability to manage stress, so they have the breathing space to do that (the wisest engineers will choose a workplace that makes this easier)<p>Skill in proofs is a predictor: flexibility, handling complexity, managing the top-level purpose as well as the detail (forest-for-trees), noticing connections. Mathematical knowledge itself can help sometimes too.<p>But probably the skill in any intellectual discipline is an equally good predicator e.g. philosophy, history, law')
