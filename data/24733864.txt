Code is usually just a way of representing what you want your app&#x2F;the machine to do.<p>I think no-code only makes sense if you make multiple, similar products comprised of existing building blocks and then using a basic visual editor to mark the relation between them. But again, with code it can be similar, you can have differet libraries&#x2F;packages&#x2F;APIs and just describe the connection between them.')
