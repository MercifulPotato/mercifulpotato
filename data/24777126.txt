However, it is the common convention that is important here and for decades Windows convention has been application installers.<p>&gt; But I see no reason to hold up what AFAIK is the shrinking 3rd place in computing (behind cloud and mobile) as evidence. Servers and phones install software too.<p>Ok, let&#x27;s look at mobile... which uses self contained applications. Huh. How about server... where things like VMs and Docker are increasingly popular because they allow self-contained services. Hell, even developers use Docker to create self-contained build environments.<p>Regardless, I don&#x27;t think what servers do is very applicable to how desktops should work. Mobile is much more applicable because they are personal devices, like desktops, but they are still a distinct entity with different use cases.')
