She was the head of HR for a F500 company and did this to the COO. The buyout package for her to leave and agree not to disclose what she recorded was apparently quite substantial as she didn&#x27;t have to work for years. Still a bit amazed that she both had to guts to do it and actually got away with it. HR is a completely different world.')
