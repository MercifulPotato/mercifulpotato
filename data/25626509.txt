That&#x27;s my point based on your original comment: You&#x27;re comment was comparing work to school, and that normal schools were bad in some way because at work you could miss time and someone else would step in. I said, repeated, and will say again: learning does not work that way. No one can step in for you. Montessori doesn&#x27;t change that. It changes the timing and, sure, the direct pressure from the teacher. That doesn&#x27;t mean there isn&#x27;t <i>some</i> type of pressure: from the parent, from the other students that are obliged to help in their co-operative learning structure, etc.<p>I&#x27;m not debating the merits of Montessori schools. I&#x27;m saying the &quot;missing time&quot; aspect of your comment does not have a good analog from work to learning. That&#x27;s all.')
