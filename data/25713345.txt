I personally haven&#x27;t seen such dumb arguments even on the internet. I&#x27;ve seen plenty of arguments about why &quot;the system&quot; is racist (or not) but that&#x27;s not the same.<p><i>Why don&#x27;t we see that much media around how the wealthy class are greedy, bad and immoral?</i><p>I don&#x27;t think many people think that way to begin with.<p>But there&#x27;s plenty of class-based content on social networks. I cannot say I&#x27;ve ever seen them being deplatformed though.')
