In PnD, there is an element of subterfuge - the people you are selling to are unaware of what is going on. In this play, all actors are fully informed of what is going on. I mean, maybe some people don&#x27;t really understand the details, but the majority of people here aren&#x27;t buying GME because they think it&#x27;ll keep going up; they all <i>know</i> it&#x27;s overvalued, but they don&#x27;t care, because the goal is only partially to make a profit. &#x27;Pump and dump&#x27; isn&#x27;t illegal per se, what is illegal is lying about fundamentals or circumstances to influence stock price. That is not what is happening here.<p>Furthermore, if you&#x27;re arguing that it&#x27;s illegal because it&#x27;s done in group, then I don&#x27;t understand what legal basis you are using for that. I also don&#x27;t understand why you&#x27;d say it&#x27;s &quot;very different&quot; from doing it on your own. I can&#x27;t think of anything else off the top of my head that legal to do on your own, but illegal in group (some things are <i>more</i> illegal in a group, but that&#x27;s not what we&#x27;re talking about)')
