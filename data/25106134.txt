There is absolutely nothing unique to &quot;indy hacking&quot; in the original post that doesn&#x27;t apply in general to the small business&#x2F;independent contractor world, and if you spend any time talking to one of these people, they will have plenty of similar stories. Thus the &quot;well, what did you expect&quot; tone of some of the replies that you seem to take offense to.<p>The best course of action for low risk tolerance people who don&#x27;t want to do everything themselves is to find a big company to work for with stable employment that is focused on their core passion, rather than forcing them to deal with customer support, billing, tax issues, HR issues, VISA issues, facilities maintenance, infrastructure, sales, working capital management, and all the other stuff you have to handle on your own if you are running a 1 man shop (or even a small business).<p>All of the above should be absolutely obvious -- why do you think these big companies have tens of thousands of employees and have dozens of non-developer full time staff for every developer? If you want to do everything yourself, you will need to take on the responsibilities of all these other people.<p>None of this will ever change, either.<p>Btw, this was the topic of a nice essay by Joel Spolsky called &quot;The Developer Abstraction Layer&quot;. The original author of the post basically lived out the parable in Joel&#x27;s story. You might want to take a look:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.joelonsoftware.com&#x2F;2006&#x2F;04&#x2F;11&#x2F;the-development-abstraction-layer-2&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.joelonsoftware.com&#x2F;2006&#x2F;04&#x2F;11&#x2F;the-development-ab...</a><p>Interestingly enough, the <i>theme</i> of Joel&#x27;s story is that developers take this abstraction layer for granted, and thus end up being shocked when it turns out really hard for the indy developer, who is missing this layer, to do everything for themselves.')
