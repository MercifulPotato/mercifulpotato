If that were the normal definition most transactions would be considered zero sum.<p>But its not. Zero sum has to do with the utility provided to each side of the transaction.  I may have a completely different desire to own a future than you.  Perhaps my portfolio needs less risk or my predicted oil needs have changed.  In those cases I gain a lot of utility by being able to move out of the future into cash, even if later you make more than I would have by selling it.')
