I love learning about code (see my book review blog) and using tech to help my team go faster. My career has been full stack but I find myself leaning more towards backend things, I&#x27;m enjoying the microservices and API world. I&#x27;m also well practised with remote: in the last 5 years I&#x27;ve worked with developers on four different continents.<p>I&#x27;m looking for teams where I can code while learning from and teaching others. I&#x27;m also not shy of speaking in front of crowds.')
