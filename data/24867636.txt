If anything is a candidate for a potential Reserve Currency, BTC is it, imho.<p>Deep in the footnotes comes the contorted logic,&quot;<i>According to the IMF Treatment of Crypto Assets in Macroeconomic Statistics, crypto assets such as Bitcoin do not\nmeet the definition of a financial asset—and hence currency—in macroeconomic statistics.</i>&quot; and presumably that&#x27;s what lets them off the hook, nevertheless, the ONE payment-rail that BTC fits perfectly is precisely that of international settlements between Central Banks&#x2F;countries - such settlements typically involve the large-scale transfer of assets, they&#x27;re not especially time-sensitive, and the transfer cost is inconsequential (and in the case of BTC negligible against the values transferred).<p>So I&#x27;m still left wondering: Why the aversion?<p>Fear? Lack of control by recognised &quot;authorities&quot;? Their argument that it&#x27;s &quot;too volatile&quot; is largely untrue over the past year or two, with Bitcoin showing no greater volatility than any of the world&#x27;s fiat currencies, so I doubt that&#x27;s <i>the</i> factor at play.')
