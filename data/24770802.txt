If this is the case, then tech companies will be hiring new employees from all over, presumably at rates that are based on the candidate&#x27;s location.<p>If this is the case, and employees in WY are being paid 30% less than employees in CA, then the company might end up having an implicit preference for turning over existing employees in favor of new&#x2F;remote ones. Imagine managing a team with 10 employees and 2 million in total comp. Now you&#x27;re told you have to make do with a 30% budget cut, due to bad earnings. It would be hard to imagine that you wouldn&#x27;t consider the amount that would be saved by cutting more expensive folks versus less expensive folks.<p>Of course, at first the longer-tenured folks would be more valuable than their newer colleagues, based on institutional knowledge. But as this advantage fades, presumably more expensive employees would be put at a disadvantage in these scenarios.<p>And some companies will decide to pay everyone SF-based salaries, regardless of location. To my mind, that would have a similar effect on the company&#x27;s finances as not price-discriminating when selling their product. Selling to a person? Same price as selling to a company! There are surely some cases where it would work out fine, but for some companies it could make the difference between success and failure.')
