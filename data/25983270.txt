Let&#x27;s imagine a hypothetical world where there exists 1 share of a particular company and it is owned by Person A. Person B then borrows the share from Person A and sells it to Person C (this is the first short). Person C now owns 1 share and Person A doesn&#x27;t have a share but is contractually obligated to receive 1 share from Person B at a certain point in time in the future. Person D then borrows the share from Person C and sells it to Person E (this is the second short). Even though there only exists 1 share the short interest in this case is 200%.<p>Now there are obvious reasons as to why this isn&#x27;t a smart thing to do as recent events with GME show but it&#x27;s not necessarily illegal (as far as I know). If this is actually not true or it&#x27;s illegal somebody please correct me.')
