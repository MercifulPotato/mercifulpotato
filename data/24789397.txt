I&#x27;m single and have worked from home for years, minus a brief contracting gig in an office a few years ago. I made sure to make time for seeing people though. I have friends in my neighborhood and we would meet up for lunch or tea during the week and I would always go out on the weekends. With social distancing it&#x27;s been really challenging.<p>I&#x27;m fortunate that I have friends that are also careful that live close to me that I can still see. It&#x27;s not as safe as completely isolating, but I also weighed the risk of completely isolating myself from everyone and I decided that I had to be okay with a certain amount of risk of infection. People don&#x27;t really talk about the death toll of mental health problems, but it&#x27;s substantive in certain demographics. I keep telling my friends that you can&#x27;t eliminate risk, just mitigate it to an amount that you&#x27;re comfortable with, and that amount is different for everyone.<p>Complete isolation is not a sustainable plan. I&#x27;ve been looking at what my lifestyle is going to be like until we start getting this under control, which doesn&#x27;t look like it&#x27;s coming in the short to medium term.')
