That is, they try to find out whether an incision from the left is better or from the right.<p>&gt; But very few studies try to find out whether the incision does anything at all for the patient. Shocking, but thatâ€™s the truth.<p>Assuming that those studies do not always conclude &quot;neither is better than the other&quot;, this implies one or both of these:<p>1. At least one of the two options is better than the placebo.<p>2. At least one of the two options is worse than the placebo.<p>In other words, finding differences in effectiveness of different intervention approaches <i>must</i> mean that either <i>some</i> of these interventions are better than placebo, or that <i>all</i> (except maybe the best one) are measurably worse than performing no surgery at all.<p>&gt; &quot;the severity of your symptoms does not change the effectiveness of the operation&quot;<p>I hate the word &quot;effectiveness&quot; because it can mean anything. Effectiveness at what? Measured how? Surely the severity of my symptoms (&quot;my toe hurts&quot; vs &quot;half my leg has been shot off&quot;) plays a role in determining whether amputation is an &quot;effective&quot; remedy? Or you could argue that it is equally effective at &quot;removing&quot; the symptom in both cases. But then killing the patient would be peak effectiveness - no more pain at all, guaranteed! It&#x27;s just pointless to discuss such a thesis - if you talk about &quot;effectiveness&quot;, your statements very quickly become unfalsifiable.')
