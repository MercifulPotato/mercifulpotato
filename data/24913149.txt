Item(by='triceratops', descendants=None, kids=[24913551], score=None, time=1603840399, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24912357, text='&gt; A carbon tax has to be an approximation, and there are significant judgement calls on what the total carbon burden of a given product or service might be.<p>Sorry, could you explain more? I always assumed a carbon tax meant an extraction tax on any fossil fuel. For example, taxing companies per barrel of crude, per ton of natgas or coal they take out of the ground. Since practically all carbon emissions involve the use of a fossil fuel somewhere in the chain, wouldn&#x27;t this capture the carbon output of any product or service?')
