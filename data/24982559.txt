Rust is a great replacement for low-level C.<p>Unfortunately, those are not the features that you care about most in a compiler. In a compiler, your priorities are ease of extension, ease of specification, and ease of transformation. The last thing you want in a compiler language is to worry about ownership when trying to implement expression-rewriting optimizations. Conversely, OCaml is excellent at these things.')
