To pick just one example, Brexit the Movie talked about the low quality of EU bureaucracy quite a bit.<p>The EU&#x27;s old list of &quot;myths&quot; is a bit of a joke BTW. A lot of the so-called myth debunkings started with an admission that the claim is indeed true, but here&#x27;s why it&#x27;s actually OK. It&#x27;s more a list of responses than myths. For instance the &quot;myth&quot; that they were funding trapeze artists in Africa was explained with words to the effect of, yes we do this, but it&#x27;s totally cool so what&#x27;s the problem? I&#x27;ve noticed hardly anyone who quotes the existence of that site seems to have actually read any of it. I think they took it down at some point - it was as embarrassing to the EU as the British press, really. Kind of a hall of shame of stupid stuff the press had picked up on over the years combined with a very weak set of justifications, often of the form of &quot;we decided to do this so that makes it right&quot;.<p>Bendy bananas is a good example of that by the way. You claim the press made it up. You&#x27;re lying, perhaps without realising it. Commission regulation 2257&#x2F;94 specifies different classes for fruit based on, amongst other things, straightness. Read about it here:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Commission_Regulation_(EC)_No._2257&#x2F;94" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Commission_Regulation_(EC)_No....</a><p>This is supposedly to make trade easier. Perhaps it does, although why the EU needs to define this vs just supermarkets and other bulk purchasers who care about banana straightness is very unclear. The debate about bendy bananas was never about whether the rules existed at all, but rather whether they represented a reasonable deployment of trans-national bureaucracy.<p>Your post is symptomatic of a more general problem: people who are very pro EU tend to believe they are better informed than they actually are, and tend to believe people who disagree with them about the value of the EU are just brainwashed idiots who don&#x27;t know the facts. But when this has been tested rigorously e.g. in polls or studies, it&#x27;s always been that anti-EU people have a (slightly) better grip on the facts.')
