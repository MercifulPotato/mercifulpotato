Those are normally found by using either &quot;springs&quot;, &quot;magnets&quot; or a combination of both.<p>There is theoretically a way to use the roughness of the terrain (so the bike going up and down as it rides) to store that energy and then use that for propulsion. When finding a rough spot, the bike trades forward momentum for a vertical impulse, so it might be possible to transform a part of this back to horizontal. I don&#x27;t have a basis to calculate this, but my intuition tells me accounting for loses this energy must be <i>very small</i> and <i>very difficult</i> to capture, to the point of almost worthless. Think of a wave energy generator, but on a calm day with waves almost flat.<p>The article doesn&#x27;t claim that though (&quot;10kg active weight [...] generate a moment ranging from 7.3Nm to 7.8Nm&quot;), so this is either bad reporting or a perpetual motion scam. My money is on the latter specially seeing the &quot;infinite power assistance&quot; label on the video, would be happy to be proven wrong though!<p>Fun fact: In 1775 the Royal Academy of Sciences in Paris stopped accepting proposals concerning perpetual motion.')
