I&#x27;d take vanilla PHP and JavaScript over TypeScript and the frameworks any day. I recognize that&#x27;s an extremely unpopular opinion but those languages are battle tested over 25 years and if I run into a problem that I haven&#x27;t seen before, there&#x27;s a high probability I&#x27;ll get the correct answer from a search.  For the &quot;modern&quot; stuff, I get five different answers and none of them solve my problem because the language and&#x2F;or framework has changed as many times since the question was first asked.<p>That said; given the choice I&#x27;d choose Clojure and ClojureScript. It&#x27;s a young pup compared to PHP and JS but it&#x27;s still based on a 60-year old language and just a joy to work with.')
