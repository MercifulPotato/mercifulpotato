Many modern practitioners feel that they&#x27;re reclaiming a practice that was persecuted under American Puritanism.<p>I&#x27;m curious about this:  is there any record of actual Puritans persecuting someone explicitly for having a facial tattoo?  (It is true, of course, that Puritans in England and the colonies did not have a modern perspective about the separation of church and state and persecuted minorities like the Quakers.  A revulsion to their sense of justice is also pretty understandable, but justice was pretty rough back then, too.)')
