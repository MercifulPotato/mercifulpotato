I&#x27;ve done things like have a bunch of subslides that just mutate content when I&#x27;m trying to telling a technical story, with javascript stepping forward the changes. Works much better than copying and pasting and editing the same slide 25 times.<p>Honestly, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve made any presentations that <i>didn&#x27;t</i> use reveal.js (except when forced to) in, what, a decade now? If it wasn&#x27;t reveal.js back then it was something like it.')
