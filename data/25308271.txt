It is remarkable when you watch movies from the 70s to see those empty streets, full of empty parking slots on the sides.<p>For instance this short film. Shot early in the morning (so empty streets expected) but look at the side of the roads, almost no cars parked anywhere. Today these streets are packed bumper to bumper. It feels like another city: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=2-GqZIR0HUw" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=2-GqZIR0HUw</a><p>But you would notice the same on any film or documentary from the 70s.')
