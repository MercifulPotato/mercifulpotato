I&#x27;ve experimented with splitting a single window into multiple panes (GNU screen has slightly clunky support for this), but overall haven&#x27;t found that to be as useful.  I use the vim keys for viewing &#x2F; copying the terminal window history as well as command-line history.<p>For a long time I&#x27;ve eschewed using multiple tabs in Gnome Terminal, but I&#x27;ve started using those as well.  Instead of having multiple terminal windows for different hosts, I just use different tabs, and switch between them via Ctrl-PageUp and Ctrl-PageDown.  Another option there is to use another level of GNU screen with a different hotkey, but perhaps down that path lies madness.')
