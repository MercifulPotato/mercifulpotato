I would like to add in here someplace that AMD used to make 100% identical chips for an entire full lineup and then adjust the frequency and prices to the actual binning process like if they tested a bunch of chips and got a lot that did 3.8 then they sold them all as 3.8 if they did 4.1 they sold them as 4.1 it was quite common to buy the lowest possible cheapest AMD chip and get one that could essentially be and overclock to their number one highest bench chip. See fx 8120 the lowest bulldozer chip overclocking to be and identical performer to the much more expensive and higher chips.')
