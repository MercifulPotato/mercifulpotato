Although these facilities are similar, there are substantial differences.<p>&gt; Facilities in Concurrent C were designed keeping in perspective the concurrent programming facilities in the Ada language and their limitations. Concurrent C facilities have also been modified as a result of experience with its initial implementations.<p>&gt; The authors compare the concurrent programming facilities in Concurrent C and Ada and show that it is easier to write a variety of concurrent programs in Concurrent C than in Ada.')
