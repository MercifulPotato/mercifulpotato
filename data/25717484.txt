The only thing missing from this list is a sense of how brutally true it is.<p>As brand-conscious consumers, we swim in daydreams of products and images.  &quot;What if BMW made a blender?&quot;  But these are playground thoughts.

Unless you happen to be launching a reusable rocket.  Then you may get to choose the payload :)')
