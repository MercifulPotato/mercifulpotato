It was linked as part of their cover letter, I hadn&#x27;t even spoken to them before that.<p>I told them they should take that off the internet and we wouldn&#x27;t be proceeding with their application. It even had things like notes from standups, design documentation and future development plans - I guess their team took the monorepo thing very seriously.')
