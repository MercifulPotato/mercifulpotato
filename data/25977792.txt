There are all variety of repos that simply don&#x27;t get indexed. Forks seem generally not to get indexed, even when they have changed significantly. Also though at the same time I see TONS of copies of similar&#x2F;almost the same file when searching. There needs to be some consistency and&#x2F;or an option here of whether to search forks or not. Besides forks, I&#x27;ve also seem some repos that aren&#x27;t forks that simply aren&#x27;t indexed and I have no idea why.<p>2. Support standard quoted match &quot;exactly this stuff&quot;.<p>3. Support standard + and - for needing to have a term and needing to not have a term.<p>4. Support 2 and 3 in combination. +&quot;this stuff&quot; -&quot;this other stuff&quot;<p>5. As asked by others, be able to exclude header files. This is extremely irritating when attempting to find unique implementations of some specific thing by keywords. I get deluged by reverse engineered headers with no available implementations.<p>6. Be able to &quot;watch&quot; specific keywords. I would like to be notified when new results appear under certain search terms.<p>7. As others have asked for, be able to somehow intelligently group duplicate results that are not exactly the same file. This goes back to looking for unique implementations. I&#x27;m imagining this working by comparing the lines around the matched locations. I often search for things and have to wade through pages of duplicates to find unique examples.<p>8. Intelligent parsing of source code files. Functions&#x2F;subroutines in a language should be indexed and searchable on their own. This would allow search for all functions that mention a specific keyword; those functions could then be deduplicated to prevent the issue with showing copies of the same API that are slightly different but exactly the same in the function where the match was found.<p>9. Invent some way to add search metadata to source code files for letting people find them. For example, tagging something as being an example usage of a certain library function. It would take time for it to become popular but this would aid in letting authors make their code more discoverable by people looking for it.<p>10. Treat binaries stored in github differently. For example, dump the symbols of executables stored and let those symbols be searched.')
