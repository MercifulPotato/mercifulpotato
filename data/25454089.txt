Not sure we&#x27;d be able to put in the effort into a new tool of this depth if we were to start today (same with GIMP).<p>I noticed some regression on Ubuntu 18&#x2F;20 though: the integrated XML editor crashed,  and the weird property dialog sometimes doesn&#x27;t pan into view. Don&#x27;t know if that has something to do with Ubuntu or gtk&#x2F;gnome specifically, but Ubuntu Studio appears to have moved to KDE (or alternatively XFCE) recently. And switching to a KDE-based distro such as OpenSuse or Manjaro (or Studio) is what I&#x27;m planning to do anyway.')
