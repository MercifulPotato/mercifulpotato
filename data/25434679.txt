Additionally, press freedoms are really important, as a properly functioning free press allows people who might not get beat up by the police access to the knowledge that the police are breaking the law and beating people.  People don&#x27;t seem to like it when authority figures act hypocritically, so this is a great tool for exposing their crimes and perhaps causing something to be done about it.<p>From a consequentialist point of view, it&#x27;s worse when the police beat journalists than people who aren&#x27;t documenting cop crimes, because preventing press from publishing about criminal behavior by police increases the likelihood that they will go unpunished.<p>If we have limited resources to fight them, we should protect those who can accomplish the most in fighting this longstanding police culture of violence, racism, and lies by exposing it for the shameful, dishonorable practice that it is.')
