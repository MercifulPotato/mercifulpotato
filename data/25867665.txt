The Australian search market is obviously still a billion dollar business, the law is not literally &#x27;unworkable&#x27; and Google probably knows this. What else is Content ID on Youtube? Third party revenue sharing agreements for content <i>already exist on Google&#x27;s own platforms</i>.<p>What Google is afraid of is the precedent it sets for other countries to do the same and eat into their search revenue because it would dispel the myth that tech companies cannot be regulated, that&#x27;s the real danger here.')
