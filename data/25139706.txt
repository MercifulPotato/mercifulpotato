Item(by='dvtrn', descendants=None, kids=[25152137], score=None, time=1605721132, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25139503, text='<i>(We talk about 10x programmers, are there 10x machinists?)</i><p>Yes. Why wouldn&#x27;t there be? Asking honestly?<p>A story, if you will-because I have a very intimate relationship with industrial machinists: My father was a certified industrial welder, pipe fitter and metallurgist for General Electric&#x27;s gas turbine division for 32 years (he was also a licensed master electrician) He was the only individual in his functional team with the number of licenses and depth of mechanical engineering background to his name. He oversaw several manufacturing retrofits in their plant, and lead a team of 10 other engineers, all of whom through his time and tenure became family friends. I know all of their stories and backgrounds intimately.<p>When he left GE due to layoffs in the early 1990&#x27;s, he opened his own shop and hired several of those machinists to come work for him. Despite getting to see this work daily, up close, and learn for myself the family trade of metal smithing (both of my brothers, my father, two of his brothers and my grandfather were all metal workers and passed down the trade through to my generation), I was the first to cross over the digital divide and go white collar as a full-time career, but I still have a strong appreciation for mechanized labor and I took this with me into automotive.<p>So, all of that said, to answer the question, I think yes, there absolutely are 10x machinists (I don&#x27;t personally buy into the &quot;10x&quot; thing <i>generally</i>-at least not the way it is sometimes applied, but in alignment with your question, yes) and I  remain firm in my objection that these people are <i>less</i> skilled because their skills are <i>different</i> or <i>differently applied</i> than ours as SWEs.')
