It&#x27;s making all of music more generic.<p>There&#x27;s composers and producers with quite high production values, very complex and intricate music, the kind you want to pay attention to, in order to get the most out of it.<p>But I don&#x27;t listen to that music all day. I got other music for background.<p>In my view the latter is not more valuable because I listen to it for more minutes.<p>When it was CDs I&#x27;d pay roughly the same for my Autechre as my Kruder &amp; Dorfmeister.')
