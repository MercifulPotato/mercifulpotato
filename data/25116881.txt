The author in a self-deprecating way says that he’s not a mathematician, but just a programmer. Bear no mind to that: this is one of the best popular expositions of Goedel theorem I’ve seen. Everything is very accurately explained, there are no silly mistakes and untruths one often sees mentioned in context of Goedel theorem, and even the original proof is sketched in a very approachable manner, striking a very good balance between getting across all crucial ideas, and skipping most of the distracting technical aspects (which are important and interesting, but I think only to mathematicians, haha). Great job all around.')
