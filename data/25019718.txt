You want people smarter than you running the country, because you understand that governing is a boring job that requires skill.<p>But the second job of the president is to be a role model, to be a good example. And if the president is too good, too perfect, too clean, there&#x27;s a bunch of people who are going to feel alienated or inferior. And that turns into resentment and hate.<p>So then Trump comes along. A sexist, racist, buffoon who ignores political correctness. And for a lot of people, having him as a role model makes it easier to keep up, to compare yourself. &quot;He says it like it is&quot;, they say. His terribleness gives them permission to be equally terrible. If the president can grab women by the pussy, <i>they</i> can grab women by the pussy.<p>I don&#x27;t know if splitting the Head of State from Chief Executive would help solve it, a lot of other countries have split the role, it&#x27;s not like they have to go together. But it&#x27;s clear that the <i>governing</i> job has to be moved away from the idiotic popularity contest that is the presidential election so that we can ensure we get people capable of governing in the role.')
