In the same way that saying books cause violence is also practically meaningless.<p>Societal violence isn&#x27;t as simple as neurological desensitization to stimuli. To take Call of Duty for example, the violence is so incredibly unrealistic, the only thing I could imagine it desensitise someone to is the cocophenious stimuli of Call of Duty itself; the actual reality of soldiering is too corporeally miserable to form any meaningful connexion between the comfortable experience of playing a video game. However, Call of Duty creates a very reactionary world where you get to be part of the machinations of a barely legal extra-judicial dark operations.  While I do not think it is obliged to do so, it never really comments on the morality of what you are doing, as you are always fighting evil - and this evil happens to be either Russian, Brown, or Marxist. It&#x27;s not scientific to draw the connexion between videogames (as literature) and violence, but you&#x27;d have to be deliberately obtuse to deny that ideas (even within videogames) effect change.<p>No one today talks about opera as a medium being a catalyst for violence, but opera was a surprisingly common source of riots; sometimes even igniting revolutions. Following the July Revolution in France, the Belgians enthused by &#x27;La muette de Portici&#x27; and its nationalist idealism, rioted and occupied the government buildings, and splitting from the Kingdom of the Netherlands.<p>Anyone who claimed it was the soprano&#x27;s vibrato rather than the librettist&#x27;s lyrics would be dismissed as mad today. In a way it&#x27;s similar to claiming that a red pulsating vignette in COD causes bloodthirsty violence. However, it&#x27;s completely valid to critique games as literature that encourages dehumanisation that leads to violence.')
