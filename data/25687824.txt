We can display ads in between the updates -- something print newspapers used to (and still) do all the time.  Then we just take the revenue share from any specific market, divide it up by the number of updates contributed, and go from there.  It&#x27;s not perfect, and we may still want to tweak, but the hope is that we can then incentivize lots of hard news reporting, and not &quot;5 celebrities without makeup.&quot;')
