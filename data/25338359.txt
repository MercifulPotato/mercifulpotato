Maybe offer a monthly subscription so people can give it a try with a smaller commitment. Just because you might not think that it&#x27;s worth it, doesn&#x27;t mean other people won&#x27;t have different value propositions.<p>I have friends and family who would easily pay $100+&#x2F;year to use this (compared to the $36&#x2F;year you&#x27;re charging now). The British neural option above is much more palatable than the current default, imo.<p>All in all, nice work!')
