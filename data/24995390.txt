We&#x27;re not aware of any species that feeds specifically on one of these dangerous mosquito species, and all of these dangerous species have other mosquito species in their habitats, so we&#x27;re pretty sure that first- and second-order environmental impact of the extinction of these dangerous mosquito species would be minimal.<p>Though, by greatly reducing human morbidity and mortality, wiping out these dangerous mosquito populations would increase general human environmental impact.  Granted, that&#x27;s a Thanos-level complaint, similar to bicycles causing pollution because exercise causes people to live longer.')
