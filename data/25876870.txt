I wouldn&#x27;t do that (for a couple reasons). The main one, is that I want to always be able to link back directly to the creator&#x27;s repo and license. It gets a bit meta when people start collecting icons from other 3rd party sites.\nAs for whether it&#x27;s allowed, I think it depends on the specific license. For example, some licenses may not allow for redistribution generally, but then may grant a special license to a provider (for example, like Noun Project). So then, you may find yourself violating a license that you didn&#x27;t even know about.<p>So the rule is, I&#x27;ll only include icons that have licenses that specifically allow redistribution and attribution, and I&#x27;ll almost always link back to the repo. The exception is some sets aren&#x27;t hosted through GitHub or GitLab, so I&#x27;ll link back to their respective website.')
