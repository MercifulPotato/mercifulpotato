Finding it the first time is the difficult part. That can happen based on a tip-off (e.g. every security team in the world will be checking their network for these processes, domain names etc. now), a lucky find (e.g. if the backdoor triggered weird crashes and someone took a look), or because it&#x27;s linked to some other bad activity (e.g. someone finds some form of known malware and investigates how it got there).<p>In this case, it&#x27;s likely that they somehow found the backdoor in SolarWinds&#x27; network and realized what was happening that way.')
