Item(by='Retr0spectrum', descendants=None, kids=[24886300], score=None, time=1603633548, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24886037, text='- youtube-dl should be re-named to something like webvideo-dl<p>- I&#x27;m not familiar with the ytdl codebase, but I believe its already structured as a general framework, with separate per-site extraction functions. The central framework should be stored in a &quot;webvideo-dl&quot; repo, and the separate extraction functions should be contained under separate repos - e.g. &quot;wvdl-plugin-youtube&quot;.<p>This solves two problems:<p>1. If &quot;wvdl-plugin-youtube&quot; is DMCA&#x27;ed, the rest of the project continues to function.<p>2. Separate &quot;plugins&quot; can be maintained by separate teams. It sounds like the original youtube-dl was already running behind on responding to issues and PRs, prompting the creation of the youtube-dlc fork.')
