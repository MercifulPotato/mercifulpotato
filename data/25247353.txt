A second robot pops out of the main tractor to go open the gate, the tractor drives through the narrow opening towing the field implement behind it and waits for it&#x27;s mini robot to finish closing the gate and return to it&#x27;s docking station. The tractor then takes off through the 30 acres of pasture that separates the crop ground from road access, following a winding two track path. It crosses the creek at the bottom of the valley, not at the main crossing, that one is too muddy from the wet spring and higher traffic last week, the one upstream of it.\nIt continues up the other side, following the path until it reaches the gate to the crop ground. The mini robot pops out. This time it must hurry, because the cows grazing this pasture think this tractor is coming to feed them and have started to gather round. The tractor makes it through the gate, waiting while the mini robot shoos the cattle that followed thenm through back into the pasture.\nThe tractor can now start working the field. It starts by doing a few passes around the outside perimeter. On the first pass it finds a tree from the fence line has blown over into the field from the storm last week and needs to be dragged out of the way. Mini robot deployed again, and pulls the tree into a ditch. The main tractor continues on its first pass while mini robot patches the top line of barbed wire, broken by the weight of the downed tree. The tractor is coming back around from its first pass, just in time too, since a big chunk of plastic bale wrap that blew in from the neighbors farm has gotten lodged in the implement and is causing malfunction. Mini robot pulls out it&#x27;s pocket knife and cuts the plastic free and re-docks so that the tractor can continue.<p>This is what small scale farming looks like. Do you think we are close?')
