Item(by='wwright', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605924783, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25163702, text='In most languages that have implicit returns (that I’m aware of), the languages are also expression-oriented. For example, in Rust, if&#x2F;else is actually an <i>expression</i> and you can use the result:<p><pre><code>    let result = if foo &gt; 5 {\n        &quot;Big foo&quot;\n    } else {\n        &quot;Small foo&quot;\n    };\n</code></pre>\nImplicit returns are just an extension of this (it’s really just “semicolons create statements; if you don’t have a semicolon, that’s the final value of the block”). The <i>explicit</i> return is an actual statement that returns <i>early</i>.<p>IME the holistic design works pretty well, and I think you can glue together expressions much more naturally this way. The implicit return on itself would be much more annoying IMO.')
