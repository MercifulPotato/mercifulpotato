The kernel author could simply say &quot;this isn&#x27;t how the kernel works, so we cannot accept this&quot;. There isn&#x27;t a need to come up with wacky insults, as humorous as they may be.<p>&gt; Sounds harsh.

How does someone become a kernel developer?

An open source project is a team job, and there&#x27;s a reason development takes place out in the open: so that others can contribute. If outside contributions to the project isn&#x27;t allowed, why not make it a source available project instead of open source?')
