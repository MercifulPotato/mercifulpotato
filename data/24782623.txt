I run a service that needs to dynamically provision AWS resources, and lacking a clear path to do this programmatically, I shell out to Terraform.<p>* I assume you aren&#x27;t shelling out :). Do you have any additional helper libraries on top of the Terraform code base to make it more of a a programmatically consumable API, as apposed to an end user application?<p>* Are you still pointing at a directory with resources defined in HCL, or are the resources defined programmatically?<p>* What are you using for state storage?<p>* What is the execution environment for the programmatic Terraform process? Since Terraform uses external processes for plugins, I&#x27;ve hit some issues with resource constraints around the max number of process sysctl&#x27;s in containerized environment where I have multiple Terraform processes running in the same container.<p>edit: formatting')
