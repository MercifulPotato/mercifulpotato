Every report of a problem, no matter how big or small, should at least be taken seriously enough to record the report and investigate its credibility - otherwise you&#x27;ll set up a culture of issues going unreported because they get poo-pooed when they are reported.  I&#x27;ll see if I can find the talk where this concept was first put in such plain words to me, but I believe it was a Defcon talk called &quot;Steal Everything, Kill Everyone, Cause Total Financial Ruin&quot;.')
