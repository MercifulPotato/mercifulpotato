The advice presupposes that indignant people are reasonable, fair, forgiving (and frankly, gullible). If you bend over to a mob that is out to get you, then you will find out very quickly how cruel people can become. You will find out that human beings, within angry group dynamics, simply revert back to primitiveness in these situations. It&#x27;s like dealing with a pack of wolves. Never show weakness. This doesn&#x27;t get us to a better society but it is what it is.')
