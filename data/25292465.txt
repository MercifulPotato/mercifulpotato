Here are some things you could try:<p>* At standups, have a parking lot time at the end where people can raise issues.<p>* Do retrospectives - you should be able to raise your issue and get your team thinking about a solution.<p>* If you&#x27;re running the meeting, have an agenda. Build in time for Q&amp;A and an Any Other Business time. If you&#x27;re not running the meeting, request an agenda.<p>* Book in your own meetings to have your say. Back it up with info.<p>* Try do confidence voting - I have seen this work well. You go around everyone in the room and ask them how confident they are in the solution. It can be eye opening because some people may say 3 (low confidence) while others say 8 (high confidence)<p>* Try make your comments before the meetings (on slack if you are WFH)<p>* Start a Decision Log for team. It may help to prevent the decisions that have been made from poor points.<p>Now, none of these help if your team don&#x27;t care and are just Loud(tm).')
