They might have one, but my experience is largely I&#x27;m still downloading EXE files from a &#x2F;download page somewhere. But I only use for my work so not installing much. I still feel like the app store on OSX is meh. I download DMG files 99% of the time from a &#x2F;download page somewhere. Seems to work fine, what am I missing?<p>You&#x27;re making it sound like app stores have fixed something but I&#x27;m failing to see what. Maybe on iOS it gives some exposure&#x2F;discoverability to new apps. But I don&#x27;t see that as an overwhelming feature for end users. This used to exist outside of app stores as web based directories and that worked better in my opinion.')
