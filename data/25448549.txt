In it, there was a CDC&#x2F;WHO expert who traveled around to various health authorities&#x2F;districts&#x2F;regions and trained them on how to deal with the public regarding a pandemic.<p>This expert did the professional version of a facepalm when she recounted the times when these health experts failed in their drills. She made it clear that the public will look to them as experts, so be clear, be informative, tell the truth, give actionable steps, etc. Because if these experts _don&#x27;t_ do these things, the public will look elsewhere. And that &quot;elsewhere&quot; will likely be random yahoos on the internet. Doctors saying &quot;wear a mask&quot; will have greater overall benefits, even if people follow that advice BADLY.')
