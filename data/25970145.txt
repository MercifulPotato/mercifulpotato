This was because not having a blacklist was not the app&#x27;s sole distinction from other mastodon apps (it had a majorly different UI), so its purpose was determined to be more than just accessing Gab.<p>However, some fdroid users asked for its removal. They felt removing the blacklist feature, which had previously only blocked gab, was itself an endorsement of Gab and indicated the app&#x27;s purpose was to access Gab since the other available mastodon app (Tusky) still had a blacklist.<p>fdroid did not agree and fedilab is still available.<p>OpenTusky was not allowed as it was literally Tusky with the server blacklist removed, created in response to Tusky blocking Gab. It also advertised this in the app description, so fdroid judged it to be primarily for accessing gab and removed it.')
