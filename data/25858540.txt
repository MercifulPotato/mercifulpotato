The problem I see is that this sort of arguments, if accepted as OK&#x2F;inevitable and universalized lead to a dilution of responsibility that would make no one fully accountable for any intentional wrongdoing: for example, if you pay for your car to be repaired at your regular car repair shop, but the mechanic knowingly used parts that were not certified or due to time pressure skipped standard checks, and you let someone drive your car a year later, and there is an accident that was caused as a consequence of that sloppy repair-work, do you share responsibility for your oversight? - You might argue you do; well, I would argue you don&#x27;t.')
