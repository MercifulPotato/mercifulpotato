Their product range is restricted to houses and maybe condos, boxed into a specific geographic constraints (whichever regional MLS they&#x27;re part of).<p>This seems like it&#x27;s intentionally hobbling your reach for some customers:<p>* A house isn&#x27;t right for everyone, due to finances, preferred location, whatever.  Why not take your agency&#x27;s understanding of neighbourhoods and also serve as a high-powered apartment referral service?  I also don&#x27;t know if they handle manufactured houses, which is again putting viable choices off the table.<p>* Anyone shopping at the border of your MLS territory.  Yeah, there are 300 houses perfect for the customer&#x27;s needs right across the county line, but there&#x27;s no way for you to sell them without getting into a standoff.  On the flip side, it also means you only have access to customers fairly late in the move process-- once you&#x27;ve decided &quot;I&#x27;m moving to Gary, Indiana and will find a house when I get there.&quot;<p>A true national real-estate firm could do some amazing integrated services.  Especially with the growth of &quot;work-anywhere-there&#x27;s-broadband&quot; remote work, you could meet the customer at the &quot;I want to leave San Francisco; where can I go that has good schools, municipal broadband, and four-bedroom homes on a $350,000 budget&quot; phase of the process.  Existing homeowners could orchestrate selling their old house and finding a new one through a single firm, even if they&#x27;re doing a cross-country move.  They&#x27;d also have the market presence to put price pressure on auxillary services (inspectors, title insurance firms, short-term investments to hold sale proceeds)')
