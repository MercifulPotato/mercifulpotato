I&#x27;m making the distinction specifically because of the DMCA&#x27;s anti-circumvention measures, which specifically apply to circumventing digital copyright. Obviously any analogy to a sailboat is unrelated to the DMCA and unrelated to my comment.<p>I do agree that specific sentence of mine is poorly worded, but the point that it still requires that circumvention stands regardless of the poor wording.<p>I linked to the bit of the snap that I believe may constitute circumvention under the DMCA. I welcome you to actually respond to what I meant in my comment, and not with some strawman of an intentionally poor interpretation of it.')
