People like you do in fact care about non-local pollution. there are steps: first you need to get far enough out of poverty that you can start thinking you can accept the lower standard of living not having poison around you is acceptable. When you don&#x27;t have enough to eat or in danger of freezing to death (or other weather&#x2F;nature related disasters) that poison is something you just stay away from - particularity if your job is with whoever is dumping it since making them clean up might me they don&#x27;t pay you and then you can&#x27;t eat. When you don&#x27;t have those basic worries to you worry about more avoidable ones like local poison&#x2F;pollution. Only after the above do non-local concerns matter.')
