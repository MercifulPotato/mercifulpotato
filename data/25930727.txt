You don&#x27;t have to be an elite coder to use JITX. Most EEs have banged out a quick matlab or python script at some point, which is plenty of experience. We worked a lot on the semantics of the language to make it correspond to how EEs think about designs, which I beleive helps.<p>Not a one-way street -- you can flow designs back and forth between JITX and the CAD tools we support. It was hard for us to get working, but it is important. At least until we have all of PCB design fully automated.')
