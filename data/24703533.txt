Think we had 3-4 indoor cats at one point and some other strays outside they liked to feed.<p>We had 3 litter boxes and they had to be scooped daily or they quickly became disgusting.<p>My point was that cats still need upkeep and it&#x27;s really not fair to leave them living in filth for a week at a time just because someone can set up an auto-feeder.<p>Any pet is going to be an inconvenience if properly cared for.  Doesn&#x27;t mean a person can&#x27;t travel, but as mentioned they will likely need to ask or pay someone to come and check on the pets.<p>Giant litter box is helpful but still needs to be regularly scooped.<p>If someone can invent a feasible self cleaning litter box (or a good way to toilet train a cat) I would love to have a cat pet, but right now the idea of them using dirty litter boxes and walking on every surface in the house is just too unappealing.')
