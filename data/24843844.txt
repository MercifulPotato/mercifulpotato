The national grid regulator (FERC) gets its foothold through the interstate commerce clause. Since Texas heavily restricts the interstate interconnections it is not regulated federally (or at least less regulated). Of course this doesnâ€™t explain the East&#x2F;west non-interconnection, I think historically the Rockies do most of that though (as the article mentions). The issue is only partially technical and largely administrative.')
