If you are focusing on solving problems, then learning another language, especially one that allows you to approach problems differently makes a lot of sense. I haven&#x27;t used Prolog in anger in about 20 years. But the experience with declarative, logic programming has carried over to nearly everything I&#x27;ve done (you&#x27;ll see state machines differently and see other logic patterns you can generalize). The resume isn&#x27;t the be-all end all. Programming is a portfolio profession. You can prove your skill by showing your work - even if it&#x27;s just some toy you wrote for fun on the weekend.')
