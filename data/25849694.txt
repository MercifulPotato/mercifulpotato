Especially React, which has become the boring choice for a lot of client side programming. And you were going to end up using some sort of cross-compiler and packager for significant browser code anyway, just to wrap up all that risk about multiple browsers.<p>That&#x27;s a bit less clear on the server side, where you have more control. But two things are going for you: if you&#x27;re going to use Node you might as well use the same language on both sides, and you can cleanly escape to plain Javascript if you feel compelled.<p>(Personally I&#x27;d prefer a less sucky language, but honestly, TS makes JS pretty good. Not great, especially with all the legacy warts, but decent, and at least you get to share code with the browser.)<p>TS has survived long enough and become endemic enough that it doesn&#x27;t look like much risk any more, and it&#x27;s a vastly better language than plain Javascript -- especially for reducing the risks that come with long-term boring projects. If you&#x27;re writing JS and like boring, Typescript is looking increasingly like the good, boring choice.')
