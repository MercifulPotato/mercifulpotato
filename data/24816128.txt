When you&#x27;re cobbling things together yourself you can leave features out of the design of your deployment &#x2F; orchestration system. That is a blessing and a curse. A lot  of the time you just end up ducktaping that feature on later because &quot;oh shit, it keeps breaking&quot;. Eventually your &quot;simpler&quot; system is just as complex a <i>design</i>, but the system has lots of major flaws:<p>* It doesn&#x27;t work as \nwell<p>* Nobody outside your company has heard of it<p>* Most of the code is once-off hacky scripts that nobody really maintains<p>* Breakages <i>will</i> occur when underlying dependencies get upgraded when you patch your OS.<p>I&#x27;ll even wager that nobody <i>inside</i> your company completely understand how it works. And when it breaks, you are 100% on the hook for it. There&#x27;s no chance of official documentation or training, and no point asking for help on stackoverflow.')
