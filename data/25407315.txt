These days he says that his code has very few conditional statements.<p>I think the tactic strategy to achieve this is to confine conditional branches in a few well chosen words.<p>For instance if you have a word SORT that sorts the top pair on the stack, which has to have a branch:<p><pre><code>    : SORT 2DUP &lt; IF SWAP THEN ;\n</code></pre>\nthen you can build &quot;if-less&quot; MIN, MAX and ABS:<p><pre><code>    : MIN SORT NIP ;\n\n    : MAX SORT DROP ;\n\n    : ABS 0 SORT SWAP - ;</code></pre>')
