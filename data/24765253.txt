The Korean Government keeps favoring their ISP over other internet companies.</i><p>The Korean Government also sees an opportunity to bring in additional revenue, while at the same time applying a more equal treatment to foreign and domestic content providers alike. Domestic content providers are paying network usage fees, and depending on the final thresholds (currently 1% of domestic network traffic and 1M daily users over a 3 month period[1]) content providers may also have to pay an additional surcharge. Naver, Kakao and other dominant Korean content providers aren&#x27;t happy about this.[2]<p>It&#x27;s a high stakes game for sure. I wonder how far South Korea will go to enforce this legislation; perhaps something similar to the Great Firewall of China. Theoretically, as&#x2F;if popular foreign content providers are cut off (FB, Netflix, etc.) in the new year then domestic providers should grumble less as their market share and usage presumably increases.<p>[1] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theinvestor.co.kr&#x2F;view.php?ud=20200908000889" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theinvestor.co.kr&#x2F;view.php?ud=20200908000889</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;koreajoongangdaily.joins.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;09&#x2F;10&#x2F;business&#x2F;industry&#x2F;Netflix-Naver-Kakao&#x2F;20200910194700425.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;koreajoongangdaily.joins.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;09&#x2F;10&#x2F;business&#x2F;ind...</a>')
