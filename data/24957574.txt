People are concerned about the loss of jobs due to the software our industry creates, and your response is to imagine a completely made-up scenario where that person gets a new, more fulfilling job that you literally just made up in your own head?<p>By the way, is that your idea of an ideal job for everyone? Sitting in a &quot;comfy chair&quot;, rather than doing, you know, the actual job of a cameraman, a job that is arguably an art form in itself? Do you understand that people love sports, people actually <i>enjoy</i> the athleticism of running around with cameras documenting sports, and that what you&#x27;re dismissing would be a dream job for many people?<p>Do you really truly think the people buying this technology are doing it so that they can also continue to pay that same person to sit in a room and control it, while working towards self-actualization??<p>And do you think the appropriate response to concerns over jobs being eliminated is that the newly unemployed should feel grateful for being &quot;freed&quot; from the work they loved and took pride in, to go and do something &quot;more fulfilling&quot;? And add insult to injury by telling them that the job they had was just not a good job and wasn&#x27;t something humans should have been doing in the first place?<p>&gt; I&#x27;m an automation engineer, I&#x27;ve worked with hundreds of machine operators.<p>You mean, the ones that are keeping their jobs? Have you spent just as much time with the ones whose jobs have been eliminated?<p>I mean, I can understand that you may be facing a little cognitive dissonance here due to <i>your</i> job, but ... try to show a tiny bit of empathy for your fellow human. You think AI won&#x27;t be able to do <i>your</i> job someday? Are you totally comfortable being dropped onto the labor market in today&#x27;s economy if your current professional skill set became entirely valueless overnight, or is that something you only expect other people to be OK with?<p>We are recreating and eliminating entire industries, jobs, and traditions, and the level of awareness and respect for that disruption needs to dialed up by several orders of magnitude, or we as an industry, and all of us as a society, are in for some serious trouble.')
