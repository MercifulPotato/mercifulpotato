Item(by='kypro', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607457877, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25349219, text='&gt; I did not know that. Are you refering to Armenian Genocide or like TYT channel has created violent antifa type people?<p>Gavin Long is probably the most clear cut example I&#x27;m aware of, but we know others like Arcan Cetin were TYT subscribers and some of suspected he was politically motivated. Elliot Roger was also a TYT fan, although I see no connection there.<p>&gt; I followed Sam before TYT era mainly during the Hitchens and Dawkins time. Sam is very smart but I&#x27;ve been listening to him lately and boy is he ever deranged on Trump. I suppose every president has the Clinton Crazies equivalent. It&#x27;s very interesting to see Sam not rational about Trump.<p>I know what you mean. Personally I think his views on Trump are reasonable, although the way he talks about Trump sometimes makes me feel he&#x27;s too emotionally invested in the subject. I wish his rants about Trump had more facts and less ad hominems, there are others who make a much better case against Trump than Sam.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s definitely not. Here in Canada we absolutely have extensive censorship. VPNs are becoming increasingly popular for Canadians.<p>It&#x27;s the same in the UK. We have to be quite carefully about what we say publicly online because if someone gets offended about our opinions (regardless if we intended offence) we can be arrested for a hate crime. I remember when people used to talk about how crazy it was that the Chinese government censor the internet and arrest people for having the wrong opinions, but this has become fairly normal in the UK today.')
