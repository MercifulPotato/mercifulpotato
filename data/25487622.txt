The designers wanted to keep it under (I think) 10 watts which would let them use cheap plastic packages for the chips. But they didn&#x27;t have good power simulation tools so they needed to be very conservative with the design. When they manufactured the chips, they found the power consumption was closer to 1 watt.<p>Edit: as beagle3 pointed out, I got the numbers wrong; they aimed for 1 watt and came in under 0.1 watt. For more details, see Steve Furber&#x27;s oral history, page 15. He says &quot;Effectively, we used Victorian engineering margins on the power consumption of the chip.&quot; <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.computerhistory.org&#x2F;resources&#x2F;access&#x2F;text&#x2F;2012&#x2F;05&#x2F;102746196-05-01-acc.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.computerhistory.org&#x2F;resources&#x2F;access&#x2F;text&#x2F;20...</a>')
