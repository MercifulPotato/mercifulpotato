For instance, <i>if</i> I were a libertarian I might think that attempts to regulate corporations would create inefficiencies that would harm society by harming the economy.  Or if I were a social democrat, I might think that failure to regulate corporations will harm society by letting corporations run rampant on people.  In either case, very sure of my own beliefs, it seems self evident to me that those who disagree with me present a danger to society.<p>That is, unless, I have the humility to earnestly be cognizant of the possibility that I could be wrong about what I believe. If I have that humility, I might choose to temper my criticism of others.')
