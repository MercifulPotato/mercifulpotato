How do you get content that&#x27;s appealing to the widest variety of people shoved into their faces?<p>This is a very good way to put it. I haven&#x27;t figured what the best stance would be yet, but it&#x27;s clear that the old concerns about censorship are quite outdated. Almost no one can make information disappear, and instead, what modern platforms can do (as you&#x27;ve so well put it) is restrict or encourage virality.<p>What is the role of old free speech absolutists when ideas still remain accessible, but the fight is simply over how how mainstream, and how viral those ideas are? I&#x27;m not really sure, however I don&#x27;t worry about things being censored on facebook. Cloudflare&#x27;s power, although perhaps less impactful in practical terms, seems scarier: the withholding of DDoS protections from individual websites who hold controversial views. (and to be clear, 8kun&#x27;s loss is probably a net benefit for society, I&#x27;m just thinking about the modern equivalent to a free speech principle)')
