The lower down the socioeconomic totem pole you go the higher the rates of prevalence of ADHD.<p>Which would make sense given a) it runs in families and b) executive function disorders are correlated with negative life outcomes.<p>I can&#x27;t imagine it makes you _more_ successful in life and thus more likely to be from an affluent family.<p>All the a-holes that abuse the drugs and the DX for any reason need to find another planet to live on IMO. It&#x27;s so not cool.')
