Item(by='simiones', descendants=None, kids=[25649508, 25647681], score=None, time=1609865418, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25646955, text='There are many classical systems that have properties we consider real that are nevertheless not practically measurable. For example, grains of sand have definite position and momentum, yet you can&#x27;t in reality measure them for each grain of sand when you want to describe the flow of a sand in an hourglass. So the practical ability to measure something is not required for us to consider something &quot;real&quot;.<p>Now, Bell&#x27;s inequalities show that any theory of local hidden variables independent from the measurement apparatus is inconsistent with QM and with experimental observations. However, that still leaves the possibility of non-local hidden variables possible, and it also leaves open the possibility that the experiments have been flawed - that the measurement decision was somehow correlated with the result.<p>The Copenhagen interpretation is BOTH non-real and non-local, so I don&#x27;t find a real non-local theory a priori problematic. Whether pilot wave theory can be made consistent with at least special relativity is still open as far as I know, but perhaps there is some equivalent of the no-communication theorem that will be found.<p>Superdeterminism is also seeing a resurgence - I can&#x27;t claim to understand how it could be made into a real scientific theory, but perhaps there is something that is escaping me and we will see a successful theory come out of it.<p>Now, the matter of whether something can be considered &quot;real&quot; but fudamentally un-measurable (as opposed to just being practically un-measurable) is in the end a problem of definitions.<p>I would also note that there is no fundamental quantum randomness - quantum phenomena behave according to a linear equation, so they are fundamentally deterministic. It is only measurement (the interaction between quantum systems and classical systems) that introduces randomness - the superposition of all the solutions to the Schrodinger equation is replaced with a single position&amp;momentum with some probability, and with error bars that are subject to the uncertainty principle.')
