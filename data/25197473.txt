Yes you can learn the weights with genetic algorithms. Is this advised? Not so much : 99.99% of neural networks are trained with some variation of gradient descent on a specified loss function.<p>I don&#x27;t even know if I agree to the statement. Polynomial regression solves basically the same problem as neural networks but performs way, way, way worse on big datasets. But nonetheless I would say that polynomial regression is machine learning too.')
