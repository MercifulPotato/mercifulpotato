Whistleblowing. Unemployed. Nothing and no one to support me. Suffering from C-PTSD every day. Unable to sleep at night, because I may be <i>murdered</i> for reporting a potential billion-dollar money laundering scheme. Fearing to even write this, but I feel <i>compelled</i> to, because I have <i>nothing</i> else.<p>I&#x27;ve gone <i>days</i> without sleep. Woken up afraid for my life. My future. Knowing I may never work again. I may never be employed again. I may be on the street. Homeless. Unable to trust <i>anyone ever again</i>.<p>There&#x27;s no one.<p>No one.<p>Do you understand that?<p>I&#x27;d happily have a union to protect me right now. My life may be over because there isn&#x27;t one.<p>What about people who want to do the right thing and so they are crushed by evil?<p>Do you know how much literature there is out there about blowing the whistle? Do you know how many people are in prison right now for it? Being tortured every day. Julian Assange. Chelsea Manning. Karen Silkwood was poisoned and probably murdered and she was a leader <i>in</i> a union.<p>What about them? Who is protecting them? Who protected them? No one. They are going to live a life of torture and die in prison because of the <i>truth</i>.<p>Who is protecting the <i>truth</i>? Who is enabling the truth to <i>exist</i>?<p>I spoke up and had to do it, I had to, I couldn&#x27;t not do it, despite the very real threat that I might be <i>murdered</i> in my sleep. I can&#x27;t stand to see this happening around me every day. I can&#x27;t do it anymore.<p>I don&#x27;t think people really know. I don&#x27;t think you really know. This isn&#x27;t a <i>movie</i> to me.')
