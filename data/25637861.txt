But, inner source isn&#x27;t the same thing as open source.<p>I thought this was common knowledge, but in a previous related thread my comment saying the same was downvoted with some replies about how MS engineers are security gods or some such. Interesting to contrast mainstream tech coverage with HN&#x27;s RSU echo chamber.')
