This is unusual given congressional results and presidential results have historically correlated. I don&#x27;t understand the explanation for that if Democrats rigged the election somehow.<p>It seems more plausible that:<p>- there was a really high turnout aided by widespread absentee voting<p>- a large single-digit percentage of voters went Republican in the congressional races but didn&#x27;t vote for Trump<p>I can&#x27;t think of a fraud based scenario with any factual support that is as compelling.')
