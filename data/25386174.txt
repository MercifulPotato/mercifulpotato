It takes some space, alright, but mostly does not affect healthy peoples days.<p>When I am yelled at and get insulted by an autistic because I personally did not done things in the exact required routine, then it is not nearly the same thing. It is not that we should not accommodate people with issues. But pretending these are not issues that dont affect others is not accurate either.')
