I try to start with the most basic of basics - but there&#x27;s just WAY too many concepts there. No one even makes it to functions. Even most programmers take a long time to realize that the syntax they learned was as abstraction over the hardware... there&#x27;s so so much to learn.<p>This idea of &quot;gradual changes&quot; is surely worth a test. Yeah, the rules might change - but at that level, the &quot;rules&quot; are just meaningless symbols anyway. If the <i>ideas</i> stick - and you truly understand them, not just memorize them - adapting will be a lot easier than recalling &quot;oh yeah, for some reason there needs to be a semi-colon here&quot;.<p>I think it&#x27;s really clever - I&#x27;m going to test-drive it on some unsuspecting nephews and neices.')
