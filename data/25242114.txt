I keep a bookmark folder with all the threads on HN where the primary form of comment is complaining about the name.<p>It&#x27;s a pastime here, and it&#x27;s a great way to provide a low effort comment that the community will upvote.<p>In reality people don&#x27;t google search for the name of a tool they already know, and if folks are looking for a scripting language for their system, they&#x27;ll find it via Google, not some already-known-to-nerds name.<p>That said, tex is short, and overlaps with a lot of stuff not even nerdy, so teex will probably help set you apart until the fanboys of some other obscure project called teex come to the party :)')
