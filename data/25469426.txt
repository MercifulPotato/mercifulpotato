I recently got into the GA Tech OMSCS program myself. I had a non-tech BSc from a South Asian university that I barely survived because it wasn&#x27;t my thing. Ever since I got out of school, I&#x27;ve worked in tech. I even managed to get a job and move to North America through my work, but the lack of a degree always felt off to me as well.<p>If I&#x27;d read this article a few years ago, I&#x27;d likely have jumped into this program before joining GA Tech&#x27;s OMSCS program. But at this point, I&#x27;m happy with what I chose, and to be able to work and study at the same time, no matter how intense it may get.')
