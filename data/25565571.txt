Rounding up has the same problem.<p>Surely one shouldn&#x27;t round _after_ splitting the time into minutes and seconds.<p>You floor() or ceil() the time, depending on if you&#x27;re counting up or down, to the lowest unit your timer is showing, then you display it and in the process split it into hours, minutes etc.<p>So ceil(59.51s) = 60s, which is then converted to 0h 1m 0s for display.')
