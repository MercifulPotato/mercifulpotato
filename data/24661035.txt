Non-white people tend to be very rare even in metropolitan areas (maybe to a lesser extent in Warsaw), and they are usually either students or high-income people moving to Poland for professional or relationship reasons. In general, Poland isn&#x27;t a very tempting target for immigration.<p>This said, you can argue there is some systematic racism against the Roma or Ukrainians. But it&#x27;s more based on culture and national identity, so its different than what an American would think of then hearing the term.')
