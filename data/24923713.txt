Except replace Steam with Oculus&#x2F;Facebook. Like WTF do you think is going to happen to the games purchased if you delete the account they&#x27;re associated with?<p>Personally for me the issue is that after reading their TOS for Facebook, I can&#x27;t make an account because their TOS is basically saying &quot;I appreciate and support the concept of surveillance, giving up all my rights to privacy, and am perfectly okay with having everything I sad, do, share, post, like, and every intimate detail of my life being property of Facebook that can be sold off to anyone willing to buy my personal details.&quot;')
