Big libraries like Qt, for example.<p>On the other hand, if the coupling to the user&#x27;s project is loose and doesn&#x27;t make their entire project GPL, they have no reason to pay for a license. For example, compiling with gcc or hosting with nginx, or calling ffmpeg doesn&#x27;t make your entire product GPL.')
