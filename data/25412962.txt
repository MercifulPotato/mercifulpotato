Being rated relative to your peers as opposed to a rubric.<p>2. (Usually fast) removal of the lowest performing individuals.<p>When combined, these become &quot;fire and replace the bottom 3% of people on every team every year.&quot; The downsides to this approach are that if you&#x27;re on a strong team, you may be a median employee, but be the weakest on your team, and be forced out for this reason. It&#x27;s clearly problematic.<p>IDK about amazon, but the first is only half present at Google, and the second isn&#x27;t really at all.<p>In some sense you are rated to your peers, not a rubric. But only in the sense of at aggregate (that is, in an organization of 1000 people, you&#x27;d expect ~30 people to be in the &quot;worst 3%&quot; category, so if only 10 are, that may raise some questions. This removes the competition with your direct peers and aligns <i>more</i> with the rubric based idea, though it is possible that a an organization may have across the board above-average (or below) performance on occasion.<p>For the second, people with NI ratings aren&#x27;t immediately fired (I know of a few people who got NI and found new teams and much more happiness), though obviously consistent NI could result in that.')
