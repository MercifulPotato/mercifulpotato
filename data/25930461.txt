I arranged the births, changed most diapers, packed lunches, transport, meetings, homework, cubs, everything but nursing newborns. Over 30 years, I was usually the only parent that Drs, teachers, leaders ever saw.<p>This was because my wife had babies at home and had environmental allergies; I had the flexibility of self-employment.<p>Caregivers tended to be supportive. Occasionally tho, there were logistical issues with me being a man in women dominated environments.<p>One example: I wanted to monitor my young son&#x27;s speech therapy (in&#x2F;after school), so I could duplicate the teacher&#x27;s methods. Apparently parents never did this and they had to find a hidden spot for me. This still left the teacher+child alone with a man in a closed classroom - which, reasonably, could make teachers less comfortable. A 2nd teacher had to be found to float in&#x2F;out. This was a rare case where I was made to feel like I was imposing but it wasn&#x27;t much of a dad thing.<p>This exception aside, I didn&#x27;t run into a lot of issues. Surprise, yes. Lots of that.')
