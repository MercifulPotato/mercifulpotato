I&#x27;ve casually noticed over the years that a lot of the lists out there combine other people&#x27;s lists - some are more upfront about it then others. That got me thinking, who was the first list to block domain X? That is where this website comes in.<p>A lot of popular block lists are hosted on GitHub, so that made it really easy to clone the repo and do a full history import of the project. I made a little script that could walk the git history and generate a JSON file containing all the unique versions to import [1].
