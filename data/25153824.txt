But I&#x27;m not sure what the solution to that is...do we open the Covid units up to visitors and ignore the consequence to spread from doing that?<p>Unfortunately, the politicization has turned this issue into a binary decision with bad outcomes on both ends. I think there is a place for people to engage in a more &quot;normal&quot; life even in the context of the pandemic...but it&#x27;s hard to define that space in 2020.<p>Also, in my view, the covidiots aren&#x27;t the people that wish they could be with their sick or dying relatives&#x2F;friends. Those are the people that absolutely refuse (as a matter of principle) to do the bare minimum to help contain this...or worse, the people who pack clubs, parties, etc fantasizing that his pandemic doesn&#x27;t really exist.')
