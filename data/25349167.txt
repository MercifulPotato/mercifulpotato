Usually I have to run all of the above 3 when working, so I end up using OS tools to &quot;freeze&quot; the process of whichever &quot;browser&quot; I am not using at the time, but it causes problems.<p>I would be super happy if I could run several similar engines under one main process, I don&#x27;t care as much about security concerns when I&#x27;m developing my own software, and would not mind some &quot;intraprocess security holes&quot; if I could reduce my memory footprint like that and then turn it off when I want the &quot;security holes&quot; to be closed again.')
