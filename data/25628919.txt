Item(by='smcl', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609749364, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25628141, text='&gt; Health care isn&#x27;t socialised, it is a mixed-system (almost nowhere has a &quot;socialised&quot; system...even the UK,<p>&gt; the most effective systems are mixed like the US system...Germany, in particular, is known for having fly-by-night<p>&gt; private doctors who will do all kinds of crazy shit if you give them enough money<p>I think that&#x27;s missing the point a little bit - when we talk about the UK and Germany having &quot;socialised&quot; healthcare this usually refers to the fact that it&#x27;s not primarily provided by a mishmash of private insurers and private hospitals run as businesses for profit, but by the state as a service for the populace. It <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> mean that there&#x27;s not also a small private healthcare market for the wealthy to get quicker treatment in fancier facilities or to get unusual or elective procedures. One side effect of this is that there’s basically no anxiety about losing your access to healthcare if you lose your job or choose to quit - it’s just not part of the equation. This is the main point being made here. Oh and I think we should be very careful using the words &quot;effective&quot; and &quot;US system&quot; so close together in a sentence when talking about healthcare :-)<p>There <i>are</i> interesting examples of countries who have &quot;mixed&quot; systems though - Netherlands (where the healthcare company I work for are based) and Czech Republic (where I live) both have a sort of hybrid system of a market of health insurance companies in tandem with govt funding. And while ČR&#x27;s isn&#x27;t particularly spectacular, NL is very highly regarded worldwide. Frankly I&#x27;m a little surprised that those who are against M4A or single-payer don&#x27;t ever cite it. Could be because the government still contribute more than the private insurers.')
