The company reduces pay for those who move because it assumes they&#x27;ll accept that reduction based on the difficulty of finding a better paying job while working out of that new location. It wouldn&#x27;t even surprise me if the big tech companies actually colluded on these market discounts to keep wages low, given the wage fixing lawsuit a few years ago. If Google, and FB both cut your pay 30% for moving to Tulsa then employers can keep a lot more of their money and their people.')
