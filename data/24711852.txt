Does a phone dialer have &quot;squares&quot;? If you explain it that way it&#x27;s nonsensical because there are squares on a chess board and there are not squares on many phone keypads.<p>Those of you who are trying to turn the flaw of this question into a joke are perfectly demonstrating two things: hiring practices in our industry are a joke to many of the people conducting interviews, and your thinking is so weak that you are unable to unambiguously explain this question without resorting to the chess analogy.')
