It&#x27;s because they are trying to &quot;protect&quot; users from themselves, which so conveniently means taking control away from them.<p>Many will argue they don&#x27;t need or want that control --- but that also has consequences for those who do, as the minority slowly gets squeezed out; and when users realise how much they can&#x27;t do anymore because of these restrictions, it will already be too late. That classic Franklin quote has gained a new meaning in these times.')
