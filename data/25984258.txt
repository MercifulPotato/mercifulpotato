You don’t short companies that aren’t already failing or other investors will happily buy your shares and you’ll be the one squeezed out.<p>&gt; I would die happy if I saw Exxon or BP go to zero.<p>The underlying company would actually need to go bankrupt for this to work. A bunch of shorts can’t sell a bunch of stock an expect it to wipe a company out. Otherwise the company will just continue on and the shorts will bleed out payments or even worse, just buy back all of its stock an go private, really screwing the shorts.')
