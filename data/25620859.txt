I personally think of the Earth as just a means to an end (intelligent, conscious existence). I find little inherent value in an Earth that isn&#x27;t collapsing but which has no (human-level or greater) intelligent, sapient entities. And no inherent value in an Earth without any sentient entities.<p>My personal ultimate goal is to simultaneously reduce the suffering of sentient life and allow it to flourish throughout the universe. The Earth itself is just a necessary container for it for the time being. It&#x27;s an inanimate hunk of molecules. Blow it up for all I care, and all the plants and archaea and bacteria and such, if beforehand every human and non-human animal can be safely transported or teleported to another celestial object or structure which supports animal life. (Obviously this is extremely unrealistic.)<p>Is the best way to preserve sentient life the elimination of sapient life? It&#x27;s one way, but I don&#x27;t necessarily think it&#x27;s the best way. And that&#x27;s not even considering the utility one might attribute to the total number of sapient entities and how it might compare to non-sapient ones.<p>Also, practically speaking, it&#x27;s probably easier to convince enough people to address the problem of ecological destruction than to convince everyone on Earth to never reproduce. If both turn out to be impossible, then I guess that&#x27;s just how the story goes.')
