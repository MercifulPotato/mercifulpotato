And glow-in-the-dark radium watches, and telephones.<p>Having lived through these (in a rural area, things came a bit later than in the big cities) my mother-in-law was unimpressed by the movies about Buck Rogers rocketing around the solar system and Dick Tracy&#x27;s video wristwatch, taking them as just things that hadn&#x27;t made it to her town yet.')
