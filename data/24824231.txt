Item(by='DavyJones1983', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603095096, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24823069, text='&gt; I picture you decrying the same thing about the telephone, in 1949 when the us government sued at&amp;t &amp; forced them to sell off Western Electric, the maker of telephones. And again in 1959 when Carterphone was created &amp; AT&amp;T sued, forbidding anyone else from connecting their own devices. It&#x27;s just a telephone! What harm is there in consumers being forced to use only no-fuss officially endorsed solutions. You can say whatever you want, do whatever you want, as long as you say it &amp; do it with an AT&amp;T product.<p>Get over yourself. Your repeated Strawmans are while amusing quite disingenous.<p>&gt; There are limits to innovation &amp; diversity, &amp; when left to rot, when too protected, systems ossify &amp; stagnate. Beyond the scary platform wars afoot, I think Linux has absolutely cutting edge drivers in some places that can do things absolutely no other tech out there can. DMA-BUF &amp; PipeWire are in early early days but already showing incredibly promising zero-copy streaming that few if any can replicate, for example.<p>I am sure they are very good. We aren&#x27;t talking about those though.<p>&gt; Linux drivers push advanced features to devices that mainstream support has moved past years ago, while increasingly offering best of breed implementations of cutting edge features &amp; rapid adoption of Vulkan standards &amp; extensions.<p>I don&#x27;t think you know what you are talking about. OpenGL and Vulkan are specfications for a graphics API. If I wrote a driver for Amiga OS 4 that implemented the Vulkan API then I could play games that use Vulkan on that system. I think<p>&gt; The other topic worth mentioning is systems like Stadia, which is Linux based. Maybe that wasn&#x27;t necessary, but it is a strong indicator to me that Linux is an interesting &amp; worthwhile place for gaming. That there&#x27;s interesting stories of system utilization &amp; decreasing latency that no other platform could have provided. New frontiers are possible, because the platform is not closed, and that enables new interesting gaming to emerge.<p>Stadia was google&#x27;s attempt to get into gaming pie and it hasn&#x27;t worked. Their streaming technology didn&#x27;t actually provide what was promised. Thing &quot;latency&quot; was terrible and made games unplayable due to network latency. It was all a bunch of lies.<p>It could have been running &quot;Google Magic Kernel&quot; and it wouldn&#x27;t have changed things because latency in this situation is still bound to the realities of network it is connected to, the physical world.<p>I don&#x27;t think this is the best example of what you are attempting to argue.<p>After this discussion with you, I am quite sure you have no idea what you are on about.')
