It’s likely that some of those issues are related to my unit and individual fit, but I’m back to Shure SE215&#x2F;SE425 and their black foam tips (which achieve very similar overall attenuation without active NC[0]) as my go-to in-ear headphones.<p>For over-the-ears I have fairly old (and virtually unbreakable) Sony WH-1000XM3; when their battery goes I would love to give Apple another chance but the price tag makes it hard to justify.<p>IMO to any audiophile&#x2F;sound engineer familiar with the brands mentioned by eertami the price of Apple’s new AirPods would indeed appear outlandish.<p>[0] Measurably so: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rtings.com&#x2F;headphones&#x2F;reviews&#x2F;apple&#x2F;airpods-pro-truly-wireless#comparison_348" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rtings.com&#x2F;headphones&#x2F;reviews&#x2F;apple&#x2F;airpods-pro-...</a> vs. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rtings.com&#x2F;headphones&#x2F;reviews&#x2F;shure&#x2F;se215#comparison_348" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rtings.com&#x2F;headphones&#x2F;reviews&#x2F;shure&#x2F;se215#compar...</a>')
