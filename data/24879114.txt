What are the odds that the domains and companies and projects that use this have built their online presence just to pwn your computer for the lulz or that they have been compromised by a malicious actor without being detected at the same time you run the installer, and no one anywhere said anything?<p>How about if instead we exercise critical thinking and make our own assessment of the risk and act accordingly? Why would you choose not to pipe a shell script from a site you don’t trust but execute their installer instead?<p>If you don’t want to pipe it, download it and read it first.')
