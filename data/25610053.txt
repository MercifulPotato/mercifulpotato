When advanced manufacturing become cheap, generic and small scale you need less capital to create and design important hardware.<p>&quot;UX-ification&quot; of advanced programming practices or democratisation of software creation capabilities. When advanced software design, composition and implementation becomes cheap, generic and scalable you need less capital to create&#x2F;design&#x2F;implement software and to be in control of the software you want&#x2F;need.<p>When those things come together the importance of capital will greatly diminish for some vital parts of life. It will not solve all problems but some. And maybe create other problems. But it should at the very least greatly impact &quot;important&quot; problems.<p>The &quot;UX-ification&quot; of software creation is the part where software engineers can be part of.<p>Disclaimer: Perhaps I have a naive assumption underlying all this - the idea that increased flexibility eventually &quot;will lead&quot; to apparent simplicity. But isn&#x27;t living organisms kind of a proof of this? The amount of complexity that an animal needs to understand to continue living and reproduce is dwarfed by the complexity of the animal itself. Well, also cars and computers.<p>Something like that. Maybe. Goodnight.')
