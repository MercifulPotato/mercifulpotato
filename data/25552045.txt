Words turn ideas into a network of associative meanings that already exist and may fix them in stone once you get used to it. This happened to me many times so I got a habit of asking a lot of questions first rather than verbalizing ideas asap, and then using handmade verbs&#x2F;adjs&#x2F;nouns to describe thin differences.<p>As a russian classic said, feelings and emotions turned into words lose their power. Like a deep overwhelming emotion if analyzed and verbalized may turn into “I like her feet” if you didn’t use&#x2F;know approriate terms or concepts before.')
