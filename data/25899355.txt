The goal is to build hype and thus market cap that Tesla can use to build factories. Ten years ago, Tesla had <i>no</i> factories (at high capacity). They&#x27;ve had absolutely ridiculous velocity since then precisely because of their ridiculous valuation. Even if this FSD thing doesn&#x27;t work out, it might have been necessary for Tesla to get this far. If Tesla&#x27;s stock crashes, they still have the factories. All they need is to make sure nobody can prove Elon knows he&#x27;s full of it (securities fraud). His Twitter persona suits this strategy to a T.')
