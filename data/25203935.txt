Making the CPU&#x2F;GPU fans vibrate in a way that sends encoded bits. Blinking the screen to emit electromagnetic waves. Transfering certain data patterns between RAM and CPU so fast that they produce oscillations, effectively converting the BUS into a GSM antenna that can emit arbitrary data over a regular cellular network. Turning the fans off to change the heat signature in a way that transmits information.... Or even simply bliking a light to send data through regular lightwaves?<p>Scientists discover new ways to exfiltrate data basically every other year, how can you be so certain you&#x27;ve thought of every possible way?')
