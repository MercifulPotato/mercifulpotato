You’d need lamp posts every 50 feet on both sides of the street. Which we definitely don’t have.<p>I live in the peninsula in the Bay Area in a rich neighborhood. If there is that many cars on the street here in a place with $2mil+ homes then there’s no way it’s gonna work in other areas as well.')
