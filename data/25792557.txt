Right now the worst offender for me is IBKR for egigh I get ~10 ads per day on YouTube despite both being linked the the same IP&#x2F;email&#x2F;device&#x2F;browser as he service.<p>Likewise with Amazon showing you an ad for a product you literally bought minutes ago as if you&#x27;d want to buy another before the first arrives or LinkedIn recruiters trying recruit you to your current role.<p>Specialty equipment like for photography&#x2F;cycling or 3d printing is the worst. Buy a Sony camera or Peak design tripod and you&#x27;ll get ads for the same thing for a year. Like accessories and complementary products I&#x27;d understand but come on. Just how many thousand dollar cameras do you expect me to buy per month&#x2F;year?!')
