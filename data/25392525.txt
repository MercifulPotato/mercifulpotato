Do you think it&#x27;s in the Constitution that you have the unalienable right post any lie you want to YouTube?  I don&#x27;t remember that being in there.<p>IMHO, lies are toxic to free speech, and it&#x27;s in everyone&#x27;s interest (and moral obligation) to do their best to limit their spread.')
