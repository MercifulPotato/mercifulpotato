Push down to accelerate, lift up a little to maintain current speed, lift up a little more to start slowing down, lift off all the way for maximum regen.<p>It takes a week or two to unlearn the habit of &quot;popping&quot; your foot off the accelerator anytime you want to coast without necessarily slowing down, but after that it basically feels like your right foot is directly connected to the speedometer in both directions.')
