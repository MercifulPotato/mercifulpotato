Or they are drawing on a pension while doing food delivery gigs on the side to top it up to pay for essentials?<p>I&#x27;d suggest a useful definition of &quot;unemployed&quot; for the purpose of evaluating if there&#x27;s a problem is: &quot;needs a job but can&#x27;t get one&quot;.<p>That covers retired-but-not-really people, and students who need to work for a living at the same time but are between jobs.  But not children, or students with enough to live on from their parents.')
