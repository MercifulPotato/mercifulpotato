Try to commit any act of mass murder with it and you’ll fail. It’s unreliable, and you won’t be a let to reload. An semi automatic weapon is going to be far more lethal. Also the odds of someone with the know how of how to use one and committing to it is extremely low.<p>The argument always comes up, well someone could commit an act of mass murder with xyz do limiting firearms won’t do anything. And yet, it absolutely will. Firearms are the path of least resistance by a long shot for the goal. So limit that path and it’s much less likely people will do it with anything else.<p>Just admit you like your guns more than you want lower murder rates')
