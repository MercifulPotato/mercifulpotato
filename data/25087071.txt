I&#x27;m OK with my 16:9 43&quot; monitor because it&#x27;s so big I get the vertical real-estate but my thinkpad feels as though it&#x27;s really only useful for watching 16:9 videos which I don&#x27;t do.<p>If 2021 is the year of 16:10 for Thinkpad, then I&#x27;m hoping 2025 is the year of 3:2 and maybe hopefully sometime in 2030 we&#x27;ll be full circle back to 4:3!')
