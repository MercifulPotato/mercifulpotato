KDE 2 was the tick of the tick-tock of KDE 2&#x2F;3. KDE 5 is the tock of the tick-tock of KDE 4&#x2F;5. At least that is how I&#x27;d describe it (Intel been tock-tock-tock&#x27;ing the past years notwithstanding).<p>I have fond memories of KDE 2&#x2F;3 and GNOME 2. I also ran KDE 1 and GNOME 1 back in the days (initially GNOME cause of RedHat Linux and the license issues with KDE). If you compare them to Windows 9x and early NT they were quite good.')
