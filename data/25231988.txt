This is evidence that corroborates what the employees told the NYT. Now you&#x27;re at &#x27;concrete evidence&#x27;. What would that be? That someone yelled racial slurs at employees and then handed out signed receipts? The coinbase &#x27;prebuttal&#x27; doesn&#x27;t concretely dispute much either, it says you&#x27;re going to see some stuff in the NYT that&#x27;s &#x27;hard to read&#x27;. If anything, it&#x27;s striking how little both pieces disagree about the employees&#x27; allegations.')
