I imagine usually not.<p>Not that I&#x27;m aware of, neither do I know in general which and how many women consume similar media in general. My impression, and I&#x27;m not feeling very confident in suggesting this is correct or representative, is that women in general rather like to talk about sexuality related topics with their friends, or for example check out guys together on Facebook etc and not so much look at nudity in a magazine.<p>&gt; Honestly, we might have to agree to disagree<p>I&#x27;m totally fine with that. :-) I&#x27;m not on a mission here, just trying to explain why I feel this is rather an overreaction, and how my cultural background might play a role here... Yes it came from playboy, but the image on its own barely hints at that. At least I never made the connection and only learned about it from the HN comments a few years ago, I think from an IOCCC entry that used that image in some way.<p>&gt; If this was just about nudity being fine, I am not seeing many naked men in tech.<p>I&#x27;d be absolutely fine with someone using a cropped face from a Playgirl model as a counter weight. :-)')
