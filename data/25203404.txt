At the very least, you probably don&#x27;t want your estimate to be in {-1, 0, +1} after seeing one element -- you want it to be that element instead. The conditions required for this to converge are incredibly strict - it&#x27;s cool from a theoretical standpoint regarding the memory usage, but I wouldn&#x27;t use it as anything in practice.')
