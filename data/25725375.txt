You know you’ve come up with a good visualisation when it feels so instantly familiar.<p>I’m trying to think of how you can convert some ancillary information with color (with accessible fallbacks of course). Maybe color coded users? So you could see the same colors gravitating around threads.<p>I’m not sure how many unique users comment on an average thread though and how useful that would be. Maybe only showing unique colors for users with more than 2 posts in a thread?<p>I love it though. Great job')
