I write my blog posts with handwritten HTML because that is how I began writing blog posts many years ago when Markdown was not as popular as it is now. Indeed I never omit any optional tags while writing my blog posts or blog layout.<p>I am not necessarily recommending that one should omit the optional tags. However, it is worth noting that the option to do so while conforming to the HTML5 spec is there. The &quot;certain conditions&quot; are not really much to worry about. I think they are drafted quite carefully and are quite sensible. If one is writing simple HTML documents, say, for blog posts, text-based articles, etc. one can safely omit the optional tags without running into issues due to the &quot;certain conditions&quot;.')
