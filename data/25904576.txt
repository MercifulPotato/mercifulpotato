I&#x27;m not sure what this will look like eventually. :-) If you have specific ideas, please do open an issue on GitHub for some brainstorming!<p>&gt; any plans to suppport `##` or `# #` (for pep8) similar to rust&#x27;s `&#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F;`?<p>Unlikely. To generate documentation, we introspect the loaded module and also walk the abstract syntax tree. Python&#x27;s builtin AST does not include comments, so there&#x27;s no easy way for us to access them. Honestly, I think the &quot;&quot;&quot;docstrings&quot;&quot;&quot; convention is reasonable enough and widely adopted in the Python ecosystem. Is that missing any use cases?')
