They collect intelligence. The FBI investigates domestic federal crimes, mostly child porn, domestic terrorism, and white collar crimes, among a lot of other things. The NSA has a more foreign directive and focuses on national security. The DEA focuses on the war on drugs.<p>A big problem I&#x27;m noticing everywhere is that, while we have access to all of this information on how the government works, no one exercises their access to that information before commenting on internet forums and spreading misinformation and doubt about our DEMOCRATIC institutions. Even if you don&#x27;t elect the person who heads these agencies, you do elect the person who appoints those heads.')
