Those were the cause for the actual demise. Elop did his own bad by going Windows Phone instead of Maemo but that&#x27;s another story.<p>Nokia did a very good move in 2008 by acquiring Trolltech (Qt). And then they screwed it royally: instead of immediately started launching phones with Linux and Qtopia (which was mostly ready for mainstream market), Nokia kept launching Symbian phones.<p>They had this plan to use Qt as the migration platform from Symbian to Maemo. That was a good plan. Except they could have started a lot earlier: why were the Nokia N770, N800 and N810 only tablets and not phones, when what everybody was asking for were phones?<p>Because back then Nokia middle management would internally destroy any attempt to actually improve or replace Symbian with a serious alternative. Symbian ruled. That&#x27;s why the first thing Elop did was to fire (outsource to Accenture) everybody working on Symbian. It was a blunt way of saying: &quot;you no longer are Nokia, you will no longer decide what this company does&quot;.<p>Everybody was very excited about Maemo back then. While it was no iOS or Android, there were A TON of developers (and companies) looking into migrating their Symbian apps to Maemo with Qt, or even writing new applications.<p>And Stephen Elop decided to use Windows Phone instead of Maemo. This is what actually destroyed Nokia: Windows Phone 7.5 was released with no support for  C++, which left Qt out, which meant you needed to rewrite your app from scratch. That was the single defining moment where 99.9% of app developers decided they would rather go Android or iOS, and Nokia was doomed from that moment on.<p>As for the comments regarding the little success of the Nokia N9 or Nokia N950, the reason was they were simply not launched in many countries. When they announced the countries where those phones would be available, it looked like a bad joke.<p>By the way, another very stupid decision by Nokia, which shows you the power of the Symbian people back then: the Nokia N900 was released in November 2009 with 256 MB RAM and 32 GB storage for 599 EUR. Back then, phones had 64-128 MB RAM (256 MB was rare) and 512MB-1GB storage. Do you know how expensive was 32 GB flash in 2009??? They could have sold this phone for 400 EUR with only 8 GB flash, which was still a lot in 2009, and it would have reached a lot more public.<p>Really, Elop made the fatal mistake of chosing Windows Phone instead of Maemo. But Nokia had inflicted a lot of damage on itself already. In fact, the only bad thing about Windows Phone was not allowing C++ (and therefore Qt), which rendered all existing apps useless. But Elop probably never knew about this.<p>Oh, and don&#x27;t even get me started on another huge mistake: trying for many years to use Gtk instead of Qt. Nokia lost at least 2 years with that. Guys, Gtk was nowhere near Qt back then, and it&#x27;s even more far apart today!<p>(I was very very close to Nokia, with many friends inside, in those years and was about to work for them when Elop announced Windows Phone would be the next big thing)')
