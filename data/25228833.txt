Retailers who are theoretically in competition regularly band together to force suppliers to accept lower prices. Most recently this played out in both the UK and Australian dairy markets, where supermarket chains collaborated to force the dairy farm prices down. Dairy producers were unable to negotiate better contracts with different supermarkets paying more.<p>So the supermarkets could easily also collaborate to maintain minimum prices on retail goods, and pay their staff more, etc. It suits them to cry &quot;but competition!&quot;, but the competition is optional.')
