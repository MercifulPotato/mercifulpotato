I would say the same about Python &#x2F; Django: You get extensible login&#x2F;signup&#x2F;password-reset&#x2F;etc authentication &amp; user-permissions management, and even an admin interface with user groups, right out of the box. I can put together a web app in &quot;60 seconds&quot; that would take weeks to assemble using the JavaScript ecosystem. Having taught classes on both, I&#x27;d also say it&#x27;s also easier for beginners. Again, might be my own bias or other factors, but it seemed to me that the Python&#x2F;Django student&#x27;s final projects have on average &quot;out-shown&quot; the JavaScript SPA student&#x27;s final projects in terms of features that they had time to complete.<p>This isn&#x27;t to hate on JS, this is just to acknowledge that other languages and frameworks have substantial advantages in many use-cases.')
