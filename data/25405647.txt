This need not be taken to mean that one has to always ride close to the limit.<p>Of course, given that on two wheels, one is not as safe as on four (and also being enclosed in a metal frame). So, naturally the good riders will find ways to ride safely and that includes riding at appropriate speeds. The ones who aren&#x27;t good&#x2F;safe riders are not likely to ride for long.')
