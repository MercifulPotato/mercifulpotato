Twitter has absolutely no information on the reality of XJ at all, so it is in no way qualified to block the account for misinformation, when it had no way to assess to correctness of any information about XJ. Western anti China propaganda is not a reliable source upon which to make determinations about factuality. Closing out voices that dissent to that propaganda line does not a more diverse, inclusive and open free press make, and does not help correct the lack of factual information.<p>If the Western public wants to inhabit a fantasy world with regard to China, and exclude pro China voices, even if that&#x27;s comfortable, it&#x27;s to the detriment of the West. It&#x27;s to the detriment of national security. I&#x27;m not for war, but the West seems to be, and this torrent of propaganda doesn&#x27;t help their goal... If you&#x27;re going to act like China is your event, at least know your enemy. If conflict and competition is the goal, living in a make believe fantasy world about China with stories that sooth your wounded sense of superiority, will not assist you. As Pompeo said, this sort of information control is about fake moral righteousness. It&#x27;s funny, but also sadly appropriate, that he&#x27;s also been one of the biggest hawkers of this controlled fake narrative.')
