If you are going to tell a Father he can no longer gift a gun to his Son, or a Husband he can no longer gift a gun to his wife (or vice versa) well you are not going to get wide support for that.<p>&gt;BTW, using a term like &quot;Gun Grabbers&quot; might appeal to those who agree with you, but isn&#x27;t going to convince anyone on the other side or in the middle of a topic.<p>Well in times of universal deceit telling the truth is a revolutionary act. I call it like I see it.  After decades and decades of &quot;common sense&quot; gun reform, it is clear that people that advocate for said things will never be appeased until private ownership of guns is prohibited.')
