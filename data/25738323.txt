Out of the Box, the web is quite a nice experience with Brave, which is not the case with any other browser I know of.<p>Brave <i>does</i> have ads in the browser&#x27;s empty tab. I&#x27;m fine with that, if that&#x27;s how they monetize it. I&#x27;ve even clicked on a few because they were interesting to me, which I haven&#x27;t done in years on any other platform.')
