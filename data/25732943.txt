There&#x27;s not anything inherently devious about making that information public, but you can&#x27;t just view that in isolation. 99.99999% of people have no use for that information. If you&#x27;re publishing just that person&#x27;s address without comment, you have infer the intent from the circumstances. Nobody on Parler is sharing her address to show that she&#x27;s an honest politician actually living within her district. The implication of sharing just one person&#x27;s home address with people who hate her is to encourage malfeasance at such location. I think this implication would have always existed.')
