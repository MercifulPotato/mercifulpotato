I did read more when I was younger.<p>I enjoyed many of the Halo books (there are a couple duds in there too), which lead me to other books authored by Eric Nylund. I like his writing style, even though he has more fantasy elements to his stories than I would typically like but it somehow works. <i>A Game of Universe</i> and <i>Mortal Coils</i> are some that I have read.<p>I also read some of the Splinter Cell books. They were ok from what I remember, but probably only good if you liked the games. Tom Clancy has some good books (the Splinter Cell game books are ghost written). I remember <i>Rainbow Six</i> was a good one.<p>You could also try non-fiction adventure books. Since they are set in areas you are not familiar with, your brain still has to build the environment and imagery. Something like <i>One Man&#x27;s Wilderness</i>. I enjoyed that book. I used to read and listen to books like <i>Hatchet</i> and this was along the same lines but non-fiction. I&#x27;d also say to be careful about these. For me, it makes me want to quit and live on a farm.')
