The cheese plant pays for this sort of thing too. It simply isn&#x27;t entirely in the cost of the cheese itself.\nIf things aren&#x27;t getting properly handled, unfortunately that is a political issue with legal solutions.<p>Having someone slice the cheese at a counter comes with its own risks: Have they cleaned properly? Are they treated fairly? Is the price going to go up because now places need a staffed deli, sinks, and equipment? Will it be just deli products or is everything in the grocery store going to be more expensive to pay for this extra stuff? Heck, what sort of impact is all of this stuff going to have on the environment?<p>I&#x27;ll add that no matter what, we all are paying for things that we, personally, don&#x27;t do, haven&#x27;t consumed, or disagree with. It is part of living in a society. If you buy a pair of pants, you are covering the cost of theft and loss. If you go to the doctor, you are paying for other people&#x27;s care in addition to your own (heck, that&#x27;s what health insurance is). You may or may not feel you get much back for your tax money, which is really dependent on where you live in the world.')
