A more extreme example is a messaging app. Will not having iOS support for a messaging app lose you 40% of your users? No, it will lose you 100%.<p>In WireGuard&#x27;s case it&#x27;s maybe less obvious than messaging, but if WireGuard doesn&#x27;t work on macOS, it&#x27;s enough to have one Apple user in your whole organisation in order to make it a non-viable solution.')
