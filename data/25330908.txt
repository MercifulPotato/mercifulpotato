If the hardware dramatically changes, the way this new hardware is programmed will also need to change radically. But as long as the hardware doesn&#x27;t radically change (which it didn&#x27;t so far for the last 70 years or so), programming this hardware won&#x27;t (and shouldn&#x27;t) radically change either. It&#x27;s really quite simple (or naive, your pick) :)')
