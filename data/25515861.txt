But in a nutshell if something is pure it should support substitution. For example:<p>let x = 123;\nlet y = (x, x)<p>If you substitute x into the pair you get the same result. So far, so good.<p>Now consider:<p>let x = [1, 2, 3];\nx[0] = 5;\nlet y = x[0]<p>If you substitute x into the body of y you get a different result! The meaning of x[0] changed underneath you. We are very conservative and say that anything which touches an array is impure. Is this the best solution? no- but it is a reasonable&#x2F;sound start.<p>(I am one of the authors of Flix).')
