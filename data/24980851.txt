Ironically, this happened because I got scammed on Amazon a few times. I figured if I was gonna get scammed, I might as well save a bit with eBay, and it seemed a bit more reliable. Then Aliexpress came out even cheaper, although shipping times are sometimes insane.<p>Aliexpress also has real human beings. I got scammed there once too, and the result was human, efficient, and chaotic (partial refund, on a product worth $0). All-in-all, it was a lot better than talking to Amazon&#x27;s recently-useless reps, or eBay computers.<p>What&#x27;s odd is Amazon had amazing customer service just a couple years back.<p>And if I need quality&#x2F;genuine, I order direct from the vendor most of the time.')
