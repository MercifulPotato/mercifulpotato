Item(by='phaus', descendants=None, kids=[25149342], score=None, time=1605775052, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25147290, text='&gt;Halo&#x27;s trick was to sloooow the action down.<p>I agree that the action was slower, however, Halo&#x27;s real trick was designing a set of weapons that were fun to use, but were mostly horribly inaccurate. The sniper was the clear exception.<p>I did a controller VS mouse&#x2F;keyboard competition with Halo 1 on PC vs the best console Halo player in my Battalion when we were deployed to Kuwait. We would both use the same weapons at the same time for most of the games to make it fair and objective since we were doing it out of curiosity. We were mostly even with the majority of the weapons. With the shotgun the console player had a clear advantage although I don&#x27;t know why because I would have assumed a mouse would still be faster (maybe it was just me). When we were using sniper rifles, however, with my mouse and keyboard vs a controller it was like playing against someone that had never played Halo before. The mouse was just too quick and accurate and at that point Halo hadn&#x27;t developed a really egregious form of aim assist yet. The funny thing about this last observation was that I was the one that had barely ever played Halo.<p>Note: I don&#x27;t look down on people that prefer gaming on a console and I have enjoyed my Switch&#x2F;PS4 immensely. For some genres an analog controller is objectively superior without purposefully implementing a software advantage to balance things out like many games choose to do with aim assist. I do tend to agree with Shroud&#x27;s opinion that when it comes to competitive play at a certain level of MM rank they should just have separate queues for each controller type. Ultimately its a tradeoff though because if queues for a game like COD:Warzone were forcibly separated the game&#x27;s community on PC would have died completely after a month or two like previous games did.')
