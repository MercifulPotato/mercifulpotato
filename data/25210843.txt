It&#x27;s neat that it only allows you to create valid Regexes (I hope it does). At least you have static safety that your parenthesis for capture group are properly closed.<p>This advantage is not explained. Not being able to construct invalid regular expressions is a good static safety guarantee that you don&#x27;t get when you embed DSLs as strings.<p>Edit: This is the same reason why we would prefer jOOQ to embedded String-SQL, if speed&#x2F;dependencies are of no concern. You&#x27;re not allowed to construct invalid SQL as the java-type-system gives you these guarantees when using an embedded DSL instead of a String-DSL. This is very powerful, but of course only works if the type system of the host language is powerful enough.')
