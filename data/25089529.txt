Do you have anything that isn&#x27;t 5 years old, and that doesn&#x27;t try to talk around the issue by redefining terms?<p>What I mean is that when I think of when I would say &quot;the ocean is dying,&quot; I&#x27;m referring to things like declining fish populations, coral reefs dying off, and the oceans themselves getting warmer and more acidic.<p>These things are undoubtedly happening.  We have measured them, and we are causing it.  Your link seems to say something like &quot;the ocean isn&#x27;t dying, because we still <i>can</i> do something about it.&quot;  I&#x27;m not particularly concerned with this &quot;ocean health index&quot; they mention.  I am not concerned with what we &quot;can&quot; do; I&#x27;m only concerned with what we <i>are</i> and <i>will be</i> doing.  And, at this rate, what we are doing is not enough.')
