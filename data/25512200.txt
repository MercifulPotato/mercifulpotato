Item(by='blitblitblit', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608676577, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25511995, text='&gt; Two new Web browsing alternatives widen the field of browser choices for Linux users. The recent introduction of Microsoft Edge for Linux, and the Dec. 8 release of Vivaldi version 3.5 offer the freedom to experience a Google-free vehicle to navigate the Internet.<p>Sorry, but that the &quot;Google-free&quot; claim is just BS. Both browsers now run on the Google Chromium engine, and no matter how much lipstick you can put on a pig, it&#x27;s still a pig. The only few independent browsers right now are Safari (Webkit) and Mozilla Firefox (Gecko), both of which are struggling in market share because everyone in their mother is creating their own Google rebranded browsers. There&#x27;s also Goanna &#x2F; UXP which is forked from Gecko Pre-Servo, but in the grand scheme of things there are very few Google-free vehicles left to navigate the Internet.')
