In The Problems of Philosophy [0], Bertrand Russell summarizes this phenomenon nicely<p>&gt; At first sight we might imagine that knowledge could be defined as &quot;true belief.&quot; When what we believe is true, it might be supposed that we had achieved a knowledge of what we believe. But this would not accord with the way in which the word is commonly used. To take a very trivial instance: If a man believes that the late Prime Minister&#x27;s last name began with a B, he believes what is true, since the late Prime Minister was Sir Henry Campbell Bannerman. But if he believes that Mr. Balfour was the late Prime Minister, he will still believe that the late Prime Minister&#x27;s last name began with a B, yet this belief, though true, would not be thought to constitute knowledge. If a newspaper, by an intelligent anticipation, announces the result of a battle before any telegram giving the result has been received, it may by good fortune announce what afterwards turns out to be the right result, and it may produce belief in some of its less experienced readers. But in spite of the truth of their belief, they cannot be said to have knowledge. Thus it is clear that a true belief is not knowledge when it is deduced from a false belief.<p>[0] (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wmcarey.edu&#x2F;crockett&#x2F;russell&#x2F;xiii.htm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wmcarey.edu&#x2F;crockett&#x2F;russell&#x2F;xiii.htm</a>)')
