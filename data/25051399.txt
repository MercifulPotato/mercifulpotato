Employers don&#x27;t &quot;deserve&quot; Google-level programmers for half the salary that Google is willing to pay. And I&#x27;m sure they would love to get great talent at reduced prices just like you would love to get great salary regardless of your talent and contribution to the business.<p>The market salary happens when both parties work to advance their self interest. &quot;deserving&quot; has nothing to do with it.')
