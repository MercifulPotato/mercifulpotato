Because I still regularly encounter educated people who can&#x27;t tell the difference between free speech and threats, harassment, etc. If you can&#x27;t distinguish between free speech and coercive speech, then you don&#x27;t understand the free-speech position that you purport to oppose (&quot;He who knows only his own argument knows little of that&quot;).<p>I recall a thread on cancel culture a few months ago where virtually everyone on the pro-cancel-culture position were arguing that free speech ideals were meaningless because threats and harassment are also free speech ergo you can&#x27;t oppose cancel culture without also opposing free speech--of course, threats and harassment <i>aren&#x27;t</i> free speech, and this is precisely why free-speech proponents oppose cancel culture.<p>It seems like this is one area where <i>more</i> debate can be genuinely enlightening.')
