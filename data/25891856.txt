But I did use RT before making Filmulator, and I still use it in conjunction occasionally.<p>RawTherapee does no photo management. Filmulator does.<p>RawTherapee has many ways to achieve a given result, with tons of flexibility, but gives little guidance as to what&#x27;s best for what. Filmulator only has one tool for each job, and is much less flexible overall—but it&#x27;s easier to learn.<p>RawTherapee can edit jpegs and tiffs. Filmulator only edits raws.<p>The UI philosophy for Filmulator is to never add things before making them fully usable and easy to learn. I like to point to the cropping tool as a significant pain point in RawTherapee that I was able to implement more elegantly in Filmulator.')
