Previously all my interview prep was on tech and I pretty much winged it for the behavioral stuff since interview prep guides seem to always focus on the tech side.  Plus it always feels worse and more obvious when you struggle with or fail to properly answer the tech questions.<p>What I did is I prepared 10 different stories about my career experience and then tagged them with a bunch of prompts.  For example I have a story about one project that had dual PMs that experienced a lot of scope creep and eventually fizzled on release.  I can now use that story to answer a broad range of questions from failure to various project management approaches.  Overall I now have prepared stories to answer probably 50-75 different questions immediately.<p>Another benefit is that I have also told these stories multiple times in interviews now and I get better telling them each time. Even if the answer isn&#x27;t 100% relevant, I feel more confident and likely come off better launching immediately into a detailed story about my experience rather than trying to awkwardly come up with an answer on the fly.  It is also easy to drop irrelevant parts or expand on specific details when the basic framework of the story is already something that feels natural.<p>I will even have the document with all the prompts and story bullet points open whenever I am doing phone or remote interviews.  I could probably even create a cheat sheet to use for in person interviews since I usually would bring an executive style notepad with me anyway to interviews to jot down notes about the company.<p>Maybe this is obvious advice, but I think I am relatively smart and never done it previously or even seen this approach recommend so I am guessing there are other people who could use this tip.')
