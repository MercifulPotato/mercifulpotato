It seems to help my team catch up on stuff I am working on.<p>I got this idea from dask dev notes [1]<p>Its amazing how  every day&#x2F;week  history of project can help new comers.<p>It also helps getting your team members reach out to you.\nWhen I used to work in office a lot of people used to reach out with problems and I loved solving them. There was a freshness to these problems<p>But in remote scenario when I joined a new team, no body knew my strengths and I missed those times. But I think a log of this kind can help people know your abilities and give you more opportunities to solve problems outside your routine context.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.dask.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.dask.org&#x2F;</a>')
