We recently bought a base model car, and without any sort of subscription, the car is connected to always-on cellular as such that the car can be <i>started</i> from a phone app.<p>Another manufacturer I bought a few years ago had similar capabilities, but only included a couple years of access to it before a subscription fee was involved.<p>My guess is car manufacturers can get a pretty special rate for cellular plans that are almost certainly IPv6 only and have extremely low&#x2F;restricted usage for car telemetry.')
