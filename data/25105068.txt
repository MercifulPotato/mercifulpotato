I celebrate its strong parts like being a great first language and maybe, if you know what and why you are doing, great language overall in some specific situations.<p>My comment was mostly against trying to pretend that Python is fast, which it is definitely not, and everyone who knows another language can very easily prove it to themselves and to the world.<p>Regarding this specific library... Redis is not really very useful to a Rust program, because one usually loses performance by using it, instead of gaining some (which would be the case for a Python program). One would either use native data-structures for simple things (read, where Redis would be useful) or a &quot;real&quot; database if something more complex is needed.<p>If working with Redis (and its dump files) was some real priority, the rustlers would come up with something with equal quality to the python library you linked. Maybe something like this, but for Redis dump files: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;serde-rs&#x2F;serde" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;serde-rs&#x2F;serde</a>')
