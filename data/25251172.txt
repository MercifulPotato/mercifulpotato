Item(by='ramraj07', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606716890, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25251128, text='This article assumes a ton of prior context for sure, and it does make conclusions, I&#x27;ll say it&#x27;s very nuanced and actually gives an acceptable and agreeable summary of why India is the way it is due to everything happening in the past half century. If that&#x27;s the goal of the article then there&#x27;s definitely going to be much that has to be glossed over. It&#x27;s also actually very well balanced (as much as any opinion piece can try to be) in its criticisms on both sides of the political spectrum.<p>Anyone who&#x27;s spent some time knowing about Indira Gandhi and Manmohan Singh can walk away from this article with more context on what role they might have played in Indian history.<p>The same can be said about many articles in Bloomberg about American politics, but I suppose everyone&#x27;s assumed to be fully versed in the EC system in the states since US is the place to be or whatever. Perhaps the best course of action is for Bloomberg to produce articles like that about everywhere and let the interested parties look up bg info elsewhwee. Otherwise every article about India has to then do Emergency in 70s 101 which sounds pathetic.')
