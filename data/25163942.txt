However, there were also some early adopters who didn&#x27;t mind the syntax but really wanted the benefits. That&#x27;s why we didn&#x27;t push for types adoption, we allowed teams to adopt (or not) at their own pace. Once people saw the benefits, they wanted more of it. Syntax also stopped being a huge concern.<p>Quoting from the blogpost:<p>&gt; - Developers get used to Sorbet syntax over time<p>&gt; ...<p>&gt; Our main observation is that developers enjoy Sorbet more as the typing coverage increases.<p>On the editor integration, the funny thing is that VSCode is the only editor that <i>needs</i> a special extension to integrate with Sorbet. The way Sorbet supports editors is via the built-in Language Server Protocol (LSP) mode which can be used with any LSP plugin for any editor. I know people who are using it with Vim, Sublime Text, etc. Integration is, in a nutshell, running `srb tc --lsp` as a subcommand and piping data in&#x2F;out via stdin&#x2F;out. Our tool Spoom actually uses the same LSP mode to provide extra developer tools and analysis on top of Sorbet.')
