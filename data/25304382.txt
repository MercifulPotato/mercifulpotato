I just know some of us old guys hang around here.<p>And FWIW I agree with you.  I&#x27;ve been a 15 year reddit user (and employee!) but if old.reddit goes away, I suspect my usage will go <i>way</i> down.  The good news is that the current execs know this, because I have told them.<p>But at the end of the day they have to do what&#x27;s best for the business, and I&#x27;m afraid those of us who like the old interface aren&#x27;t large in number.<p>Edit to add:  I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;ll kill off the old.reddit interface.  I think they&#x27;ll just stop updating and more and more things won&#x27;t work there, like i.reddit.com.')
