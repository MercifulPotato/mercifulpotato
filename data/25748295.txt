You neither want to implement nor use it. You never know if it&#x27;s working. With Mumble (TCP and UDP, both can be used for voice) and Teamspeak you know that when you connect to a server, your connection is working. With WebRTC you only have a vague idea, since HTTP is working, but that doesn&#x27;t mean much.')
