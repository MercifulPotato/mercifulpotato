As a business you don&#x27;t want to be in a position where you have to give excuses or negotiate. Hypothetically, the EU or some crazy US senator can say Visa is endorsing CP (even if it&#x27;s not 100% true, but is good for the senator or EU parliamentary image), that they will engage in a full investigation and there is a possibility of facing sanctions. Now Visa has to activate a PR and legal campaign that can last years.<p>It&#x27;s better to just cut off that single website from the customer list.')
