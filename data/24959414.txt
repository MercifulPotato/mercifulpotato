I hate chiclet keyboards, but I know that not everybody agrees. On the other hand, I can&#x27;t imagine that anybody finds these 1990&#x27;s style low-contrast LCD matrix displays pleasant to read. I&#x27;d sooner use an actual old-school typewriter.<p>There appear to be some e-paper solutions but they&#x27;re expensive.<p>Honestly I think I&#x27;d rather go the George R R Martin route: take an old laptop with decent screen and keyboard then install a barebones environment. It could be as simple as booting straight to a full-screen vim&#x2F;nano with no distraction installed.<p>I wish I could do something like that for coding, unfortunately when I program I usually need a browser and internet access to browse docs so I can&#x27;t remove that. Maybe I should see if I can survive with only elinks or some low-featured web browser.')
