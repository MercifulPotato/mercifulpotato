I tried to address your point about too much competition within Android in a later edit; that basically Android is a world unto itself, with multiple major players trying to distinguish themselves.<p>While Google tries to address this by centralizing everything to their services app (which is a nice Open Source solution since it can be swapped; we&#x27;ll see what happens with Huawei), some vendors still want to claim their turf. I thought that has been getting better, but for the past few years I&#x27;ve found it best to buy Google&#x27;s version of whichever product, and have been very happy with them (perhaps since I&#x27;ve become more conservative, the crazy pace of innovation lives on in the mainstream Android world, with Apple waiting to see what&#x27;s sticks before they include it).<p>I don&#x27;t &quot;blame&quot; people for buying iPhone, it&#x27;s certainly a safe choice, but even though I&#x27;m not that demanding I just find iPhones to be too limiting (that is partially a Raskin vs Englebart thing). Oh yeah, and Google&#x27;s on-device AI features are actually useful. However, in the long run Apple is developing a vast closed world akin to a monopoly that will create problems (and if I hear that cheesy default ring tone again or see another film&#x2F;tv person pull out an Apple device which are the minority in use, I&#x27;m going to lose it).')
