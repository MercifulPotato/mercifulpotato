I am just going by the average production and price for california bearing acreage in California from the USDA and CA department of food and agriculture link I posted. This is an average, so it makes sense that there would be a spread.<p>Regarding the price, the ~$2.5 seems to match other sources I found [1]. That said, I understand any processor bonus&#x27;s aren&#x27;t included in this, so YMMV.<p>I have experience with other nuts, but not almonds, so I will have to take your word for it regarding the high end yields. That said, when talking about water policy and the impact on farmers, I think the mean is the most important number.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.merlofarminggroup.com&#x2F;almonds&#x2F;California%20Inshell" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.merlofarminggroup.com&#x2F;almonds&#x2F;California%20Inshe...</a>')
