Also even not that big project on Kubernetes that includes internal software will also have a lot of other software.<p>Let&#x27;s speculate: I had a look at some teams I know and how they work (or they would like to work soon) and it&#x27;s easily 15-30 images in a CI&#x2F;CD pipeline. Plus tools used to develop, but not exactly released in a build (source code management, PM, communication etc). All teams I know have 2-3 cycles developed at all times (next release, hotfix, future release after the next one). This means a lot of these tools are multiplied by 2-3 (upgrading tools as well, so multiple versions of same tool needed). If you have a few clusters that have different requirements it can also be multiplied by 2 or 3.<p>I would not dare to think what would happen if someone used &quot;latest&quot; tag in their daily work, or organized a docker&#x2F;kubernetes workshop for new people :)')
