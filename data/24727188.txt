These are plentiful.<p>Additionally, you enable responsiveness in other ways server rendering can&#x27;t accomplish with an SPA. You can display loading status of async resources, you can optimistically display changes so the user can begin editing another piece of data without waiting for latency-bound UI, etc..<p>Finally, &quot;simpler&quot; is a hard sell. Simpler for who? Someone who is writing a simple HTML data table page? Yes. For someone who is building a collaborative graph editor? Give me a break.<p>This is my point this whole comment thread - the anti-SPA crowd here sometimes hates JS and browsers so much they are willing to completely sacrifice user performance inside application use-cases because they find the idea of an SPA unappealing. It&#x27;s pretty absurd, facile really, to claim &quot;it&#x27;s faster AND simpler&quot;.')
