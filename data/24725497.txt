The neural ODE integration is super cool for example. There are also other applications where you might need to calculate higher order gradients or even do forward-mode autodiff, and Flux is first rate there. But I too have had problems porting state of art models in Flux, due to speed and memory issues. The developers are doing an amazing job but only have a fraction of the resources of pytorch or tensorflow. But that will never change unless people adopt and contribute.')
