Keep in mind that Flash wasn&#x27;t just solo indie devs--I used it personally on teams of up to 25-30 people for Facebook games and knew people working on much larger teams.<p>Battery life wasn&#x27;t really a thing I worried about before smartphones came along, so I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s super relevant (although, if you want to pick that fight, Unity on mobile is a real battery killer). Security was rough, but I think I&#x27;d trade a bit of security to ditch the walled gardens we have today.<p>I do think things are better in <i>most</i> ways for users. Because Flash portals didn&#x27;t require a download, it was MUCH easier to try new things. This led to a virtuous cycle of people making weird shit. Because so much game content is gated behind app stores these days, you have to download a thing and then wade through permission&#x2F;notification screens and it&#x27;s too much of a cognitive burden compared to &quot;oh, that looks neat.&quot;  (Toss on that app stores are horrible for discovery). I think the way most people discover (mobile) games these days is through ads, and if a game is running ads they&#x27;re a large company with plans to extract $5-$10+ out of you...<p>So we&#x27;ve traded big catalogues of free games with crappy banner ads for walled gardens that depend on ads for discovery of exploitative IAP skinner boxes.')
