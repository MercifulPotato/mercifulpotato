They do not, in fact, fact check, get statements, or give their subjects a chance to respond, at least not consistently.<p>When Nathaniel Popper wrote a hit piece substantially targeting me personally he (and NYT&#x27;s fact checkers-- if they exist&#x2F;were-involved at all) diligently avoided having any communication with <i>anyone</i> who could possibly contradict his narrative, including, of course, those he targeted.
