The idea with Oklab is to avoid having to know what luminance the eye is adapted to, by treating all colors as if they are within the normal color vision range basically. Makes it simpler to use and more predictable to use, but makes predictions in the extreme ends worse than it would be taking knowledge of the viewing conditions into account (given that you can do so accurately)<p>E.g. linear ramp for near black values would not be good if you are in a dark room, only viewing very dark values full screen on a monitor (so there isn’t anything bright around to adapt to)')
