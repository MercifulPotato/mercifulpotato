Ignoring the whole political and social aspects of a complex problem is hand-waving a lot, there are different pressures to be considered, different avenues of solutions and even more with housing that is: expensive and has a long turnaround from permit -&gt; completion.<p>But sure, tell every single young person that the solution for them on the next 5 years is to sit down and demand more housing built. What do people do while that&#x27;s happening? Allow AirBnB to extract money and rent-seekers to gouge prices for the population?<p>That&#x27;s not how the real world works, I&#x27;m sorry.')
