That sounds crazy&#x2F;impossible today, but on lets say, a 2000 year timespan could we get there? 2000 years ago, &quot;Thou Shalt Not Kill&quot; was a seminal idea, eventually resulting in the world today where killing is demonized and this is existence proof of a solution. We can then abstract to the general class of game theory coordination dilemmas stuck at backstab&#x2F;backstab, of which both covid and climate change are instances. The will&#x2F;power of billions of people outweighs the power of a few (regardless of how concentrated the wealth is as wealth is an abstraction), and the internet offers a means for billions of people to coordinate. I conclude that the needed points of leverage are available today&#x2F; right now and simply awaiting a great leader to recognize the opportunity, figure out the play and execute it. And the way ideas spread online, I bet the world can reconfigure itself in not 2000 years, but 20 - a single business cycle.')
