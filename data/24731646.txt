This is possible because of SOEC operating temperature ranges which wouldn&#x27;t be possible with a PEM cell.<p>I should also add that on the other end of the hydrogen energy cycle, production SOFCs are about 60% efficient at converting hydrogen to electricity, not 45%. And the temperatures of the waste heat are high enough to efficiently convert to electricity, bringing total electrical efficiency up to the 70-80% range. Oh, and they can use hydrocarbon fuels too.')
