However, it does tend to construct a story that is reviewed and conceived entirely by liberals. This is by the very nature of academic research and the people who inhabit it. Especially in non-STEM fields where truth is a very subjective matter.<p>A clearer example is Economics, where people from certain schools of thought will actively consider what is taught at other schools as indoctrination.
