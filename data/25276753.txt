They are primarily <i>management</i> companies instead of owning a portfolio of real estate.  If you see a Hilton logo on the side of a building, it doesn&#x27;t mean that Hilton actually owns it.  The logo is there because they have a long-term <i>contract to manage</i> the hotel for the real owners of that property.<p><i>&gt;Amazon: we don&#x27;t need to own retail stores or inventory</i><p>Amazon isn&#x27;t a totally &quot;virtual&quot; company.  Amazon owns (or leases) physical <i>distribution centers</i> instead of retail stores.  They&#x27;ve always paid sales taxes based on nexus of those DCs.  What&#x27;s recently changed (circa 2017?) was collecting sales taxes on behalf of 3rd-party marketplace sellers.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.quora.com&#x2F;Do-hotel-chains-like-Hilton-Mandarin-or-Marriott-own-their-real-estates-and-buildings" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.quora.com&#x2F;Do-hotel-chains-like-Hilton-Mandarin-o...</a>')
