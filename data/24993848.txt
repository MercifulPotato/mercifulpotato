It would stop us from destroying the environment we live in, attacking and exploiting each other over greed, raping each other due to a lack of sexual gratification (or whatever reason rapists rape), and all the other evil deeds we commit.<p>&gt; When there are more men than women, women are much less likely to have casual sex. The majority sex (in this case men) competes for the minority sex (in this case women) and the minority sex calls the shots. When there is a female majority in the population, women compete for access to mates with casual sex. Whereas a male majority competing for access to scarce women compete with long-term commitment.<p>It doesn&#x27;t have to be an either or. It isn&#x27;t a binary switch from men require mates to females require mates. During the transition phase we might actually reach that &quot;equality&quot; certain groups like to preach about. Why would you be against that?<p>Also, the article doesn&#x27;t describe all men as being in need of sex robots. In fact, it doesn&#x27;t mention any study estimating the percentage of men who might be interested in these robots. The number might well be in the single digits and just like non-heteros, they will always be around.<p>Anyway, in my opinion, what people do to themselves or other unforced, uncompelled, consenting, sentient and intelligent creatures without creating immediate dangers for non-participants shouldn&#x27;t be anybody&#x27;s business.')
