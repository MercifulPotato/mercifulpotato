Item(by='gitgud', descendants=None, kids=[25666726], score=None, time=1609986776, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25666375, text='&gt; <i>there are some vocal blind people who don&#x27;t want websites to be able to know that they&#x27;re running a screen reader at all, for fear of discrimination</i><p>This makes sense, it&#x27;s probably not a good idea to give that information to the website. It would only make people using screen readers more vulnerable to scams.<p>Similar to how &quot;scam callers&quot; work. If a &quot;scam caller&quot; rings someone and an older person answers the phone. The fact that they can hear an older person, means that they have found an easy target, and can use specific tactics to take advantage of them (techno jargon, etc..). If they don&#x27;t have that information, then it&#x27;s much harder for them to use specialised tactics to manipulate people.')
