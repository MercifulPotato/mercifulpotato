During covid lockdowns, a few ISPs &quot;temporarily suspended&quot; their data caps - and magically, the infrastructure did not collapse. So any excuse that data caps are necessary is completely invalid. They exist purely out of greed. It&#x27;s insulting that these same ISPs took government broadband rollout money and pocketed it.')
