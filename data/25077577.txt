I thought that newegg had pretty good coverage for motherboards, and they make it easy to filter by CPU type, whereas I don&#x27;t think eBay does. I just tried searching eBay for &quot;intel 2011-v3 dual&quot; and I did get<p>it&#x27;s worth checking out supermicro site itself \n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.supermicro.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;products&#x2F;motherboards&#x2F;server-boards" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.supermicro.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;products&#x2F;motherboards&#x2F;server-b...</a> just select the platform processor series, check which board seems the best fit and then try if searching that on ebay yields any results<p>&gt; &gt;this motherboard seems like a really bad choice, because it&#x27;s for a workstation not a server - doesn&#x27;t have vga out, does have audio output and doesn&#x27;t have IPMI<p>&gt; I don&#x27;t need audio output, so that doesn&#x27;t make a difference to me. VGA output would be convenient, but it&#x27;s also pretty easy to fix with a cheap GPU. IPMI would have been nice, and some readers have pointed out to me that SuperMicro has IPMI on a very similar board, so I should have gotten that one.<p>I agree - you don&#x27;t need audio output, but you&#x27;ve paid for it. That was my point. You could&#x27;ve saved on all three things by choosing the right motherboard. (edit: 3 things - integrated audio, dedicated gpu, kvm)<p>&gt; &gt;i&#x27;d also go for a better powersupply than bronze - at least gold, if that thing runs 24&#x2F;7. The return of investment is like ~2.5yrs depending on the PSU (at least in my country)<p>&gt; Does that assume the server runs under load 24&#x2F;7? My CPUs are at very low load most of the time.<p>basic PSU calculators can help you - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;outervision.com&#x2F;power-supply-calculator" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;outervision.com&#x2F;power-supply-calculator</a> -- just fiddle with cpu utilization and computer utilization time and you&#x27;ll see<p>also you might wanna check bios what mode you&#x27;re running - if performance or eco or whatever (honestly not sure if workstation MBs are different in this regard, i am dealing with server MBs only) but you might be running on higher TDP than you think anyway')
