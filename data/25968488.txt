An argument can be logically invalid but with a correct conclusion.  The role of logical fallacies is to point out unsound reasoning.  They donâ€™t demonstrate veracity or lack thereof.<p>Regarding the <i>appeal to authority</i> fallacy you mentioned.  I personally do not believe this is a fallacy.  I do agree that the <i>appeal to false authority</i> is a fallacy.  We all have to rely on the expertise of others for much of what we believe to be true.  Of course said beliefs might be wrong but relying on expert knowledge is not a fallacy in and of itself in my opinion.')
