The main purpose of a SBC market is to get a general purpose computer for a low price.  The compute, IO, etc. performance is limited only by what you&#x27;re willing to pay.<p>E.g. the 4Gb Jeston Nano has a lot of compute power compared to a 1Gb RPi, but the price of $99 vs ~$30 means it&#x27;s not really an &quot;alternative&quot; as much as it&#x27;s a product intended for a different purpose.<p>You can even get full blown x64 PCs in roughly the same size.  They&#x27;ll blow away any of the RPi line, but at a price.')
