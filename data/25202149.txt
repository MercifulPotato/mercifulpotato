They have a sizable Siri team in Boston and a good friend of mine interviewed there. This friend asked a number of questions regarding tech stack and their SCM only to discover what a complete mess it was. It was enough so that he was turned off by it. Again, second-hand account. It leads me to suspect that the struggle has always been to technical issues rather than product.<p>It also might be that Apple hasnâ€™t seen voice control as an area of growth or enhancement to experiences long term. Maybe those who have Alexas and all of its processing capabilities end up just using it for timers and dictionary definition lookups.')
