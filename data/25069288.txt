Everything being integrated right there means less latency, which likely means less need for caching, less stuff stuck waiting in RAM, etc.<p>I&#x27;m not a fan of Apple&#x27;s domineering business strategies, but this SoC is impressive. I have to imagine AMD and Intel will follow up with something similar (a tightly integrated SoC aimed at higher performance applications).')
