It&#x27;s kind of a weird situation because the beat that I made has been floating around the internet for about 12 years now and people have used it a lot and it&#x27;s had 10s of millions of views by now. This overseas manager wants to buy it exclusive. But it has more sentimental value for me and I wouldn&#x27;t want to tie it to 1 person. I even offered a lease agreement but they want it exclusive. I don&#x27;t think they can pay what I would want for compete exclusive rights to it. They even sort of &quot;threatened&quot; that they can easily remake it with some changes and get away with it but they would rather &quot;do it the right way&quot;.')
