Told you so.&quot;\nBut if it really was, how would we know? What would look different?<p>The fact that those who are meant to look out for such things (primarily, the media) are not trusted by one side to do so impartially means that if there really was foul play, their reporting would not necessarily be different. So again, how would you know?<p>To reiterate, I am not saying I think it was rigged. I&#x27;m not American, nor have I ever lived there.
