One time pads are difficult to use and extremely slow in practice because you have to work by hand to decrypt a message. A cipher machine is hard to make mistakes with and can disseminate information quickly in both directions. That&#x27;s why you don&#x27;t load up ships with hundreds of pages of OTPs, you put an Enigma (or modern equivalent ;)) on board.<p>One time pads are useful for <i>espionage</i>, and you can see examples of how they are used here[1]. They took advantage of how most espionage worked (and who knows, may still work!): different channels for sending and receiving. The numbers station read you a short message, and if you needed to send a message back you signaled your handler to meet in person at a prearranged place.<p>The same thing that makes OTPs suck on ships make them excellent for sending short messages to spies. You can&#x27;t hide an Enigma in a walnut, after all!<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cryptomuseum.com&#x2F;crypto&#x2F;otp&#x2F;index.htm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cryptomuseum.com&#x2F;crypto&#x2F;otp&#x2F;index.htm</a>')
