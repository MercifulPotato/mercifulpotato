In reality, life is a tangle.<p>You&#x27;re pushing your taxes because you had a busy quarter at work getting that project out the door. Your pushing your running because you&#x27;ve been overeating due to stress at work&#x2F;with kids&#x2F;etc. Your pushing your personal project because dealing with a personal situation is just too much right now. Maybe you&#x27;re pushing because you drank the koolaid (and who hasn&#x27;t?) that you should &#x27;live life to it&#x27;s fullest&#x27; and be busy every waking second.<p>In general, pushing is I think a crutch that we sometimes need to use, but probably should use a little as possible. In an ideal life, all those things would fit in naturally.<p>I find accepting limits, revising my priorities, and taking freedom I actually have (as opposed to me and&#x2F;or society being trained to not recognising it) to do what feels good is a better approach.<p>Discipline is not in pushing, discipline is in understanding yourself, your environment and setting honest priorities.')
