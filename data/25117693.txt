Item(by='Verdex', descendants=None, kids=[25120640], score=None, time=1605564639, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25117389, text='Yeah, this is a good point.<p>However, I&#x27;m wondering if you can&#x27;t bring things into alignment.  Like, if the IRS wants to get money from you, then all of your financial parts of you need to be considered alive.  And maybe that&#x27;s good enough.<p>Or maybe you could commit libel or slander or copyright infringement such that people will want to sue you for damages, but you&#x27;re not legally able to lose money because you can&#x27;t legally hold money.<p>And from that perspective ... maybe people could pay you to commit slander or copy right infringement and then you can live off of that money until someone shows up who is willing to do the leg work to bring you financially back from the dead so that they can successfully sue you for damages.<p>Really this is more of a thought experiment though.  Like, obviously the government could bring you back if they really wanted to.  It&#x27;s just that they don&#x27;t really want to because it&#x27;s too much work for somebody.  And it&#x27;s sad that there probably does exist a crime&#x2F;civil violation that you could commit such that suddenly it&#x27;s worth someone&#x27;s effort to bring you back.')
