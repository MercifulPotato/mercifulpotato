Item(by='ParadigmComplex', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612192108, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25988890, text='&gt; What are the main downsides to using Bedrock?<p>I address them in this FAQ entry [0].  In my experience providing support for Bedrock Linux users for over a decade, the most notable downside is the resulting complexity.  This is a fundamental result of what Bedrock is trying to do.  There is more to learn, more that could go wrong, and more to wrestle with if something does go wrong. It&#x27;s perfectly manageable for adequately experienced Linux users, but not necessarily for everyone.<p>&gt; I&#x27;m an avid NixOS user, and tend to supply PRs every now and then if I run into problems. If I hit a problem in Bedrock, can I easily do the same?<p>I see two ways to interpret this question:<p>If you are asking whether Bedrock is open to PRs, it certainly is.  Bedrock is a _lot_ of work, and I&#x27;m always grateful for assistance.  Historically, the PRs I&#x27;ve shot down have primarily either been attempts to pull the project in another direction, or ones which break existing functionality.  Those which broaden the list of features [1] or distros [2] Bedrock supports, if clean enough, are usually accepted.<p>If you are asking whether Bedrock plays nicely with NixOS, sadly it does not currently do so [2].  I know at least one blocker for Bedrock with NixOS that I plan to resolve in the next major Bedrock release (0.8.0).  However, I expect there to be many more.  Once I have completed more pressing tasks - sadly, likely years from now - I plan to deep dive into how NixOS works with the aim of getting Bedrock to play more nicely with it.  If any of the many apparently large number of NixOS users here find this problem space interesting and would like to work on it before I get to it, I would be delighted.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bedrocklinux.org&#x2F;faq.html#why-not-use-bedrock" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bedrocklinux.org&#x2F;faq.html#why-not-use-bedrock</a>\n[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bedrocklinux.org&#x2F;0.7&#x2F;feature-compatibility.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bedrocklinux.org&#x2F;0.7&#x2F;feature-compatibility.html</a>\n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bedrocklinux.org&#x2F;0.7&#x2F;distro-compatibility.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bedrocklinux.org&#x2F;0.7&#x2F;distro-compatibility.html</a>')
