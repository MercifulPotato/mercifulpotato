I&#x27;m a big fan of &quot;Do the simplest thing that could possibly work&quot; so I&#x27;m mostly opposed to CQRS except for some niche cases. A CRUD design for an app can scale well enough for most businesses to get into very decent revenue numbers. When you start bumping up against limitations, then you can start to refactor. Until then, the simplicity of a CRUD app can let you prototype and ship faster, as well as significantly boost new dev onboarding time.')
