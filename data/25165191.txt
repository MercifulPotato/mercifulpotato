But hard intellectual property laws are also harmful in blocking (even if temporarily) directions that others may have been likely to also benefit from.<p>A fix might be to assign a small percentage of revenue or profits on ideas protected by IP to a similar equally dispersed fund.<p>That funding would reflect the cost of society to temporarily give up the rights of others to independently discover and monetize protected innovations, and the cost of providing that protection.<p>The idea that the human race inherits open ended physical and intellectual terrain, but that inheritance is unequally divided, seems tragic.<p>I am not in any way overlooking the efforts made to uncover ideas or utilize new resources, or the need for those that do that work to benefit directly from that work.')
