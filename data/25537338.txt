Since then, not one prisoner has voted and its made literally zero difference to anyone. So what, actually, is anyone complaining about?<p>Seriously?<p>Imagine that tomorrow parliament gives prisoners the vote, but not to implimented it for 15 years. Does this upset you so much that you will you emigrate? No?<p>Then why do I have to leave the EU over the exact same thing?<p>The most amazing thing about this to me, is that people hate the EU, really hate it, for literally no reason at all. Then they make up reasons to justify it. And they don&#x27;t even seem to see what they&#x27;re doing. So many people acting completely irrationally. It&#x27;s actually scary. It makes me worry about the future of democracy.')
