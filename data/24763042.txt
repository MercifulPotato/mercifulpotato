This is a recipe for drivers speeding up, and never bodes well for bicyclists or pedestrians who don&#x27;t benefit from the wider spacing when they&#x27;re crossing streets or navigating intersections. In my limited experience, NYC has many narrower streets but is still problematic especially outside of Manhattan, and SF is similar in some parts.')
