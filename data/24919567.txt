And it is pretty safe (as in: if out of fuel while flying, you wonâ€™t drop dead).<p>So yes, the company does show a few videos of flight tests, even though they are not licensed to sell it to be flown by customers.<p>Of course, the real struggle is to find enough customers at this high price point.
