Every mechanic it implements is lousy and half-baked. From the driving, to the shooting, to the looting, to the AI, it&#x27;s just mediocre.<p>Try this tonight: make sure you&#x27;re absolutely alone and shoot someone. A cop will spawn behind you. No AI, no chase, no nothing, just bloop here&#x27;s a cop.<p>The game has destroyed the reputation of this company overnight.')
