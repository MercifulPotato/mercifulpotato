While there is a lot of hype around it, this blog post is unfairly harsh.<p>In particular:<p>&gt;In 2006, RNAi gene silencing was given the Nobel Prize. MIT called it the breakthrough of the decade. I remember everyone being so excited about it! It was the hot topic at conferences and even my graduate school interviews. While RNAi was and always has been a great benefit to researchers its actual application has been extremely limited. Itâ€™s taken 13 years from the RNAi Nobel Prize to bring something to the clinic and even then the two drugs have been a bit underwhelming. According to Google Scholar, papers even mentioning RNAi have been on the decline for the past 6 years. The drug approved in the past few years haven&#x27;t even slowed the decline.<p>The reason RNAi has fallen out of favor, at least for research purposes, is that CRISPR knockouts are much better.')
