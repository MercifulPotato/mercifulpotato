So we match each transcribed word with the video sequence. If you delete a word or sentence, the corresponding video sequence is cut out. If nobody is talking, pauses are represented by dots which can also be edited. The whole application runs in the browser.<p>The goal is to make video editing easier and faster. Of course this is only suitable for videos that include some kind of speech.')
