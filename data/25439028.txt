Consider the fact she has agreed to the giving pledge, giving away half of her wealth to charity similar to Buffett, Gates, etc. Whereas Bezos has not agreed, and I&#x27;m not aware of any time when he has donated billions. That may be the difference but I&#x27;m not sure as I haven&#x27;t really seen any Bezos donation headlines that were negative, or any that I could remember at all for that matter .')
