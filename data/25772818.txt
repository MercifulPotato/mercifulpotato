I&#x27;ve been working remotely for most of the last year (just like everyone else), so I do about 4-5 hours of work in the morning and then spend the rest of the day remodeling the house. But even when I worked at the office, I would roll in around 10am. I&#x27;d go work out at one of the campus fitness facilities from 1-3 (15 minutes to walk there, 5 to change, 1 hour to work out, 10 minutes in the sauna, 10 minutes to shower and change, 15 minute walk back), and then head home at 5. And I always get exceptional year end reviews because I always get my work done in a timely manner.')
