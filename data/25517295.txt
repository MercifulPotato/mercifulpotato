With a market order you are essentially saying to the broker &quot;I want this stock right now, you can decide what the price is&quot;. With a limit order, it seems much harder to pull any tricks.<p>It seems like market orders are, and always have been, for chumps. Robinhood is just being more shameless about abusing them than previous brokers.')
