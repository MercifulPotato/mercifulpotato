If you don&#x27;t plan on diving in completely and just want a single really high end pocket knife go budget $300-$400 (you may not spend it all), survey the landscape and buy what appeals to you most, otherwise you&#x27;re going to sink a grand or two into sampling everything trying to discern the differences yourself.')
