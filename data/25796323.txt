Item(by='_underfl0w_', descendants=None, kids=[25799435, 25796547], score=None, time=1610744162, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25795009, text='You can also trigger wake words like &quot;Ok Google&quot; or &quot;Alexa&quot; by using _harmonics_ of normal human voices that are outside the range of audible sound. The key is that the mic can&#x27;t differentiate between the harmonics and actual speech of normal human pitch and so the trigger is set off, but the sound isn&#x27;t audible to humans.<p>I don&#x27;t have a link to the paper handy (sorry!) but IIRC I found a white paper on ArXiv called &quot;Dolphin Attack&quot; or similar that demonstrated this. It was a fun read.')
