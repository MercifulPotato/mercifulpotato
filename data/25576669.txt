When she factored in stock options for Coinbase’s employees — often an important part of pay at start-ups — the compensation for women and men was roughly the same while the gap between white and Black employees grew to 11 percent.<p>So the pay gap disappeared when options were considered for male&#x2F;female at least.<p>Surely they are looking at this?<p>&gt;ased on an analysis by Alexandra Marr of Coinbase employee and salary data from 2018. Analysis included the 448 salaried employees who were paid in U.S. dollars and who were assigned to a level within the company. None of the manager groups overseeing engineers had more than two women in it so all manager categories are ones overseeing non-engineers.<p>Oh so the data is from 2018? well...<p>&gt; In a statement, L.J. Brock, Coinbase’s chief people officer, said the company started to conduct a comprehensive review of compensation across the company in late 2018.<p>Hmmm....<p>&gt;The data analysis from those cases suggests that Coinbase had bigger wage disparities between men and women than either Google or Oracle. At Oracle, the gap between men and women with similar backgrounds and roles was 3.9 percent according to analysis in the court case against the company — less than half as much as the gap at Coinbase.<p>Very bad sounding!<p>&gt; The numbers in the Google and Oracle cases controlled for factors, such as experience and education, that were not possible in the Coinbase statistics because of the limits of the data shared with The Times.<p>&gt; The Coinbase figures arrived at by Ms. Marr took account of the job level of all employees, as well as their status as an engineer and manager. It is possible that if the analysis took account of more factors, the pay disparity would shrink.<p>Yeah this is a hit piece. You are putting forth a strong agenda and then having to walk it back in case you get called out for it.')
