Some brokers like fidelity have hoards of 401k money and more likely to have 100pct cash for their orders.  Trading brokers like IBKR RH keeps the minimum possible amount of cash with DDTC, and their automated systems adjusted up the minimum.<p>This is more or less like the futures market, except futures trades settle at end of day (when CME closes for an hour at 5pm, and next day starts at 6pm lol) and DDTC is the equivalent of CME<p>Who’s irresponsible here?  DDTC for their lax cash requirements?  Individual brokers that only keeps the minimum required cash?  Futures cash requires 10pct or less, but no futures trader would only keep that much in their account, unless they don’t mind being wiped out and liquidated at end of day settlement (and then deposit more money the next day to trade again).  Brokers cannot risk being wiped out at all.')
