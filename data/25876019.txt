A textbook example of some major fallacies:<p>The first is mistaking your level of desire for something to happen with the actual probability of it happening. It&#x27;s clear he doesn&#x27;t just <i>think</i> web programming is going to collapse, he <i>wants</i> it to happen. And it&#x27;s distorted his estimation of its likelihood. I&#x27;m sure in 2030 he&#x27;ll be making videos confidently predicting the collapse of web programming by 2040.<p>The second is where an expert in one domain considers its complexity to be inherent and unavoidable, while assuming other domains, of which they are ignorant, are inherently simple. Then when they try to engage with those domains, they run into significant complexity and experience the uncomfortable and unfamiliar sensation of being an amateur again. Since the unfamiliar domain is, by their estimation, simple, they conclude that the complexity they&#x27;ve encountered is unnecessary â€” a result of people working in that domain being too stupid or inventing busywork.<p>The third is the mistaken belief that our means will improve, but that our desires will remain the same. So, right now we have certain requirements, and in order to meet them requires us to do a lot of complicated, cutting edge stuff. But soon all that complexity will get figured out, the cowpaths will get paved etc., and we&#x27;ll happily just pushing a single button to do everything we need. The reality is, of course, that our requirements will just get more complicated as well. Human civilisation has been on this treadmill since time immemorial.')
