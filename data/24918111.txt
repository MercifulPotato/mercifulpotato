We take all precautions to shield civilians where practical.<p>In Afghtanistan, the Taliban represented well under 1% of the population(1). In WWII 31% of the German population, and 9% of the American population, were in military service.

In Afghanistan this would be <i>incredibly</i> counter productive, as so few Afghans were actually fighting. But in WWII? When a full 1&#x2F;3rd of the population is in the military - and much of the rest is working in the industries necessary to keep the military running - ethics aside, it&#x27;s easy to see how anything that reduced food supplies would have a direct effect on the effectiveness of the military.<p>1) <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Taliban" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Taliban</a> - reports 60k Taliban &#x2F; 37 million Afghtanistan population = 0.16%<p>2) <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;historynet.com&#x2F;what-percentage-of-the-population-served-in-ww2.htm" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;historynet.com&#x2F;what-percentage-of-the-population-serv...</a><p>3) <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;CombatFootage&#x2F;comments&#x2F;3nla50&#x2F;allied_gun_camera_of_strafing_attacks_on_horse&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;CombatFootage&#x2F;comments&#x2F;3nla50&#x2F;allie...</a>')
