I work for an agency that specializes in both Woo and Shopify and we&#x27;ve counseled certain clients to move to the other platform, depending on their business goals and requirements.<p>Shopify is great for a simple business model with little hands on requirements and pushes towards low friction checkouts.<p>Woo is less optimized to scale out of the box (this can be tweaked to scale easily enough), but you have entire stack available to you. It&#x27;s just PHP and MySQL at the end of the day, so anything is possible. This allows you to build more custom experiences depending on what type of products you&#x27;re selling.<p>Think of a local t-shirt store. They might start on Shopify, selling their shirts for the local sports teams and tourist attractions, but as they grow, they move into selling custom branded clothes using a printer in their back office. They might transition to WordPress to build a more customized checkout flow, where a user can upload various design files (in a variety of formats: svg, ai, pdf, etc), tweak them on a model and then start a back and forth conversation with the shop owner if there are problems. All that can happen in their account and customizable. That sort of custom experience just isn&#x27;t possible on Shopify without jumping through some absolutely ridiculous hoops (hosting a separate API and then running an SPA in your shopify theme, etc).<p>All that to say, it depends :)')
