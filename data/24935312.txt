Thanks to GWT and J2CL it is fun, productive and production ready today.<p>IMHO it is pitty that all those Java main vendors forget the Web Browser as a Platform, because after Applets, Java WebStart, there is no standard solution based on Java on Web browsers. All Web browser solutions are always based on JavaScript and more and more TypeScript.<p>We have definitely some tools and frameworks that embrace Java as a Programming Language on Web browsers like GWT, J2CL, TeaVM, JSweet... but I would like to see Java2JavaScript transpiler as a part of Java distribution.<p>What do you think, Java developers?<p>Thanks and enjoy reading.')
