The little back and forth that may or may not be sharp is what makes these discussions fun (for me at least) in the first place. I think the added danger and possibility for severe personal consequences might end up being a net positive for everybody in the long run, as you can see in Eastern Europe where Stalinism and its restrictions on free speech resulted in a group of people who generally play things close to the chest by nature but have a very rich inner life and are able to contemplate serious or emotionally charged subjects in a way I find most Americans and first worlders in general lack.<p>New negatives in environments always come with new positives in the environment&#x27;s survivors, and I am hopeful that we will all end up with a more thoughtful introspection similar to that which came from &quot;oppression&quot; (I hesitate to call what we are experiencing oppression due to how minor it is compared to gulags.) Some of the world&#x27;s most beautiful literature as well as brilliant scientists have come out of Eastern Europe, I am optimistic that something similar will be the fruits of what is now underway globally with the advent of social media and its soft tyranny over social relations.')
