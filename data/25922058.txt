We&#x27;ve successfully managed to spearhead Gitlab into our giant company, and it&#x27;s slowly making inroads.<p>until this price change<p>And now we&#x27;re looking at alternatives. Sorry, the price hike for our case (~500 devs) is <i>hefty</i>, to the point where we&#x27;re willing to eat crow and go with Gerrit+Jira+Confluence+Jenkins, and basically disentangle ourselves.<p>So like, I guess it makes financial sense in the short term? But definitely will hurt in the mid-long term. You&#x27;ve lost us at least as a customer. And no--we aren&#x27;t going to talk to our account leader about this, or discuss any discounts or anything.')
