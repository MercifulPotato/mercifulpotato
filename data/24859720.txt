A lot of services are massively subsidised for these folks but there&#x27;s a billion of them.<p>The whole Indian railways network is massively subsidized but it&#x27;s doubtful anyone on HN would travel by anything other than air conditioned if indeed they travel by train (eg. I&#x27;ve never travelled by train after i began working).<p>In many states, basic groceries are effectively free. The less well off folks buy from these, the &quot;middle class&quot; shops from private traders. However there&#x27;s a massive number of the less well off.<p>Not saying there&#x27;s no corruption, but the scale of the problem is massive.')
