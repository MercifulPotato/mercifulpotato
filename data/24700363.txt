When I tested the API I was surprised how robust it is to name and address variation. It knows &quot;MLK blvd #101&quot; versus &quot;Martin Luther King Blvd STE 101&quot; are the same address. It also is robust to typos or variation in name like &quot;Village Pizza&quot; vs &quot;Village Inn Pizza &amp; Pasta&quot;. I also tested some of my favorite edge scenarios like two starbucks across the street with similar addresses, and the API knows that these are different places and does not merge them together. This natural ambiguity is what makes address and place data so challenging, and my tests show that the API is achieving something non-trivial. I&#x27;m impressed. The list of launch partners also includes a lot of major platforms (e.g., Esri, Carto). Definitely worth a look.')
