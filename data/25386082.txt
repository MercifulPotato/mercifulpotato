It just makes you different. The problem is society&#x27;s refusal to cater to the workplace needs of people in a vegetative coma state!&quot;<p>All the social model aims to do is think about a separation of the impairment itself and the ways in which society may make it worse.<p>In some cases, sure. Lots of impairments will just be debilitating no matter what. Somebody in a coma is not going to be able to participate in society very much.<p>Lots of counterexamples though. For example, imagine a skilled software developer. However, she needs a wheelchair and she can&#x27;t work anywhere in town because none of the buildings have wheelchair access. A perfectly able developer has been rendered disabled (or at least, unable to work) by this fact. This is somebody who <i>could</i> be working, if we simply build wheelchair ramps or allowed her to work from home.')
