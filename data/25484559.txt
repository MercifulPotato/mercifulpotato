I&#x27;m not proposing some kind of spooky process that can&#x27;t be described in terms of causation.<p>But I am proposing that we should have some skepticism when importing an explanatory style that has worked well in physics and expecting it to perform equally well everywhere.  I think we&#x27;re likely to make mistakes of this sort:<p>If a cat&#x27;s head appears from behind the couch, and then later its tail becomes visible--you wouldn&#x27;t say that the cat&#x27;s head caused the cat&#x27;s tail--they&#x27;re just different parts of the same phenomenon.  We&#x27;re familiar with cats, so we don&#x27;t make this exact mistake, but I think that we are quite susceptible to misapplying causation to things that we don&#x27;t understand well, like happiness.<p>Years ago I had this idea that many of our ideas about causation are flawed in this way.  So I developed a habit of taking a causal claim that seems true, flipping the arrow around, and then testing the mutated hypothesis--just to see if it worked backwards.  I was surprised by how often it did.<p>I don&#x27;t have the data to convince you that the habit of mistrusting my instincts about causation and using &quot;deep down, it probably goes both ways&quot; as a heuristic has <i>caused</i> me to reap benefits that I would have otherwise ignored, but I suspect it strongly enough that I plan to keep doing it.<p>So the difference between the alternative perspectives is that if you&#x27;re skeptical about the universal utility of causal nitpicking, you&#x27;ll learn to recognize when you&#x27;re wasting your time trying to prove that the laws of physics demand whatever you&#x27;ve noticed.  You&#x27;ll bail sooner on perspectives that don&#x27;t work, and you&#x27;ll be more creative about finding new ones.<p>On the other hand, if you demand a certain style of causal argument, you&#x27;re more likely to double down against the opacity of human behavior to other humans.  You&#x27;ll design experiments and write articles that inspire further nitpicking about which is a cause and which is an effect, and the matter will remain in stasis--perhaps indefinitely--where its capacity to positively affect people&#x27;s heath is limited.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that we shouldn&#x27;t try to uncover underlying mechanisms when we can.  When that&#x27;s in cards it&#x27;s pretty great.  I&#x27;m just saying that we shouldn&#x27;t always expect results of that sort to be within reach, and that reasoning from correlation alone can get us further than we tend to let it.')
