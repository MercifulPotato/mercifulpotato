At one of the local schools here any uniform violation means isolation. They take your phone away and you are kept on your own in a room until the end of the day and visited by teachers only to issue work.<p>The student this happened to, my daughter, caused this to be triggered by dying her hair a lighter shade of brown than her normal colour.<p>I found out about this when she  arrived home without her phone because the teacher had left it locked in her desk.<p>She was moved to a not insane school immediately and complaints raised with the school and the phone was collected by me the next day.  Of course all record of all events magically disappeared.')
