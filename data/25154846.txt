I&#x27;ve been on IRC a long, long time and frankly it&#x27;s a garbage heap these days. Forums are slow and chunky with the exception of the Stack Exchange (and even this has its limits.)<p>I&#x27;m not saying real-time, Discord based chat is better, but what I will say is I run a tight ship: there&#x27;s no room for politics, religion, elitism or NSFW. Everyone is welcome and no one is above anyone else, including me and my mods.')
