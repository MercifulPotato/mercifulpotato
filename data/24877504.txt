I have never once felt good about an outburst of intense sadness, crying and panic. The effect it has on those near me is devastating and something I try to minimize as much as possible. We&#x27;ve all had a talk of some form to just not engage with me and know that I&#x27;m not myself. This also limits my motivation to make new friends as I don&#x27;t want that burden for anybody.<p>I suspect my vagueness isn&#x27;t helping, but to be clear I have never had any sort of outburst incident in the actual workplace. I&#x27;m a _very_ non-violent person (never even been in a fight) and prefer logic to emotion when I&#x27;m not too overwhelmed.  I&#x27;ve been &quot;fired&quot; (it was a contract to hire position so it&#x27;s totally fair) once for issues related to depression.<p>As for the suggestions, I think before I was able to do that I would need to tell my employer in some way about my mental health issues and I have never once felt comfortable doing that. There have been times when I could have opened up but didn&#x27;t, and that&#x27;s something I can work on I think.<p>Do you really think that will go well? Just saying - &quot;I&#x27;m so sorry but I&#x27;m dealing with some mental health issues and won&#x27;t be able to attend today&#x27;s meeting&quot;? To be clear, this is something I&#x27;ve desperately wanted to be able to just have the _option_ to do because I very consistently get panic attacks during meetings. I&#x27;m quite good at hiding them but it&#x27;s a deeply unpleasant experience. I&#x27;ve left to use the bathroom several times and people just wait for you to come back because they don&#x27;t know you need to just not attend.<p>I suspect the answer is &quot;it depends&quot;. I&#x27;ve had bosses who definitely would&#x27;ve reacted better to this than others. The search continues.<p>Thanks again.')
