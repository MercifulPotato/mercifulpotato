It is explicitly designed to promote certain freedoms for the <i>user</i>. The producers set and the users set <i>are</i> likely to intersect, which is likely where some of the confusion comes from, but it is not common that they are identical sets.<p>If the corporate world is part of your target audience, then the GPL family, particularly AGPL and GPLv3 (though not so much so LGPL) are unlikely to be good choices. This is true whether you are a solo home developer, or a significant commercial entity, or something in between, yourself.<p>Just like commercial licences, and other F&#x2F;OSS licences, the GPL takes away nothing. It <i>grants</i> rights subject to the grantee agreeing to its other conditions.<p><i>&gt; under reasonable terms</i><p>That is a very subjective thing.<p>If commercial entities won&#x27;t touch something of mine because I&#x27;ve chosen to license it under GPLv3&#x2F;AGPL&#x2F;else, that is only a problem for me if I care whether commercial entities use it. They are free to try negotiate a different licence. Of course I&#x27;m only able to do that for my contributions unless others the project has taken contributions from have legally stated on the record something to the contrary, but that is no different than for a commercial project which has multiple otherwise independent contributors.')
