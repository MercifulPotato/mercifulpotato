You think big pharma likes spending that kind of money on trials?  I’ve been a part of those negotiations with the FDA.  It costs that much because the company says “we believe a 6 month trial is sufficient to prove both safety and efficacy” and the FDA says “if you want it approved, you need to collect 2 years of data”.<p>Now, $10-15k per patient-year is for a typical therapeutic.  And that is an average across global trial sites, not just the US.  It’s not much money.  You go a 15 min doctors appointment and your insurance is billed $150.  Now imagine going 1 per week and having multiple tests run each time.  Or having to stay in the hospital for a day when the drug is administered.  You can burn through $1,000 per month pretty damn quickly.')
