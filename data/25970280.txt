Item(by='Melting_Harps', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612023584, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25970052, text='&gt; Certainly an EV driving experience versus a 55mpg ICE is going to be absolutely no comparison.<p>5 speed properly jetted and carb tuned Honda CRX for MPG or a Geo Metro come to mind to get those numbers and were made in the last century, other than only a K car or 3 cylinder exotic can come close. Did a Smart, which always looked like more like a toy than a car, actually get that?<p>I had an 1st generation CRX in university and that thing was a coffin with 4 wheels as nothing but 2 bodies fit inside. It&#x27;s nothing I would say was ever comfortable by any stretch of the imagination.<p>I got in a bad accident in that thing due to a mechanical failure on the freeway and I&#x27;m surprised I&#x27;m still able to walk to this day as I felt every inch of that metal bend and fold upon impact. Ended up with bad hyper extension injuries to my ankle&#x2F;feet (2 feet in rule in a spin) and vertebrae damage that persist to this day that made me realize MPG is not worth bodily injury.<p>My prius only gets 44 mph with mainly street driving, and its ok but feels like joke when its windy due to how light weight it is.')
