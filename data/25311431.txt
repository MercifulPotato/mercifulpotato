Beneficiary of the system and knows how to navigate all of the social codes.<p>Less elite or poor white:  Takes the bullet that was aimed at the elite white.<p>Asian:  Scores way too high on tests for their % of the population and this is a problem for a worldview that cares about what % of college slots go to which races<p>Professional class black or latin:  Does great, huge beneficiary of CRT activism<p>Working class black or latin:  Invisible and accidentally hurt despite good intentions.  CRT proponents tried to pass a referendum legalizing racial discrimination in hiring in California this year, which would have helped professional class POC and probably hurt this class.  Fortunately it failed.<p>EDIT:  I removed some cattiness above.  Not trying to pull the rug out from under you but I&#x27;m rate-limited and wanted to focus on my actual points.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m a caricature of &#x27;unwoke&#x27; person who never thought about or dealt with these things before.')
