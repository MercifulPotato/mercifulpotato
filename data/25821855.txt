Consequently, this also resulted in a lot more noise on GitHub projects vs projects managed via mailing lists where bug reports are more concise and maintainers are more receptive (at least from my experience with LLVM).<p>I think we&#x27;re still in a transitional period where nobody really knows how to properly run large scale open source projects with low&#x2F;no barriers to entry. Even well-funded projects repos like Typescript, VSCode, React receive more issues than they can close. Stale bot is not perfect but some automation is definitely required for these popular repositories. I suspect some barrier to entry may also required for a healthy repository to filter out the noise e.g. mandatory repository that reproduces the bug.')
