When lockdowns first started I remember seeing _tons_ of first and second hand accounts of all the ways anti-cheating software failed when exposed to the real world.<p>&gt; I imagine it wouldn&#x27;t be terribly hard to run the machines so that only one full-screen window is shown, or a user for whom the internet is disabled. Is that not enough?<p>It can be a little tricky. We put the test in a single full-screen window on top of any other windows, and...the students alter the transparency to view their notes behind it, or they notice that we only check windows in the current desktop or for the current active user. Maybe &quot;full-screen&quot; on the system in question only fills a single monitor and leaves another open for research.<p>All of that assumes that the student is only using a single device and doesn&#x27;t have a hi-def pet silicon rock in their pockets at all times, hence the webcam monitoring and whatnot to check that a student is actively staring at the screen the whole time.')
