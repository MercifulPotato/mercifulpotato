Every time I use one of these it&#x27;s impossible to do what I want to do.<p>Try signing out of one icloud account on a Mac laptop and signing into a different one. You need to open several apps, dig through various random disconnected menu options, click past several warnings, and wait a long long time sometimes (often with no visual feedback that the task you started is done).<p>And I feel like most things in Apple ecosystem are like this.<p>iOS doesn&#x27;t even expose a file system to the users, so so so many of my family members on iOS have no idea where to go once they download a document or audio file or video file to then play it back. The worst part about this is that there is a Files app, but you can&#x27;t save files you download to any folder that app exposes. Why? Who knows??<p>Sorry for getting heated, but I&#x27;ve just had such frustrating experiences with the platform. Maybe someone can give some examples of the amazing UX they have then I&#x27;ll see more clearly why people like it. My instant reaction is to remember all my wasted time trying to do simple tasks with it')
