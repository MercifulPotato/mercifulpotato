(I would put a low barrier to entry in the possibly-harmful column.)<p>It&#x27;s nice that free trades are the new normal and I don&#x27;t think there is anything wrong with payment for order flow, but on the other hand, $7 is just not that bad a price. If you can&#x27;t afford $7 trades then either you are trading too often, or you should stick to paying off your credit card debt and building up an emergency fund.<p>Vanguard&#x27;s UI isn&#x27;t pretty but it&#x27;s functional and not hard to use. How often are you going to use it anyway?')
