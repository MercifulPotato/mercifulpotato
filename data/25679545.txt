I have I think  6  currently with no way to merge (curse of bouncing between countries).<p>Gnucash is as baroque as you say, but the only one of your options above that actually works and solves this problem (aggregate view) reasonably, of course that can&#x27;t help you with things like virtual CC limit above.
