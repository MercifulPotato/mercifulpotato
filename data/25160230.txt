On most applications compile time strings are very few and not need validation. When you need validation of strings you generally need only runtime or both and then why duplicate the runtime validation with another compile time validation that take an alternative syntax?\nThis seems 1) a niche feature \nAnd 2) a feature that users will misunderstand, the only dev I know which read about the feature think it works at runtime. Also I believe that existing template litteral do accept general strings I did a POC a few months ago so that&#x27;s weird but maybe that TS can determine that a string is from runtime and then refuse it at compile time.')
