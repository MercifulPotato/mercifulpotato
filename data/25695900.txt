These companies are very aware of what their customers&#x2F;users think (think of all the data!). It&#x27;s asinine to think that these companies, with corporate boards and a legal mandate to produce profit, would just out some amount of users and reduce revenue. They clearly don&#x27;t think the amount of users they are affecting with these actions are significant enough to damage them, especially compared to the costs of enabling these domestic terrorists.<p>These groups are not some good ol boys looking to have measured debate about monetary policy. They are literally trying to kill elected officials and undermine democracy.<p>More directly, the average voter very clearly seems to care, when you&#x27;re looking at these actions in an economic light.')
