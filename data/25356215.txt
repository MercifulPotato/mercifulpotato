I tried really hard to get iCloud Photo + iCloud Drive to work for my needs. I was not able to figure this out.<p>1) iCloud Photos and iCloud Drive do not work together - this was really surprising to me as I need a file-system based option to be exposed.<p>2) iCloud Photos requires (or did so 2 years ago) that you enable backing up of all photos. I prefer to choose the photos I want to add to my archive and there was no way to do this and use iCloud Photos.<p>Individually the two products showed promise but they are siloed. I did not make it this far but due to the lack of APIs I would not have been able to use Synology&#x27;s Cloud Station to pull down a copy of my library for a secondary backup.<p>In the end, it suited me well to invest a little more time in my solution to further decouple the services that I use. I was using Google Drive, for example, and started having a lot of sync conflicts so I switched to Dropbox with little hassle while still using Google Photos as my viewing application.<p>Really hoping Synology Photos can fill this gap and I can move off Google Photos.')
