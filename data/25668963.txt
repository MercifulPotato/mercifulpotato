Nobody has stormed the Capitol and violently disrupted Congress since the war of 1812, as I understand it. Certainly I&#x27;ve never seen anything like it. I don&#x27;t agree that the protests described are remotely the same, nor with the characterization of the summer protests as &quot;BLM&#x2F;Antifa&quot;. I saw plenty of massive BLM protests, zero Antifa except occasionally on TV. It&#x27;s like calling Redmond WA the town of Microsoft &#x2F; Joe&#x27;s Diner.<p>The idea that it&#x27;s both sides and civil war is coming is certainly a claim of the militant right wing that seeks violence. Nobody else says it that I know of.')
