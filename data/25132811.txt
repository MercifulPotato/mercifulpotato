It has already been used to prove fraud in Iranian elections. \nIt is legally admissible in court of law. It was also only 1&#x2F;4 of my argument. Dr.Shivas analysis isn&#x27;t covering Benford&#x27;s Law. It&#x27;s a completely different vector of analysis that shows weighted anamolies indicating algorithmic manipulation of the presidential choice as a function of a precinct&#x27;s straight party Republican vote.

If there&#x27;s no fraud then the audit should show that to be the case, and we can dismiss Benford&#x27;s as an election fraud detection technique if enough false flags are proven. So, let&#x27;s be scientists about this theory and test it rather than dismiss it.')
