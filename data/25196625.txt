Sydney is alleged to be the most spread out (lowest density) city in the western hemisphere. This is partly because Australian houses are the only ones bigger in the world on average than American ones. Lots of people live in places where public transport has historically been and&#x2F;or remains very poor, so there is a lot of reliance on motor vehicles. We can blame the shortsighted government for dismantling Sydney&#x27;s once vibrant tram infrastructure at the probable behest of the motor lobby, chasing the 1950s American suburban dream. There has however in recent years been a huge growth in cycling as a golf-replacement for middle aged men in lycra (MAMILs) who use it to network and exercise on weekends. I assume this will improve cycling facilities in certain areas of the city only. They should really reclaim the edge of the rail infrastructure as car and pedestrian free cycling lanes.')
