There’s a really great thing happening where more and more frontend work is embracing static site generation, while using tools more commonly used for client rendered content (eg react), but the frameworks then ship tons of JS duplicating the mostly static content of these sites, roughly doubling page size and at least doubling render times.<p>Easy to use, type safe, automatically validated&#x2F;decoded&#x2F;encoded&#x2F;documented interface boundaries. There’s awesome tooling for this and nothing I’m aware of checks all those boxes, at least on platforms I develop on.<p>I’m considering experimenting with solutions for the former, and actively developing a solution for the latter for TypeScript&#x2F;Node.')
