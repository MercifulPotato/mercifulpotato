Item(by='MaxBarraclough', descendants=None, kids=[25777566], score=None, time=1610637906, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25775633, text='I&#x27;m not an academic but I can find a lot wrong with this essay.<p>&gt; Nor would this student need to take very extensive notes since everything done in the lecture is better done in the textbooks.<p>Strongly disagree. As an undergraduate I generally found my lecturers to give a more approachable &#x2F; less bewildering account of mathematical topics than did textbooks. (This is mere anecdote, of course.)<p>&gt; The experienced observer will note that, though the general outlines of proofs are reasonably well done, the fine detail is often tackled inefficiently or vaguely with, for example, a four line proof where one line will do.<p>It&#x27;s teaching material, not a research mathematics publication. The proof should be optimised for approachability&#x2F;intuitiveness, not density.<p>&gt; A lecture takes place in real time, so to speak, with 50 minutes of mathematics occupying 50 minutes of exposition whereas a chapter of a book that takes ten minutes to read may have taken as many days to compose<p>Except it doesn&#x27;t take ten minutes to read. It&#x27;s just not the case that students can absorb new material five times faster through reading than through lectures.<p>Again this seems confused about the target audience. It may be true that for a research mathematician brushing up on a topic they haven&#x27;t seen in a few years, consulting a book is far more efficient that watching a lecture. That&#x27;s not who we&#x27;re talking about, though.<p>I realise page 3 refutes these earlier points against lectures, but it seems to miss a lot of this.<p>&gt; We do not learn to play the violin by playing the violin or rock climbing by climbing rocks. We learn by watching experts doing these things and then imitating them.<p>Not sure about the climbing example. I suspect there are plenty of skilled self-taught climbers.<p>With all of that said it&#x27;s an interesting read, and I do like the taxonomy of types of questions, in the final paragraphs.')
