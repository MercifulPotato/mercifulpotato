So it changes every generation, unlike most of the rest of the world, where a single surname lasts through generations.<p>The point about caste differentiability by surname is still valid, though in a different sense, because the given names also have caste bias.<p>IMO the easiest way to break this cycle would be a widespread campaign to de-stigmatize inter-marriage between castes; that would solve the problem of correlation between name and caste within a generation or two.')
