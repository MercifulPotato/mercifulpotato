As a general rule of thumb, this is something where the gut reaction to any bug report is going to be &quot;you&#x27;re doing it wrong&quot;--the C standard actually provides a lot less guarantees here than most people believe it does. I haven&#x27;t read the verbiage and the bug report in question in enough detail to ascertain if this is true or not, but it isn&#x27;t in the least bit surprising that most people see setjmp&#x2F;longjmp and immediately table the issue as being low-priority.')
