(Note, I never claimed they were illogical, but instead that they were &quot;too logical&quot; Pure logic will not explain why people feel the way they do, because people are not always logical).<p>They then ask:<p>&gt; Can someone explain what this description misses and where the harm comes from?<p>In answer, maybe no harm is actually done. But even so, people will perceive that they have been harmed.
