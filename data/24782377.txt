I remember being in Tel Aviv and running out of Melatonin. I went to a pharmacy and asked for it. The guy, having quite an attitude replied to me, &quot;This is not the US, you need a prescription for Melatonin&quot;. By the way, at that point I hadn&#x27;t even visited the US yet and my english accent makes it clear that I&#x27;m not from the US. Anyway, I really enjoyed the post. I&#x27;m lucky to not have to struggle with insomnia anymore, it can be very painful.')
