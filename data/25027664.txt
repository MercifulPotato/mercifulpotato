Well, if bullies do this, they also do other things, so we need to protect the vulnerable of them anyway. The way I understand it, the secret vote comes from a time where henchmen of the local warlord&#x2F;prince&#x2F; were much more common and secret vote is a defence against organized bullying to votechange. But are we( as in people of western states) still living in such times?')
