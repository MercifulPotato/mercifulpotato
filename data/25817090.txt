The standard linux daemons that used to be the default logging (syslog), scheduling (cron), and deployment (apt&#x2F;yum) aren&#x27;t commonly used in modern cloud shops.<p>Too many developers, linux and other OS primitives are unneeded overhead on their application.  One can write a little cloud formation, or kubernetes yaml and be off to the races while only interacting with linux as part of their build system.')
