It’s now higher, but there was a time you could easily get closer to 0.05% with some effort and nontrivial but not huge volume.<p>Iirc, last I checked, bitmex cost 0.075% to take liquidity, and paid 0.025 to give liquidity (which should be noted, is more than a tick - so, market making on bitmex is free money in an unpredictable market - which has made it technically expensive)<p>INET had a similar incentive structure before they were bought by Nasdaq, as did BATS when it started - it’s a common way to jumpstart liquidity in a new exchange.<p>Robinhood and IB will let you trade for free today (with other hidden and hard to quantify costs related to their order flow transactions instead)<p>So there’s no general solution - the details keep changing - but there’s likely a way to make nice profit of 0.1%.')
