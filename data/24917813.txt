This causes Vastaamo to increase security and close the holes the hackers used.<p>2019 Apr&#x2F;May: Independent security company (not named) performs audit since the company was to be sold. Some improvements were suggested, no major security flaws were found.<p>2020 Aug&#x2F;Sep: Vastaamo receives threat from hacker if they will not pay 40BTC the hacker will release the database. Until they do the hacker will release 100 records per day.<p>2020 Sep&#x2F;Oct: Infosec company Nixu researches Vastaamo systems, reporting that the breach that stole the database was probably made in November 2018, possibly single records in subsequent breaches.<p>2020 Oct: Individuals whose information was not in the already-leaked records have been contacted and extorted individually.<p>After that, in no particular order:<p>* 300 records have been leaked. The hacker seems to have stopped, though.<p>* Single records not included in the 400 have surfaced on \nTOR web<p>* A site on TOR was up for a while with several similarly-named files, one a 10GB tar that is rumored to be database. Partial downloads have been reported. Edit: Also program snippets etc included, with possible &#x27;digital fingerprint&#x27; according to Mikko Hypp√∂nen, a well-known Finnish security expert.<p>* An IP address related to the hack has been traced to Inkoo, Finland.<p>CEO claims the 2020 Nixu report was the first time he heard of the breaches and that&#x27;s why the new CEO or board were not informed -- which seems awfully sus, considering several breaches were made and a reactionary battering down the hatches as well as an external audit were made.<p>Further, people who work or used to work at Vastaamo have come out claiming toxic work environment, threats of lawsuits if they speak out against the company, bad working conditions and a large number of ethical violations (like using as advertisement names and reputation of people who don&#x27;t work for them). It also appears they&#x27;ve been sending social security numbers in plaintext over email. Claims have also been made that the database and system were outdated and only had default passwords and no real attempt at securing the data or even servers have been made, but of course nothing is public yet. Possibly never will be.<p>All in all, looks like the previous owner is a bona fide scumbag with all the bells and whistles that entail. And, of course as is fashionable, when asked about these things his responses have been &quot;I have no knowledge of that&quot; and &quot;I do not recall.&quot; And, of course, affected people have found out about this from the news and not Vastaamo themselves.<p>My heart goes out to the people affected, it takes courage and effort to start working out mental health problems and this has probably been a devastating blow to many.')
