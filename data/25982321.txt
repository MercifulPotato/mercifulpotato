The AZ vaccine has been massively deployed in the UK - I know because several members of my family had the AZ vaccine weeks ago and long before it was approved in the EU.<p>&gt; So, personally, I am glad that the EU did not follow the UK with an exclusivity contract. It would have been a literal disaster for many countries, including the UK.<p>Completely wrong - there is no exclusivity over the AZ vaccine. AZ&#x2F;Oxford have been working with manufacturers around the world to build capacity and it&#x27;s being sold at cost (unlike the other vaccines). Given the lower cost and easier storage it&#x27;s will be hugely deployed in the developing world.<p>The truth is that uniquely, the AZ vaccine&#x27;s development and initial manufacturing was fully funded by the UK government and then literally given away to other countries (including the EU) to manufacture.<p>Many months later, with manufacturing in the EU having ramp-up problems, the EU commission panic about their lateness, spot doses being manufactured in the UK for the UK population and say &quot;we&#x27;ll have those&quot; using a dubious interpretation of their contract.<p>Not surprising we&#x27;ve seen a U-turn today.')
