No, generally the regulations &#x27;protecting&#x27; workers have gone up and up and up.  The nutty expansion of UC in recent months is one example.  As for &#x27;social safety nets&#x27;, for people who learn to navigate the system, there is basically work-free living available.  Between Section 8, SNAP, SSDI, Medicaid, etc, the &#x27;social safety net&#x27; is beyond anything imagined a few decades ago.<p>In addition, your attack on Walmart is lazy and typical.  When Walmart moves into a neighborhood the first group to get hit are whatever retailers already exist in the area--because all the best workers immediately line up to work at Walmart instead.  Better pay, better benefits, etc.  Just a typical case.<p>So, what should you read?  Anything but &#x2F;r&#x2F;politics would probably help some.')
