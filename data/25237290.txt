When you train a VAE, it&#x27;s pretty standard to use a BCE loss, but this is wrong because the data isn&#x27;t binary (i.e. it&#x27;s not a Bernoulli distribution). They define a continuous analogue of a Bernoulli distribution that is supported in [0, 1], and use this as the loss function for training a VAE, which gives them reconstructions that are closer to the input.')
