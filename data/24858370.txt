There’s also work going on to add a new type of DNS record to indicate that the server is h3-capable, which would allow you to connect over HTTP&#x2F;3 immediately, but that’s opt-in, and loads of sites that support HTTP&#x2F;3 will never add that record. So until browsers switch to defaulting to trying HTTP&#x2F;3, HTTP-over-TCP will continue to be used regularly even when HTTP-over-QUIC is supported, and that means plenty of HTTP&#x2F;2 will be used until that time. This <i>could</i> keep HTTP&#x2F;2 alive for a lot longer than the decade I posited. I don’t know how it’ll play out, but I think it will depend on how much browsers decide they want to push HTTP&#x2F;3; if they push it hard and try it more optimistically, HTTP&#x2F;2 will die more quickly.')
