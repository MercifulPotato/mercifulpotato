It&#x27;s easy from a hardware and software perspective to send a command to the webcam to disable itself and turn off its LED. If you want to completely cut power then you need to add power switching circuitry.<p>You could use one of your CPU&#x27;s limited GPIO pins to control the switching but now you probably need a smart power switch (~$0.30, which is significant) since the low voltage (1.2V?) GPIO can&#x27;t handle switching a regular mosfet gate. GPIO writes are usually easy (just write to a memory address), but you&#x27;d still need to modify the vendor driver to do this and then distribute the driver.<p>Motherboards typically have embedded controllers which have GPIO - on desktops there is a SuperIO chip, I believe laptops typically use a regular microcontroller. Now you have some 3.3V GPIOs that can handle gate switching so you can use a regular MOSFET (~$0.10). You still need to modify and distribute the webcam driver, and now it might have to communicate with another driver which is handling the embedded controller.<p>Now you have to deal with the webcam disconnecting and reconnecting as you switch power to it. You want the device to always be present even if it&#x27;s not enumerating on the USB bus, so you can select the webcam in zoom and turn it on and so you&#x27;re not constantly playing the hardware connect&#x2F;disconnect sound - even more driver changes. Maybe the webcam takes significantly longer to turn on now because it has to boot and enumerate.<p>That was all somewhat informed speculation, but I think it illustrates how a seemingly simple thing gets complicated. The electronics industry could easily solve these issues if there was motivation, but there just isn&#x27;t.<p>Edit: Well, I&#x27;m posting this on an article talking about a vendor which <i>is</i> doing the work to make this happen. I guess I should say there&#x27;s just enough motivation to eventually get around to solving this problem in a mature market.')
