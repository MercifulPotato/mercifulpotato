It&#x27;s fair in a very obvious sense, which feels better than other ways of allocating things.<p>&gt; Besides, the idea that it&#x27;s wasted or neglected, it&#x27;s crap. The government has basically unlimited resources. How much money did we borrow, how many checks did we cut in the last 7 months, and what were the implications really? It is never about making the most of a scarce resource, there is never really scarcity. And maybe it&#x27;s not justice either.<p>Apartment space in NYC absolutely is scarce. A lot more people want to move there than there&#x27;s space for; you can move numbers in bank accounts round all day and that will still be true.')
