For family members, they all use Macbook Airs. For me, I have the 2018 MacBook Pro. I also use a Lenovo Carbon X1 and a Dell XPS15. Apple kills the Dell in build quality. The X1C is a fantastic build quality, and the lightest of the 3. But, it does feel like a laptop from 10 years ago. The black with red highlights makes it feel like an AS&#x2F;400. I can&#x27;t knock the machine though. It&#x27;s a solid performer.<p>All this said, I have no idea what the Windows experience is on any of these machines.

I do most work in a Terminal and Web browser, so it feels like almost any environment would do.')
