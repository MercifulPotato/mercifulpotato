Customers are not in the role of ensuring employees are paid, and if we as society accept Doordash et al&#x27;s attempts to push that role onto us, the more we are supporting the abusive employment in the first place.<p>The correct place for this implementation is in legislation or in free markets.<p>If we as society deem it necessary, legislation.<p>If we as society stopped being tricked into tipping as you are suggesting, and the effective wage was low to the point of triggering necessary business changes, the free markets will do their work.<p>Tipping is an entirely broken concept for the deliver model and arguing for customers to tip more or via cash is further incentivizing the model.')
