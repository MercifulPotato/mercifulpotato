If you work in the toilet hardware industry, buy&#x2F;sell stocks related to that industry.<p>I do #1, since consulting generates higher returns than any micromanagement of my portfolio. Perhaps that will change in a few years, as I have more savings.<p>I&#x27;m not sure why anything public ought to generate alpha for me over people who do this full-time. The only place where I have a unique advantage are my areas of professional expertise. I can evaluate the quality and market impact of a development in my industries more accurately than people who do finance full-time, so there&#x27;s some alpha there. It&#x27;s not huge, since most companies do things outside of my area of expertise too. But it&#x27;s better than zero.<p>It&#x27;s worth noting that diversity is important. One can actively trade a small chunk of one&#x27;s portfolio in one&#x27;s own industry. I wouldn&#x27;t allocate more than perhaps 25% of my holdings into areas where I am an expert.<p>And of course, standard disclaimers on insider trading apply. A safe approach is to trade in companies in one&#x27;s own industry, but not in ones where one is employed or has any contracts &#x2F; NDAs &#x2F; relationships &#x2F; internal information.')
