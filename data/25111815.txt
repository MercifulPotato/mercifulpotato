Item(by='sokoloff', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605536011, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25111545, text='I think a lot of the disposable nature is related to the auto repair shop rate being $130+&#x2F;hr to the customer and assembly line labor being $35&#x2F;hr to the manufacturer. (And of course combined with &quot;people like shiny new stuff&quot;.)<p>It also makes me sad, both from an ecological standpoint, but also from a financial standpoint. I see a lot of people making car payments that are $400+ for 72-month loans. (The <i>average</i> car loan length in 2019 was 69 months for a new car and perhaps an even more astonishing 65 months for used cars.)<p>Then, because they have a loan, they have to have expensive collision insurance and maybe even gap insurance. Then, because it&#x27;s an expensive liability they see everyday, they feel like they have to take it to the dealership for repairs (to &quot;protect their &#x27;investment&#x27;&quot;). Some people feel like they need to build a little house to protect it (which needs a curb cut and associated extra land usage), etc.<p>If it were more commonly accepted to drive a &quot;millionaire next door&quot; 15-year old Camry or CR-V, I think we could go easier on the world and on people (maybe except for people who work in the automotive new-car supply chain).<p>Until then, I can be happy that people buy so many new cars so often, because if they didn&#x27;t do that, there wouldn&#x27;t be any cheap used cars for me to buy and DIY-repair to avoid the shop rate and parts markup. :)')
