It seemed as if you were talking about a different book.<p>In the HN comment he says &quot;the Lisp code that Russell and I had online&quot; so I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s difficult to guess it&#x27;s indeed AIMA he&#x27;s talking about.<p>I don&#x27;t think that the book, in any of the four editions, &quot;primarily uses or encourages Python&quot;.

Elsewhere, they provide implementations in different languages: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;aimacode" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;aimacode</a>')
