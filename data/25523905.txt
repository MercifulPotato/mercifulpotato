I was beating on xcode in my comment because it deserves it, but this problem isn&#x27;t confined to xcode and swift. Compiling rust is also extremely slow. The new reddit feels like a slideshow (and despite launching years ago, how have the reddit team still not fixed the performance problems??)<p>We&#x27;re having this conversation in the context of notion. Starting up Notion on my laptop feels like wading through honey. I really want to love notion, but every time I open it and try to do anything I find my motivation tricking away. Notion isn&#x27;t even doing anything impressive with all that compute - its just slow. The sales pitch I make in my head for notion is that its a place to organize all my notes and workflows, but like Jira, living in notion means accepting that <i>I</i> work at the speed notion does, and that feels antithetical to the feeling of productivity I have in snappier, lighter tools like Bear and iA writer.<p>But Notion and XCode aren&#x27;t really the problem. The problem is cultural. It seems to be the worst in the web ecosystem, though its not confined there. My favorite example of all is this issue in web3.js[1]. I can&#x27;t help but play Benny Hill music in my head while I scroll through this 3 year old, apparently unsolvable issue thread.<p>When the new M1 macs came out lots of people were complaining that there&#x27;s no 32 gig variant. Holy cow that is <i>so many bytes</i>. The Atari 2600 had 128 bytes of ram. The NES ran super mario bros in 2kb. Its completely ridiculous to me that our software can even fill 16gb doing everyday computing. Is there a ceiling? Will there ever be a ceiling, or should we expect a document editor in 2030 to sit on 256gb of ram, just because thats how much ram modern javascript frameworks use by then?<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ethereum&#x2F;web3.js&#x2F;issues&#x2F;1178#issuecomment-745694012" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ethereum&#x2F;web3.js&#x2F;issues&#x2F;1178#issuecomment...</a>')
