Given that you are able to articulate an idea useful to many people, there exists prior units of that idea. The only way then to come up with a &quot;new idea&quot;, is to come up with an idea useful only to yourself (plenty of those) (or small groups), or translate an old idea to a new language.<p>The reason for this is that if your adult life consists of just a tiny, tiny, tiny fraction of the total time of all adults, and so if an idea is relevant to more people, odds decrease exponentially that no one thought of it before.<p>There are always new languages though, so a great strategy is to take old ideas and bring them to new languages. I count new high level, non programming languages as new languages as well.')
