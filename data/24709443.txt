Item(by='acabal', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602085918, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24709308, text='&gt; You get the entire GNU&#x2F;Linux desktop for free, so you aren&#x27;t in a position to complain.<p>I would buy that argument if we were talking about some new technology that still has some warts. But we&#x27;re talking about trackpads here. Technology deployed on the scale of billions of units over many decades. At some point users must demand a basic standard of quality for technology that is not only old, but ubiquitous. If libinput shipped a version that randomly duplicated keystrokes on a keyboard, I&#x27;d be the one on the hook to fix it and I&#x27;m not allowed to complain because it&#x27;s free? Really?<p>&gt; This isn&#x27;t kernel development.<p>This perfectly illustrates my point. My day job is not in this sector and I don&#x27;t even know the right place to start looking. And I&#x27;m supposed to fix this in just a day, like any old amateur student supposedly could, otherwise it&#x27;s my fault? Give me a break.<p>Edit: <i>In this very thread</i> we have one user who submitted a kernel patch that <i>possibly</i> might solve this (but who knows), and another user who points to a year-old libinput bug that <i>possibly</i> might be what I&#x27;m talking about (but who knows). Not even the experts agree on <i>where the problem even lies</i>, but I&#x27;m supposed to fix it in a day. OK, right.')
