(<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Lipid_bilayer" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Lipid_bilayer</a>) There are various transporters (ie protein machines) embedded in the different membranes that move specific things from one side to the other. There are also complex transport systems that move packets of things from one organelle to another.

As a concrete example, this is actually one of the ways that viruses know when to &quot;wake up&quot; and start doing things.

If they react with things they aren&#x27;t supposed to then (over generalizing to an absurd degree for illustrative purposes) everything stops working, that organism dies, evolution continues, and one way or another eventually we&#x27;re back at that protein only reacting with the things it&#x27;s supposed to react with.')
