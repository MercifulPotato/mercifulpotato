The entire system power of the M1 mini under load was 28W.<p>What the article is pointing out is that the mobile low-power version of the M1 (as the mini is really just a laptop in a SFF box) is competitive with the top-end Zen3 chip; the benchmark gap is smaller than 2x.<p>We don&#x27;t know yet how far the M1 scales up, e.g. a performance desktop will presumably have a higher TDP and probably trade the integrated GPU space for more CPU cores. But we don&#x27;t known if&#x2F;how this will translate into performance gains. Previous incarnations of the Mac Pro have also used multiple CPUs so it is not yet clear if &quot;in the real word, most Zen3 CPUs will have 2x or more cores&quot;.')
