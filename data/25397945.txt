They generally haven&#x27;t been and still aren&#x27;t. Especially given that so many deaths labelled COVID deaths are of people who were about to die anyway and the COVID label took priority over other causes.<p>All lockdowns were ever meant to do originally was temporarily delay the inevitable to ensure everyone got a hospital bed if they needed one, to give their bodies a better chance. But hospitals were never overwhelmed or even at any risk of being overwhelmed: the places that didn&#x27;t lock down and saw incidence curves the same as everywhere else have now proven that. So in the end they had no real health impact in the positive direction, yet they&#x27;ve definitely killed people. In the UK about half of all excess death in the first wave wasn&#x27;t even COVID related, let alone COVID caused. That&#x27;s the human price of government mandates.')
