There&#x27;s no money to be made building a giant radio telescope. Sometimes corporations have a need for scientific institutions and their patronage helps keep the lights on but I really can&#x27;t think of any way that can apply to something meant to stare at the stars. What could help is designing a radio telescope that have both scientific use and military use like China&#x27;s telescope in Argentina. You have one user willing to pay plenty for time on it and another user that is just happy to get some work done.')
