Thus I try to put mask on when I see someone on the street even if they are far away.<p>I think not wearing masks again will be easy to normalise. For example, Hong Kong got hit by the first SARS and everyone wore a mask for a time, and then when it was over all was back to normal and masks quickly became rare.')
