Item(by='moron4hire', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607127394, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25288535, text='Along this line of thinking (constant improvement), I made a big effort to excise the word &quot;bug&quot; in favor of &quot;defect&quot;  in my speaking patterns. The word &quot;bugs&quot; implies that the issue got in from the outside, crawled into the works. It might even connote that it&#x27;s a natural thing, that it has some sort of agency of its own. A &quot;bug&quot; is nobody&#x27;s fault, unless someone&#x27;s job was to keep the window closed and they failed at that job.<p>The word &quot;defect&quot; is much more accurate. They were always there. That didn&#x27;t just show up one day. They are an inherent artifact of a failure somewhere in the specification&#x2F;design&#x2F;development&#x2F;testing process. Now, we might be generous and forgiving folk and not visit punishment on the person(s) who failed in that process, but that doesn&#x27;t change the fact that it was a person who made the defect.')
