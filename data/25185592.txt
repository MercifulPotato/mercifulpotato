Luckily IKEAs IoT-devices (primarily lights, controllers and switches) use the ZigBee-protocol and are decently priced. I have also used cheap environmental sensors[0] from China that supports ZigBee. I really like the idea of only using components with an open protocol and being able to isolate my IoT-setup to my local network.
