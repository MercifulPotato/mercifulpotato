And I get confused since &quot;mockist tdd&quot; isn&#x27;t really talked about explicility anymore. But I would argue the concept is very much alive as a natural part of behavior-driven development which encourages outside-in development with a focus on writing acceptance test first. So my question is if Fowlers worry from the past, that using mocks and asserting behaviour is focusing too much on the implementation. But like Fowler I haven&#x27;t done BDD &quot;for real&quot; so I haven&#x27;t seen how it plays out in the long term.')
