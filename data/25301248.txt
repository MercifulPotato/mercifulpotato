I have two friends who decided to take advantage of some COVID downtime to learn to code. I suggested they start by doing some HTDP, and they did. Now one is doing a bootcamp and the other is building his own apps. Both are doing Javascript, React, Ruby, a bunch of popular stuff.<p>I&#x27;ve interviewed and hired dozens of junior devs in my career, many of whom had already been on the job for a couple years. Most had only gone through a bootcamp. My two friends are far surpassing what any of those folks were capable of. They are able to understand these modern tools on a deeper level, not just copy-pasting or memorizing parts of an API.<p>I recommend it to anyone who wants to learn to code. Once you know fundamentally how to design functions, you can learn any of the trending technologies that might snag you a job. And you&#x27;ll probably end up with higher quality, higher output, fewer bugs than your peers.')
