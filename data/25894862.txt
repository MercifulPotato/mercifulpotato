But, my impression was that more customers might have switched to Alpha servers (from HP-UX, Solaris, etc) if they didn&#x27;t think Itanium was going to win the market.  It also gave more credibility to x86-64 by sort of confirming that old-school RISC was dying.  Itanium did end up with a heavy stigma, but there was a time when many thought it would be the future.')
