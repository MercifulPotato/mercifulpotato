But maybe not?<p>Bringing it back to the post&#x27;s proof example, what if you had completely nailed every step of the proof such that Anki doesn&#x27;t ask you about it for a while, and then 6 months later, one of the harder steps comes up in isolation:<p>&quot;What is the second adjustment we make in the proof of the ratio test, a &lt; 1?&quot;<p>what if you can&#x27;t remember the first steps? Would having the rest of the context help? I guess it&#x27;s a tradeoff.')
