[...] if you live in Wellington you likely have stopped even thinking about the pandemic most days<p>It would certainly reduce the urgency of take-up, but I would expect there to be a pretty strong correlation between how well a city&#x2F;country deals with the pandemic, and the proportion of residents in that region who think that getting the vaccine is important, even if it&#x27;s a vaccine for a virus that&#x27;s not directly affecting them right at this moment.<p>I live in a region that eradicated the virus a long time ago, but I still think about it almost every day because the world&#x27;s so interconnected. It has had almost zero effect on my personal life since March, but the vast majority of my friends overseas are in unending lockdown cycles, and international news is almost exclusively about the latest death tolls or what the vaccine progress is like. It would be pretty difficult to <i>not</i> know what&#x27;s going on.')
