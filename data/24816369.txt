The new mindset is that any system or procedure where a single human error can cause an incident is a broken system. So the blame isn&#x27;t on the human pressing the button, the problem is the button or procedure design being unsuitable. The result was a huge improvement in safety across the whole industry.<p>In software there is still a certain arrogance of quickly calling the user (or other software professional) stupid, thinking it can&#x27;t happen to you. But in reality given enough time, everyone makes at least one stupid mistake, it&#x27;s how humans work.')
