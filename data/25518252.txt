They don&#x27;t really seem to have grown significantly while both physical memory and address space size have grown massively.<p>I write a bunch of algorithms which would most naturally be written recursively, but I have to go out of my way to make sure they have enough stack. Is there a good reason not to give the main thread of every program on a 64-bit OS 1GB of virtual address space?')
