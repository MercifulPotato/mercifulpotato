The company knows that the pricing model is profitable - and therefore, raising prices won&#x27;t be worth the massive customer outcry.<p>For a new company, a price list is speculative. There is no way to do accurate long-term extrapolation of profitability. If the prices turn out to be too low to sustain the business, they will have to be raised - and while there will be an outcry, the business will simply have no alternative.<p>And since it&#x27;s really hard to migrate all your data&#x2F;workflows&#x2F;integrations&#x2F;etc. away from the service you first decide on, you&#x27;re incentivised to never join a new service - because the price instability might come back to bite you, let alone if the company itself doesn&#x27;t collapse later.')
