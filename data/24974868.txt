Obviously, cities need parks and trees. Largely they <i>have</i> parks and trees.<p>I see a lot of newer areas designed with mini-lawns and I always shake my head - in an urban environment, the name of the game is density and accessibility. Don&#x27;t put a bush between the sidewalk and your shop: the shops are supposed to be on the sidewalk. Half of the time, these shops seem to be hiding their main entrance in the back, next to a parking lot, because it&#x27;s actually a suburb with some apartments over a dentist office, not a real attempt at an urban environment.')
