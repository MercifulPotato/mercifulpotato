A good practice is to use some existing ontology when modeling (say, FOAF or schema.org), this can fix the problem of having to map fields since both sources would already be using the same conventions.<p>I think what&#x27;s normally done is some sort of normalization pass or passes after ingesting the triples, so at the end of the process your app can always use your preferred property (say vcard:fn) or just ignore the subgraph in the worst case. There are a number of tools to perform this kind of normalization.. I know of SPARQL construct queries but I&#x27;ve seen others out there (rml.io).')
