Item(by='chansiky', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605466921, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25096196, text='&gt; it isn&#x27;t so much a drive for prestige, but just a lack of other goals<p>Couldn&#x27;t agree more.  &quot;Prestige&quot; and the insecurity of people who seek it is the root of why people run the rat race.  It is of course a race because we&#x27;re pushing all our might in an effort to win.<p>Now I&#x27;m not against competitiveness, but if were talking 40+ hour weeks of 30+ years of grinding for this abstract concept of prestige, then it&#x27;s pointless, and those people accruing checkboxes on their resume are running like lemmings off a cliff.  It doesn&#x27;t help that the chimp mind is wired to feel the pain of low status in the pecking order.  But, living life to avoid that pain, through decades of work is just throwing your life away, the only life one gets to live, 90 mph off the cliff.  This is why working too much is one of the biggest regrets of people on their deathbeds.<p>The people working for prestige, titles, paychecks, and status attainment without a larger idea of accomplishing something either for themselves or for the world really don&#x27;t do anything, accrue far more security than needed, and waste away their time(decades of it) in insecurity, without actually doing anything, except maybe move forward the company agenda (talk about lack of identity, what was the definition of &quot;cog in the wheel&quot;?).  No wonder they regret not living their life at 80.  Because they haven&#x27;t.')
