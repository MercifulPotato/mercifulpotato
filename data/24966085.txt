Typing hooks is a little easier than using HOC because you don&#x27;t have to determine the type of your props which could conceivably be a combination of multiple HOC and the actual props your component expects. With hooks your props are your props which you have a simple interface for and then the hooks can be typed based on their parameters and what they return like any other function.<p>HOC are the more lispy&#x2F;dynamic way of doing it I would say and in Clojurescript using Reagent it has always been common to use that general pattern I feel.')
