Firstly, stop stating it&#x27;s &quot;best&quot; or like OP noting it as &quot;success&quot;.<p>Let&#x27;s tax the rich more and give everyone access to higher education, even the playing field out. Yes you can redefine what rich means, and what poor means, over time through policies.<p>That last part sounds like almost a threat regarding what rich people might do if you block their corrupt behavior. That&#x27;s already a sign there&#x27;s a problem with the power dynamic here.')
