I know more than a few developers that work on sub $999 laptops&#x2F;machines. Specifically Dell&#x2F;Lenovo laptops seems to be the go to, since they can get them with 16GB RAM + 1TB hdd + non-discrete gfx, then they just swap out the hdd with 256&#x2F;512GB ssd.<p>About half of all my dev friends have given up on laptops (specifically apple gear, incl iPhone) and ALL of them built ryzen-based machines and work from home. My previous workplace refused to buy us laptops and built typical workstation PC&#x27;s for everyone (quadcore i5 + 16GB RAM + 256GB ssd + 1TB hdd, this was around 2017). The guys that do have iPad&#x27;s tend to hang on to them but swapped their iPhones with Android phones when they ditched their MacBooks. Main complaint? Ports &amp; (Performance vs Price vs (ryzen pc with same price)).')
