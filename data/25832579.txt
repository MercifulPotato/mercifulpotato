You have to be a Finnish citizen with no income to qualify.<p>Everyone <i>not</i> participating in the capitalist economy (by owning business or being employed at one) is essentially a government&#x2F;military reserve employee on indefinite paid leave receiving a budget that covers virtually all living expenses to quite a reasonable standard. And it&#x27;s <i>baseline</i>, every citizen eligible, other obligations withstanding. You&#x27;d have to really make a mess of your life to not live comfortably.<p>The only downside is, if there&#x27;s war, I have to give my life for the country. Which, given Finland&#x27;s history (defensiveness and neutrality), seems like a good deal to me. Most men get actively recalled to military trainings; I&#x27;ve personally been exempt during peacetime.<p>I could indeed mine bitcoins for free. But that&#x27;d be a gross misuse of my time and resources. I&#x27;d rather create something meaningful than literally waste electricity just to prove that I have it (the idiotic quality of proof-of-work cryptocurrency).')
