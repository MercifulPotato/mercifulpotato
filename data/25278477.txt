This isn&#x27;t cracking the ship into halves.  This is very slowly grinding a hole through the structure.  Look to the edges of the cut line and you will see the failure mode of the metal is very different.  No sharp&#x2F;jagged fractures, more round peeling off of metal.  It is the difference between using an axe and using a saw.')
