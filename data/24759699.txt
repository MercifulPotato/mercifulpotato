Obviously it would be nice if filesystems were not corrupted by a system crash, but I&#x27;m pretty sure POSIX doesn&#x27;t guarantee it. And just because the data is on the disk, that (unfortunately) doesn&#x27;t mean that you&#x27;ll necessarily be able to find it.<p>(shades of <i>MS Fnd in a Lbry</i> by Hal Draper here)')
