As I said, these have been around for 10+ years and nobody buys them. It&#x27;s not my opinion that these are undesirable, we <i>know</i> they are undesirable based on sales numbers.<p>Bikes with Automatic drive trains aren&#x27;t popular in the US.\n... or Europe.\n... or Asia.\n... or anywhere.<p>They are more expensive, heavier, and harder to work on than traditional bikes. Half-assed automatic shifting doesn&#x27;t make up for those issues.<p>Maybe I&#x27;m off base and people just didn&#x27;t like them because they are ugly. Who knows, but since it&#x27;s been 10+ years now I think it&#x27;s clear they aren&#x27;t the fix-all for getting people on bikes Shimano designers thought they were.
