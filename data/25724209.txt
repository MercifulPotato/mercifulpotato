I&#x27;m really strongly considering carbon steel as a replacement, I&#x27;ve hardly used cast iron either and think it&#x27;s time to take the plunge and convert.<p>One tip to add that the cast iron griddle maker gave me in the manual was to avoid putting lots of cold water on it while it&#x27;s hot.
