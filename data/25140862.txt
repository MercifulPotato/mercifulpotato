It seems they want to phase out all non Metal APIs.<p>That doesn’t make sense as Metal APIs are implemented on top of the graphics drivers. There’s Metal drivers for AS, Intel iGPU, and AMD. The last two are not built for arm64. On AMD’s side it would require work from AMD as most of the driver is shared code from Windows. I wouldn’t be surprised if that changes in the future.')
