My bet is that we&#x27;ll see strong typing dominate in the coming decade, with assistance from linters&#x2F;static analysis becoming default.<p>Unfortunately, this is not too easy to create using Julia. Much easier than Python, sure, but not too easy. Tellingly, the Julia community apparently does not care for static analysis and have not begun to develop the capacity for it. As a consequence, much Julia code is written in a way that is un-analyzable, which digs it deeper into weak typing.')
