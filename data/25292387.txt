Thousands of people have been killed in this fight. It has also led to perverse politics such as rewarding military officers based on how many drug farmers or dealers they kill.<p>The leading example of this is the &quot;False positives&quot; scandal [1], which consisted in the kidnap and assassination of thousands of innocent civilians from the poor suburbs of many cities, to add them to the lists of guerilla killed  and inflate their rewards. this  was made by the very same Colombian army meant to protect the civilian.<p>Just think about it, the army massacring innocent people to claim rewards, being paid by the taxes of these same people. We&#x27;re literally paying to be killed. All of this was  orchestrated by the president at that time. Alvaro Uribe Velez, which unsurprisingly, has been found related to a lot of drug trafficking and violence.<p>All of this was greatly reduced when the peace accord was restarted about 8 years ago. When Uribe&#x27;s successor was elected president. He started proposing legalizing drugs, and signing peace, which Uribe didn&#x27;t like, so he started picturing him as a traitor (much in the way that Trump manipulates people).<p>Still, Uribe&#x27;s influence is so great (as he has a lot of power from drugs and from having it&#x27;s own paramilitary, all of this is a widely known &quot;secret&quot;) that he got to set another president (as he also has his very own political party). This extremely right wing politics has resulted in spikes in violence and violations of the peace agreement from the side of the government.<p>Just to synthesize, these $800 million have been deceptively spent in killing innocents, claiming bonuses, and covering up that the Colombian right wing politics are grossly involved in trafficking and violence.<p>If you want a name, is Alvaro Uribe Velez the person who twisted media, politics, war and trafficking, and set himself as the hero, in the deadliest chapter of this country so far.<p>If you consume cocaine occasionally, I invite you to stop, not because of health issues or whatsoever. It is because in being a consumer you&#x27;re contributing to this giant violence network, which kills social leaders and kicks out innocent farmers from their lands.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;%22False_positives%22_scandal" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;%22False_positives%22_scandal</a>')
