Because of that, they would rather use an ORM because they think they can avoid internalising the relational paradigm. But, guess what - if you don&#x27;t speak relational then your table design will suck, which in turn will impact DB performance.\nGiven a long enough time, you&#x27;ll either switch jobs before this becomes a problem or you&#x27;ll be forced to learn SQL properly.
