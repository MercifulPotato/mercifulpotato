It&#x27;s not &quot;serving&quot; like working as a servant&#x2F;a billionaire doing whatever the president says in a controlling&#x2F;exploitative way, it just means that Larry King thinks that Ted Turner wouldn&#x27;t turn down a cabinet appointment.<p>You can also infer from the way King says that &quot;what&#x27;s he got left in life to gain,&quot; and Clinton&#x27;s surprised &quot;you&#x27;re kidding,&quot; that they both consider this kind of service to be a major downgrade from the billionaire life - King saying here that Ted Turner has nothing left to gain indicates a separation in his mind between personal gain and working for the Clinton administration. Clinton&#x27;s surprised response tells us he feels the same way, surprise that a billionaire would want to work for the president.')
