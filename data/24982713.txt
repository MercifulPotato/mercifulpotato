If you&#x27;ve been writing OCaml and then you want to change your project to another language, you will most definitely miss the garbage collector. All of a sudden you have to solve problems a second time in a different way, which is something you wouldn&#x27;t have to do using F#. There&#x27;s no way I&#x27;d shift a serious project from GC to non-GC unless I had absolutely no choice.')
