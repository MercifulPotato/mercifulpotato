Taxes are a taking of the proceeds of an enterprise, the more taken the more the owner is defacto the government.<p>&gt; Not a federal or Democratic Party policy issue<p>It&#x27;s local and state Democratic policy, and it certainly is socialistic.<p>&gt; That has nothing to do with the means of production<p>Of course it is. It applies to business and how they are run.<p>&gt; Not a left vs right issue<p>Of course it is. It comes from the left.<p>&gt; This doesnâ€™t prove or disprove anything.<p>Requiring them to all be wrong should perhaps give pause.<p>Anyway, you&#x27;re clearly focused on federal socialism. So I&#x27;ll bring up Biden&#x27;s plan to spend $2 trillion on all kinds of centrally planned economic initiatives, such as electric car chargers all over the place. The government has tried central planning of energy production and distribution before, back in the 70&#x27;s. The DOE decided, for each and every gas station in America, how much gas it was allowed to sell. It was a disaster - gas lines and shortages everywhere. This all ended overnight with Reagan&#x27;s first Executive Order.<p>And I mean literally overnight the gas lines disappeared and never returned. I remember it well, it was wonderful not to have to plan for an hour wait for gas. The DOE proved simply incapable of putting gas where people needed it.<p>Do you believe Biden&#x27;s central economic planners will put the charging stations in the optimal place? I don&#x27;t. But I suppose we&#x27;ll see. In any case, it&#x27;s still $2 trillion worth of socialism.<p>&gt; This is evident in the fact both democrats and republicans love Medicare which is literal socialized medicine for folks over 65.<p>Of course Medicare is socialism. You are pushing the idea that Republican actions define socialism. I disagree - socialism is an economic system, and is not defined by who implements it.')
