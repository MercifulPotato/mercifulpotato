There could be a scenario where current Firefox developers suddenly revolt against their managers and say that they&#x27;re going to create a new worker-coorperative independent of Mozilla. The managers can&#x27;t really control them because the source code isn&#x27;t really their &quot;own&quot;. The new org would still have to change their logo and branding since Firefox is still trademarked, and they would have to rebuild their testing&#x2F;CI infrastructure. They would also have to find new sources of revenue; will donations be enough?')
