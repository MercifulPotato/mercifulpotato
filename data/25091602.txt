I doubt that historically this specific feature was responsible for any &quot;static typing hate&quot; (because languages with such high-level type systems were quite obscure 10 or 20 years ago). I have the impression that this hate was specifically a web-dev thing because many Javascript developers never experienced what it&#x27;s like to work with a statically typed language until Dart and Typescript showed up (and then it suddenly was the best thing since sliced bread).')
