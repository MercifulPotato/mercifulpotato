Windows wasn&#x27;t that well established in 1991, and QBasic was a direct replacement for QuickBasic (and VB was the premium-cost replacement for the Professional Development System that was the upmarket companion to QuickBasic), which itself was the successor to GWBasic on PC and there&#x27;s probably a fair amount of conflation of them in people&#x27;s memory.<p>&gt; it seems almost like a niche group of people who in the 90s were still using DOS a lot.<p>It wasn&#x27;t really a niche group that was still using a DOS a lot before about Win95; Win 3.1 was separate add-on on top of DOS, and lots of important software still targeted DOS exclusively or had separate DOS and Windows versions.')
