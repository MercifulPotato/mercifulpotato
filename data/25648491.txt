If you believe that landlords use the cost of holding real estate as an input that shapes the supply side of the supply-demand balance in the broad rental market (as I do), then it seems that renters do indirectly benefit from the deductibility of the loans on the buildings in which they live.<p>The mortgage interest deduction serves to put the purchasers of owner-occupied real estate onto a more equal footing with commercially-rented real estate. That seems like a valid public policy purpose, even though the mortgage interested deduction became substantially less valuable with TCJA-2017.')
