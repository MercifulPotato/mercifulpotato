We should aim for allowing others to change certain parameters or data in the pipeline. That is, the result should be robust with respect to minor changes in the pipeline, which could be more easily tested by others with a published, fully specified pipeline.<p>Referring to my other comment [2], Guix or Nix really shine in allowing others to change part of the pipelines, due to their functional approach to composing components.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;phys.org&#x2F;news&#x2F;2019-05-replicability-science.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;phys.org&#x2F;news&#x2F;2019-05-replicability-science.html</a><p>[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25866651" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25866651</a>')
