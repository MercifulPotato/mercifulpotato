Both are stressful at times and both are rewarding at times. One might feel like foolish and other one just selfish but there is lot more overlap than you think. But then you don&#x27;t see so many old age home types of things in the latter. It&#x27;s just culture where people care more for others happiness than their own.<p>One example of such culture you may find interesting: Since most of the India lives in rural areas and journalist live in cities, you may never hear it. When in a village someone makes a lot of money, he will give a feast to the entire village, sometimes even 7 or 11 villages. You can say how foolish he is.. He can roam entire Europe with that kind of hard earned money, meet new people, be happy. Right? But for him, seeing so many of his fellow villagers having one delicious meal is far more fulfilling. And this keeps happening often here. Earlier they used to make wells for water for all, etc.')
