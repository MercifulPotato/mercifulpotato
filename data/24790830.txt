It was very crappy, but allowed me to do some web freelancing (thanks Sublime Text, I miss you) and browse web in general (sure, one thing at a time. Sometimes I couldn&#x27;t listen to music on Banshee and have a heavy RAM tab opened). That&#x27;s what I could afford at the time. Today I got a powerful Dell laptop, don&#x27;t care anymore about these micro optimizations. I feel like I&#x27;m betraying my old self, hah.')
