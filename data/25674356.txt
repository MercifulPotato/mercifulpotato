I&#x27;ll send contact details on Slack.<p>The application is to do long term financial projections for life insurers. Currently market dominated by applications such as FIS Prophet and Risk Agility - but we believe that we&#x27;re a) faster and b) better integrated with other data &#x2F; analysis tools. These jobs can be enormously compute intensive (eg see [1]) so being able to do them faster &#x2F; with less resources can be very valuable.<p>Glad you&#x27;re keeping your sanity. Very impressed with the utility of what you&#x27;re doing.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;integrate.milliman.com&#x2F;-&#x2F;media&#x2F;integrate&#x2F;pdfs&#x2F;azure-batch-job.ashx" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;integrate.milliman.com&#x2F;-&#x2F;media&#x2F;integrate&#x2F;pdfs&#x2F;azure-...</a>')
