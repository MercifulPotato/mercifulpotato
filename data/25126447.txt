Mozilla could have set Cloudlfare DNS to be the default even for regular, unencrypted DNS traffic. There&#x27;s nothing inherent in DNS technology that would force them to respect your OS settings. If your concerned about Cloudflare taking over, rejecting DoH isn&#x27;t the solution to that problem.<p>It&#x27;s not an underhanded centralization push, it just so happens that when DoH was still new, there was effectively one provider that was widely available, that could confidently handle a large upsurge in traffic, and that made extremely strong privacy guarantees compared to the rest of the industry. At the time Mozilla started pushing DoH, most ISPs in the US didn&#x27;t even offer it as an option at all. As that changes, I expect that browser defaults will change as well.')
