It needs to be properly configured, which is non-trivial.  Over the years it has been necessary to request IP unblocks from a few providers.  Delivering mail to microsoft domains (hotmail, outlook, msn, live) has been problematic, so those messages only are now being delivered though SES.  Incoming messages are forwarded to free gmail accounts.   I spend 20 minutes a week blocking spam, we get very little now.  We use about 15 rbl lists, but I also manually block client domains, sender domains, and do some header checks.  Email is important to me and I enjoy doing it this way.  It&#x27;s super cheap, I can use several domains, and I have full control of the mail process.')
