By definition, climate is not characterized by sharp transitions; it is very slow on a human timescale.<p>The argument &quot;against climate change&quot; is more so an argument against immediate action. It&#x27;s a silly argument since prepping for climate change involves R&amp;D into ultimately more profitable energy solutions, like nuclear, electric, solar, etc. People are deterred by the cost of change.')
