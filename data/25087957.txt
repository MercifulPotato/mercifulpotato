A lot of fine detail-oriented design with the mouse.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;yZeqpuo.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;yZeqpuo.png</a><p>Imagine hooking up a MadZuri loader (Arithmetic Combinator &quot;output = input &#x2F; -Size&quot;. Input is sum_of_chests (Green Wire, isolated to input-side). Output is also Green-wire (isolated to output-side). A 2nd network built out of red-wires on each inserter connected to its private chest, calculating &quot;output - myChest &gt;= 0??&quot;).)<p>Configuring such a setup would be... terrible, through touch. No matter how I think of it.<p>--------<p>With keyboard + mouse, I shift-right click to copy settings, then run down the line to shift-left paste settings across every inserter. But that&#x27;s because the keyboard has many, many buttons that can map to useful hotkeys.<p>Touch provides... maybe 3 or 4 gestures that work while touching an object? (Touch, touch-and-hold, pinch-zoom, pinch-zoom out, multi-finger touch, multi-finger touch and hold). Between select, settings, rotate, zoom... I think we&#x27;re already out of gestures before we even got to copy&#x2F;paste settings (vs copy&#x2F;paste blueprints vs copy&#x2F;paste ghost objects).<p>The precision needed to hook up the Madzuri loader would be hell alone on an imprecise touch-screen. Its already kinda difficult with a mouse, even at full zoom-in.')
