You’re recovering from a major illness which can make even minor work effort feel overwhelming. Give yourself some grace here!<p>- Covid also has cognitive effects on some, even after recovery. It’s possible you’re feeling fatigued or impaired, even imperceptibly, which could make you feel more anxious about your capability to contribute. Again, give yourself some grace, and try to pay attention to whether this might be a factor.<p>- As others have mentioned, potential contributing mental health issues like depression and general anxiety (these can form a feedback loop with burnout as well). Do consider looking into identifying and treating any mental illness you’re experiencing.<p>- You may be generally unhappy with your career regardless of title or compensation. You’re allowed to feel that way! Not every “good job” is necessarily a good fit.<p>- This time has felt isolating for most people, especially anyone who’s been sick. This isolated feeling can lead to or amplify any of the above. If you’re able, try to make extra space for whatever kind of social you feel comfortable with.<p>Most of all, just don’t be too hard on yourself. You’re doing the best you can, and seeking outside advice is a great step.')
