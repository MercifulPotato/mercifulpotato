So how much was their time actually worth? (An economist will ask this.)<p>How much was the labor of slaves worth to the slaveowners? surely you&#x27;re not arguing it was worth nothing?<p>&gt; Post-slavery, norhern states, which had no slaves, paid the cost of welfare for millions of black families. So how does that factor in?<p>The price of social programs don&#x27;t factor in at all.<p>&gt; Since there&#x27;s intermarriage in America, what&#x27;s a quanta of African blood? How much does one get paid per 1&#x2F;32? (This is referring to the heated race arguments of the 1800s and 1900s.)<p>This will come up if the reparations take the form of payments to individuals.<p>&gt; Do you have any experience with the above? My family is from the Detroit area, so I&#x27;m one of few posters on HN that actually does know something about these issues.<p>Thank heavens we live in a country where people are allowed to have opinions without demonstrating the right to those opinions on the basis of heritage.<p>&gt; The US paid a heavy price during the civil war, one of the biggest issues being related to slavery. Do the northern states get reparations for freeing the slaves?<p>Why would they?<p>&gt; That&#x27;s the problem when you drag history into modern times. One of the biggest advantages that the US has over other countries is that we don&#x27;t continue to fight the same battles over and over.<p>Sadly you can&#x27;t get rid of the effects of history by choosing to forget about it.<p>&gt; Even before corona, black familiies in America struggled greatly with maintaining households and educating their children. Instead of virtue signalling, why don&#x27;t you contribute to solving today&#x27;s enormous problems?<p>This is unhelpful.')
