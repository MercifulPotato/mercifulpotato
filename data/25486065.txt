Item(by='Melting_Harps', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608470735, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25484290, text='&gt;  It’s interesting that ivy students are trying to use their pedigree to get into tech. Tech itself isn’t impressed by an ivy university degree like other professions, nor does it really look for one in applicants.<p>I used to believe that, since I knew so many self taught coders become pretty successful 10-15 years ago. But the typical Stanford grad to FAANG route has become a total laughable mockery of its former &#x27;build shit to gain a reputation&#x27; ethos but explains why their is so much corruption in University admissions.<p>You can still be pretty successful without a university degree with the right connections, but now with so much unemployment and significant applicant noise to signal ratio I think we will continue to see this as the norm. Which is how so many founders get their start anyhow; Elon&#x27;s story of being a shy nerd waiting in the lobby of a tech company hoping to talk to someone to no avail comes to mind being perhaps the most famous of this phenomenon.<p>With that said, I think this how the toxic Ivy league <i>mentality</i> of entitlement happens; they often justify their entitlement as something they deserve after years&#x2F;decades of not &#x27;living life enough.&#x27;')
