First study I&#x27;ve seen with more than a handful of participants, doing something other than self-reporting of symptoms.<p>That said, it&#x27;s notable that:<p>* They don&#x27;t have a control group (makes it impossible to know what the baseline rate of these symptoms is in the population).<p>* They don&#x27;t measure the various criteria for &quot;organ impairment&quot; <i>before</i> the participants caught covid (makes it impossible to know if the people who were found to be abnormal were abnormal <i>before</i> catching the virus -- there are a fair number of smokers and obese people in this sample, so this isn&#x27;t an idle concern).<p>* They find a fairly strong association with hospitalization (i.e. the people who are sickest, end up having the most lingering symptoms).<p>* The people who were sickest tended to have the most pre-existing risk factors for <i>the same outcomes</i> being measured by the study (i.e. there&#x27;s a hidden correlate).<p>Because of these limitations, you can&#x27;t really draw any broad conclusions from this study. In general, I&#x27;d say that it shows that older &#x2F; obese &#x2F; unhealthy people are more likely to have both severe Covid, as well as concomitant symptoms of severe Covid.')
