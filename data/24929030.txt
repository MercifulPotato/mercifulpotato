Are you absolutely sure?<p>&gt; Second, most research projects are funded by grants not from the state - it comes from industry and places like that.<p>Again: 100% sure, your &quot;most&quot; applies?<p>&gt; Third, even if they are funding it, why isn&#x27;t funding the creation of companies (employers!) a good thing for the state?<p>It might be, it might not be. The company may generate lots of taxes, the company also may just move to a tax haven and tell society to screw off.')
