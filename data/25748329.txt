In case anyone reading and not well versed on the subject.<p>While the 3GPP Profile and Spec aren&#x27;t exactly &quot;Open&quot; by Open Source and HN&#x27;s Standard, It is definitely not closed or proprietary. You can implement a working 3G &#x2F; 4G &#x2F; 5G system. It just wouldn&#x27;t be competitive with commercial offering.<p>And US actually has plenty of IP via Qualcomm in Core Standards. Ignoring IoT and AV ( Autonomous Vehicle ). Also partly via Nokia when acquired Alcatel-Lucent, where Lucent is from AT&amp;T Bell Labs.<p>So No, US aren&#x27;t out of the 5G circle. They just dont have any companies making specific part of the 5G infrastructure.')
