International transactions can also get delayed because of shoddy foreign banking servers which may simply be down.<p>All of these problems remain, but an additional constraint of requiring consensus and hashing is imposed.<p>This is a version of second system syndrome where even the naive variant doesn&#x27;t sound good on paper.')
