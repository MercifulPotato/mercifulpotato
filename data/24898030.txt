PHP does not execute line by line like an interpreted language. But takes the source and compiles it down to an intermediate representation (IR), just like Java. Java calls it bytecode, PHP calls it OPCodes. Also like Java, PHP then takes that IR and executes it on a VM. Java&#x27;s is stack based and PHP is register based, if I remember correctly. Many PHP accelerators &#x2F; caching solutions save the IR and thus, the next time the code is needed, no compilation of source code is done.')
