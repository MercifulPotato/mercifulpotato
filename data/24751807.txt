I strongly agree that Police REFORM is necessary.  At least in the US things are bad enough that a not-small portion of the population feels the police are out to get them, or at best unlikely to be a positive influence on any outcome.  Peace Officers are necessary.  A recognition that many situations require de-escalation and a variety of social outreach to achieve the best results for both society at large and the individuals involved.<p>Believe in reform and redemption, and apply it to everyone and everything.')
