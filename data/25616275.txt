Privacy is one of them.<p>In general people today agree with the &quot;if you have nothing to hide you have nothing to fear&quot; rhetoric,  generally accepting that &quot;only bad people&quot; want or desire privacy, and the government is only their to &quot;protect good people from bad people&quot;<p>It is all a lie ofcourse but that is where we are as a society, and I am not seeing anything on the horizon to change this<p>Largely we (the US) are moving to a more Authoritarian, collectivist society,  leaving behind our Individualist libertarian roots')
