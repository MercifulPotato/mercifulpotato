For many devices it shouldn&#x27;t be too hard to make it possible to use them both with 110V and 230V, even more so for already complex and expensive machines like a washing machine.<p>The biggest problem might be the amount of power a device can draw. Half the voltage gives you half the power, which is the reason why e.g. kettles are much less useful in the US.')
