It seems they came to an agreement in court, that from that point forward, each party could have 60 representatives present.<p>So, based on this thread alone (which was written as happening live on Nov 5), which you provided, we don&#x27;t know if at any point election observers were previously kicked out, how many, when or where, or for what reasons.  We also don&#x27;t know if the observers were allowed to observe much of anything (there&#x27;s something about not allowing them within 100 feet in that thread).<p>The rest of what you wrote is speculation.  Nobody need be concerned with the &#x27;why&#x27; someone did something, merely the facts.  Were the elections carried out in accordance to the law, or weren&#x27;t they.  That&#x27;s what&#x27;s being litigated.')
