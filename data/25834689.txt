But it seems to be growing (eg, “open core”, “openai”, stuff like this taking about open with non-open licenses).<p>It’s getting hard to filter out. One of the benefits I think to CCn is that it clearly lets users know what is and is not allowed. Having OSIn might help with people who don’t read licenses for fun.')
