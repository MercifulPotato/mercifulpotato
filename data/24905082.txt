Before that, I worked all sorts of different unskilled jobs. In one of them, warehouse picking in a supermarket chain, I met a guy who had burned out of tech (and this was ~1990). I couldn&#x27;t believe that someone who had a career writing code, working for IBM, all of that, would just walk away from it to become a warehouse picker.<p>30 years later, after ~25 years in tech and a major clinical depression, I totally understand why he did that. He seemed happy, too.')
