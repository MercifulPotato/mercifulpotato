It&#x27;s telling that they are now the party that is overly cozy with the largest, most-powerful companies on the planet.<p>See that? &quot;the left&quot; has &quot;become the party&quot; of things not actually evident. They are &quot;the party&quot; that is somehow cozy with Twitter, although again, I don&#x27;t see how a Republican yelling at a company&#x27;s CEO necessarily means the other party supports that company.')
