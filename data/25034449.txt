If they were not orthogonal, then severity of consequences would be a parameter in formal statistical methods for evaluating our confidence in the ranking.<p>Let&#x27;s take your analogy a step further. Does it follow that the US is the most likely to be the next user of nuclear weapons? Does it follow that Japan is most likely to be the next target? (I&#x27;m sure someone is thinking that at least one of those outcomes is quite likely, but note that I wrote &quot;does it follow...&quot;, not &quot;how likely is it...&quot; because the issue is what one can deduce from the evidence presented in the above post.)')
