Better than coal to be sure, but it&#x27;s not what you&#x27;re making it out to be.<p>Rare earth metals have to be mined in remote portions of China in dystopian hellscapes. Lithium and other minerals also have to be mined, and leave toxic tailing ponds. Solar panels frequently have cadmium and tellurium, which are also hazardous, and need to be managed. Plastics and composites in wind turbines also cannot be recycled.<p>There are no perfect solutions, and the future will almost certainly require a mixture of kinds of energy.')
