Trump took over completely, got rid of everyone else, and then now he&#x27;s gone. Not sure what&#x27;s left, but at this point it doesn&#x27;t seem promising.<p>Democrats seem OK on paper, but (feel free to disagree with the following) seems to be getting taken over by people who don&#x27;t actually like the country, its culture, and frankly a large number of its people. Many of the policies being proposed seem more likely to go the way of Venezuela than Denmark. I am not saying most Democrats are this way, but the powerful ones in the party seem to be. EDIT: let me add that I don&#x27;t feel welcome in the Democratic party unless I toe the far-left line on every issue. If I out myself as a libertarian, I feel like I&#x27;d be pushed away from polite society as fast as Alex Jones.<p>And I don&#x27;t feel this type of discussion can really happen many places (aside from HN maybe) because the left is completely in control of all media now, and all education.')
