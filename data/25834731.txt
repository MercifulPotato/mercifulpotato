Maintaining a service at the scale they offer is a huge undertaking.<p>You get the high-availability, the hundreds of engineers working to keep those services up and make them talk to other AWS services easily. You get teams of engineers on-call to react to any failures.<p>I agree with you that this has a bad effect on the companies that originally created those projects, but I do see a huge value in what Amazon offers.')
