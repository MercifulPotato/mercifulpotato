I was really impressed with their rider assist [1] for their new motorcycles and the ability to balance a bike. Perhaps that is a small feat compared to what level 3 will require but I am confident Honda will pull it off. This opinion is also based off the fact that I have a couple 37 year old Honda motorcycles that still to this day run strong and hard. I am just optimistic they can do what they say.')
