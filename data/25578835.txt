Most individual captchas are pretty rudimentary and can be attacked with simple image processing techniques and pattern matching.<p>This one in particular is simple enough that nearly any technique you wanted to throw at it would succeed with minimal fine tuning. I&#x27;d be shocked if it took an afternoon even if you&#x27;d never broken a captcha or done any image processing before, and that&#x27;s without borrowing an off-the-shelf ML solution.<p>Plus, even if you had a 50% failure rate you&#x27;d just need twice as many calls. That&#x27;s not trivial, but it doesn&#x27;t really affect the viability of the idea.')
