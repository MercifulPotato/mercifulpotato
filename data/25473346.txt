As I get older, I realize that the world is a complex place and people (characters) are nuanced.  Reduction to black&#x2F;white (good&#x2F;bad) squeezes the nuance and thus the humanity.<p>For similar reasons, I don&#x27;t enjoy reading about the good works of (Western) holy people.  (Buddhism and Hindu stories, the small exposure I have, seem to contain nuanced characters.)')
