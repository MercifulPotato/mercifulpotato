To me your country looks like long-haired footballers, Borges, Soriano, tango, Buenos Aires, desaparecidos, a president who looked like the guy on Fantasy Island (Menem), and all those magnificent comicbook artists the country somehow produced (Quino, Josè Munoz, Carlos Sampayo, Horacio Altuna, Alberto Salinas, Lucho Olivera, the “adopted” Robin Wood...). It’s still very much a stereotype, but definitely something I can’t really associate to wilderness.')
