This isn&#x27;t my area and you&#x27;re right I haven&#x27;t researched this topic in any depth (though I did look at Diaspora), so I&#x27;m not surprised it shows.<p>Thanks for responding.<p>I&#x27;m glad you understood (at least I hope you did) my comment wasn&#x27;t meant as an attack on you.  Far from it, it was just my honest assessment.  And I do appreciate the discussion.<p>&gt;Decentralized platforms like Diaspora may be viable alternatives someday, but my possibly ill-informed pragmatic gut tells me they won&#x27;t be viable alternatives for many years to come.<p>Network effects[0] give platforms like Facebook and Twitter their power and influence.<p>Creating (and more importantly, using) decentralized alternatives is, IMHO, the only reasonable way to counteract that advantage.<p>Which is why I made the suggestions WRT APIs (to level the playing field and give alternatives a chance), ISP upload speeds (to make self-hosting viable), content licenses (to give control back to the creators of content, rather than the aggregators) and tracking&#x2F;advertising opt-ins (to reduce the money making power and incentives to track&#x2F;spy&#x2F;collect data of the big guys).<p>Your pragmatic gut is pretty spot on.  Without at least some of the above, alternative platforms will have a hard time gaining traction (although they do exist and are viable in a number of areas) in the social media space.<p>I&#x27;d say that the success of decentralized alternatives rests on the willingness of people like you and me to use and advocate for those alternatives.<p>Perhaps it&#x27;s time to install a Diaspora pod[1] or Mastodon instance[2]?<p>&gt;Thanks for your patience and persistence. It was interesting!<p>Likewise.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Network_effect" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Network_effect</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.diasporafoundation.org&#x2F;Installation" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.diasporafoundation.org&#x2F;Installation</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.joinmastodon.org&#x2F;user&#x2F;run-your-own&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.joinmastodon.org&#x2F;user&#x2F;run-your-own&#x2F;</a>')
