IMO it&#x27;s an underappreciated technological achievement at the once-in-a-hundred-years level.  Only a few years ago, it was hard to get a decent digital camera for $400 and change.  The Mini is a decent camera that also happens to <i>fly.</i><p>When that realization hit me, it reminded me of the first time I saw a $29 DVD player for sale at WalMart.  Some incredible things had to happen to make that possible, almost all of of them going completely unnoticed by almost everyone.<p>The BAE drone probably costs $50,000 apiece, and doesn&#x27;t appear to be substantially different from the current-generation (or even the original) Mini.')
