Send an email to every customer (domain, so pick a single customer at every domain) and send them an email with a fake login, or a note that says please disregard?<p>Aside from that being spam, it&#x27;s also likely to get legit emails stuck in spam filters as people start marking them as spam.<p>Secondly, I think most of the largest providers don&#x27;t really grey list any longer.  They seem to have moved to inbound throttling.  So your first email goes through but then if you send a rash of mail, you end up seeing the throttle on the back side.')
