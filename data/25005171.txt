I very much want IPv6 to take over, but a firewall does not provide the same level of security as a NAT when a bug is found.<p>If a bug is found in a non-NAT firewall that prevents it from blocking a packet for some reason, you have a routable address from the outside that you can send packets to. If a bug is found in a NAT firewall that prevents it from blocking a packet, it&#x27;s very difficult to tell the router <i>which</i> internal address to route the packet to since the IP header only holds 1 &quot;TO&quot; address and by necessity, that&#x27;s the public address of the NAT firewall.<p>There are of course some edge cases (double-headers, being on the same L2 network as the firewall, etc), but for most cases, the fact that the internal network is on IP addresses that won&#x27;t route <i>to</i> their public interface (the NAT firewall) is in and of itself a layer of protection.<p>Personally, I think this trade-off is worth it in the long run, but it&#x27;s simply not correct to claim they are equivalent when router firmware bugs are still discovered on a regular basis and consumer network equipment rarely gets security updates (and it&#x27;s even rarer for consumers to install them).')
