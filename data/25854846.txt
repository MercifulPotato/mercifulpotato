The reason you don&#x27;t hear about it more is that YIMBYism is not developed enough there for people to complain about it, but the population of NYC is decreasing because of housing supply issues.<p>They also have a lot of left-NIMBY people making wrong arguments based on things they imagine are happening; in this case it&#x27;s that all new housing is luxury towers that are being bought by &quot;investors&quot; and kept empty, for some reason related to taxes, instead of being rented out.')
