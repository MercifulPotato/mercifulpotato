Worse, I suspect the continued push for it demonstrates both a lack of leadership and the sort of ego-driven corporate politics where no one wants to admit they&#x27;re wrong so just keep doubling down until you win.<p>AMP still breaks for me on iOS in completely fixable ways. I have poor eyesight. I use higher default zoom. I suspect this is the reason why AMP rendered content doesn&#x27;t fit on my screen and I can&#x27;t scroll to the part that doesn&#x27;t fit. It&#x27;s super-annoying.<p>On iOS you can force touch the link to render a preview and get the non-AMP version. There&#x27;s no way to get that by default and that is a completely ridiculous situation.<p>I, as a user, should be able to opt out of this crap.<p>The fact that Google forced this down people&#x27;s throats by giving AMP content ranking preference is an utterly stupid decision by leadership. It risks antitrust action, government investigations and all that entails.<p>If you want to prefer sites that load fast, that&#x27;s fast. If you want to prefer sites that use a technology that you created and control that&#x27;s completely different. This is a textbook example of abusing your market power. I&#x27;m sure the executives found legal advice to the contrary. If so, such advice ignores just how malleable government action is and the negative PR consequences.<p>Reducing that search ranking boost is a step in the right direction but it never should&#x27;ve happened in the first place. You can&#x27;t turn back time of course but that ranking boost needs to disappear entirely. Immediately.')
