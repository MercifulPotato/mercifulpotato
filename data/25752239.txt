Sometimes your business model gets disrupted by a VC dumping a billion dollars into a money-losing startup. Sometimes it gets disrupted by a nation state dumping a billion dollars into money-losing R&amp;D, that they then gift to their domestic firms. It&#x27;s fine when Europe does it, it&#x27;s fine when China does it, it&#x27;s fine when the US does it.<p>The reason it&#x27;s fine is because there&#x27;s nothing about capitalism or markets that require your competitors to be profitable... Just like there&#x27;s nothing about capitalism or markets which forbids arbitrary, regional advantages, be they related to your geography, your access to human capital, a unique regulatory environment, or your access to a friendly government that will subsidize your business (With grants, or R&amp;D credits, or tech transfers, or just by buying a lot of stuff from you.)<p>To put another way - if some other government funded the development of a drug that cured cancer for $2&#x2F;dose, I wouldn&#x27;t shed any tears for the trillions of dollars of wasted R&amp;D, and lost profits for existing vendors of cancer medication. I&#x27;d still feel that way, even if they went ahead and gifted the IP to a domestic vendor, that sold it at a hefty markup.')
