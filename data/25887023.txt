We were using Smalltalk with Gemstone for a number of years, but the internet and Java killed the Smalltalk industry, so we migrated everything to Java using VA for Java and early Websphere.<p>VA for Java hid the idea of source files and gave a good illusion of a dynamic and “live” Smalltalk-like environment. Later moving to eclipse was the end of that illusion and any Smalltalk feel.<p>Added: we also had no problem with version control in Smalltalk or Java, both tool sets provided great team tools')
