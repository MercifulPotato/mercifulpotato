Take a car engine for example. Imagine if someone wanted to rip out their car radiator and attach something else in place and then complained to the dealer when the engine failed. This is why dealers sometimes void warranties if you didn&#x27;t let them handle any repairs. This is also why OS makers secure some things away from you - to ensure their product works as they had intended. They don&#x27;t want to be held responsible for any mess-ups their customers could make.<p>As so, no one is trying to screw you. If you want control over an OS, then maybe don&#x27;t buy a product from a vendor and instead make your own...')
