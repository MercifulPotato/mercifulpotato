Restaurants are very different to newspapers.<p>Suppose there is a &quot;best&quot; Chinese restaurant in a city. Is its food still good if it has all the way across the city to reach you? How long does it take to arrive to your house? Can it produce a volume of food to feed an entire city?<p>OK, maybe this restaurant has many locations. You&#x27;re now proposing that the best Chinese restaurant in a given city is a chain. Chain restaurants are not historically known for offering the best food available. And now you also have variation across restaurants, unless your restaurant is literally just Panda Express, where standard food comes frozen in a giant plastic sack.<p>Many colleges have started canceling formal courses in linear algebra because we have a video recording of Gilbert Strang, but few cities are in danger of losing their Chinese restaurants because a single one is so obviously the best.')
