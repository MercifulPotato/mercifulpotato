How selective of me! &#x2F;s<p>Yup, precisely. You&#x27;ve conveniently ignored successful projects elsewhere, like the Hanul nuclear power plant and the Taishan nuclear plant. Also, you&#x27;re incorrect that Votgle is the only nuclear project in the US, Turkey Point is installing two more AP1000 reactors.<p>&gt; It includes such things as instrumentation, enrichment, fuel fabrication, and (most importantly) manpower and expertise.<p>Enrichment is not a substantial portion of nuclear power&#x27;s cost. Almost all of it is in construction and fabrication of the plant. I&#x27;m also not sure why you think building a nuclear warhead translates into running a nuclear plant. A nuclear weapons designer <i>wants</i> a very violent runaway nuclear reaction. This is what a nuclear plant designer wants to avoid.<p>Nuclear power and nuclear weapons don&#x27;t use the same fuel. That&#x27;s not quite true with recent plants: a few of the newer nuclear plants can mix in some weapons-grade plutonium - but the mix is still mostly uranium. This more about dismantling plutonium, as it&#x27;s the only way we know how to get ride of weapons-grade fissile material - well, besides detonating the nuclear weapon.<p>&gt; Investments are made on expected payoff. The expectation that renewables will do well is high. The off chance that they do not, oh well! Nuclear could be a backup in that case. There is no need to pump trillions into nuclear now to restore your putative golden age.<p>You continue to miss the point. With renewables and storage, we&#x27;re talking in terms of hypothetical costs. What we <i>think</i> it will cost. Projected costs are cheap, because by definition they exclude the costs of unforeseen issues. Historical costs <i>do</i> include the costs of unforeseen issues that emerged in implementation.<p>Nuclear costs are historical costs. We <i>know</i> what nuclear costs, because we&#x27;ve built it before. And we&#x27;ve built it at scale.<p>The cost of proposed storage technologies are hypothetical costs. Nobody has built a 1TWh storage facility, let alone a 10 TWh storage facility. We can make educated guesses at what this will cost, but they&#x27;re still guesses. We&#x27;ll only know the real cost after it&#x27;s been built. And projected costs are almost always optimistic.<p>Comparing historical costs to projected costs is comparing apples to oranges.<p>&gt; (I&#x27;d actually put carbon capture over nuclear as the backup plan. Nuclear would be the backup to the backup.)<p>You seem to be particularly determined to avoid the one solution that is actually proven to work.<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pv-magazine-usa.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;03&#x2F;01&#x2F;12-hours-energy-storage-80-percent-wind-solar&#x2F;#:~:text=Team-,12%20hours%20of%20energy%20storage%20enough%20for%20U.S.%20to%20run,3%20weeks%20of%20energy%20storage" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pv-magazine-usa.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;03&#x2F;01&#x2F;12-hours-energy-stora...</a>.')
