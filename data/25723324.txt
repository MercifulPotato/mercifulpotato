Biden is almost definitely going to be more like Gerald Ford than some would like him to be, they&#x27;ll probably have some kind of formal investigation into the Trump administration but not much else from the executive-branch itself.<p>&gt; But I evaluate his and any other politicianâ€™s policies on a case by case basis.<p>This is fairly naive, i.e. ignoring that (Trump being the most shining example but in no way unique) politicians are two-faced by default, policy alone doth not a president make - no amount of policy would allow you to decide what type of president will condone QAnon or write a short love letter to people threatening to shoot up the capitol building.<p>As per YouGov, an overwhelming majority of republicans and a supermajority of democrats thinks China is a strategic enemy of the United States now, it&#x27;s just plain bad (not just bad, <i>diabolically awful</i>) political strategy to undo what little Trump did. Some of his tariffs might go, but they were effectively just a Tax on US consumers and didn&#x27;t move the Chinese an inch so that&#x27;s not really up for discussion.')
