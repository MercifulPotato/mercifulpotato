There&#x27;s no need to try to explain this with ridiculous conspiracy theories about how the only reason Facebook pumped billions into VR to get a million people to create a FB account.<p>Account security benefits massively from economies of scale,  both in the sense of infrastructure and operationally. Oculus did not have that scale. There&#x27;s probably a couple of million Oculus accounts vs. ten billion Facebook ones. The Oculus accounts are probably a similar PR nightmare waiting to happen, like the Ring accounts were for Amazon or the Nest accounts for Google.<p>In concrete terms, Facebook accounts will have better 2FA implementation than Oculus. They&#x27;ll have better protection against credential stuffing or enumeration attacks. It&#x27;s less likely there&#x27;s going to be some kind of an authentication bypass, or a bug where plaintext passwords are getting logged, etc. Basically, for Facebook to continue using the Oculus account system rather than migrating off would be irresponsible, and the main surprise is that they&#x27;ve taken this long post-acquisition to do it.<p>FWIW, I&#x27;ve never had a Facebook account, despite some minor social pressure to get one for like the last 13 years. But that&#x27;s just because none of their services has ever seemed interesting in any way. But I was totally OK creating one a few days ago after buying the Quest 2.<p>The only problem is that at least for now a Facebook account == Facebook social network profile. I wish they were more like Google or Microsoft accounts in that a) having an account doesn&#x27;t imply use of any particular Facebook product, b) they allow use of separate profiles tied to the same main account (e.g. a MS account can be associated with Xbox gamer tags for gaiming, a Google account with Youtube brand accounts for posting videos). But that&#x27;s something they haven&#x27;t needed until now, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll come.')
