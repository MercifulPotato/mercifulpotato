In fact quite the opposite. Go into a convenience store, buy a pack of mints for $1.04 (104 yen) hand them an $100 bill (10000yen) no one blinks an eye.<p>Most convenience stores in the USA won&#x27;t accept $100 bills AFAIK.<p>I can see if it was some tiny store and they couldn&#x27;t make exact change then yes, they&#x27;d have an issue.<p>Also, liquor (and maybe beer) I think may have changed. I haven&#x27;t seen a beer&#x2F;liquor machine since 2016 but the one I saw then required an id card to prove you were old enough to buy. Tobacco too apparently (I don&#x27;t pay attention to cigarette machines)<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ja.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Taspo" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ja.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Taspo</a>')
