Do the latest EVs have a way of pulling realtime availability data from the network, or do you have to use a phone app? (Or is it not possible at all?)<p>IMO, more important than catching up to Tesla&#x27;s headstart in total number of chargers, is just to have reliable station information before you arrive. This doesn&#x27;t have to work on every network-- just <i>enough</i> of them to trust the system. I won&#x27;t say it&#x27;s trivial, but it should be fairly easy to work towards. Each network needs to have a way of exposing charger status, and the vehicles need the software to query them. Again, they don&#x27;t need to support every single possible charger vendor, but the more the better.<p>The user won&#x27;t (usually) care if they are unaware of a few chargers they could have used, but they want data on the ones they plan to use, and they want that data to be accurate.')
