In my company, the teams using Python run circles around the teams using C++ and Java. The Python teams ship higher quality stuff that is both more reliable (it turns out that lack of a compiler for various static checks not only doesn’t make anything more reliable, but also slows things down unreasonably on large code bases), and easier to modify and adapt to changing requirements.')
