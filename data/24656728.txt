He was evasive and politely changed the topic so yeah, I still have zero information. I guess that&#x27;s the right approach.<p>If I has asked him if he knew the name of the monastery as opposed to whether the entire story was a canard, I probably could have gotten further. By foolishly asking if it was a story, I think he fell back on the &quot;zero information&quot; strategy - as in, even if it&#x27;s real and he&#x27;s living a solemn life of meditation, don&#x27;t say anything.
