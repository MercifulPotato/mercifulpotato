The dozen or so hours of academic instruction is only a fraction of the college experience that one pays for.  Socialization, library access, gym access, athletics, dining services, student clubs and a whole other host of services and facilities that are denied to students during &quot;remote learning&quot; represent substantial value that students are paying for but no longer receiving.  This is even more egregious when many students are going deeply into debt in order to pay their tuition.')
