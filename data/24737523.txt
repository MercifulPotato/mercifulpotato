It’s a well-known theme however, consider Game of Thrones: a dragon queen frees the oppressed of the world with a movement to make all the societies a better place, until it is revealed that she’s actually just power-hungry and wants to control it all, even if it means destroying it all. Sometimes you have to wait to the end to put the beginning motivations in context. I would argue that the famous 1984 commercial was motivated more by jealousy, that another company was ruling the industry, and not them.')
