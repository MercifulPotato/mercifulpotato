Broadly speaking, prescribed burns are thwarted by a mix of local objections to smoke, noise and traffic ... and environmental objections relating to specific watersheds, protected species and (literally) individual birds that are witnessed in the burn area.[1]  Remember:  this is California - these people didn&#x27;t move here to not have their very, very specific voice, and preferences, heard and respected.  (I kid because I love)<p>&quot;But these massive fires over the last month are approaching that million acre number: does anyone know if next year we will be safer because of those fires?&quot;<p>I can&#x27;t speak to &quot;safer&quot; but, absolutely there will be less fuel to burn next year.  Almost the <i>entire land area</i> of Napa County has burned this year.  I suspect they can skate for many decades on this (rapid, violent) fuels reduction.<p>Personally, as the owner of 25-ish acres of wooded land in this area (Marin County), I am not waiting.  We are <i>simulating</i> fire by dramatically reducing fuel loads on our lands.  I am assuming these forests will burn and trying to reduce the speed and intensity of that eventual fire.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.newyorker.com&#x2F;magazine&#x2F;2019&#x2F;08&#x2F;26&#x2F;a-trailblazing-plan-to-fight-california-wildfires" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.newyorker.com&#x2F;magazine&#x2F;2019&#x2F;08&#x2F;26&#x2F;a-trailblazing...</a>')
