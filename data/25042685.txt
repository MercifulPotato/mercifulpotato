Remote work doesn&#x27;t work for sandwich artists or mechanics. However, there are so many jobs that do not require you to physically interact with anything other than your computer. Not just software engineering jobs. This doesn&#x27;t mean that none of the hardware jobs can&#x27;t be remote, just the ones that requires regular interaction with tools that cannot be shipped to engineers. Consider how much money companies save by not paying rent for large office space. If that money is redirected to making sure their remote employees can upgrade their workspace and send the necessary tools, then many of these can still work out.<p>Remote work doesn&#x27;t have to mean multi-country workforce. It can be same country, same state or even same state within 1-2 hrs driving distance. There is a lot of talk about in the office once or twice a week.<p>As far as social cues that you can only pick up in person. I haven&#x27;t struggled with this at all. I&#x27;m not sure if that means I miss those cues in person so I&#x27;m not noticing or I&#x27;m capable of picking them up on a video call. Could it be possible that those cues are not actually that important?<p>I do feel bad for my single friends who live alone. During the pandemic they have been very isolated and very lonely. I understand that an office environment might have been more enjoyable for them. However, from a business perspective, perhaps there are better alternatives to solve this problem than require everyone to come into the office and sit on site 5 days a week. I actually think this will say more about how people chose to dwell then how the office space should work.')
