It&#x27;s often both educational and entertaining to kibitz high profile players and participate in the play commentary and banter.<p>The downside is that people can kibitz their own table (if kibitzing is allowed) using an alt account. Yes, it&#x27;s a risk, but there are lots of ways to cheat online. It&#x27;s trivial to cheat using out of band communication with your partner, as a sibling comment points out, or use a computer program to calculate odds if cheating without the knowledge of your partner.<p>So the whole thing is built on an honor system.')
