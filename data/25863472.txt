Item(by='javajosh', descendants=None, kids=[25863590], score=None, time=1611259347, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25861998, text='I remember a story about someone getting arrested for &quot;child porn&quot; going through an airport when some TSA agent found a video of a mans kids taking a bath on his phone. I&#x27;m not sure what happened in that case, but it has made me a) hesitant to take similar video and photos of my kids (even though bathtime is really fun and I want memories! My parents have <i>plenty</i> of bathtime pics of me as a kid, and I&#x27;m glad!), and b) a lot more skeptical whenever I hear someone claim &quot;child porn&quot;. Similar to how &quot;registered sex offender&quot; has lost a great deal of weight since apparently cities around the country apply this label to drunk people pissing on buildings.<p>This doesn&#x27;t invalidate ALL such labels, it only means that the label itself is NOT ENOUGH for me to assume I know what happened. In short, &quot;the system&quot; has lost its credibility with me. (The same applies to other labels like &quot;convicted felon&quot; or &quot;ever arrested&quot;. The ease with which these labels are applied, especially as the result of a corrupt plea bargain culture, and a society where all LEOs have a &quot;marshal law bubble&quot; around them, ruin the effect for me. And I wish it ruined the effect for more people.)')
