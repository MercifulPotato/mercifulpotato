Item(by='lmm', descendants=None, kids=[25354972, 25354597], score=None, time=1607475378, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25346851, text='&gt; The problem we now have is called write skew. Our reads from the inventory view can be out of date by the time the checkout event is processed. If two users try to buy the same item at nearly the same time, they will both succeed, and we wonâ€™t have enough inventory for them both.<p>And you&#x27;ll have exactly the same problem if you&#x27;re using a traditional ACID database: the user saw the item as being available, clicked buy, but it was unavailable by the they went to get it. Using an ACID database doesn&#x27;t gain you anything; you might as well just use Kafka for everything.')
