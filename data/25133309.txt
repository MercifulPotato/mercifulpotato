They work on commission typically, so they want you have to a strong case. I would speak to you and see if you have a case. Right now though, nothing has happened and you have no case. Let the company dig their own hole or laugh it off with you. Don&#x27;t give anyone any ammunition against you. If the IT guy, your manager, external contractors, etc. catch any flak for what happened they&#x27;ll redirect the blame to you. Just hold your ground and don&#x27;t yell or get angry.<p>I also think it&#x27;s possible you&#x27;re blowing this up out of proportion and you being a temp would explain why your coworkers didn&#x27;t have your back. If they&#x27;re set on firing you, just make sure they throw you some money for the hassle. Is it possible it&#x27;s not a big deal? It is all kind of ridiculous after all.')
