They happen to have deep structure, but it&#x27;s implicit in the process and not obvious.<p>L-systems are explicit structural grammars with some simple recursion, and are much shallower. You can more or less predict the shape of a simple L-system just by looking at it. The recursion - usually not many levels - looks nice because we like modulated repetition. And some natural systems seem to have evolved similar macro-level structures. But they&#x27;re pretty trivial conceptually.<p>Cellular automata are part way between the two.<p>None of the above really evolve, because they don&#x27;t support natural selection or recombination.<p>There&#x27;s a class of solution-explorers called genetic algorithms which were a thing before ML (kind of...) took over a similar space. GAs do evolve, but they&#x27;re not particularly efficient and they suffer from the usual problem of getting stuck in local maxima.<p>It turns out that for <i>interesting</i> and open-ended evolution you need a much bigger parameter space than any of these toy algos - like the one nature has - and current computing can&#x27;t handle that (yet).')
