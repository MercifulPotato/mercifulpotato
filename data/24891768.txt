One major reason for this is &quot;no one wants their launch complex to glow&quot;, which is a major downside of the currently feasible nuclear rocket engines with &gt;&gt;1 TWR. (Orion drive, which is throwing nukes out the back and riding the shockwave, and the Nuclear Salt Water Rocket, which is like that but continuous via a standing nuclear detonation in streams of enriched Uranium salts in water)<p>Once you&#x27;re in space, ISP matters a lot more than TWR, and is the main limiting factor on how far you can get with a given mass fraction. Nuclear rockets generally have ISPs at least double that of the current best high-thrust engines, hydrolox. (hydrogen+liquid oxygen)')
