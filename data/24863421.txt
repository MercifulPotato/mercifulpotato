Item(by='ascar', descendants=None, kids=[24863484], score=None, time=1603401617, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24863243, text='&gt; * set pw length beyond 128 back<p>What&#x27;s your usecase for such long passwords? 55 lower case ASCII characters (a-z) have over 258 bits of entropy.<p>As an example, that&#x27;s more than the key length of AES-256. If my limited understanding is correct that would mean it gives no additional brute-force resistance to use a password longer than 55 lower case characters for anything AES-256 encrypted (and thus also for anything weaker than AES-256). Similar logic should apply if the password gets hashed to 256 bits or less (e.g. SHA-256 or bcrypt with 192bits).')
