That&#x27;s Apple&#x27;s real accomplishmentâ€”they made an ARM chip that is (very) competitive with modern x86 processors, but which has the power efficiency typical of ARM.<p>Will a competitor beat them in two years? It&#x27;s possible, but I expect Apple to keep their lead for a while. CPU-wise, the iPhone has been well ahead of competitors for several years (even as other specs like memory lag behind), and no one else appears to be making serious inroads in this space.')
