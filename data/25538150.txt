The end with these &quot;tools&quot; now is to limit death, but the means aren&#x27;t working well (in the west, anyways). In a traditional auth. situation, the end is usually perpetual power and&#x2F;or some ideological bend (genocide or something).<p>Anyways, what I&#x27;m trying to say is that I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;re in a traditional auth. situation now. It&#x27;s a classic &quot;never attribute to malice that which can be adequately explained by stupidity&quot; in my mind.<p>Sure we&#x27;re seeing some signs of government overreach, but the impetus is to save lives, not some consipriacy to control the masses. Doing so misses the mark and distracts from the real issue at hand.')
