It might be subjective, but floats often seem to result in cleaner CSS, even taking into account the clearfix hack (which becomes much simpler with a Sass mixin).<p>Suppose you have the following desktop layout:<p><pre><code>    ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE\n</code></pre>\nand you want to turn it into the following mobile layout:<p><pre><code>    O   N   E\n    TWO THREE\n    FOUR FIVE\n</code></pre>\nWith floats, you can achieve that by overriding only a few properties, primarily &#x27;width&#x27;. But if you asked me to do it with either flexbox or grid, I&#x27;d have to think for a bit.<p>Flexbox is good for things that need internal flexibility in one dimension. Grid is for things that have a relatively static, two-dimensional layout. Floats are perfect for things that need to shuffle across dimensions, and I don&#x27;t see any reason to avoid using them. After all, it&#x27;s not as if floats are un-semantic or anything.')
