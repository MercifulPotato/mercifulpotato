Doesn&#x27;t mean you should run it like that.<p>You can, as soon as you receive a request, hash the IP address and store the hash instead of storing the cleartext IP. If there is no way of reversing the hash (which there shouldn&#x27;t, wouldn&#x27;t be much of a hash then), you&#x27;re not storing any IP anymore, and it&#x27;s not personal data.<p>Strikes me as very weird someone who supposed to be high-level developer or employee at one of the biggest companies in the world don&#x27;t know how not build applications that stores personal information. But since that company is Google, it hardly surprises anyone.')
