It will mean harder work for less pay, fewer promos, and less autonomy.<p>I&#x27;d argue an organization needs to reward these things properly to happen. People won&#x27;t give up promo to do right by the business, the business needs to give promo for the right things. If nothing changes then it&#x27;s far more likely the company is in deep trouble long-term.')
