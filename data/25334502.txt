I lived in the bay area since high school, more than two decades ago. Last year I finally moved away from it for good. Not far, just to the Greater Sacramento area. (I&#x27;ve been working remotely for a couple years, well before COVID) Qualify of life improvement is huge. Weather and cultural are important reasons for me to stay in California (plus family and friends), and I still get that here. (in fact, I prefer weather in Sac -- real summers&#x2F;not chilly, and winters are similar to the bay area). My house now is easily 1&#x2F;3 the cost of a similar one in the peninsula or 1&#x2F;2 the cost of a similar one in east bay.')
