That seems like a decrease in demand to me. I think an increase in supply in this context would be e.g. an increase in the amount of music and movies being produced.<p>Low-end smartphones: Apple’s charging record prices for its new iPhones so I don’t think the availability of low-end smartphones caused any sort of crash in the price of smartphones. Rather, it’s a new market category.<p>Operating system software: I’m not sure what you’re getting at here. The price of Windows has been relatively stable for decades despite the availability of free alternatives like GNU&#x2F;Linux.

I don’t think it’s ever been popular to charge separately for the operating system on mobile phones.')
