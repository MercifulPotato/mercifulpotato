Netflix still has to go through the same processes as movie companies regardless if their specific IP is exclusive to their platform. My point was that they don&#x27;t have exclusivity when it comes to providing that content which is not the case with Microsoft&#x27;s XCloud, for example. All of that content is only available from Microsoft because every game on the platform has to be licensed by Microsoft.')
