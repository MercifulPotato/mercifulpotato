Maybe they <i>ought</i> not to be, but they are.<p>Of course, your main point stands that companies generally shouldn&#x27;t hire based on an employee&#x27;s political opinions (unless it&#x27;s a PR&#x2F;representative position or such), outspoken or not, but let&#x27;s use the correct terminology here:<p>publicly stating political stuff under your real name is more than just &quot;having an opinion&quot;.')
