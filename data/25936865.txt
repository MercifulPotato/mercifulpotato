They can squeeze shorts because they target <i>trash</i> stocks of failing businesses (you know -- the stocks that get shorted), then create a positively <i>ridiculous</i> story about a value proposition. A bunch of moron retail investors on Reddit aren&#x27;t going to do shit to squeeze shorts, but they&#x27;re the front for a couple of very well financed players.<p>But...something something Nancy Pelosi.
