If microsoft built all of the computer hardware in the world, as well, then there is absolutely no way that society would let them engage in anti-competitive practices.  Instead, that would be even <i>worse</i>, as it would show microsoft having even more market power.<p>Take a look at the railroads as a similar example.  The railroad companies built their own railroads.<p>But obviously, even though railroad companies built their own railroads, they still got hit with anti-trust.  The railroad companies lost.  Building the hardware, or railroads, is not a defense.<p>&gt;  Apple doesn&#x27;t seem to be leveraging their market position (in any market) to force suppliers to pay Apple even when Apple isn&#x27;t involved.<p>Sure they are.  Once someone owns a phone, it now belongs to them.  It no longer belongs to Apple.  Apple is no longer involved in any way, with the hardware that the consumer now owns.  That is now Apple getting involved in a different market.<p>&gt;  Sony makes their own gaming hardware<p>From a high level I would not say that Sony has nearly the same amount of market power as Apple does.  Thats why the same arguments don&#x27;t apply.  It has nothing to do with them making hardware.<p>But, on the other hand, if there were only 1 major game platform, then anti-trust law would <i>absolutely</i> apply.  If only xBoxes existed, then they would have significant market power.<p>&gt; but not Sony or Microsoft. I think it&#x27;s a good question.<p>The reason is because Apple has way more market power than the playstation and the xbox.  Thats it.<p>&gt; a strong case against the iOS App Store<p>The very strong case is that it is very clear that Apple has significant market power.  That is the only thing that matters.  The only thing that matters, at all, is that Apple clearly has significant market power, and that means that it cannot engage in certain actions.<p>There is nothing at all in the sherman anti-trust act that says &quot;If you build the hardware entirely, then you can engage in anti-competitive actions&quot;.<p>Please show be the paragraph in that law, that says that.  It does not exist.  The only thing that matters is market power.<p>&gt;  I think Apple is too big<p>I don&#x27;t care about them being big. Instead what I want is for them to not engage in anti competitive practices.<p>&gt; we need to do something, and this annoys me<p>What we need to do is end the anti competitive practices, and force apple to allow all major 3rd party app stores to be installed on the iphone.<p>That is not a vague proscription. It is very specific.<p>The government needs to force Apple to allow 3rd party app stores in the same way that they forced microsoft to allow people to easily choose a different web browser.')
