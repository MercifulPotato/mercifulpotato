Item(by='tartoran', descendants=None, kids=[24841008], score=None, time=1603219370, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24840325, text='&gt; If something appears broken to you, but persists for a long time, it&#x27;s time to start considering that the apparently broken thing actually serves a purpose you can&#x27;t see to someone you don&#x27;t know.<p>What does this even imply? That someone benefits from this broken system? The recruiting firms? It is indeed broken as engineers are not happy with going through the middleman gauntlet, companies are short on developers and would ideally want to hire asap. The only problem I see for companies here is find the right candidates (filter the bad candidates) but all these obstacles don&#x27;t seem to be doing that at all. So back to the drawing board...')
