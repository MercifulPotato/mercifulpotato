Item(by='spekcular', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603853689, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24914225, text='&gt; My point is that by whatever measure pure maths is worth studying (i.e. those measure beyond &quot;practical&quot; applications) also obviously applies to HoTT.<p>Not all branches of pure mathematics are equally worthy of study. A few are essentially dead for various (good) reasons, for example.<p>&gt; There are pretty standard ways of talking about how well-regarded&#x2F;important certain subfields are in mathematics, &quot;I&#x27;ve asked around&quot; isn&#x27;t one of them.<p>How else should one figure out how well-regarded a subfield of mathematics is if not by asking members of the mathematical community?<p>&gt; His comments express a substantially different point to yours. He does not say that HoTT is a waste of time, or that it &quot;doesn&#x27;t have much content&quot;.<p>His comments support the point I intended them to support, which is that Lurie is not a huge fan of HoTT. You made a remark about well-regarded mathematicians, and I gave you comments from a well-regarded mathematician.')
