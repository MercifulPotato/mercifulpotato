And users?<p>Just giving my two cents: I don&#x27;t have any trouble contributing to AGPL projects. Mind you, I haven&#x27;t contributed much in general, but still.<p>As for <i>using</i> AGPL projects: Well, I wouldn&#x27;t want to offer someone else&#x27;s project as a service and poach potential users for the maintainers in the first place. But if I did, I wouldn&#x27;t mind contributing back any modification I made.<p>Now, using them as dependencies—for just one part of an application that you want to keep otherwise private—is a little trickier because I&#x27;m neither a lawyer nor has the AGPL been tested in court as far as I know. The crux of the issue lies on whether dynamic linking makes a piece of software derivative; the FSF thinks it does (at least from what I read in their FAQ), but <i>that</i> also hasn&#x27;t been tested in court (again, AFAIK) and one&#x27;s interpretation could be entirely different. If it isn&#x27;t derivative, then there&#x27;s no problem with using AGPL software strictly as dependency. And, if it is, well, in the world of microservices you could just create a thin wrapper over the AGPL library, run it as a service, and release only <i>that</i>.<p>Then again, if one assumed that linking doesn&#x27;t make a work derivative, then there&#x27;s not much difference between the GPL and the LGPL (once again, AFAIK). It&#x27;s a nuanced issue, to say the least.')
