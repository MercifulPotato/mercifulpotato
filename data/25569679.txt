Here&#x27;s a quick summary: they are used to store additional text for a link (whatever it might be) and can be added &#x2F; edited from the link detail page, e.g. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;demo.linkace.org&#x2F;links&#x2F;87" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;demo.linkace.org&#x2F;links&#x2F;87</a>. Although I do not use them a lot I think they can be used to add more context or details about a link without using the description. Like more details about why you added the link, how to find more details on that said link, and so on. I think this might become more powerful and useful when support for multiple users is ready. Notes can then be used like a low-level comment system.')
