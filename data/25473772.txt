IMO, it&#x27;s important for a physician to treat each case as unique, and start with conservative therapy and move to more invasive measures.<p>Now I&#x27;m doing PT yet again because I have an onset of carpal tunnel syndrome, but it looks like I&#x27;ll probably be going under the knife for it...')
