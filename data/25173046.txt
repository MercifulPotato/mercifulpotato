This is a do-ocracy. Votes are very rare and, except for systemd (2 in 10 years), are quite non-technical. The second key aspect is that you can&#x27;t force anyone to do anything. The third key aspect is the project is unable to reach any consensus (there is always someone to disagree and do enough noise for the discussion to go nowhere and we cannot vote).<p>Most of the points listed by Michael derive from that.
