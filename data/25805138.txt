If you implement an algorithm in a high level language like Python you may get much worse runtime than you thought because some inner loop does arithmetic with bignum-style performance instead of hardware integer performance, for example. In such case you could talk of big-omega (your analysis is bounded-below instead of bounded-above, asymptotically).<p>Of course, that&#x27;s why Big O says one thing, Compiler, CPU and Caches may say the other.')
