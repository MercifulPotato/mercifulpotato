Item(by='curryst', descendants=None, kids=[25426142], score=None, time=1607986454, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25422092, text='&gt; Part of why when folks say video games aren&#x27;t addicting, I ask why CoD put in the prestige system. It keeps hitting you with that dopamine of &#x27;yea, just unlocked something&#x27; which constantly throws you back into combat where something else gets unlocked.<p>It&#x27;s also part of the competition.  It&#x27;s called &quot;Prestige&quot; because having a lot of those levels is meant to be prestigious.  For me, it was closer to an MMR Ranking or KD Ratio.  It&#x27;s less about collecting the icons, and more about getting some form of external validation that you were a better player than other players.  Of course, Prestige is a bad indicator that you are a better player than other players, but it allows people who aren&#x27;t good but have a lot of time to compete on some level.<p>If this were really about &quot;yea, just unlocked something&quot; I would expect better rewards.  I haven&#x27;t played the new CoDs a lot, but from what I remember, the rewards for prestiging were largely meh, and you get most of them from low levels of prestige.  If you hit prestige 99, you&#x27;ve done a <i>lot</i> of prestiges without any unlocks (other than the bars next to your username, which no one ever looks at).')
