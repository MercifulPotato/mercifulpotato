They are a different variety of tomatoes (Roma tomatoes) that can be picked via machine. That&#x27;s also why they taste differently. The automated picking is why they are cheaper (plus the variety is better for quantity). One wouldn&#x27;t be able to sell the automatically picked tomatoes uncanned since their skin gets damaged.')
