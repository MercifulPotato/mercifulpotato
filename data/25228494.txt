You can pre-render something complex in 3D or do some complex calculations to populate a precomputed table on any computer no matter how slow, and it might be clunky and inconvenient yet still possible if it&#x27;s merely 2x or 3x slow. But if it&#x27;s something like 10000x slow doing it would pretty much be out of the question, as real-world projects (even hobbyist ones) are bound by limitations of time and budget.')
