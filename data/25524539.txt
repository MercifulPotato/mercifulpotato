In my experience, as we’ve gone far away from skeuomorphic design <i>(hey, it’s 2011 in the title, we can use that word)</i>, having those nice razor sharp minimalistic icons at 20pt&#x2F;dp or smaller sizes means you do want to draw them with care. You can notice the slop when something doesn’t fall on a nice integer position.<p>Especially as we still are not in a fully HiDPI world. I came across this the other day when I was trying to create an icon for a 5×5 matrix. Looked great on my MacBook Pro screen. And then I dragged it to my external display that I keep for testing. And oh. Yikes. I needed to tighten things up.')
