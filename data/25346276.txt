Item(by='rolfea', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607440758, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25345999, text='Well sure, most of Feldman&#x27;s work could be described as &quot;minimal&quot; but saying it is part of the body of work that is typically referred to as &quot;minimalism&quot; is a little disingenuous, in my mind.<p>But maybe it just makes it more obvious that these categories aren&#x27;t particularly useful. I think it&#x27;s interesting to talk about those early works in the 70s and compare them to minimalist art, like Judd&#x27;s or Serra&#x27;s sculptures or paintings by Sol Lewitt, Stella, etc., but it&#x27;s just a component of a much broader conversation that needs to be based in listening first.<p>It&#x27;s interesting to me that Glass&#x27; early music didn&#x27;t really click for me until I had stood inside of one of Richard Serra&#x27;s Bands sculptures at LACMA. It gave me a different mental (and metal, haha) framework to engage with the music through. That&#x27;s probably why the Berio&#x2F;Feldman comparison was so surprising to me in the first place, because I feel like the music from those composers both demand different kinds of engagement to find them enjoyable that Glass&#x27; early music, both as a listener and a performer.')
