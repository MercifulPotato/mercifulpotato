However, the transmission line rates are set by regulation. We have accepted as a society that the infrastructure needs to have regulated pricing.<p>So why is it all that different here?<p>The transmission of the products, just given the way the cellphone market works, is basically limited to either App Store or Android Store. I basically have no alternative.<p>Isn&#x27;t that approaching a monopoly &#x2F; duopoly where regulation starts to make sense?<p>I say this all as a fairly conservative person, but it just seems too similar to utilities to me...<p>Why am I wrong?
