The company has above 90% market share in datacenters. It&#x27;s not on life support by any stretch of the imagination.<p>AMD has been executing well for years and the market only recently took notice. That doesn&#x27;t mean Intel can&#x27;t benefit as the pie gets bigger, and it doesn&#x27;t mean 10nm has to be a death knell for Intel.<p>Apple released a new chip to its own fanfare, but unless you bought an M1 device or made a shopping appointment in an Apple Store (they wouldn&#x27;t even let me walk over to the MacBook when I went to pick up an online order), you don&#x27;t have much reliable information outside of what some tech journalists have posted on the internet.')
