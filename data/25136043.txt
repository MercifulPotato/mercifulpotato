I also find it darkly amusing that GTD is basically a system for dealing with IM tools, phone and email for people who feel they have no choice (they totally have a choice; it is a bullshit paradigm -even the president has plenty of goof off time).<p>I have no place else to say so, but latency in zoom is annoying as fuck, and it totally didn&#x27;t happen with twisted pair. Back in 2016 times, I insisted on twisted pair meetings. Even then, dipshits with ipotatos on wifi would find a way to fuck it up. Now a days, even I don&#x27;t have access to twisted pair, so we&#x27;re in a new dark age, similar to how old fashioned 7 gallon flush toilet bowls were vastly superior to the atrocities we have now. Most people only dimly aware of what has been taken away from us in the name of &quot;progress.&quot;')
