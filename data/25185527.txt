Item(by='quietbritishjim', descendants=None, kids=[25193764], score=None, time=1606129303, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25180819, text='&gt; The purpose of the signature is to create an artifact that demonstrates the signatory’s acceptance.<p>This sentence is correct but subtly conflates two elements, essentially contained in the respective words &quot;signatory’s&quot; and &quot;acceptance&quot;:<p>* It proves the signatory&#x27;s <i>identity</i> i.e. it was this person that agreed to the contract rather than some other person.<p>* It proves actual <i>agreement</i> i.e. this wasn&#x27;t just a draft contract that we were still in the process of negotiating, but the final contract we had settled on.<p>If it came to court and the first one, identity, was in dispute then a signature is fairly unlikely to resolve that, at least on its own. But if the second point was in dispute &quot;yeah I know I said that but it was conditional on blah blah other thing&quot; then a signature on a contract makes that much harder to argue. The second one is very similar to what the parent comment said: the fact the signatory went through the ritual shows that they understood they were actually agreeing to precisely those conditions.')
