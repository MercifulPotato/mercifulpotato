I think the extent to which our society esteems neutral institutions (&quot;neutral&quot; within some reasonable error margin) is the extent to which we can see a reversal of Trumpism (and probably the woke progressivism that preceded it). There&#x27;s always a fringe, but I yearn for the days when extremist viewpoints were (rightly) marginalized.')
