If you create something worthwhile with it, you cannot exactly include it in your product. I get that you can create something like a one off garage opener based on face recognition, but you won&#x27;t learn any real world knowledge of developing a product and if you later on decide that this is something for you, you&#x27;ll have to learn a whole new ecosystem.\nThese devices remind me of &quot;game maker&quot; software claiming you could make your own game with it, but you were limited with what developer had in store for you and you wouldn&#x27;t become a game developer from using it.')
