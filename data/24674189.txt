There is almost never any evidence that can distinguish beyond a reasonable doubt non-consensual sex from consensual sex.  It is almost always the word of one party against the word of another.  However, like the previous examples of police impropriety, that has no bearing on the validity of the accusations.  Victims should feel welcome to come forward with their experiences regardless of the likelihood of their accusations resulting in a conviction.')
