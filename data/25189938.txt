(This can help a lot for OS upgrades, replacing failing hardware, disk upgrades, etc. on a running cluster.)<p>Likewise, you can develop + test your containers on a more performant or convenient machine (like a PineBook Pro, or VMC on a Chromebook) and deploy to the Pi(s) without having to manually map your FS layout, dependencies, etc. to Raspbian or another Pi-specific distro.<p>It&#x27;s not something you _need_ to do, necessarily, but neither does that mean there isn&#x27;t value, esp. for folks already comfortable with a container-based deployment workflow.')
