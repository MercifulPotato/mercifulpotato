That doesn&#x27;t seem right.<p>I can&#x27;t remember exactly where I heard it, but I believe robust herd immunity in human populations has never been achieved for a virus like this without the widespread use of a vaccine.  Which makes sense, because there&#x27;s evolutionary pressure on viruses to adapt, and so many diseases remained endemic and common until vaccines where introduced for them.<p>Edit: in response to the dead reply: the Spanish Flu didn&#x27;t disappear.  It killed tens of millions (out of a much smaller world population) and persisted for decades as a seasonal flu.  IIRC, it didn&#x27;t get eclipsed by other strains until the 50s.')
