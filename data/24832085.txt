It&#x27;s okay for a kid to be lazy. It&#x27;s probably not great for a <i>homeschooled</i> kid to be lazy, but you can invent games and rewards and other incentives and make this work.<p>But it&#x27;s irresponsible parenting to allow your homeschooled kid to be illiterate at 10. You&#x27;re not going to convince me otherwise with comparisons to lazy parents not wanting to read your boring emails. It is <i>so obviously</i> not the same thing.<p>The whole concept behind unschooling is that you allow a child to find the things that <i>they</i> find interesting, and then allow them to voraciously teach themselves as much as they can, as fast as they can. This doesn&#x27;t work <i>at all</i> if your  kid can&#x27;t read.')
