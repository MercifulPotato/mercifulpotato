Anything else you could do is just moving your problem upstream. Throw a connection pooler in front of the database and have the users connect to that? Well sure, you could that. But doesn&#x27;t really help you. You now can tell the database to only accept connections from this pooler, but now you are just moved your whitelist management problem upstream to the connection pooler, if you don&#x27;t whitelist manage the pooler, then you are effectively just exposing the database to the open internet.')
