My other concern is if something happened to me it would be much harder for my spouse to figure out than Quicken.  However I have used beancount, fava and python to do my own financial planning i.e. what will my income, expenses, and taxes be in future, and being able to have different inflation assumptions for say medical care vs say food or transportation, as well as to have different return assumptions for index funds, vs bonds or savings.  They are really great tools.')
