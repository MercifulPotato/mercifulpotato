Item(by='kokey', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604396143, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24977464, text='We already tax people and most of the noise about companies not paying tax basically ignores that because it makes a good headline.  I&#x27;m of the opinion that taxes on corporations are a bit of a nonsense tax.  If they sell goods or services, there&#x27;s sales tax.  If their employees and shareholders receive salaries and profits, they get income and dividend tax.  When we see a headline of a company paying almost no taxes, they&#x27;ve usually paid more in sales taxes and their staff and shareholders will be paying more in taxes than corporation taxes can ever dream of bringing in.  Taxes on profits is difficult, profits can be moved easily.  Tax profits too much and companies simply won&#x27;t make any profits.  Sales tax is good since it goes to the actual market the product is sold into, it&#x27;s the cost of having access to that market.  Income&#x2F;dividend taxes brings in the money where the employees and shareholders live and spend their money, so it&#x27;s the cost of benefiting from the society they live in.  We can quibble about loopholes and levels around those taxes because they make sense, but corporation taxes is never going to bring in enough money to warrant all the noise.')
