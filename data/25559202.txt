Asia are the benefactors of a weaker China and they too begin to modernize as the whole Species stands to benefit from that and we decouple from the CCP&#x27;s violent and belligerent stance against the World.<p>There are plenty of belligerent countries in those regions, it&#x27;s just that they&#x27;re not considered important enough for their saber-rattling to be noticed internationally, and their enemies tend to be sub-national groups formed around shared ethnicity, control of resources (drugs, oil, mines) or religion who are even less likely to attract attention.<p>By now, lots of people have heard about Mexican drug cartels, Kurdistan or Joseph Kony&#x27;s &quot;Lord&#x27;s Resistance Army&quot;, but who cared about the Houthis in Yemen before their civil war turned into an international proxy war? Who could&#x27;ve predicted the civil war in Ethiopia? And who knows whether the Movement for the Autonomy of Kabylie, the Naga nationalist movement, the Wa state or the Free Papua Movement will be next to make international news?<p>Modernization doesn&#x27;t guarantee peace and democracy; it also means higher availability of more powerful or more, cheaper weapons. Combined with population growth, even small areas are able to raise substantial armies, while declining resources (relative to population) incentivize wars to secure a larger slice of the pie.<p>I expect that we&#x27;ll continue to see large countries only held together by shared colonial history disintegrate violently into smaller regions with more complex borders.')
