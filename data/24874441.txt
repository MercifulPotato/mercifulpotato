And Presidential elections have been decided by less.<p>Moreover, both of the parties are a product of the election map. If the map changes, it doesn&#x27;t <i>destroy</i> one of the parties, it <i>changes</i> both of them, to get the balance back. If Republicans started getting 20 of California&#x27;s delegates, Democrats would change their policies until they were getting those 20 back somewhere else. They&#x27;d stop pussyfooting around on climate change so they can save Florida from ending up underwater and put those 29 in the solid blue column, or dump a big jobs program in Ohio and get those, or start paying attention to the plight of the rural poor.<p>Or the Republicans would realize they could stand to <i>lose</i> some votes they currently have to get, stop being so inconsistent about at the same time claiming to want smaller government while never actually making it smaller, and actually gore somebody&#x27;s ox.<p>You need 270 to win. 300 means you gave somebody something you didn&#x27;t have to. 240 means you didn&#x27;t give somebody something you did have to.')
