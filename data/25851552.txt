I&#x27;ve also never spent any significant amount of time in SV or engaging with SV culture (besides this website).<p>What I have is anecdotes and idle thoughts: most of my STEM peers were laser focused on their majors and avoided the humanities (and even other STEM topics) like the plague. The university I went to enabled and even encouraged this, since it makes their alumni statistics look great and kept the four-year-graduation-to-tech-job machine well-oiled.<p>I have a difficult time assigning immediate blameworthiness when talking about this: it&#x27;s frustrating to hear tech people disregard things just because they fail to adapt them, but it strikes me as a failure of education rather than a solely personal failure.')
