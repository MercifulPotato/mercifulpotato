I <i>know</i> about Emacs+SLIME, I know about paredit, I&#x27;ve seen it in action and it&#x27;s impressive, I just can&#x27;t force myself to expand the energy to dive into the Emacs eco-system.<p>And yes I&#x27;ve tried vim fireplace and Cursive and VSCode&#x27;s latest ...whatever.....but they all just feel &quot;wrong&quot; in a way, like a square peg in a round hole.<p>I feel if I could just spend enough time to really understand Emacs and all of it&#x27;s LISP-yness goodness, I&#x27;d enjoy LISPs a lot more and use them more in daily work')
