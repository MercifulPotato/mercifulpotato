I do not use the NVIDIA card for video output because the proprietary driver would regularly stop showing my desktop - or suddenly any output at all after reboot.<p>The integrated Intel GPU on my laptop is mostly without issues whatsoever.<p>On laptops I would still recommend Intel GPUs anyway for power consumption reasons - although AMD APUs are quite interesting and I don&#x27;t have recent knowledge about how well they compare. The CPU and its ability to lower power consumption under sleep is also relevant there, and this was <i>way</i> better under Intel so far. Unless you need the increase in performance an AMD GPU&#x2F;APU would offer...')
