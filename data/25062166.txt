I hope that all of this &quot;computing&quot; under restricted and profitable for megalithic corporations trend will end soon. But the problem is that majority of users cannot comprehend the damage. General Users are like kids in a candy store, they will grab everything shiny and sweet without thinking twice. My other concern is cancel culture in new developer&#x2F;designer&#x2F;engineer generations. They simply don&#x27;t care. Critical thinking is something from the past. Apple ideas for future of computing are &quot;give us money&quot;. Suddenly everything thats important is iOS and vertical integration. This strategy was evident when they postponed making of Mac Pro for years. As a designer I have only one problem: I don&#x27;t like Windows at all. I can live happily with Linux desktop but I need graphical software as good at least as Affinity Designer. So I have a big request: If someone here is close to Affinity management, take a note I will pay the price of current Affinity Designer x2 for a chance to run it under Linux. :)')
