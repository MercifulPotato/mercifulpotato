It&#x27;s my own anecdata and I&#x27;m sure others still have great experiences, but I got three places in a row that were being operated as something like short-term tenement housing with everything at the bare minimum quality and cleanliness. Charging hundred euro cleaning fees and then leaving a bad review that there were dirty dishes left in the sink, which apparently we were foolish to assume would be included in whatever expensive cleaning service they were using. An expensive apartment that was not cleaned between stays, that had no cleaning supplies in the apartment and the owner was out of the country, and then the owner complained that it was still dirty when we left.<p>Popularity has ruined it in my opinion.')
