So the PS5 will also benefit from the great games coming on PS4. The prices of the games would be the same, you would benefit from the same experience of the devs developing on the PS4. The only disadvantage is that the PS5 will be pricer. And it will also be less ecological-friendly if you intend to buy an used PS4. But that&#x27;s it.')
