And if that was happening in an &#x27;enemy&#x27; state we&#x27;d have no problem seeing it for what it is.<p>And now I find that simply expressing this opinion on HN, even under a 10,000+ word criticism of the CIA, results in:<p>a) account [pmachinery] being banned from posting, and (even more sinister):<p>b) being presented with Google tracking&#x2F;captcha on login<p>This has all been very illuminating at least.')
