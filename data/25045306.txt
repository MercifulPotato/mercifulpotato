If I design a printer, whether inkjet or any other type, I probably design it to some pretty tight tolerances in terms of the ink or toner. So I probably don&#x27;t want people to drop in cartridges where the manufacturing tolerances might be way off the mark as they might well cause issues with the performance. That I as the manufacturer might be asked to fix, also possibly gaining a reputation for poor quality in the process. Yes, you might reasonably point out that OEM cartridges are expensive, but it&#x27;s far from a monopoly out there, isn&#x27;t it? In some ways, the expense of printing could be considered to be a good thing. Because it&#x27;s a disincentive to the production of waste paper. Just my 2 cents worth :)')
