It&#x27;s an NP-complete problem, but we can still realistically hope that researchers might discover efficient algorithms for solving subsets of the problem space, hopefully broad subsets.<p>If we get to the point that 90% of travelling salesman problems can be solved quickly, and the remaining 10% can quickly be <i>approximately</i> solved (to within 5% percent of the optimum solution, say), that would be pretty great, even if we never &#x27;really&#x27; crack NP-complete problems. (Which, of course, might not even be possible.)<p>As an example, a smart TSP algorithm should be able to very quickly solve problems where all nodes fall on points in a circle.<p>(Disclaimer: this stuff isn&#x27;t my wheelhouse, corrections welcome.)')
