Thats a lot of cars on the road, a lot of people waiting in lines, a lot of hotel rooms and vacation rentals taken up. I made up these numbers of course, but the point is with a state like California, even a tiny fraction of the population visiting at any given time, it&#x27;s still an overwhelming number of people to deal with. And its not even just Californians that go to Tahoe -- plenty of folks from other states visit, and plenty of international visitors too.<p>So back to<p>&gt; Nobody goes there anymore, it&#x27;s too crowded<p>Yep, practically speaking, a tiny fraction of people that can go to Tahoe at any time actually go -- a rounding error -- &#x27;nobody&#x27;. But it&#x27;s still too damned crowded because Tahoe can&#x27;t handle the rounding error anymore.')
