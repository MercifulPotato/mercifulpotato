Take it for what its worth but what I learned from Intels Andrew Groves book &quot;High Output Management&quot; book is that the output of a manager is the output of his team&#x2F;org and team&#x2F;org under their influence.<p>&gt; Finally, CEOs are terrible examples. More than any other title, CEO is an echelon which once reached, by whatever means, seems to ensure that the title holder can almost do no wrong.<p>I disagree here. I think the CEO is a very good example since if they do something wrong, it would be very visible and that&#x27;s why even high profile CEOs get fired. See Uber or WeWork or even now, Intel for example.')
