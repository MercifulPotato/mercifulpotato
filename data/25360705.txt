I just thought I&#x27;d mention that in case the admin would be here and interested.<p>It&#x27;s causing a download extension in my browser to show a download dialog on clicking the link. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a bug in the extension, but rather a required behavior because of the limitations of extensions. The extension has no sure way to know what my browser&#x27;s treatment of the response will be after it inspects the body content to guess the type, so the safer thing to do in its case is to show the dialog.<p>I don&#x27;t think Content-Type is required by HTTP, but it&#x27;s pretty rare for servers to not include it. Might be good to add it if only in interest of the Robustness Principle[1].<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Robustness_principle" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Robustness_principle</a>')
