It&#x27;s meaningless because if there was a scientist questioning global warming they wouldn&#x27;t be able to hold a related job or get funding. Additionally, people tend to conform, especially in fields where your career depends on your reputation. For example, the scientific consensus prior to World War 1 was that citrus didn&#x27;t cure scurvy, even though it had been doing so for hundreds of years prior and had been scientifically proven before.[1] So people started dying from scurvy again. Even the very well prepared, intelligent polar explorers were unable to deal with it properly even though they researched and planned for it, because they relied on the consensus of the scientific community instead of good science.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mentalfloss.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;24149&#x2F;how-scurvy-was-cured-then-cure-was-lost" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mentalfloss.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;24149&#x2F;how-scurvy-was-cur...</a>')
