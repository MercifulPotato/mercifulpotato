But its just putting EEG electrodes on the skull to record frequency ranges in the brain. These frequencies(Delta, Gamma and Alpha) relate to the &quot;focus&quot;, &quot;relaxation&quot;(related to meditation) and &quot;cross-talk&quot; functions of the brain that primarily are controlled by the Sensory-Motor Cortex.<p>There are many different programs all with different goals, some try to optimize the relax range, some focus and some try to minimize cross talk. Imagine looking at a screen and it shows your POV from inside a roller coaster car. On the sides you can see a bar chart going up and down and a threshold level you want to attain. Eventually you learn to control it so you bring that bar to the threshold and hold it (Holding it is key). If your really motivated you can tell the technicians to bring the threshold down so far that you are able to focus greater than the average person.<p>It begins by controlling muscles in your eyes effectively, once movements of the eyes have stabilized(this is the hyperactivity part that negatively effects focus) light can effectively move into the visual cortex. Then tying the other senses(sound and touch) together probably switches on the focus networks in the brain. This leads to experiencing reality at much higher &quot;resolution&quot;.<p>I would advise having professionals around(like I did) they can spot problems&#x2F;anomalies and can aid in training. It can be dangerous to mess with your brain without professionals around.')
