I should not have to throw away a perfectly functional device because developers can&#x27;t be bothered to cut back on dependencies for their plain-text site.<p>Developers think that because they&#x27;re separated from the waste they&#x27;re causing, they&#x27;re not causing waste. Bloated sites accelerate the obsolescence of perfectly good devices, leading to people discarding them long before they actually have reached the end of their life.<p>(The reason I get by is because I have uBlock origin blocking large media elements. Most people don&#x27;t know how to do that.)')
