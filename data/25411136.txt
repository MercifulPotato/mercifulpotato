Yet many people successfully learned Languages there. It is far below a University or a poly-technical college. It has nothing do do with a real degree.<p>FUN FACT: I read once a Serbian guy took a course there in Economics, had the certificate translated into Serbian and the translator translated &quot;Volkshochschule&quot;,  to &quot;Peoples University&quot; and became an Economics professor with this certifica in Serbia until the whole scam became public.<p>To give you the perspective: Basically every guy here on Hackernews could give a &quot;Python course&quot; there or something. for 2 hours every week for 6 months and one of the attendees would manage to become a CS professor with this.')
