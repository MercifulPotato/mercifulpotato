A <i>real</i> attempt at fascism would have had much better armed and organized attackers.  This was a self-directed mob, which was bad enough; real fascism would have had quasi-official orchestration instead of letting people freelance.  That lack of the real power behind it makes me question your narrative.<p>But I see how quickly and how broadly conservative people are getting muzzled and vilified.  I can to some degree see sense in taking away the microphone (and networking apparatus) between now and Jan 20.  On the other hand, I can see it becoming the start of a witch hunt.  How far are you going to go to shut down conservative voices, and for how long?  The fact that it&#x27;s hitting Ron Paul indicates to me that it is over-reaching reasonable bounds, even for the short term.')
