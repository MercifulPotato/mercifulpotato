Item(by='ardy42', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603218479, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24839101, text='&gt; Apple seems to do all kinds of weird networking _stuff_. For instance, during wakeup, your T2 equipped Macbook will wait for a DNS response and then use said DNS response to synchronize time via NTP before letting the user use the keyboard. Probably checking timestamps on signatures for the keyboard firmware, or something stupid like that. This only happens if it happens to have a default route.<p>When did they start doing this?  I&#x27;m still using High Sierra on my 2018 MBP work laptop, because the keyboard and trackpad was freezing for anywhere up to 5 minutes or more with Mojave after a wakeup (usually after a long sleep).  Downgrading to High Sierra fixed it, but fighting with the machine was such a pain I haven&#x27;t dared touch it since.<p>I&#x27;m wondering if you&#x27;re describing the problem I was having, but could never figure out.')
