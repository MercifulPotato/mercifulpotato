The same is true of Excel: people already have it and are using it, so they just organically start learning the more advanced things you can do with it, and before long they&#x27;re basically programming.<p>We aren&#x27;t talking about people who make a concerted decision to &quot;go find and install a tool for programming&quot;, and who just don&#x27;t want to put in the effort to learn the &quot;real tools&quot;. We&#x27;re talking about people who would never think of themselves as programmers in the first place. I think you underestimate the significance of the small barriers, even ones as small as a search-and-install step.<p>I do think it would be silly to drop Node into Chrome wholesale, since the bulk of Node is V8, which is the JS engine Chrome already includes. But what about a version of the JS console that&#x27;s designed to be exposed to everyday users, for interaction with the sites they use every day? What about a button on the New Tab screen for opening an interactive web dev space similar to CodePen, which can trivially save the resulting files to the local file system (and load projects from there)? They could re-use most of the GUI components from the existing Sources tab in the dev tools. What if it included a preconfigured (simplified) reactive front-end framework so people could get started making custom GUIs?
