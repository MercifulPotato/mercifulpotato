What we should demand of these projects instead is &quot;we can provide this amount of renewable power 24&#x2F;7&quot;. There is a big difference. We&#x27;re ending up in a situation where we can &quot;build renewable power at a fraction of the price&quot; for half of the time. For the other half we rely on fossil fuels but we don&#x27;t see the issue because we&#x27;re focused on the amount of clean watts we get at peak.')
