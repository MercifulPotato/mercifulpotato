I don&#x27;t know where they came from or why I&#x27;ve never seen them here in Australia.<p>Apart from that, I had delicious small homegrown ones as a kid, and the occasional almost or totally tasteless medium-sized ones from shops ever since. I always wonder how it feels to be a farmer growing totally tasteless strawberries for a living.')
