They really need to pull their collective head out of their metaphorical fanny immediately and completely unless they want to face a 20-year (at least) severe slump in market share.<p>The very same thing that Intel has done over the past decade or so (grown comfortable and lazy at the #1 position) will happen to Apple as well if they take the #1 position by any significant margin for any significant amount of time.  Companies stop innovating the instant they no longer need to.<p>And, until these CPUs are available outside of the Apple ecosystem they are effectively non-existent to me.  I can&#x27;t stand OSX or Apple&#x27;s recent laptop designs.')
