Imagine having a web browser that didn&#x27;t have tabs, that&#x27;s how bad this is.\n- No preview in explorer. Mac has this awesome feature where you press space and it gives a quick overview of most files (not only images but also pdfs, .docx, ...).\n- No column view. Column view makes it much easier to navigate across directories, and back and forth between subdirectories of a root directory.')
