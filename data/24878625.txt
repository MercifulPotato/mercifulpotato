I&#x27;m explaining my personal path, I don&#x27;t want to give too much details but I&#x27;ll be happy to answer any question you have.<p>I attribute part of my earnings to luck because it&#x27;s what really happened, how do you call withdrawing some BTC before a crash that nobody was expecting?<p>Maybe in some countries is illegal to hire someone without making a job position public, I don&#x27;t know but there are plenty of company websites where you can make an open submission. If they end hiring you, is that illegal?<p>Last clarification, I&#x27;m not saying that my algorithm will continue earning 2% forever, I&#x27;m just saying that it will provide a good income <i></i>without requiring much effort<i></i>. I will try to review these last paragraphs to make the point more clear.<p>Again, thank you for offering your thoughts, I will be happy to provide more details while taking into account your feedback!')
