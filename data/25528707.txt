Personally I never learned much theory - as a child, playing piano wasn&#x27;t something I particularly enjoyed (and it&#x27;s only now as an adult that I do it occasionally for fun and appreciate the time I put in), but back then learning theory was even lower on the list.<p>I do think theory is useful for understanding the mechanics of music, and may help accelerate learning any instrument.<p>My teacher pulled a lot of material from the Royal Conservatory of Music (and I didn&#x27;t learn theory from them).  I haven&#x27;t heard of this course until today.')
