Directives are the ones that member states will need to adopt to their own laws. One example would be consumer rights directive. It gives a list of goals, but member states can decide how to archive them.<p>Regulations, like GDPR, come in effect automatically on the whole EU. One example of these, in addition to GDPR, would be various economic sanctions.<p>If someone leaves EU, they would still keep all those laws they implemented before but are free to change if they wish by following their own law making procedures. However, they would no longer need to care about any of the regulations (they may need to follow some if they wish to trade with EU). They are free to still adhere to them if they wish. They may need to adopt some laws for them if their national regulation bodies don&#x27;t have necessary rights to enforce such regulation (as earlier EU regulation would have triumphed national law).')
