It&#x27;s like makeup to me... wrinkles, freckles, scars, and everything else have never affected my perception of beauty because I tend to like an exotic, atypical appearance. Health and physical fitness have a much larger impact on attractiveness for me and all this stuff just seems like a poor imitation of what it actually is to look healthy.')
