Is this not the central principle of science?<p>But following scientific explanations requires certain skills, such as mathematics.  And the mass media, including even  Scientific American, do not print equations.  So popular journalists treat scientists as, in effect, alternative gods, whose opinions may be weighted according to prestige, or by how well they flatter reader&#x27;s prejudices, but cannot be otherwise tested or analyzed.<p>Conspiracy theorists merely take more or less this same dysfunction to its extreme: a circle of Youtube pseudo-scientists, perfect conformity to reader&#x27;s prejudices, and perhaps no numbers at all.')
