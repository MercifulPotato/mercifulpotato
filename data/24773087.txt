This law essentially just makes the data available wirelessly.<p>I care about security holes and I care about consent. Having a physical interface makes it easy to provide data with consent to repair shops who need while trivially making sure no third party manufacturer or insurance company is leaked a massive database of everyone&#x27;s driving data. I really don&#x27;t see how the &quot;wireless&quot; addition gives me more of a right to repair, but I clearly see how it forces manufacturers to significantly increase their surface area of possible data leaks.<p>I&#x27;m all for Ben Franklin&#x27;s liberty&#x2F;safety argument, but with the 2013 law already in place, I honestly don&#x27;t see the upside of the 2020 law.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;malegislature.gov&#x2F;Laws&#x2F;SessionLaws&#x2F;Acts&#x2F;2013&#x2F;Chapter165#:~:text=All%20content%20in%20any%20such,diagnostic%20and%20repair%20information%20system" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;malegislature.gov&#x2F;Laws&#x2F;SessionLaws&#x2F;Acts&#x2F;2013&#x2F;Chapter...</a>.')
