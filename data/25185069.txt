I&#x27;m very sceptical hygienic macros are at all comparable in utility to what a type system provides for multi-dev projects of any size. These benefits of types at scale are fairly massive and apply to basically any code. In contrast macros should make up a tiny amount (much less than 5% certainly) of code in a non-trivial application code base which means careful review is not a big overhead (and in my experience competent programmers do not introduce a lot of hygiene problems). So to be equivalent, in those instances where you do get a benefit from hygiene, that benefit would need to be absolutely massive compared to the average benefit you get of types.')
