Binary file formats are so much faster and efficient than JSON. I have no idea why projects use JSON when they expect to produce tens or hundreds of GB of data. When monitoring 100 Gb links, JSON marshaling and unmarshaling is so wasteful and costly and one reason why they need clusters of servers that expand easily.')
