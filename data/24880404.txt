People with Ehlers Danlos have to pop visibly dislocated joints back into place daily (and yes, it&#x27;s very much painful as fuck)<p>Arguably the most horrifying is when a male dislocates their hip and one of their testicles falls back into that area. You can imagine what happens when somebody attempts or succeeds in shoving the bone back into it&#x27;s socket when there&#x27;s a testicle also sitting in the socket. May be more traumatizing for the nurse that shoves it back in once they realize what they&#x27;ve done :D')
