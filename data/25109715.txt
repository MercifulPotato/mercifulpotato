How is population growth a good thing in the context of sustainability? Improvements in efficiency have generally been more than offset by increased productivity and thus (unsustainable) resource consumption, which is the reason the deterioration of all ecological indicators is accelerating.\nWhat I meant with &quot;matter of priorities&quot; is that we&#x27;ve had the means to stop that trajectory for some time, but it just wasn&#x27;t and isn&#x27;t a priority. We&#x27;ve already caused irreparable damage to much of our biosphere. There&#x27;s positive glimpses here and there but nothing changed fundamentally. I don&#x27;t see us escaping the Great Filter.')
