Just take off the subsidies and let the market choose the mix between suburban houses and high density housing.<p>Exactly.  If someone wishes to own a detached single-unit residence, fine.  I&#x27;d prefer they didn&#x27;t but that&#x27;s not my decision to make for an individual.<p>The problem comes when people want to control what&#x27;s built within a quarter or half or full mile of the residence they own.  (And, no, before someone comes at me with this specious reasoning, there&#x27;s a <i>huge</i> difference between &quot;build a nuclear power plant next to a daycare&quot; and &quot;different types of housing near each other.&quot;)<p>As a matter of public policy, I will always advocate that we do the environmental and financially efficient thing of building closer-in and closer-together.  (We gotta add in some standards for noise transmission, too.)  But preserving a specific type of housing in a specific location in amber forever is not reasonable and should not be continued.')
