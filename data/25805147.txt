Item(by='rakoo', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610828422, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25802745, text='Thank you for your view, I guess Roam also adheres to the Zettelkasten way and that&#x27;s why there is much more focus on the interlinking of nodes ?<p>It seems to me the difference lies more in the wiki software. I was asking the initial question because there are wiki engines with a lot of features, and what you are doing for Zettelkasten can be done in them as well: take for example tiddlywiki (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tiddlywiki.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tiddlywiki.com&#x2F;</a>) which organizes nodes in &quot;tiddlers&quot; instead of full-blown articles or pages. You can link to another &quot;tiddler&quot;, or you can even include it so its content can be reused elsewhere without having to &quot;click&quot;. So it seems to me those new systems are more revealing of todays&#x27; wiki engines&#x27; limitations than completely new paradigms.<p>Another difference I just realized: wikis are expected to be read and modified by multiple people, while Roam and Zettelkasten systems are expected to be used by one person only. While not written in stone, I feel like this has an impact on the way content is structured.')
