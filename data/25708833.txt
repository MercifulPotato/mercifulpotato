But none of those things happened here. If one does consider this to be a &quot;violent terrorist attack&quot;, then what words are left to describe an <i>actual</i> terrorist attack?<p>Is anyone else disturbed that the discourse is being ushered toward these particular words; that you&#x27;re being made to associate a riot of angry citizens with mass-murder attacks by men wearing balaclavas and wielding AK&#x27;s? To use these words, &quot;terrorist attack, assault on the capitol, violent uprising&quot;, for this event, it&#x27;s imprecise, misleading.<p>Orwell has a wonderful essay covering this imprecise and practically manipulative use of language. It&#x27;s a brilliant read, and very relevant at the moment: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.orwell.ru&#x2F;library&#x2F;essays&#x2F;politics&#x2F;english&#x2F;e_polit&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.orwell.ru&#x2F;library&#x2F;essays&#x2F;politics&#x2F;english&#x2F;e_poli...</a>')
