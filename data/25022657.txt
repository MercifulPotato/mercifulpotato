But while one is still committing a crime, no amount of hand-waving or pearl clutching can make a non-criminal out of someone who is actively committing a crime.<p>For an illegal immigrant, this would mean either lawful settlement or deportation.  Until an illegal immigrant either earns the right to settle or leaves the country, that person is still a criminal.')
