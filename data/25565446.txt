Item(by='kelnos', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609204364, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25559536, text='I rented in SF for the past 10 years, and bought earlier this year.  I don&#x27;t look at my primary home as an investment; it&#x27;s me paying to live in a place I love.  Obviously I&#x27;d prefer that my mortgage not end up underwater, and a capital loss when I eventually sell wouldn&#x27;t be awesome, but that would be a small price for me to pay for housing in this city to become more affordable for lots of people.<p>But I&#x27;m extremely lucky that my financial situation is such that my home is not the bulk of my net worth.  For most homeowners in the US, their home is not only the vast majority of their net worth, but it&#x27;s the basis for their retirement nest egg (with the intention being to sell in retirement and trade down to a smaller home, keeping the difference in cash value).  So while it grates on me, I can absolutely understand how homeowners will do everything in their power to not only protect their home values, but ensure they keep going up, year after year.<p>At the same time, though, it does feel a little greedy to see people who bought 20-30 years ago holding on to their obscene hundreds (thousands?) of a percent gains so jealously, to the detriment of so many others.  But again... it&#x27;s hard to blame them too much, considering how uncertain retirement finances can be in the US.  Solving that problem decisively with a housing windfall is an attractive proposition.<p>I imagine there are some truly awful people who are very rich and continue to push policies that keep their home values high, even when they don&#x27;t really need them to stay high to support their lifestyles.  But I expect that&#x27;s a small minority of people, if only because few people are that financially secure.')
