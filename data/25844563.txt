Meanwhile, epidemiologists <i>are not biologists</i>. Look at Neil Ferguson, one of the world&#x27;s most famous. His actual background isn&#x27;t biology, it&#x27;s ... physics!<p>If you want to get the views of biologists on the effects of EM on the body, then great! You&#x27;d want to talk to microbiologists about that. Physicists can probably also be informative, but epidemiologists can only look at graphs like the one I linked to previously. They&#x27;re more or less data scientists, posing as disease experts, but what they&#x27;re doing when you drill in is what anyone who knows R and a bit of stats could do.<p>The IARC finding seems to be phrased very ambiguously. I would read it as saying &quot;we have no evidence, but absence of evidence is not evidence of absence&quot;. Which is true but not really helpful for moving the debate forward, as at some point absence of evidence does need to be taken as evidence of absence or else you&#x27;d be stuck in the precautionary principle of not doing anything forever.')
