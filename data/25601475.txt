Do you only have a single thread of tasks you&#x27;re doing at any given time on your machine, all of whose resources are torn down and rebuilt from scratch when needed?  I use my current laptop both for work and personally, and in my personal workspaces alone, I have at least half a dozen browser windows with ~20 tabs representing research that I&#x27;m doing or a task that I&#x27;m organizing; everything from gift-buying to medical devices for a family issue to building a new workout routine for the pandemic. You can rack up tons of relevant tabs pretty quickly in these scenarios, and there&#x27;s really no advantage to closing them in any well-managed environment (ie one that has non-rudimentary window management and a browser&#x2F;extension that handles idle tabs with negligible ongoing resource use).<p>I probably have hundreds of &quot;productive&quot; tabs open, and that&#x27;s before even getting to tabs that are serving as an &quot;L1 cache&quot; version of a read-it-later service.  And all of this comes with extremely quick clean-up; once I buy the gift&#x2F;finalize the routine&#x2F;purchase the item, it&#x27;s trivial to close the entire window for that task.')
