It gives the appearance of being just another big software update.<p>Unlike Windows, Mac OS updates come out more often, about once a year for major version, and every couple of months for minor version.  Despite the marketing fanfare, they are not as big a change as say jumping from Windows 7 to Windows 10.<p>Ok, maybe you still want to take care with a new OS.  Like with Excel three days before filing taxes.  (Though when do you expect the accountant to upgrade?  They are <i>always</i> doing someone&#x27;s taxes.)<p>Maybe you do try it in a VM first, and decide you like it, it works well for you.  Some people try new OS versions in a separate partition.  You can do that on a Mac, just like on a PC.  It seems like it ought to be safe, because you&#x27;ve kept the old installation on as well.  Just like on a PC, you can choose which to start up using the built-in boot menu.<p>Being sensible you take a full system backup first.  Usually, with Apple, a backup is pretty good.  You can reinstall from a backup provided the system can boot.  Macs have a reinstaller built in.  By analogy with a PC, it&#x27;s more like &quot;imaging&quot; a Windows or Linux system, and as if the PC BIOS had built-in tools to restore from a backup image.<p>Following that analogy, the problem here is that Big Sur nuked the BIOS!  It can&#x27;t even reboot from external media, or the recovery partition.  If a Window OS upgrade did that we&#x27;d not only be unhappy, we would also be rather surprised that we can&#x27;t boot an external USB key to recover.')
