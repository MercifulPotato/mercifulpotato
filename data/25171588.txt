Otherwise you don’t have skin in the game. It makes you a better engineer, and at most places increases the quality of your software in two ways. One, you don’t want to get that call at 2am, so you think more about reliability, edge cases, writing playbooks etc. Secondly, when things do go wrong, you perform a post mortem and you get the action items in your stream of work. Additionally you should always track on call stats and use it as a metric in your team health checks. If people are getting called a lot out of hours, it’s time to pull the cord, and sort it out.')
