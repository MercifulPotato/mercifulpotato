It implies that workers don&#x27;t already know they&#x27;re in a much worse position compared to founders&#x2F;business owners when it comes to acquisitions. Generally it suggests that workers &quot;learn&quot; through pain until they become founders. Which might apply to some people but certainly isn&#x27;t the case for everyone, let alone a good reason to treat your workers badly. I much more agree with the sibling comment by Jochim.')
