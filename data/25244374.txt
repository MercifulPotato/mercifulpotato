I mean, religion is quite openly a set of guidelines and rules that establish how a society should operate. Some religious text books use parables as rhetoric devices to show scenarios that illustrate how behaviors harm or benefit society. Thus, we don&#x27;t need the supernatural to be religious. It helps, but it&#x27;s not necessary.')
