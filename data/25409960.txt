Civilization has collapsed, governments are non-existent, and the remaining human tribes need some sort of currency to facilitate trade. I need a goat for my farm, so I walk up to the goat breeder and hand him a pile of gold. Does he take that gold and smelt it into something? Probably not, he&#x27;s a goat breeder. He might be able to take that gold and trade it to someone else for something he needs, but I&#x27;d imagine the person making gold jewelry or semiconductors will also sell goat food. So he&#x27;d have to give that gold to a hay farmer, who would trade that gold for a new plow and now the plow maker might be able to smelt that gold into something useful. But the gold has no use for the goat breeder or hay farmer.<p>Now I hand him a stack of papers with numbers printed on them. The goat breeder has no use for these papers, but he also had no use for the gold. He&#x27;d need to trade them for something. Let&#x27;s run it all back up the same line and we see it doesn&#x27;t end at &quot;and now the smelter has something useful&quot; because paper isn&#x27;t useful to the smelter either... but running the paper through that chain of merchants has proven that there&#x27;s value attached to the paper. The smelter then recognizes the value of the paper and trades the paper to the miners who supply the metal, because the traders who supply the metal want to buy some goat milk from me and they know I accept this weird paper in exchange for my goat&#x27;s milk.<p>That&#x27;s how currency has worked since the beginning of civilization. Ancient people weren&#x27;t melting down coins to make something more valuable, they were trading the coins as-is without a worry about how useful the raw materials are. They just needed something <i>anything</i> that everyone agreed had a certain amount of value to it that&#x27;s also difficult to fake. Gold has no intrinsic value for 90% of all humans on the planet, it&#x27;s just a way to exchange goods and services based on an arbitrary-but-universally-recognized token.')
