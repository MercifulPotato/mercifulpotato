I&#x27;ve been selective about what I implement based on what applies to me.<p>I don&#x27;t share the code because I&#x27;m not sufficiently confident that it&#x27;s correct, don&#x27;t want liability, and don&#x27;t want an obligation to keep it up to date.<p>That said, it feels like the scope of the project would be manageable for a small nonprofit, and would be of great social value. One reflection from my work is that it would be particularly valuable to represent annual changes in the tax code as transformations of the code AST.')
