Item(by='quadrifoliate', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604251481, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24960756, text='&gt; The politics behind promoting Hindi is a religious one. It makes convenient to promote the varna system(modern caste system).<p>As someone with some knowledge around this subject, this is a simplistic and inflammatory bad-faith reading of a <i>very</i> complex topic â€“ how <i>do</i> you create a common country out of hundreds of splintered cultures, languages, and religions spoken by millions of people? The nearest parallel to how many languages India is the European Union, and I would wager that given the differing scripts and such, India&#x27;s diversity of languages exceeds that of the EU&#x27;s.<p>And people have been trying to unite this complex mixture as a country since the 1700s! (thinking of the British attempts here; much earlier if you include pre-British empires).<p>The imposition of Hindi has been the one of the (failed) ways to have such a common language. It is quite a vast topic, but one example is that Mahatma Gandhi himself started the South India Hindi Outreach Institute to promote Hindi as a means of integration between (broadly speaking) North and South India.<p>Also, the issue of caste in India is a pretty complex one as well, but having spent some time in south India, I can confidently say that casteism is <i>way</i> more prevalent there than Hindi, which casts some doubts on the effectiveness of the politics you allude to (even presuming it exists).<p>----------------------------------------------------<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Dakshina_Bharat_Hindi_Prachar_Sabha" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Dakshina_Bharat_Hindi_Prachar_...</a>')
