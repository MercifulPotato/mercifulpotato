I was into Valve&#x27;s Half Life games and Garry&#x27;s Mod, and Lua was typically the way that you&#x27;d make modifications to things (e.g. increase player movement speed). That would interact with the Source engine, which was in C++, but you could do a lot of stuff without ever touching C++ [1].<p>I didn&#x27;t even really think of it as programming at the time. You start by just changing constants, like what if we make gravity = 2 instead of 9.8 m&#x2F;s2? And then build up from there. I think is what a lot of these educational programming games try to replicate today.<p>After a while, I got confident enough to the point of trying to do things in LÃ–VE, which is a free and open-source 2D game engine that uses Lua [2]. What I learned there is the reason why I eventually studied computer science in college. That said, when I return to Lua, it feels a bit limited, but I suppose that&#x27;s the point! I never really questioned it at the time.<p>&quot;Lua is not object-oriented. That is it.&quot; Laughed out loud when I read this. It was funny to learn programming without the concept of classes, and then realize that Lua is the exception, not the rule.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.valvesoftware.com&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Embedding_Lua_in_the_Source_Engine" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.valvesoftware.com&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Embedding_Lua_in_th...</a>\n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;love2d.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;love2d.org&#x2F;</a>')
