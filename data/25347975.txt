You&#x27;re just driving a transistor, not the selector magnet itself. The ASR-33 has its own magnet driver.<p>The older teletypes, the Model 14 (1920s) and Model 15 (1930s), take more driving. They need 60mA at 120V DC, because you&#x27;re operating the selector magnet directly. The usual setup is a 120VDC supply with a 10K 2W resistor in series, switched with an opto-isolator. That is simple and works fine.<p>I designed and built a driver for the older machines that&#x27;s powered entirely from a USB port, and converts 5V to 120V.[1]  This was a fun electrical engineering project. Had to design an unusual switching power supply. A few other people have built this board, including some from the Computer Museum in Mountain View. That packages up the whole power problem in a nice little box. Requires surface mount soldering, though.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;John-Nagle&#x2F;ttyloopdriver" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;John-Nagle&#x2F;ttyloopdriver</a>')
