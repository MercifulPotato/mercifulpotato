However, if you want to take it seriously, you should consider using the High Quality Camera with the Pi as a USB webcam. The sensor on that HQ camera is HUGE, thus the picture quality is really really good, especially when you take time to figure out the focus and such [1] [2]. It&#x27;s better than most if not all the webcams you can buy on the market. It&#x27;s definitely more compact, cheaper, and less hassle than using the whole Mirrorless + HDMI capture-card setup if you want to upgrade your Zoom appearance.<p>On the software side, I have worked on the exact Pi-as-a-webcam software project for a while [0]. It&#x27;s quite customizable and you can play with parameters of the camera to further extract values out of the hardware. I also am hoping, in the future, to implement &quot;smart&quot; functions such as auto-panning the camera and such.<p>However, I still couldn&#x27;t figure out a good case for it so the setup looks kinda crummy, not as slick as the iSight.<p>0: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;showmewebcam&#x2F;showmewebcam" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;showmewebcam&#x2F;showmewebcam</a><p>1: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hackaday.io&#x2F;project&#x2F;174479&#x2F;gallery#715fab460d86cbd1144014c5b3cb72fb" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hackaday.io&#x2F;project&#x2F;174479&#x2F;gallery#715fab460d86cbd11...</a><p>2: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hackaday.io&#x2F;project&#x2F;174479&#x2F;gallery#da539049c84e7fd646ed2f6518ff93fa" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hackaday.io&#x2F;project&#x2F;174479&#x2F;gallery#da539049c84e7fd64...</a>')
