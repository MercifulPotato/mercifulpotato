If this is the state of affairs today then you need to imagine how it would have been centuries back. Are you saying they were progressing and suddenly became regressive in modern era? What would explain that theory?<p>Secondly Christians, Hindus, Buddhists also exists in large numbers and Jews are the most prosecuted community. I do not see them carrying out random suicide attacks. How do you explain this behavior?<p>Thirdly Every faith have seen voices to reform vs other major faiths. Why don&#x27;t you see any major reforms going on in Islam?  Are they perfect and don&#x27;t have anything to reform? What there isn&#x27;t any major movement from within Islam against polygamy, halala, barbaric punishments, degraded status of women and minorities.<p>Note: Strangely I was stopped from replying by hacker new algo because I was apparently posting too fast. I don&#x27;t know why posting 4-5 messages over an hour should be considered &quot;fast.&quot;')
