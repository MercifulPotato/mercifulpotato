Item(by='Thorrez', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606277630, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25198445, text='&gt;Because it is the body that people care about when they talk about algorithms.<p>The article isn&#x27;t just talking about what happens in the body. It&#x27;s also talking about what the value of i is after an iteration is done.<p>&gt;But even if you include it, it is ran exactly as many times as the body of the loop, so not sure why you bring it up?<p>That&#x27;s exactly why I bring it up:<p>After 0 iterations, the iteration statement ran 0 times, so i is 0.<p>After 1 iteration, the iteration statement ran 1 time, so i is -1.<p>After 2 iterations, the iteration statement ran 2 times, so i is -2.<p>...<p>After |INT_MIN| iterations, the iteration statement ran |INT_MIN| times, so i is INT_MIN.<p>This directly contradicts the article. My point is that the article has an error.<p>If on the other hand you say the iteration statement isn&#x27;t part of the iteration you get:<p>After 0 iterations, the iteration statement ran 0 times, so i is 0.<p>After 1 iteration, the iteration statement ran 0 times, so i is 0.<p>After 2 iterations, the iteration statement ran 1 time, so i is -1.<p>...<p>After |INT_MIN| + 1 iterations, the iteration statement ran |INT_MIN| times, so i is INT_MIN.<p>I don&#x27;t agree with that point of view. But it does agree with the article.')
