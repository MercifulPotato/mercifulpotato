If you&#x27;re a non-technical user, you&#x27;re not going to read it at all. You might update, you might not, but you&#x27;re not going to look through the list of changes.<p>If you&#x27;re a technical user, you know it&#x27;s unlikely that update == &quot;more crashes and slower load times&quot; so saying the opposite isn&#x27;t helpful, and a list of things <i>might</i> be helpful.<p>So as a user of an app you probably fall into one of 3(ish) categories:<p>1. You read the changelog and something is relevant to you.<p>2. You read the changelog and nothing is relevant to you.<p>3. You don&#x27;t know what the changelog is.<p>Listing the bugs that are fixed helps some of these groups. &quot;Bugfixes and performance improvements&quot; is a given, and helps no one.')
