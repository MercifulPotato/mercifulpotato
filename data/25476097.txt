Item(by='rualca', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608367024, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25472095, text='&gt; From your comments and the article, seems like the WGU model could completely disrupt the normal 4 year university experience, for self motivated learners.<p>I don&#x27;t agree at all. The &quot;normal&quot; university experience is designed around the assumption that the student is not familiar with the subject, and thus they specify a path comprised of a combination of lessons and assignments that allows everyone to get up to speed on a topic and share a common base level of all the fundamentals at a given stage.<p>The OP&#x27;s comments mention nothing of the sort. They show that, even though the student lacked some fundamentals, the preliminary work already had covered most of the topics.<p>Thus OP&#x27;s story is one mostly about getting a certification instead of actually learning something new. It involves learning stuff at their own pace instead of being forced to ramp um on a time budget with hard constraints on where the acceptable speed of growth must be.<p>We should not confuse the two, and we should certainly not mistake being able to pass a certification as a reflexion of intelligence or capability. The challenge of getting from cluelessness to have a solid command of the fundamentals of a topic in less than 4 months is incomparably higher than just casually cruising on a topic for 10 years.')
