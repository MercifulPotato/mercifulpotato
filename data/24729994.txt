I know it&#x27;s not that old, but as I talk with fellow developers from other companies I can spot a few differences as a result of how each codebase has been managed that directly affect team productivity, engagement and happiness:<p>- Perception of architectural consistency<p>- Perception of quality and robustness<p>- Willingness to adopt &quot;new trends&quot;<p>- Amount of technical debt<p>- Frequency of partial&#x2F;total rewrites<p>- Operational complexity and costs<p>About a year ago I posted a few learnings from my own experience managing our codebase since its inception:<p>- https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thomasvilhena.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;11&#x2F;system-design-coherence<p>So I&#x27;m interested in your experience and learnings managing a long-term code base, both what your team did right and what went wrong.<p>Thanks in advance!')
