I didn&#x27;t use any add-ons.<p>Just set &#x27;active hours&#x27;, turn off everything under &#x27;Advanced&#x27;, and if you really want to not do any updates for a while, you can select a date a date 35 days in the future to restart updates.<p>Three very simple things built into the update tool.<p>If you are on a corporate machine, they may limit what you can block based on their internal rules, but that is an IT problem, not Microsoft.<p>Windows 10 never updates or reboots during my active hours.\nI always defer updates to a long time out, then manually update at a point where I want to. Problem solved.')
