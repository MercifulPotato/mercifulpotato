I purchased the iPhone 12 mini with high hopes but for the price, I didn&#x27;t feel like I was getting enough. I only had 2 out of 3 rear cameras (of the pro) and I would have preferred telephoto instead of wide. The battery life wasn&#x27;t quite there either. The only improvement was 5G but coverage is still spotty anyway. I exchanged my purchase for the SE and I&#x27;m pretty happy. I still get the smaller easy to reach screen size and the fingerprint sensor is a welcome from the past. I think TouchID &gt; FaceID. I was an iPhone X owner for a number of years until the screen randomly died.')
