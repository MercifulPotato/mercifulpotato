Service contracts have to be fulfilled, and making a living off of social media like Instagram, YouTube and Twitch isn&#x27;t just an American phenomenon, actually come to think of it, most of the YouTubers I follow aren&#x27;t even American. They&#x27;re mostly in Europe or Australia.<p>And don&#x27;t assume they&#x27;ll just be fine without Facebook either, as far as digital advertising goes, Facebook and Google are pretty much the only game in town. Some small businesses do depend on being able to get business through advertising referrals.<p>Europe is a rich continent, it&#x27;s not like they would be destitute if the rich wonders of American tech companies just evaporated from their part of the world tomorrow, but you&#x27;re not replacing most of them overnight either, so Europe instead is trying this thing where they can at least try to control them.<p>I mean, I don&#x27;t see it working out in the long run but in the short term they&#x27;ve shown some muscle, because after all: Europe is a rich continent.
