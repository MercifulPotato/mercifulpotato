Wait till the infrastructure is there, courtesy of the early-adopters.<p>I can still remember being an early-adopter in the early days of personal computers, when computer retailers were very few and very far between. It took a special trip of 300km (180 miles) to buy a box of floppy disks for $60. If the machine needed anything serviced it was another 300 km trip.<p>Give it another 10 years and maybe it might be convenient enough to lash out on an EV. But until then, I will rely on petrol as my fuel.')
