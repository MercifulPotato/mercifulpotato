Item(by='sriku', descendants=None, kids=[24916637], score=None, time=1603859492, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24914710, text='The fact that &quot;lambda&quot; came from &quot;lambda calculus&quot; is of such little relevance to mainstream programming today that we don&#x27;t need to be reminded of it every time we want to write an &quot;anonymous function&quot;. IMO, Clojure did the right thing there.<p>I&#x27;m not against the concept of lambdas (obviously, I love them since I made a scheme dialect with them for video editing). The word today is too specific for a plethora of subtly different representations&#x2F;implementations of the &quot;lambda&quot; of &quot;lambda calculus&quot;.<p>If &quot;lambda&quot; is supposed to mean &quot;function&quot;, choose &quot;function&quot;. No harm done.')
