Compared to what laptops like the Dell XPS 13 are doing with larger screens in smaller bodies, the current Air and 13&quot; Pro designs are getting a bit long in the tooth now.<p>I expect next year we&#x27;ll see new design for the iMac with the M1X, or whatever the bigger variant will be called, as the current version is absolute dinosaur at this point, but I also think we&#x27;ll see an updated design for the Air and 13&quot; Pro (maybe 14&quot; like how the 15&quot; went to 16&quot;â€”it would certainly help differentiate the Air and Pro a little more).')
