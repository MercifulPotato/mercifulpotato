Most people just want random people to not get be able to get into their stuff--same as a physical lock.<p>They carry a physical key on their person.  It&#x27;s not too much to ask them to carry a &quot;digital&quot; key on their key ring.<p>The problem is that most &quot;digital&quot; keys are a pain in the ass:<p>1) Mostly because everybody wants to &quot;centralize&quot; authentication so that they can charge you and administrate you.<p>2) Secondarily because there is no good solution for talking to the key on your person.  NFC sucks.  USB requires that I plug my key in.  WiFi requires that the device be able to hit your network.  BLE has no access from web pages.<p>BLE is probably the best choice, but there is no real money in making it work.')
