I&#x27;m obviously not well-versed in browser internals, but here&#x27;s the very first sentence of &quot;Threading and Tasks in Chrome&quot;:<p>&gt; Chrome has a multi-process architecture and <i>each process is heavily multi-threaded.</i><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chromium.googlesource.com&#x2F;chromium&#x2F;src&#x2F;+&#x2F;master&#x2F;docs&#x2F;threading_and_tasks.md" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chromium.googlesource.com&#x2F;chromium&#x2F;src&#x2F;+&#x2F;master&#x2F;docs...</a><p>Either way, I think browsers have a very specific scenario, where there isn&#x27;t much interaction between the tabs, and they need to be well-isolated from each other.
