So to pick an obvious example, two related issues that would clearly fall into the “not directly related to the mission” bucket are gay and transgender rights. Without getting at all into the issue of where you (Dear Reader) stand in terms of these particular issues, it seems to me that by saying “we explicitly will not lobby to make sure transgender people have equal rights, because that’s outside of our mission” is at direct odds with saying “we believe a core part of our mission is making sure transgender people feel welcome and can do their best work”.<p>Unless some law is interfering with the ability of Coinbase to provide a welcoming workplace to employees who are gay&#x2F;transgendered, gay&#x2F;transgender social causes have nothing to do with Coinbase&#x27;s goal of providing a welcoming workplace that maximizes its ability to advance its mission.<p>You can&#x27;t shoehorn every &#x27;social justice&#x27; issue into the goal of providing a welcoming workplace. The latter statement is not meant to be interpreted in such an all-encompassing way.<p>The kind of absolutism that premises your perspective&#x2F;position would engulf everything in politics.')
