They are providing a really valuable service when they provide open source software as a service. They aren&#x27;t giving back to <i>Elastic</i> the company, but it&#x27;s important to note the difference, because Amazon isn&#x27;t being a bad actor here. I think it&#x27;s reasonable for both Amazon and Elastic to act the way they do, and I think the competition between their respective business models will end up in a better set of products available to developers.')
