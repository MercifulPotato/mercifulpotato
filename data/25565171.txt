I think there’s a lot of belief that sleep apnea is something that only happens to old or unhealthy individuals. Frankly for most people it’s due to airway size and back of throat muscle issues. Age and obesity simply bring it to the point where people are so sick they can’t ignore it, hence those who get treated.<p>I tell people it’s more like needing glasses. Most people just are born with the issue that develops over time. We don’t have hang ups with treating vision problems (at least not anymore)... sleep apnea should be the same.')
