It&#x27;s unfortunate that partisan invective seems to have overwhelmed more nuanced arguments of platform moderation...<p>I think it will be interesting to see how higher degrees of intervention and moderation break some of the assumptions of the network effect. Services may not be winner take all if there are big ideological wedges that companies can serve.<p>And just as a personal note on US politics, I would encourage more GOP-leaning folks to consider one important difference between a 2016-Russia and 2020-Fraud comparison. For 2016, Hillary conceded after two days, Obama welcomed Trump, there was no widespread opinion of a stolen election by the Democratic Executive or voiced by Dem US House&#x2F;Senate members. The smoke focusing on &quot;personal collusion with Russia by Trump&quot; was by the media after the fact. The Mueller investigation was appointed by the DoJ from a bipartisan committee to investigate specifically Russian interference.<p>For 2020, the sitting President is loudly pushing a narrative of voter fraud and deep-state conspiracy from views he has always held. Paraphrasing: &quot;I would have won the 2016 popular vote if 5 million people didn&#x27;t vote illegally&quot;. He called the 2020 election rigged multiple times before it even happened! Like the word slippery slope gets tossed around a lot, but this really is an instance of a slope that&#x27;s very slippery.')
