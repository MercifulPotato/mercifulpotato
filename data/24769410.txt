I&#x27;m pretty lost about what to do next so I need your help.<p>I&#x27;ve always worked at small places that needed a programmer to create small projects, some years ago I worked at a startup with no success and the last six years I&#x27;ve been working as the sole developer of a non profit.<p>I&#x27;ve built projects using Machine Learning, NLP, Computer Vision, scraping libraries, Lucene based search engines, WordPress and more but they were all small projects, like the ones you can find on a &quot;basic tutorial blog post&quot;. I&#x27;ve never need to structure the code in a scalable way because no one but me will see the code and also because it doesn&#x27;t made sense to invest time to build scalable and readable code for such small projects.<p>That&#x27;s why I consider myself an expert beginner, I&#x27;m able to get code to run and I&#x27;ve never got to the stage of not knowing how to solve a technical problem, but I don&#x27;t know about good practices, how to approach scalability, how to work on big projects.<p>I don&#x27;t know what to do really, I thought about reading open source projects (Python is the language I know the most), advanced Python programming books (fluent python, effective python) and scalability books (designing data intensive applications), but I don&#x27;t know if by reading those materials I&#x27;d become a &quot;senior programmer&quot; without working with other people.<p>Another way maybe is to look for junior roles but I&#x27;m 33 now and with 10 years of experience it&#x27;ll seem weird when interviewing.<p>What would you do if you were in my position?')
