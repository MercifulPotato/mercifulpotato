It was also very hard to keep these models up to date, test out multiple scenarios, share models with investors without them immediately going stale, etc. I think there&#x27;s also a great opportunity for you to look at the data from different startups in order to help give guidance re: best practices (e.g., &quot;80% of startups in your category have a lower conversion rate than you - consider adjusting your expectations&quot;).<p>I&#x27;ve actually considered working on this problem myself, but TBH I have some concerns about the business model (e.g., I think it&#x27;s going to be challenging to get startups to pay a significant amount of money for this on a recurring basis). I&#x27;m happy to see that someone is working on it though, and I&#x27;ll be rooting for you guys!')
