That is, the person who has the largest share of output contributes disproportionately much to the public good.<p>Simple proof: write individual i&#x27;s marginal benefit from the company&#x27;s total effort X as<p>s_i f(X) - x_i<p>where s_i is i&#x27;s share of the output f(X), and x_i is i&#x27;s own effort.\nTaking everyone else&#x27;s effort as given, i will equate marginal benefit of own effort to marginal cost, so that total effort solves<p>s_i f&#x27;(X) = 1<p>equivalently<p>f&#x27;(X) = 1&#x2F;s_i<p>Now suppose the person with the largest share satisfies the above. Then everyone with a smaller share must have<p>f&#x27;(X) &lt; 1&#x2F;s_i<p>and therefore, if they are contributing more than the minimum possible, they have an incentive to reduce their contribution. So, this extreme version has that only the largest &quot;shareholder&quot; does any work. (A more realistic model has a convex cost of effort, so smaller shareholders do something, but they still contribute less than their output share.)')
