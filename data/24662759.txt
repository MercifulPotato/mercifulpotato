You probably won&#x27;t want to waste their (and your) time on untrustworthy projects, so I&#x27;ll have to get a licensed software person to sign off on particular releases of my library to certify quality, to make it more likely someone will want to use it.<p>This would introduce some inertia in software - not enough to be stifling, it won&#x27;t pry away Turing-complete languages from the hands of curious children, but perhaps it&#x27;ll be enough to introduce some sanity into the industry.')
