The first startup I ever joined was founded by a woman, who was also the CEO.  I joined when it was her and 4 other people.  I&#x27;m interviewing now with an insurance-tech startup founded by a woman, who is, again, the CEO.  People like you have been the death of discourse on sites like this for a long time, because you&#x27;re desperate to attribute every criticism to group identity characteristics.  I deeply resent this behavior, and people like you who perpetrate it.<p>My denigration of Mrs. Jones would be identical if she were Mr. Jones, because it&#x27;s fully focused on the fact that she was fired for insubordination by abusing her position as the maintainer of the dashboard to make unilateral decisions, like for example activating the CSV export functionality when one of the epidemiologists on her team was concerned that it was incomplete and was checking it against Johns Hopkins&#x27; data sources.  She turned this firing into a PR stunt by falsely claiming (as it was later determined) that she was actually fired for protesting her team &quot;hiding&quot; covid deaths and hospitalizations.  Naturally, these &quot;hidden&quot; deaths never materialized, because they were never there to begin with.  She was proven a liar by late May, but her lies are politically convenient for the Democratic Party, and therefore she continues to be portrayed as a whistleblower by highly partisan outlets.<p>Apparently, you&#x27;ve never criticized a female in your entire life, and anyone who does must automatically be motivated by misogyny. The solution to this is for men to only work with other men, because how can you work with someone if you can&#x27;t constructively criticize them?  That&#x27;s the world that your behavior will create.')
