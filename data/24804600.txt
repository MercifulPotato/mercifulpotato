Item(by='JHonaker', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602879243, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24804391, text='&gt; As [one] math major to another, there are interesting problems everywhere and literally all people are interesting and full of problems.<p>Add me to that list as well. I originally started graduate school with dreams of moving to California and working for a FAANG company. Early in the program I got a graduate assistantship that basically partnered with a large company to be a half-time intern. I didn&#x27;t really see myself working at long term.<p>Over the last five years, I&#x27;ve come to appreciate the fact that I&#x27;m not using my knowledge of statistics to keep people addicted to their phones or serve ads. I just took a full-time position there while I finish the tail end of my PhD.<p>Everyone has an interesting problem to solve. It&#x27;s just not everyone is slamming down their &quot;achievements&quot; down your throat trying to recruit.')
