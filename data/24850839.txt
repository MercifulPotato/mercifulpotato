Item(by='tgsovlerkhgsel', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603306312, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24849753, text='Yes, in very, very narrow cases:<p>- Gmail\n- Calendar\n- Online support chats where I get a notification when an agent becomes available&#x2F;responds so I don&#x27;t forget about the tab\n- A custom tool I wrote for myself (web notifications are the easiest way to get push notifications onto your phone without having to go through the overhead of full app development)<p>I bet there are <i>some</i> people who genuinely like the idea of a news site pushing them the latest news. I doubt they outweigh the number who accidentally enable those notifications and then can&#x27;t turn them off, but I haven&#x27;t seen user studies and I could be wrong; average users often have habits that seem weird to me.<p>I have, however, also seen what really abusive notifications can do: A friend enabled notifications from a shady site or the ads served on the shady site (because users don&#x27;t understand dialogs and end up clicking a random button, so ask them often enough and one of the clicks will land on &quot;yes&quot;), and now their <i>Chromebook</i> was telling them that they have a virus and need to {install a malicious extension,give the scammer money,etc.}. Since then, disabling notifications is on my mental &quot;browser hardening for when I set up a browser for inexperienced users&quot; checklist.<p>I&#x27;d wholeheartedly support blocking the notification dialog for <i>all</i> sites, limiting notifications to a barely-noticeable icon that the user needs to actively click. Much harder to convince a user to take an action than to convince a user to click a random button to get rid of a dialog that&#x27;s getting in their face.<p>Also, an easy browser-controlled way to unsubscribe from notifications, and enforcement based on the rates of a) people clicking &quot;no&quot; in the permission dialog, b) unsubscribe rates. If the metrics show that your users aren&#x27;t happy with your notifications, no more notifications for you.')
