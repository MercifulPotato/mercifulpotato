Assuming 356k vote on election day, and voting takes place over 12 hours. That&#x27;s still about 100 per hour and location.\nAnd that&#x27;s ignoring that most will likely vote on their way from&#x2F;to work (spices in demand), and that polling locations are most likely not perfectly distributed according to the population distribution.<p>Germany has 73,000 locations for 61,690,000 voters.
