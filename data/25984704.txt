In a super volatile and absurdly illiquid at times market like GME recently, this is where the institutionals would do most of their trading.<p>If I needed to buy 1m shares of GME I wouldn’t do it in the open market. I would call my favorite sell side shop, let’s say Goldman and have them call Fidelity or similar to arrange a block trade.')
