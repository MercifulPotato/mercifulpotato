A very dubious proposition.<p>No, in fact, I clearly said that they were useful but not scientific.<p>My problem with <i>The Ship of Theseus</i>, is that it pr√¶tends to be scientific, whereas it is merely a futile quibble of semantics.<p>&gt; Giving your example, thinking about who is beautiful and who isn&#x27;t (not &quot;Scientific Study&quot;, just thinking) would be pointless is well, and in reality, in practical objective reality of a lot of people, isn&#x27;t.<p>Indeed it isn&#x27;t. Now imagine the existence of some thought experiment by a philosopher who tries to use deductive logic to decide what is and isn&#x27;t beautiful absent any rigorous definition of beauty and thus indeed ends up stuck.<p>I would indeed call that a very futile exercise, so I called <i>The Ship of Theseus</i>.')
