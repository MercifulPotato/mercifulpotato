It does try to apply those during what it believes are not &quot;active hours&quot;, but it is not a perfect system.<p>Until that happens, consider setting your active hours manually in the Update &amp; Security -&gt; Windows Update settings panel.  The update system is designed to avoid automatic restarts during active hours.<p>You can also pause updates for a period of time as well when you know that you don&#x27;t want your system disrupted overnight.<p>I empathize with your frustration around the timing and I would encourage you to file feedback asking for more control over when updates happen.')
