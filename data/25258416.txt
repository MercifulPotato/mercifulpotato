In the Redmond, WA area, $2 million <i>might</i> get you something that isn&#x27;t a 4700 sq. ft. box with windows. Hell, San Diego is looking downright affordable these days. And that&#x27;s from a <i>Seattle</i> perspective. I can imagine a Bay Area resident with some equity (I have a big imagination) would do well moving just about anywhere else, including SoCal.')
