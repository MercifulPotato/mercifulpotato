What is the ideal rate of growth?<p>The executive branch by itself has grown from 699 to 2079 since 1940 to 2014 [1]. That&#x27;s a growth of just under 3x. By comparison, US population has grown from 132 million to 318 million in that time period according to Google. A growth of ~2.5x. The US GDP has grown by 14x in that time period [2]. Just to imagine that size, the US economy today is larger than the world economy in 1940 (now sure there&#x27;s some inflation along with that so the numbers aren&#x27;t strictly comparable.<p>However, if you look at the total federal government size itself, it appears to haven&#x27;t really changed since 1984 [3] so this growth in the executive branch is just shifting employees around. The government hasn&#x27;t been growing since the 80s.<p>So I&#x27;ll reask my question. What level of growth is acceptable? Why has 0 growth in 40 years still not been enough to achieve the &quot;ideal&quot; &quot;small government size&quot;?<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.opm.gov&#x2F;policy-data-oversight&#x2F;data-analysis-documentation&#x2F;federal-employment-reports&#x2F;historical-tables&#x2F;executive-branch-civilian-employment-since-1940&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.opm.gov&#x2F;policy-data-oversight&#x2F;data-analysis-docu...</a>\n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thebalance.com&#x2F;us-gdp-by-year-3305543" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thebalance.com&#x2F;us-gdp-by-year-3305543</a>\n[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.volckeralliance.org&#x2F;true-size-government" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.volckeralliance.org&#x2F;true-size-government</a>')
