All well and good.  We developed a routine: I had a series of taps on the stall I would deliver, which was Shower Spider&#x27;s cue to retreat to the web.  I then showered and left multiple large drops of water on the nearby ledge to drink.  At all times I would fling drain flies (and other randomly encountered bugs) into the web for devouring.<p>Shower Spider died one day and I was never able to determine why.  Water and bugs were delivered by me on the regular.  We had a really good working relationship.  Other Shower Spiders have come and gone, but the first one was a real trooper.')
