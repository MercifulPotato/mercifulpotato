The lawsuit says it was a three day timeline, start to suspension, and then 36 hours until they were taken offline. I haven&#x27;t seen any comment from Amazon talking about the timeline on their decision. I get a pit in my stomach thinking that in the span of 3 days an internet business with +10 million users can get shut down instantly. Was there no middle ground where they worked collaboratively to let Parler pause, clean up, and get moderation in place? Sure the CEO was bombastic, but in the lawsuit they said Amazon ghosted them and that their contract said they get 30 days.')
