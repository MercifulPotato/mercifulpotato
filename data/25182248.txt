Item(by='patrec', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606089652, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25181330, text='&gt; No. Unless you&#x27;re not familiar with Lisp-1 vs Lisp-2.<p>Just because &quot;classical&quot; defmacro is mildly awkward to use in Common Lisp and much more so in scheme does not mean that the only viable alternatives are R*RS style hygienic macros. Look at how e.g. clojure does it, it has a simple and perfectly adequate solution (a concise gensym notation, basically). As far as hygiene is concerned. Not so much in terms of generating good error messages.')
