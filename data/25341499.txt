It can be dangerous to be at the hands of an hostile officer, but then an equal comparison would be to say that being a police officer I&#x27;m the presence of an armed violent criminal is dangerous.<p>But like you said, being an officer is not the most dangerous profession. Just like being in the presence of a police officer is not that dangerous.')
