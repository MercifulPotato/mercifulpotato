It’s very few tracks, not a general issue, 99% of tracks sound great, just some tracks with real low loud bass and it triggers on the bass drum. I’m no sound engineer, but it sounded a bit like a glitch that spunds like a rattle of a speaker that can’t handle it. Maybe the bass gets boosted on noise cancellation? Like i say, turning off the cancellation stops it, and the bass come through just fine')
