The link is literally empty; there&#x27;s nothing more at the link than the custom title we see here.<p>So, basically, if it comes down to Russia being the defendant, the mere accusation alone should already be sufficient, because Russia always denies the validity of evidence, so, hence there&#x27;s no need to provide any, because it&#x27;ll only make it easier for the defendant to defend themselves, when all the evidence is on public display?!<p>And this happens every single time?  If Russia is the defendant, then they&#x27;re surely guilty?  So, we shouldn&#x27;t even go into the trouble of bothering to collect or examine the evidence?  I mean, can you even remember any time, any one single time, when Russia was accused merely for political gain, and we should have been smarter than taking the bait?')
