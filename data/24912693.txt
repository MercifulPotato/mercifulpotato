People nag about other companies using whiteboard interviews as some kind of &quot;silver bullet&quot; of hiring. Most of the time I see negative comments about it, it is that some small startup which is trying to get people to work below market price is grilling people on interview like Facebook or Google. (as a side note there is whole list of bad stuff that medium&#x2F;small companies do just because &quot;goog&#x2F;fb does that&quot;, but they should never do)<p>Other negative that I see in discussions is, technical interviewers are assholes that want to show you how smart they are. Which FAANG interviewing style is helping to spread. Asking random algo question, that you know answer to and the person you are interviewing does not, makes it easy to feel superior.<p>Being thoughtful about hiring... Yes if hiring manager has resources to do that then he might build amazing hiring engine. Again most of the companies have scarce resources, and entrepreneurs probably spend more time on sales than on hiring, because you should hire only if you really have to. Probably hiring is also not their core business.')
