Item(by='spijdar', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610558320, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25756932, text='&gt; I bet both Intel and AMD aren&#x27;t exactly in love with x86 at the moment<p>This has been the case for, eh, decades now? To me it&#x27;s almost a joke how many times Intel has tried to replace ia32 with a modernized replacement and miserably failed to make any headway.<p>I suppose Intel doesn&#x27;t want to try competing with the legion of architecturally similar RISC cores and would rather &quot;go big&quot; with ideas like Itanium&#x2F;i860&#x2F;i960&#x2F;iAPX. It&#x27;s funny to imagine, but maybe one day they&#x27;d release a RISC-V implementing processor. Can&#x27;t imagine them licensing the rights to ARM, and going with Power or MIPS also seems out of character.')
