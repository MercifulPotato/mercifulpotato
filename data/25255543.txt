We spent months unsuccessfully trying to compute kinematics and sensor coordinate transformations on vectors of quarternions by “hand” with numpy. I wouldn’t wish it on my worst enemy. There are so many opportunities for mistakes, and the intermediate numbers can rarely be checked against your intuition.<p>With SymPy however (and some optional Newtonian physics package), one can simply define their free-bodies and coordinate systems, and SymPy will spit out simplified, compiled tensors of whatever expressions they want! It was truly magical at the time.')
