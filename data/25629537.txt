Isn&#x27;t the UK now trading with Europe at World Trade Organization tariffs? Or was a better deal made? The EU has trading agreements with a significant part of the world. See this map for example: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;trade.ec.europa.eu&#x2F;doclib&#x2F;docs&#x2F;2020&#x2F;december&#x2F;tradoc_159174.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;trade.ec.europa.eu&#x2F;doclib&#x2F;docs&#x2F;2020&#x2F;december&#x2F;tradoc_...</a>. If the UK is now trading at WTO rules they would be worse off than all those countries that have an agreement. Eyeballing that chart about 50% of the world would have an easier route to trade with the EU than the UK.')
