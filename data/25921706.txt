Send me an email (profile has it) and I&#x27;ll send you a resume you can dump into the ATS system to see if anyone thinks I&#x27;d be a good fit. (And no, I don&#x27;t send my resume to head hunters to shop around).<p>The second challenge is that I am in a position to be reasonably frank when the biggest threat one can hold over me is to be fired. I have found that some managers don&#x27;t appreciate employees for whom their &quot;hire&#x2F;fire power&quot; over them doesn&#x27;t give them any leverage. This combined with a general perception that I am a good manager, means that I tend to develop a followship whether or not I&#x27;m in a leadership role. This can lead to &quot;issues&quot; no matter how hard I try to prevent them.')
