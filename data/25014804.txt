So far I am very happy I went back to a REST API.<p>Oh and here’s another REST benefit: when working on my REST API I spend most of my time thinking about good API design and testing practices. When working with GraphQL I spent most of my time figuring out how GraphQL ecosystem libraries worked. I would much rather spend my time thinking about how to do the job well than how to glue together an ecosystem of tools that someone else designed. Admittedly this is a very subjective line to draw, for instance I loved Rails and some people make the same criticism of Rails that I make here for the GraphQL ecosystem.')
