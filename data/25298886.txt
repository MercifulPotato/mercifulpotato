The few leetcode-style or coding questions I had were easily prepared for from my ~40 hours of interview-specific coding prep.<p>There is zero chance I would have gotten those interviews or passed them without excelling at my job. My resume would have looked terrible if I didn&#x27;t go above and beyond at my last role, and I would have given weak answers to some of the questions I was asked if I didn&#x27;t have real experience with the subject matter or a relevant situation.<p>I think I understand why you have the perspective you have. Indeed, many modern software interviews can feel far removed from the actual job, and we all know that even well-executed interviews sometimes result in decisions barely better than a coin flip. However, unless you <i>really</i> enjoy leetcode, I can&#x27;t think of anything more depressing than studying for interviews all day. Also, it is hard to prepare for interviews at higher levels (senior&#x2F;staff) without actual experience produced by doing a good job.')
