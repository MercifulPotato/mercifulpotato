They are basically a solution to just in time delivery for restaurants and nothing else.<p>all They grow are great salad crops. Thats about it. If you&#x27;re going holistic, you can farm fish at the same time. But that introduces a load of complications.<p>Look, if you want to make the world a better place you need to:<p>1) come up with a simple system that can create good quality soil (think Terra preta, but different blends for different regions of the world)<p>2) make a multch that is cheap, safe and sustainable, so normal farmers can reduce water loss<p>3) create a cheap fast robot that can remove weeds<p>4) same again but for pests.<p>5) make a system of payments that allows both mixed crops (ie fruit&#x2F;lumber&#x2F;nuts) as well as livestock and arable.<p>Out of all of them 5 is the hardest. Its also the one that will have the biggest impact on climate (mixed land holds the most water, regulates heat and captures the most carbon, it also can have the lowest yield.)')
