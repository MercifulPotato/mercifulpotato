As an &quot;adult student&quot; the system seems 10x more broken than it was when I was a high school graduate.<p>Being young and tuition-free it was easy to grind through the material just worrying about the next test in the next class. Now, here I am as a tricenarian trying to relax and understand hundreds of pages of anatomy material while everyone else seems to just binge seems so asinine. After 75 pages of reading, exams continue to be a black box. Here I am paying for instruction and the professors can&#x27;t be bothered to tell me what&#x27;s important to know for the career let alone the test.<p>I got one teacher to chat off the record and he basically said to &quot;get through it.&quot; What a disservice to students. Why are there still weeding-out classes? How many doctors, surgeons, programmers, engineers would there be in the world if it wasn&#x27;t for these classes? The Montessori education system and the like seem so superior. College should be pass&#x2F;fail.')
