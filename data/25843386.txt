Any time I express concern over China I&#x27;m voted into oblivion.<p>It&#x27;s the same with Apple, but that I expect.<p>Recently I think someone has taken to downvoting entirely innocuous posts I make from my post history. Sometimes I&#x27;ll post replies to day-old threads and find myself downvoted within half an hour.<p>You&#x27;re about to be downvoted too, btw.')
