Location sharing seems so niche that bundling it into the client encourages poor opsec&#x2F;privacy behavior.<p>As I have heard, Telegram is unencrypted by default. Both WhatsApp and Telegram are poor at making this 100% clear 100% of the time despite privacy being a major purpose of the apps. I&#x27;ll admit I really haven&#x27;t used telegram much but WhatsApp encourages backing up chats to cloud storage. WhatsApp also only provides a single alert that a contact&#x27;s security code has changed. It also doesn&#x27;t encourage verifying the security code on the <i>initial</i> contact. i.e if someone out of the blue contacts you on WhatsApp the only security is the phone number.')
