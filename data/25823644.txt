The history as most voters perceive it is: crime was high and rising fast in the 70s and 80s, until we got &quot;tough on crime&quot; in the late 80s and early 90s, and crime finally started declining once all the criminals knew we&#x27;d be tough. So they conclude that the modern American justice system is what&#x27;s causing crime to decline, and are concerned that being &quot;soft on crime&quot; would make crime start spiking again.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I&#x27;m not a fan of mass incarceration, but you can see where the skepticism of reform comes from. It&#x27;s impossible to overstate how bad things were perceived to be in the 90s.')
