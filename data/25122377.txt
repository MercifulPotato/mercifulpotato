The diagonal stripes that you eventually see are\na manifestation of the hidden pattern in RND - the pattern \nthat makes it pseudorandom instead of truly random.&quot; (1) (2)<p>In another part of the manual it also explains the mathematical properties of the built-in random generator:<p>&quot;(For mathematicians only.)\nLet p be a (large) prime, and let a be a primitive\nroot modulo p.\nThen if bi is the residue of a’ modulo p (1 &lt;= bi &lt;= p-1), the sequence<p>(bi-1)&#x2F;(p-1)<p>is a cyclical sequence of p-1 distinct numbers\nin the range 0 to 1 (excluding 1). By choosing\na suitably, these can be made to look fairly random.<p>65537 is a Fermat prime, 2^16+1. Because the multiplicative\ngroup of non-zero residues\nmodulo\n65537\nhas a power\nof 2 as its order,\na residue\nis a primitive\nroot if\nand only if it is not a quadratic\nresidue.\nUse Gauss’\nlaw of quadratic\nreciprocity\nto\nshow\nthat 75 is a primitive\nroot modulo\n65537.&quot; (3)<p>---<p>1) It works by directly changing the &quot;attributes&quot; part of the memory which is directly mapped to the color of the 8x8 pixel part of the screen used for different characters (22 rows of 32 characters == 704), randomly selecting both the position on the screen and the value of the attribute, two calls per one loop pass. It&#x27;s beautiful in how short the program is.<p>2) The appearance of &quot;the diagonal stripes&quot;: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ibb.co&#x2F;kB2qS2L" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ibb.co&#x2F;kB2qS2L</a><p>3) Is the suggested proof online now somewhere?')
