Item(by='mindslight', descendants=None, kids=[25497942], score=None, time=1608574428, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25497484, text='The same way you don&#x27;t get super gouged when choosing a restaurant while hangry - non-urgent shoppers keep prices down across the board, even for urgent participants.<p>I&#x27;m not saying this makes for some total solution - just reacting to rejection of the market dynamic having any worth. It&#x27;s foolish to cast aside entire paradigms of approaches because they don&#x27;t fully solve every corner case. (The dual would be to ask how single payer healthcare solves purely elective procedures like cosmetic surgery. It doesn&#x27;t.)<p>Obviously any market dynamic for urgent care needs to recognize that no contract has been formed, and so hospitals can&#x27;t unilaterally set charges under a fallacious idea of contract. For instance when your car gets towed under duress (accident on the highway, expired papers, etc), the state sets the rates they&#x27;re allowed to charge. They&#x27;re still inflated, but at least within a factor of 2-3x the usual market.<p>(FWIW I think single payer is a good pragmatic way forward)')
