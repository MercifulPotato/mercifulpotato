I was at Amazon too in that time frame, and I don&#x27;t recall the Sun to Linux transition to be all that big a deal.<p>Amazon was always at that time facing challenges on every front, the dot-com bubble breaking etc. There was a large build out of distribution centres around this time  that was very expensive.<p>This was just one more of the challenges they faced. I may not have been senior enough to be privy to all the details, but I don&#x27;t think this particular migration brought the company to near bankruptcy. That&#x27;s a stretch.<p>I think the big migration was the database, and it took time, and Oracle was having some difficulties with running on Linux. But we were already using Linux boxes on our desktops since 1999. Webservers had switched to Linux around 1999. And migrating core code base which mostly C&#x2F;C++ with Java starting to appear to Linux was mostly a challenge for the infrastructure teams and one of those routine large projects that every company has. I don&#x27;t recall anybody talking of bankruptcy for this reason.')
