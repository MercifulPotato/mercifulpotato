Pretty soon I added the ability to roll and chat in private rooms with your friends, so it became basically a chat site for roleplaying games.<p>Then Roll20 launched, and my Rolz was basically crushed by it. Other sites have sprung up en masse, too. Rolz doesn&#x27;t really have a userbase left right now.<p>Nevertheless, it is <i>the only thing I ever did&#x2F;launched that people actually used and cared about</i>, so I decided to finally start adding features again. I&#x27;m working on a Virtual Tabletop feature right now, it&#x27;s very early, but usable in a rudimentary way.<p>I&#x27;ll probably post to Show HN when it&#x27;s more fully featured and battle-tested (no realistic expectation of making front page though), but if you want to check out the progress so far you can try it out right now.')
