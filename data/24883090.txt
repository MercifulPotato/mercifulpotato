A lot of us live in places where summer days can easily top 100 degrees, and the better part of the year it&#x27;s just too darn unpleasant to walk outside.  I suppose it&#x27;s possible if one works at an office with showers and lockers to allow for changing clothes, but even then it&#x27;s unpleasant and still unsuitable for everything else.')
