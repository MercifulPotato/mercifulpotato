Item(by='lostcolony', descendants=None, kids=[24866473], score=None, time=1603430552, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24866230, text='They were &quot;free&quot;, but they&#x27;ve always been supplied lower than demand (that is, the number of permits grew slower than the population&#x27;s need for taxis did), an arrangement that worked well for cab drivers since it allowed less competition, and a profitable secondary market for the medallions. Lyft&#x2F;Uber&#x2F;etc gutted that demand.<p>Not saying &#x27;good&#x27; or &#x27;bad&#x27;, just, you can&#x27;t blame the city for the price of the medallion; it already had a high one due to the demand outstripping the supply.
