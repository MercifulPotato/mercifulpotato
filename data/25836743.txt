No long term planning or focus, and perpetual &quot;election season&quot; thrashing one way or another while nothing is followed through with.<p>Plus, in 2, 4 or 8 years many of the leaders are gone and making money in lobbying or corporate positions. No possibly short-term-painful but long term beneficial policy gets enacted, etc.<p>And many still uphold our &quot;values&quot; and our system as the ideal, and question any that would look towards the Chinese model as providing something to learn from. So, I anticipate this trend will continue.')
