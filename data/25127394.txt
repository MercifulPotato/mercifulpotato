Bandannas, near zero. N95, quite good.[1] Cloth masks are all over the place depending on material, weave, etc.\nCDC: &quot;During a pandemic, cloth masks may be the only option available; however, they should be used as a last resort when medical masks and respirators are not available&quot;.<p>Ordinary medical masks are easy to get now. N95 masks are still hard to get in the US. The trick that makes N95 masks work is that they have a middle layer that&#x27;s an electret with tiny holes, with a semi-permanent static charge. That will capture solid particles smaller than the holes by electrostatic attraction. So it can actually stop an aerosol.  Cloth masks and the lower tiers of medical masks don&#x27;t have that.<p>It&#x27;s pathetic that, nine months into the epidemic, the US doesn&#x27;t have N95 masks in volume production. Prices on eBay are 10x normal. Normal price is under $20 for a box of 20.
