If you do this:<p>Most often when calling programs with a shell script it is recommended to make use of env to find it.<p>Like...<p><pre><code>    #!&#x2F;usr&#x2F;bin&#x2F;env python3\n</code></pre>\nAs in the limitations link above, env is pretty much everywhere, and when it isn&#x27;t, you&#x27;re probably going to struggle anyway to make anything portable to those systems.<p>env actually has an in-built flag for ensuring you&#x27;re passing arguments.<p><pre><code>    #!&#x2F;usr&#x2F;bin&#x2F;env -S python3 -m http.server 8010</code></pre>')
