Goals take a lot of will power which, for me, is exhausting and affects other areas of my life.<p>On the other hand, making it easier to to what I want to do has actually enabled me to enact those changes.<p>I want to be more tidy? I&#x27;ll get the boxes&#x2F;bins&#x2F;containers that I need so the effort to put something away is minimal.<p>I want to wake up earlier, I&#x27;ll setup a light alarm and have my bedroom at a comfortable temperature by the time I want to get up. (I realized that a big issue for me was leaving the warm be for the cold bedroom, so a warm bedroom makes things A LOT easier!)<p>I want to recycle? Get the proper bin and make as effortless as possible throwing a plastic on the recycling bin as it is on the regular trash bin.')
