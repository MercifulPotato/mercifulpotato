This is not a problem anyone has, which is precisely why so few formats have a solution.<p>&quot;widespread industry use&quot;<p>It&#x27;s not in &quot;widespread&quot; use. It&#x27;s in <i>niche</i> use, and it&#x27;s been in niche use for about two decades, and shows no sign of escaping that niche.<p>Human perception is a bit broken here. You show a list of 100 users and it looks like a tech is in &quot;widespread use&quot;... because you don&#x27;t intuit that the market has <i>hundreds of thousands</i> of users, if not millions. (I&#x27;m being conservative. It&#x27;s almost certainly millions.) RDF is niche. You can comfortably read an effectively-complete list of users over a coffee break. Try that trick with JSON.<p>Also, to be honest, referring to &quot;haters&quot; rather proves my point about just how quickly insults get trotted out. You almost literally just said &quot;RDF!&quot; with no further substantive conversation exactly the way I mentioned! I know about RDF. I used it ~2005 when working on some Mozilla stuff. It had every opportunity to overtake JSON, and was never in any danger of it.<p>In fact my current job for the last few weeks has been working on a massively cross-team data lake in the company I work for... and <i>nobody</i> is talking about RDF. Not me (and I do know it, actually), not any vendor that might provide useful technology, not any vendor that consumes data to provide reports on it (<i>nobody</i> consumes RDF in this space), nobody. Nominally a core use case for &quot;semanticness&quot;, and it&#x27;s a complete non-starter.')
