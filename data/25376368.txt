Turns out bestbuy.com on my phone has all the same features.<p>I also have Netflix, Amazon Video and Hulu - but not because I want those apps, but because you can&#x27;t play their video content in the mobile browser.<p>But most of the time all apps do is annoy the crap out of me with pointless notifications. And I&#x27;m thankful that the latest Android let&#x27;s me disable notifications for these apps - the entire experience is extremely pro-company, not pro-user. I think apps should die and if you want games get a switch.')
