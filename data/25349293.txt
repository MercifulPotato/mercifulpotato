Item(by='jariel', descendants=None, kids=[25358282, 25351247], score=None, time=1607451678, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25345777, text='&quot;You are more likely to be violently attacked working at a convenience store than being a cop.&quot;<p>You are absolutely more likely to be shot at while serving a warrant, than working in a convenience store.<p>&quot;Citizens that choose to carry a weapon for self-defense cannot point their weapon a people just in case&quot;<p>Citizens are not police officers, entrusted to carry out the law and who must <i>actively</i> confront danger, moreover, police are trained to do so.<p>&quot;Then this is a failure of their training or a failure of the individual police.&quot;<p>This is wrong to the extent that it&#x27;s very rational for police to at least have weapons drawn when individuals are refusing to comply with the warrant etc.. &#x27;Weapons drawn&#x27; is a very simple tactic, which makes them easy to use <i>if</i> necessary. It is not in and of itself particularly dangerous.<p>&quot;First, it is not too dangerous. &quot;<p>Yes it is. [1] (from the AP, not Fox News) Have a little Google yourself.<p>&quot; Second, if it is, then pick a new line of work&quot;<p>This is a shameful remark, exemplary of the general tone here. &quot;If you don&#x27;t want to get COVID and die - quit being a nurse - now go ahead and work without a mask!&quot;. It&#x27;s absurd (and basically offensive) to suggest that public servants shouldn&#x27;t have the right to take appropriate steps to defend themselves, or even have to put themselves in a position of danger, let alone harassment in the first place.<p>Even African American Police officers are called the n-word and put up with all sorts of horrible abuses (just search &#x27;police&#x27; on TikTok) which should definitely be illegal: you cannot go into the DMV or IRS (or Wallmart!) and start harassing people - the same should apply to police.<p>If the woman in question was concerned for the safety of her children, she would have simply opened the door and &#x27;used her words&#x27;.<p>If in fact, the Gov. is illegally intimidating her, and she&#x27;s done no wrong, well then I hope the judge recognizes that.<p>Finally, police reform is not going to come form the plebes on social media, it&#x27;s going to have to be done thoughtfully, by them, led probably by ex-police officers who have first-hand experience.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apnews.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;30fd23e66f21446b90d2b8cb0135ae03" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apnews.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;30fd23e66f21446b90d2b8cb0135ae03</a>')
