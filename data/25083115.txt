It&#x27;s not about limiting people&#x27;s time it&#x27;s about making sure companies don&#x27;t take advantage of people. You can make a similar argument about all labor regulations, eg why limit people to 40 hours if they&#x27;re willing to work more for the same pay if their employer doesn&#x27;t want to pay overtime?')
