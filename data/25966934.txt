I&#x27;ve been on track with Ex-Grand Prix Drivers.  Some of the biggest names in racing, and for sure the Worlds Best racing instructors helped teach me how to drive race cars at the limit of adhesion. I have consulted with the same sports psychologist that pioneered the training program for F1 and Indy car racers at Methodist Hospital in Indianapolis--The Performance Institute. They actually called me on the phone when my test results were calculated and told me &quot;I wasting my time running a contracting business&quot; because I was a World Class racer as far as their testing was concerned.<p>Now I&#x27;m not saying I have ever driven a car with the insane performance of an F1 car. I did however walk away from an offer for a fully funded season to race a Swift DB6 (2 liter) after I had tested in that year&#x27;s national championship winning car. What a fucking car, I loved that car! There were two reasons why I walked away from that offer: Mainly because I am Not brilliant at learning new race tracks. And the faster and more expensive the race car--the less time you have to learn a new circuit and get into your racing rhythm (I suspect this is because I did not race as a child. I was in my twenty&#x27;s when I started going to racing schools and racing). And the second reason is I was 33 years old at that time; I had a wife, a newborn baby, a contracting business, and a mortgage.<p>However; I was arguably the fastest Formula Ford driver in America on any given day. I beat a National race winner&#x27;s lap time by .4 of a second a lap using the exact same car race car in back to back sessions.<p>For years and years.. and YEARS--all I thought about was how to be a better driver. Every sport I played was done to improve either my balance (driving at the limit, is in good part--feel and balance), my concentration and my strength.<p>My point is I have some idea of what is required to drive \na F1 car. I really don&#x27;t to put anyone down here: but the fact is a racing driver Would Never Ever buy a self-driving car. And trust me unless you own fire proof underwear and can drive 100 mph on a snow covered road (with winter tires of course. Racers&#x27; employ a particular eye technique coupled a steering tactic gives us so much more time to make decisions when we drive. Plus we can drive a car sideways while whistling a happy tune) you would have a hard time imagining just how good GOOD really is.<p>Launch control, dual clutch transmissions yeah we love that stuff it let&#x27;s us drive quicker.<p>Traction control, automatic braking, lane departure systems we hate shit. And No real racer would buy any car where those systems can&#x27;t be turned off. I turn them off my on car ALWAYS and MOST ESPECIALLY in the Snow, Ice and rain... that shit is off--because I&#x27;m FAR better at controlling the car than those systems are.')
