Of course, a production-level compiler would use a faster algorithm)<p>If so, you still might have to annotate some library functions that are implemented outside the language, but that would be it. The annotations are there for the programmer as, without them, it would be hard to keep track of which of your functions are pure, which might throw, etc.')
