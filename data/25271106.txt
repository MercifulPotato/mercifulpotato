There is something rotten in the research labs where society is not getting return on investment for basic research.<p>If the goal is to just produce researchers that can work at corporate research labs, then I feel we could get more bang for the buck.<p>If the goal is to do move research in the public good, something needs to change. Maybe it’s the fact there’s too little money out there, and it causes everyone to chase meager grant money. Or that there’s too much competition between groups. Or a million other reasons.<p>But I’d love to see it fixed and have more faith in public investment in basic science.')
