Do you see their political beliefs reflected here?&quot; (E.g. Rand, Orwell, etc.), &quot;Does my workplace allow trans people to use the restrooms of their choosing?&quot;, &quot;Who grows this food, and how are they compensated?&quot;, &quot;Who makes this garment, and how are they treated?&quot;, &quot;Where does my electricity come from and how is it produced?&quot;. Etc.<p>We can choose to ignore these questions, but that doesn&#x27;t mean they aren&#x27;t there. While they aren&#x27;t directly answered with &quot;The Democrats&quot; or &quot;The Republicans&quot; or whatever, they pretty quickly have answers that fall into one camp or another.')
