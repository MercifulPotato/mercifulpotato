On-top of the privacy issues with most variants Chrome is also the new Internet Explorer, monoculture and forced &quot;standards&quot; and all. Firefox would have to become <i>really</i> bad for me to even consider switching and, again IMHO, Firefox is also better than most critics say it is. Every time I see a critic of FF I have a hard time taking it seriously as most are hyperbole or FUD. Like &quot;it uses x GB RAM!&quot; and I look in Task manager and see it uses way way less*. It seems it has become hip to attack Mozilla and Firefox all the while using Chrome, Gmail and Google search (or if really hip all of these except DDG instead of Google search).<p>* Atm. on my PC Firefox with 3 sites open and 10 add-ons installed (Including adblocker, decentraleyes and containers) uses 630,5MB RAM and 0 - 0,3% (of a very old I7) CPU.')
