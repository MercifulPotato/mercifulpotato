Change rarely works this way. Our decisions to do something (especially this drastic) are composed of numerous influences.<p>Part of change is about what people expect to be the new normal. If all your friends are ok with homosexual marriages, you&#x27;ll likely change your point of view soon enough anyway. If many of your friends at least mention that they are concerned about factory farm abuses of animals, you might one day decide to eat one less hamburger.<p>Change is much easier when younger; I changed during college years. I&#x27;m now 35 and I&#x27;m sure to have nudged at least some of my friends to eat less meat in the last decade. Much of it probably was just my consistency. If your friend tries a fad diet, you can ignore it. If their diet lasts 5 years, you&#x27;ll at least want to learn more about why and how.<p>It&#x27;s an important issue to change others&#x27; opinions on. A great book about this subject is &quot;<i>Change of Heart: What Psychology Can Teach Us About Spreading Social Change</i>&quot; by Nick Cooney')
