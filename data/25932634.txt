If you can&#x27;t run it, you can&#x27;t use it and the rich UX and deep system integrations don&#x27;t matter.<p>So developers cast about looking for alternatives to Qt and GTK and friends. Flash and Java (and Silverlight....) all had browser plugins and offered vaguely convenient APIs for building applications with rich UXs. Unfortunately those plugins had inherent technical issues and died (or were killed, as it were).<p>So what platform remained that had super easy distribution and portability? A XML document format that supported directives for styling xml and some rudimentary scripting language that could dynamically change that xml and styling.<p>So that&#x27;s what ended up getting built upon. And now, since abstraction can do anything, we finally have things resembling what we had 30 years ago in desktop applications but built on top of a standardized runtime with a JIT and a sandbox and a nascent assembly language. So that&#x27;s finally what people use.<p>I really had nothing but disdain for web applications built with javascript&#x2F;jquery soup for the longest time. They worked, sure, and printed money and all that, but I was bitter that such poor technology was what won, instead of some evolution of the existing desktop app paradigm.<p>Now with React et al it&#x27;s finally getting bearable again. But I still find myself wishing I could just say forget all this web junk, I could write this as a Swing or JavaFX program in 10% of the time.<p>(It&#x27;s just unfortunate that nobody would be able to use it because nobody downloads programs off random websites anymore except Putty and nobody has an (independently-installed) Java runtime anymore. Which brings us right back to the initial problem).')
