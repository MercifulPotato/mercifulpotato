If it&#x27;s something like &quot;don&#x27;t eat meat on odd-numbered dates&quot;, you&#x27;re probably fine. On the other hand, you say something harmful or distasteful to other protected categories, you&#x27;d be lucky to keep your account. They&#x27;d weigh the harm to you of kicking you off versus the harm to others by letting you stay and (of course) the PR liability incurred by doing either.<p>If the discrimination criteria are broadly found to match up with a protected class you&#x27;re in legal hot water. IOW using proxies for &quot;plausible deniability&quot; is a risky strategy and businesses have been punished in the past for doing it.<p>&gt; It cannot be a fuzzy &quot;I dislike what you do&quot;, as it is prone to selective enforcement<p>You&#x27;re right it can be. But again, consider the alternative on online forums. Anyone could post porn or vulgarity on religious forums, or socialist propaganda on business forums. It would be very disruptive if selective enforcement weren&#x27;t allowed.')
