It was more of choose the career and surround yourself with the type of people that are good for your type..<p>But again, some criticism here is spot on for different resons while other is quite unfounded. But it seems to me that mr PG hasn’t changed much, his essays stayed pretty much the same while the whole landscape has transformed quite a bit since his early essays. If one of his vhehement critics is to read an old PG essay thinking it is recent they’d probably have the same reaction.')
