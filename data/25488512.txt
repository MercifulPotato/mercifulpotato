Item(by='peter_d_sherman', descendants=None, kids=[25488760], score=None, time=1608489904, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25487517, text='Er, yes, but...<p>Everything in Economics&#x2F;Business&#x2F;Transactions can be thought of as having two separate dimensions:<p>1) Intrinsic Value<p>2) Perceptual Value (that is, all value that is not intrinsic)<p>We might call #2 &quot;Speculative Value&quot; or value that can change relative to outside circumstances or conditions, and #1 value that cannot so easily change, perhaps &quot;Fixed Value&quot; or &quot;Constant Value&quot;.<p>Now, if your idea that Tesla stock is overpriced -- well, I would politely submit that &quot;the market thinks otherwise&quot;.<p>The market, at the time a measurement is taken, represents the exact parity value of the Intrinsic and Perceptual (at that point in time) values, or the constant (underlying) and varying (speculative) values combined.<p>The market is always exactly correct when it makes a price determination, at the exact point in time when that price determination was made.<p>In other words, if you know the fixed value of something (e.g., company earnings and projected profits over the next 20 years), you can figure out the varying, speculative value of something by simple subtraction of that from the market price.<p>Thus you can determine that Tesla, at this point in time, has a huge amount of speculative value.<p>Maybe your bet is that Tesla is going to go down in the future, that some of that speculative value will be lost, and maybe that&#x27;s true, but to advance a personal opinion against a market in terms of determinating the speculative value of something at the present point in time is foolhardy, because by definition the market is always right, because it&#x27;s always the best measure of that speculative value.<p>Now, there are other factors.<p>One important factor is how much money is being injected or taken out of the money supply.  When a lot of money is put in -- then stock prices naturally rise.  That&#x27;s because in addition to the intrinsic and speculative values of a stock, one must also consider a stock&#x27;s value relative to the money supply.<p>A positive earning stock should (if all other economic factors were equal, but they aren&#x27;t) rise naturally when more money enters the money supply (it isn&#x27;t rising, it&#x27;s keeping pace with inflation minimally, and maximally, it&#x27;s outstripping the inflation curve.)<p>Opinion: Tesla may rise for a few years to come... but watch out(!) when when there&#x27;s less money in the money supply...<p>...Although, when that happens, Tesla&#x27;s (and other similarly high-performing stock) might be the equivalent of the proverbial &quot;canary in a coal mine&quot; -- that is, a marker or warning of things to come...')
