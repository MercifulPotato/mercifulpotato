You make recommendations. You state which areas you haven&#x27;t had the time to look at. Under no circumstances do you provide any guarantees that might put you at the wrong end of a multi-million dollar lawsuit.<p>This, incidentally, is every audit ever. I&#x27;ve been audited many times, every audit finds stuff and make recommendations. Then management gets to pick which recommendations they adopt and which they&#x27;ll derogate. I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s a completely useless process, but it doesn&#x27;t provide the cast-iron guarantees people think it does.<p>Then, of course, there&#x27;s financial audits, which are meant to provide a cast-iron guarantee the firm is still a viable entity. But nearly every big firm that went bankrupt had passed such an audit in the previous year.')
