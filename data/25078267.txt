For example, in some tasks you may prefer a voice command system that has more flexibility than mere keywords, where the instructions are phrases matching the users&#x27; language (you might want the same product to support many languages) but the system needs to understand only a very limited subset of language that can be expressed with a strict grammar - mainly because its ability to do stuff is also limited to what that subset can express.<p>The benefit of a strict grammar over (for example) NN transformer architectures for NLG and NLU is that it&#x27;s relatively straightforward to map the structures of that grammar to the structured data that your non-NLP code is using for the business logic, you can have a clear and debuggable 1-to-1 mapping for the semantics of these phrases.')
