Never ever have I written a post and got that amount of nice feedback. First the maintainer of ziglearn.org and now you.<p>This is the thing I love so much and if you guys combine this absolutely amazing attitude with some professional marketing I just see a bright, bright future for the Zig language.<p>I tried all the so called C replacements, and especially Rust. The Zig language is the only approach where one does not need an IQ of a 130 to learn it. Just please you guys do everything to not vanish into a absolute niche like D did, because D was and in my opinion still is such a great candidate&#x2F;language, they just should have done better marketing.<p>I would be looking forward for your book and would be the very first one to buy it!!! Also, can I donate to ziglearn, Zig Showtime and&#x2F;or the Zig Foundation?<p>In my opinion Linus should think about letting Zig into the kernel and not Rust :D. Maybe one day you guys will also achieve that.')
