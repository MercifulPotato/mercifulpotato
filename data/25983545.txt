It&#x27;s why &quot;historically&quot; good brands can get taken over by relative bad actors, perhaps &quot;just&quot; greed, and pillage the good reputation and reach a brand has - and because they already have the resources, processes, and reach - they can maintain it more easily; it&#x27;s far harder to break through the noise to create a new brand with mass mindshare than to acquire, and why acquisitions happen and conglomerates form - as a form of suppression and to continue maintaining control.')
