Item(by='santah', descendants=None, kids=[25631049, 25620706], score=None, time=1609658745, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25614966, text='<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;next-episode.net" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;next-episode.net</a> is a service I run for more than 15 years now.<p>It&#x27;s a TV &#x2F; Movies tracking website&#x2F;community that helps people organize what they watch and find new shows to watch.<p>I started it for myself (because I couldn&#x27;t find such tool back in the day) while I was working as a front end developer in an outsourcing company and it slowly grew and became my (only) day job.<p>There is a lot to do in terms of user support and constant maintenance and development (considering also the iOS and Android apps), but I&#x27;ve made the conscious decision to stay a sole developer and not try and hire people to help. For me - I feel this works great even though I realize I may be missing a lot by not trying to scale up by hiring.<p>Hope that makes sense.<p>I&#x27;m around if anyone has any questions.')
