Has been for decades, even before containers existed. Guess what the sites-available and sites-enabled directories for apache and nginx are for.<p>&gt; Oh look, a custom Nginx config only one person understands.<p>Just because you put it in a container doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s no longer custom or that everyone suddenly understands it.<p>&gt;  Oh look, some hacked up letsencrypt config only one person understands, etc etc.<p>Plenty of people put their nasty hacks in containers and pod definitions and still nobody (or just 1 person) understands it. Packaging changes none of this; a dirty pod, container, VM image it&#x27;s all still dirty.<p>&gt; K8S on a single node does nothing for you network-wise\n&gt; - Container IP auto-assignment<p>So does docker, or even an uncontainerized bridge interface<p>&gt; - Container security policy<p>So does Docker, or a plain cgroup<p>&gt; - Container DNS management\nYep, that it does. But when you only have 1 node, what is the point?<p>&gt; - Ingress management (&quot;custom Nginx config&quot;)<p>Great, but besides moving complexity from your app to the infra it doesn&#x27;t help at all on a single node. It actually gets worse: node goes down, everything goes down (app, fallback, load balancing, routing, security)<p>&gt; - &quot;Environment that feels like a large network and doesn&#x27;t change if moved to a large network&quot;<p>So unless you are doing some local development that you later on push to dev&#x2F;prod, we&#x27;re talking about feelings. Not much objective to say about that except that it exists.<p>&gt; What part of this is difficult to understand?<p>All of it. Shoving complexity and responsibility around doesn&#x27;t reduce it, and having people make bad software isn&#x27;t less bad because of the runtime it runs on.<p>Kubernetes in prod is great, and the envs that go with it (like development and staging), sure. But when you run something in prod, and you need availability, scalability and a host of standardised facilities, then a single node or some magic &#x27;it works by default&#x27; config is very far removed from real-world production.')
