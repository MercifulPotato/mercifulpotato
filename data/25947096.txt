Different animal same game park.<p>If I saw a stock doing what GameStop is doing, I&#x27;d pull the plug. One, we&#x27;d have already made a ton of money on it. More importantly, with this kind of volatility (and correlation), we&#x27;d be well outside the parameters of our risk models.<p>Usually, cash equities don&#x27;t have this problem. But there is a realistic chance that a desk will fill a bunch of sells, turn around, and within those microseconds watch the market gap down 50%.<p>It&#x27;s unlikely. But how unlikely? We don&#x27;t know. We&#x27;re too correlated, and too volatile, to predict that. You do something like that, particularly after the amount of press coverage this is getting, you are going to lose your job.<p>&gt; <i>I hope RH is burned to the ground after giving up whoever coerced them into doing this</i><p>Between the gameified UI that encouraged day trading, their reliance on payment for order flow and margin-lending &#x2F; options trading model, I won&#x27;t say this was bound to happen. But it was an identifiable risk.<p>The warning signs were clear when their systems went offline under large volumes. Concerns were dismissed then. I expect this will be forgotten by much of their user base soon enough as well.')
