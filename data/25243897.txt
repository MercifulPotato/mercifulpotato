Many cultures value being quiet and doing your job a lot more than others, and those values get passed down by parents for at least a few generations after immigrating. If that group doesn&#x27;t have a good support structure (no BLM equivalent), that only adds to the fear of speaking out.<p>If you&#x27;re a manager that gets many complaints from group Y but very few from group X, knowing that might lead you to do some more investigating and discover group X is being treated even worse, they&#x27;re just not reporting it.
