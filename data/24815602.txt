In the standard tort ones it&#x27;s a requirement largely because of the historical requirements behind the remedies associated with the acts.<p>Where the offenses aren&#x27;t linked to theories of compensation or restitution, but instead are based on punishment, they&#x27;re less likely to require injury and more likely to look at it as a factor in determining the magnitude of the punishment.<p>The rules regarding fraud in connection with TARP funds, lies to federal agents, etc. all run on this line.<p>Tell a federal agent you aren&#x27;t guilty of something when you are?
