Item(by='devenblake', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611247341, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25860628, text='crazy person yelling at cloud incoming. all opinions and i do recognize much of this is completely unrealistic for most users<p>Personally I learned HTML through General Assembly (though I remember it being free) and didn&#x27;t really use it for a couple years. Eventually I had an application (in the sense of something to which to <i>apply</i> HTML, not one of those godawful electron webapps) for my knowledge and just fashioned my site out of &lt;P&gt;s, a &lt;TITLE&gt;, and the appropriate &lt;HTML&gt;, &lt;BODY&gt;, &lt;HEAD&gt;, and closing tag.<p>That&#x27;s all most people should need! If a webpage is just text without any images it shouldn&#x27;t need dividers, buttons, sliders, GDPR notices (why the hell are you tagging my browser when I&#x27;m trying to read your blog?), or a ton of empty space. If you need margins add a stylesheet and if you need pretty colors that&#x27;s pretty easy.<p>I write my HTML by hand, in a terminal text editor, and save and refresh Firefox to view the updated work. And it works! Really well in fact. When I wanna make a new page I just `cp [the smallest file here] [new file]` and change around the title, canonical link, and header. It&#x27;s lacking in terms of weird meta tags for Twitter and Facebook but I don&#x27;t really want people linking to my stuff from those useless sites anyway. Every image has alt text, every page works decently in Lynx, and I&#x27;m quite happy with it. If you have to spend time on every line of HTML you quickly learn to stop adding useless code to your website.')
