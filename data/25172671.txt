Item(by='rnikander', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605991933, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25171532, text='I&#x27;m using it in production, but a few situations that I could handle with autolayout constraints seem impossible in SwiftUI. Examples here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.apple.com&#x2F;forums&#x2F;thread&#x2F;664283" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.apple.com&#x2F;forums&#x2F;thread&#x2F;664283</a>\nIn these 1% cases, I can make things &quot;good enough&quot; by hacking it with SwiftUI. But it bothers me. Sometimes I want to go past &quot;good enough&quot; and reach for &quot;perfect&quot;. I could do that with UIKit&#x2F;AppKit, but with SwiftUI they haven&#x27;t documented (or created) the layout system to allow it.')
