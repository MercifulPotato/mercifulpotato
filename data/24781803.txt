But the <i>ports</i> are more durable than lightning ports.<p>I&#x27;d say that&#x27;s a good compromise given the relative costs of a phone vs a cable.<p>That said, my Nokia 6.1 had the USB-C port fail in just a couple of years. Apple&#x27;s design for the USB-C ports on their laptops looks extra nice and durable though. They are machined out of the aluminium of the case itself.')
