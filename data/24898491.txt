Think a scraper for most sites can be built in an hour or two, depending on navigation and how data is sent to the client.<p>Definitely noticed a trend towards XHR and JSON responses typically using a numeric ID. Probably the easiest type of site to scrape where you don&#x27;t need to crawl navigation, simply iterate over a number range and the scraped data is already pretty much structured.')
