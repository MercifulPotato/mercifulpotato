I think they made an effort to build a library of knowledge recently, like DigitalOcean has - I was pleasantly surprised by this just last month.<p>Vultr is a bit “me too” in the cloud-provider space, but their prices are good and (the main reason they’re my main provider at the moment) they have very good support for BSD images, including OpenBSD - new releases drop pretty quickly.')
