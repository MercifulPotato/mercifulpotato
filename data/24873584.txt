That means I tried to force everyone on to hangouts &#x2F; chat &#x2F; meet &#x2F; duo &#x2F; allo &#x2F; etc etc. It&#x27;s not just a turn off in a personal space. It&#x27;s at the point I have given up on trying to get folks to standardize on google&#x27;s products.<p>Google just did a slack competitor, but to click the screen share button (very common in slack to want to talk and screen share to collab) you are forced over in to meet land, which forces you out of your chat and defaults to video (not wanted). It&#x27;s just such a total mess its totally incredible.')
