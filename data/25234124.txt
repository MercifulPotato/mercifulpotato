Here are some thoughts from my experience in no particular order:<p>- The program is suppose to be the same as on-campus, so the degree is the same (MS).<p>- It&#x27;s dirt cheap as far as master&#x27;s degrees go. My employer is paying 2&#x2F;3, so that sweetens the deal even more.<p>- Since it&#x27;s online and inexpensive, the program is growing a lot. I think in a few years it would be safe to assume that if someone has an MSCS from GT that it was obtained online.<p>- I&#x27;ve learned a lot of things that I wouldn&#x27;t have otherwise been exposed to.<p>- The workload hasn&#x27;t been bad, but it definitely can be if you&#x27;re not somewhat familiar with C, C++, and Python since most of the classes are project based. The workload exceptions have been ML and RL which are pretty time consuming. For context, I work full-time and have two toddlers.<p>- I honestly don&#x27;t think the online program is the same as on-campus. Maybe the topics are the same, but I very rarely had to study anything outside of the lecture videos, which are almost always very high-level, and the classes have been much less rigorous than my undergraduate classes (from a different university). Additionally, the online demographic is substantially different than on-campus (I imagine anyway). I think this translates to less stimulating discussion and larger grade curves.<p>- Expanding on the previous thought, the program has definitely been a &quot;what you put in is what you get out&quot; type of thing. You can coast and still get decent grades, so getting the most out of the program requires some discipline to study stuff that isn&#x27;t required to get the A.<p>- There is almost no interaction with the professors, but there is an instructor and TAs for each class who may or may not be helpful in answering your questions.<p>I&#x27;m glad I did the OMSCS program overall. I wish that I had the opportunity to get a master&#x27;s in-person at a top school, but I don&#x27;t want to quit my job, move, or pay out the nose, so I&#x27;ll take what I can get. I don&#x27;t think that the degree will result in higher compensation, but I&#x27;ve thought about maybe one day teaching at a community college or something like that and I figured I&#x27;d get the credential just in case.<p>I honestly don&#x27;t think very many, if any, employers will care about the ranking of the school you got a course-based master&#x27;s degree from. I think it matters more if you&#x27;re doing a thesis based master&#x27;s and want to do research.')
