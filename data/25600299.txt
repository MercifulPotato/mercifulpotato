A fuel cell is in fact a battery of sorts, and it&#x27;s not out of the question that it approaches the efficiency of a conventional battery.<p>It should also be pointed out that the lower weight of a fuel cell powertrain allows you to use less energy during operation. So even if fuel cells don&#x27;t fully match the efficiency of conventional batteries, they can still use less energy on a final basis.')
