If things like retain&#x2F;release are fast and you have significantly more memory bandwidth and low latency to throw at the problem, you can get away without preloading and caching nearly as much.  Take something simple like images on web pages: don&#x27;t bother keeping hundreds (thousands?) of decompressed images in memory for all of the various open tabs.  You can just decompress them on the fly as needed when a tab becomes active and then release them when it goes inactive and&#x2F;or when the browser&#x2F;system determines it needs to free up some memory.')
