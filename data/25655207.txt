Taiwan had cases from the very first set of Wuhan evacuees.<p>The virus <i>has</i> &quot;gotten in&quot;. No <i>local transmission</i> doesn&#x27;t mean people haven&#x27;t been returning infected from Wuhan, other Chinese cities, Europe and elsewhere all year.<p>Those infections haven&#x27;t spread, though.<p>Why are you so unwilling to give credit where credit is clearly due? Taiwan has done an <i>exemplary</i> job during this pandemic, despite high population density, close proximity to the initial outbreak and zero support whatsoever from the WHO.')
