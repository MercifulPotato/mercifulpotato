It was maybe a month of discomfort and then things started to get back to normal. They were helpful with getting my life back on track. I stopped taking the zolpidem when the retiring psychiatrist ignored a refill request (that I made during business hours with advanced notice). I decided from there that I wasn&#x27;t going to be dependent on medication to fall asleep.<p>The new psychiatrist was how you might expect any psychiatrist to be - fake sincerity. So yes, there was a sense of &quot;oh no we don&#x27;t want you to stop cold turkey ;) why don&#x27;t you take this new medication.&quot; The recommendation to change to a new medication manufactured by a major donor to the university was a red flag that made me decide to stop altogether.')
