It seems like it would be a win if it improved productivity and&#x2F;or retention even a tiny little bit.<p>But pretty much everywhere I’ve worked has had a “every three years” or “every four years” hardware upgrade policy.<p>Is there some accounting quirk that makes this kind of spending especially bad? Am I weird in that I’d probably take a new laptop (that, to be clear, the company would still own) over an equivalent raise?')
