The smallest saleable parcel was a &quot;quarter-quarter section&quot;, or 40 acres (~16 hectares) of land. The Homestead Acts would grant (at various times) 160, 320, or 640 acres of land to free for anyone who would farm out. In other wards, the &quot;small&quot; pioneer farms of American history <i>are in the top 1% of all farms.</i><p>Put differently, the large number of small farms is driven by the size of subsistence farms in the intense rice-growing areas of Southeast Asia (rice being more productive per acre than wheat, especially if you&#x27;re not dealing with industrial inputs). Then, you have the subsistence farms of less-productive crops like wheat, mostly in Africa.')
