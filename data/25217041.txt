So is this really drawing attention to the story? Maybe this is just drawing more attention to Coinbase&#x27;s version of the story, rather than the NYT&#x27;s version.<p>Basically, if you&#x27;re going to end up publishing a counterargument to an upcoming news story, why not publish the rebuttal first? Maybe the tradition of waiting for a bad newspaper article, then immediately publishing a rebuttal, is an artifact of the olden days when there were no corporate blogs and social media, when there was no way to bring attention to a pre-rebuttal.')
