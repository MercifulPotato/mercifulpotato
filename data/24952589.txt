You have two choices:<p>a) turn your back on the woods and return back to the usually-accepted and documented approaches and try them and their variations again or<p>b) continue in the unexplored woods.<p>For (b) to work you must try <i>everything you hear</i>. But you say you have chosen NOT to hear. If you want to live in ignorance and pain, by all means, help yourself.<p>But if you continue into the woods, it is the &quot;Auntie&quot; remedy, the anecdotal, the accidental personal discovery that will finally help you. IOW you have no choice: open up and listen to the &quot;woo remedies&quot; for there is nothing else for you, having exhausted what is &quot;known&quot;. And when you find the remedy, no one will hear you speak of it, since it will be &quot;anecdotal&quot;.<p><i>&quot;There are more things in Heaven and Earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy.&#x27;</i>\n- William Shakespeare')
