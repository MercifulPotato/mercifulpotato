Item(by='nickmqb', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606058536, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25176861, text='Most textures look fine despite the 4-bit quantization, but color artifacts&#x2F;hue change do become more apparent when multiplying with a light factor (to darken the textures on the bottom and sides of blocks), so I&#x27;d say 4-bit is definitely pushing the limit. 6 bits or even 8 bits per color component would be ideal, though unfortunately on a small FPGA like this we cannot afford such luxuries ;). It is probably the first thing I&#x27;d change if I were to port this to a larger FPGA, since it would be pretty straightforward to do and the increase in visual quality would likely be worth it.')
