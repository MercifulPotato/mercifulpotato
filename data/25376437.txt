Item(by='dkonofalski', descendants=None, kids=[25376620, 25376688, 25377341], score=None, time=1607623370, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25376249, text='That would be a completely legitimate argument except that people buy their devices <i>with the understanding that APple is the sole controller of what they can install</i>. It&#x27;s not monopolistic behavior because Apple doesn&#x27;t have a monopoly. Apple makes the devices, they are 100% legally allowed to only allow apps from their own App Store and that precedent has already been set. The only unique thing in this lawsuit is that Cydia is claiming to be a competitor to the App Store and I firmly believe that it&#x27;ll be tossed because Cydia&#x27;s entire existence is predicated on a process that, at the time it was operating, is illegal and violates the DMCA. I don&#x27;t necessarily think Cydia is bad and people should be able to jailbreak their devices if they want but that can&#x27;t be used as the basis for a lawsuit that alleges monopolistic behavior or even anti-trust.')
