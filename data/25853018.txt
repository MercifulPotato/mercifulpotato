It&#x27;s designed to solve a perceived problem <i>with Markdown</i>, without considering the problem that Markdown itself was created to solve (an easier way than HTML to write rich text in a plain text editor). What&#x27;s the set of people who both have that problem <i>and</i> have symbols vs keywords as their only barrier to fixing it?<p>Plus to me brackets, asterisks and other symbols are not an obscure tech thing. It&#x27;s literally how tons of sites and apps do their rich text formatting - Reddit and many other forums for one, messaging apps like Whatsapp and Discord for another.
