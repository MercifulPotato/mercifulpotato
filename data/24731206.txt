There were only a few of us so my artist wife simply wrote them (not using fancy calligraphy, simply clear printed handwriting) and we printed them up on the usual card stock.<p>I remember handing one to a VC who was mighty impressed and said, &quot;wow, the software you used is amazing.  Each character varies slightly.  I&#x27;m impressed.&quot;<p>We didn&#x27;t get an investment from their firm though; impressive as the cards may have been our actual product didn&#x27;t appeal to them.')
