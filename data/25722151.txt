And yes, you can be a free speech absolutist. Take a class in philosophy and educate yourself.<p>There are plenty of free speech absolutists who believe any speech, including direct threats, should be protected speech. That you should have the right to threaten anyone and everyone. Of course, acting out and carrying out the threats is illegal.<p>For example, if you said &quot;I am going to kill you&quot;, free speech absolutist believe that should be allowed. Now if you actually killed someone, then you should go to jail. Meaning there differentiate the words &quot;I am going to kill you&quot; with &quot;murder&quot;. In other words, murder is illegal, but saying you will commit murder is not. There is some nuance to it, but there are free speech absolutists out there.<p>But you are not a free speech absolutist. You lied about it. You aren&#x27;t even pro-free speech. You comments clearly show that you align with the pro-censorship crowd because you use their terms and their logic.<p>Like I said, you are a meat eater pretending to be a vegan talking shit about veganism. But why?')
