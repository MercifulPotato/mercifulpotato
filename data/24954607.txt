It has very little similarity to what probability looked like when it was being developed.<p>Also, you seem to be overstating the maturity of PDE (people are pretty much still trying to turn it into algebra, but it may not be possible) and number theory (that&#x27;s an active research area).<p>I have never seen that saying either, but it seems quite correct, with the exception of the areas where an algebra is impossible, so the field matures without becoming one.')
