Services like Netflix and Disney+ have embraced those new technologies.  I don&#x27;t think technology like 3D was ever embraced to this extent.<p>If you compare setups between a new TV with a few year old Roku, AppleTV, or whatever versus a few year old TV with a brand new streaming device, the setup with the new TV is likely going to be the superior option.  In fact, Apple hasn&#x27;t even released a new AppleTV since 2017.
