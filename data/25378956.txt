Item(by='WorldMaker', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607635644, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25378384, text='&gt; The strange part of this story is the way how it&#x27;s set to snipe at certain companies - CDProjekt and Rockstar were target of these stories, but other development studios for some reason weren&#x27;t.<p>It seems to be cyclical that the company in the cross-hairs has a bad PR year and people talk about only the one company as if it isn&#x27;t a systemic problem until memory gets blurry and people forget the last time it came up, and few people connect the dots to the systemic problem. (Almost every major publisher has been in the spotlight at some point in time or another. EA very famously had the &quot;EA Spouse&quot; cycle of bad press. Activision had one a few years later.)<p>If there is something interestingly strange here it&#x27;s that CD Projekt Red <i>tried</i> to buck the system and do the right thing and its getting smeared so badly that it tried and failed. The takeaway for a lot of people is going to be subconsciously &quot;it&#x27;s better not to try at all to do better and stick with the status quo&quot;, which is hard not to assume is intentional this cycle from some of the members of the status quo. (It resembles other anti-union bullying tactics.)')
