Well, I rebase so that changes are logical rather than historical. This is because when people read the commit history, which actually happens regularly, they would actually like a complete story, not 15 commits of &quot;fix audit&quot;, &quot;fix review&quot; and &quot;fix typo&quot; - let alone refactors where previous work in the PR is thrown out, which you can by definition never care about.<p>Commits so small that they&#x27;re nonfunctional also break bisect.')
