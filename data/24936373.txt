Item(by='rndgermandude', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604007783, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24935391, text='&gt;Are you actually saying, without irony, that it&#x27;s bullshit and baseless that Linus Torvalds, one of the most famously abusive OSS maintainers in history, had made people&#x27;s lives worse by way of these actions?<p>Yes, at least on any scale that matters. He might have (temporarily) upset some people, but that doesn&#x27;t even come close to what I&#x27;d consider &quot;made lives worse&quot;.<p>&gt; one of the most famously abusive OSS maintainers in history<p>Nice ad hominem by the way. Also bullshit. He was outspoken to the point of being considered rude sometimes, and he was what I would consider abusive in his language on some occasions (like the infamous &quot;abortion&quot; rant; if you never had a bad day and said something regretful, feel free to cast the first stone).<p>You however make it sounds that he raped a lot of people. Or murdered his wife (hello Hans). Or at least was like this all the time (which he was not, he was mostly polite and professional if maybe a little to direct for some cultural backgrounds).<p>Get a grip. Some feelings were hurt, some egos got nicked, he crossed the line verbally on a few occasions, got criticized for it, learned from that it seems, some people - which, again, is perfectly fine - decided not to work with him. Linux lost some contributors maybe. In order words: life.<p>If you expect utter perfection from everybody always, you&#x27;ll be in for a big surprise.<p>&gt;Suppose it was a huge deal to other people. I mean, it&#x27;s not a hypothetical, I&#x27;ve provided citations.<p>You provided some one-sided hearsay, from mostly anonymous stories, nothing that even amounts to harassment either, let alone sexual harassment. That&#x27;s the evidential standard of a kangaroo court and the kind of &quot;crime&quot; dictators use to silence their most outspoken dissidents, not due process (which you seem really fond of by mentioning it all the time).<p>Regardless, that RMS made some people uneasy - while a bit problematic and surely something he could and should have improved - does by far not warrant the way people punch down on him, destroyed his reputation and negated his entire life&#x27;s work, called him names, fabricated false allegations such as that he was defending Epstein.\nWhere is your empathy for his humanity and plight? Or is that reserved to people who are slightly irked out and&#x2F;or offended to see he had a mattress in his office (which he used to sleep on, because he was essentially living in his office, btw)?<p>&gt;Are the feelings of other people illegitimate when they disagree with you?<p>Their feeling are legitimate - which by the way does not mean they always have legitimate cause to feel that way, nor does it mean they never have a legitimate cause - but matter a lot less than facts or actions.')
