It&#x27;s a slippery slope and people are justifying doing things that would normally be considered wrong. Tech is great, but it&#x27;s a shame how much it&#x27;s being used to amplify and escalate all these tensions. What is the intent here? To be a public investigation force? Is that what we really want? How many times have we seen these things backfire (IE Boston Bomber and Reddit.. etc.)<p>Nothing good will come of all of this and it&#x27;s disheartening that a large portion of the population is behind it simply because they feel they&#x27;re in the right.')
