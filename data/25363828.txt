So for instance, if a sex worker was arrested for loitering, and resisting arrest, both the loitering <i>and</i> the resisting arrest charge would be dismissed. But if she hit the cop, she&#x27;d still be charged, and if she resisted arrest after actual prostitution she&#x27;d be charged with both.')
