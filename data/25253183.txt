Its the same with people who study 100% more than everybody else to pass a class but still fail.<p>You hear about those who made it thru, but never the ones who did not have the capacity for their goal.<p>Its up to you to know where you stand in this and what you want to sacrifice.<p>But always remember, romanticizing hard work only does good for society but very rarely for the individual.')
