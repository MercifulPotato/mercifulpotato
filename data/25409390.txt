Hundreds of millions of indians living without electricity, indoor plumbing and in abject poverty.<p>&gt; Workers have the right to protest.<p>Sure, but the article is talking about riots and attacks. And it&#x27;s a taiwanese company they are rioting against. The irony.<p>&gt; China&#x27;s policies of suppression won&#x27;t work in any place where people have more freedom.<p>&quot;China&#x27;s policies of suppression&quot;. China&#x27;s policies were copied from japan, korea, singapore, etc who in turned copied from the US. Parrots parroting.<p>&gt;  In the end, companies will need to eat the increased costs of working in an environment where people can protest mistreatment and wage slavery.<p>Average indian income $2,130. Average chinese income 10,410. Guessing these indian workers are desperate for that chinese slave wage?<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.worlddata.info&#x2F;average-income.php" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.worlddata.info&#x2F;average-income.php</a><p>&gt; The alternative is bowing to China and letting human rights violations slide for the increase in profits.<p>Or the EU and their human rights violations. The laughable nonsense of human rights has got to stop. Yeah, india should slum it and stay poor just to satisfy virtue signalers. Clearly there is something china did right and india did wrong. Or could it be you just want india to be poor and weak forever?<p>India is young, populous and has such immense potential but it won&#x27;t reach it&#x27;s potential trying to appease virtue signalers. It has to look around and see how others rose up and formulate a national strategy. Otherwise, it will stand to waste the potential of 1+ billion people like it has the past 70 years. Since ww2, india has been the greatest disappointment and the greatest source of human suffering. If india would get its act together it would help solve much of the world&#x27;s poverty and suffering due to its sheer size.')
