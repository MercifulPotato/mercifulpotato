But as a passenger I have no idea how well the pilot has been trained or whether he&#x2F;she has sense enough to disconnect the MCAS and rely on piloting skills.<p>Although in reality it&#x27;s kind of hard to imagine any qualified pilot missing the 737Max memo, so I&#x27;m probably awfulizing.<p>It&#x27;s still a poorly-designed plane built by a poorly-managed company with its flaws spackled over by software, and that alone makes me want to avoid it.')
