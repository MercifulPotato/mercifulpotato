With Turbo, by default all your links&#x2F;forms will use XHR to fetch new pages which do a full body swap (unless you want to use frames&#x2F;streams or opt out entirely), whereas with htmx you have to be specific which links&#x2F;forms and targets you want - there is an hx-boost attribute that does something similar but it lacks a corresponding data-turbo-permanent attribute (at least in the current production version) when you want to exempt certain elements. Both are valid approaches but it depends on what suits your requirements better.')
