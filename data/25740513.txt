And now I hold my friends and coworkers who hyped them in <i>much</i> lower steem.<p>Bought one Access point &quot;PRO&quot;.<p>It is a hacked version of openWRT. No GPL sources anywhere on their site.<p>Downloaded the unifi controller to run on a debian 10 image.... a closed source java app. And it requires java8 from sun. pain to install on debian but fine.<p>Next, it requires an old version of mongodb. Sigh. no package available for debian 10. Compile from source, this is a nightmare on itself, but done.<p>A bunch more &#x2F;fun&#x2F; with decades old software dependencies later, i have a unifi controller running.<p>Now, I learn that despite them advertising (and showing screen shots) that i can setup VLANs with that product (and the product page advertise support for N vlans) i learn it is just a dumb unmanaged AP. I write that off as a $150 lesson.<p>The UI says that if i buy another piece of the hype puzzle it will enable the feature i bought the &quot;pro&quot; AP for. But at this point, i know i will also learn i will need a something-key, and then something else. ...thanks. Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice shame on me.<p>I will just save the dumb unmanaged &quot;pro&quot; AP to use with a setup from someone else. Probably pfsense based. Heck, the time i wasted to simply satisfy the anciently deprecated dependencies for their controller, I could have send tons of patches to pfsense so the UI looked just as good as theirs :) ...which i think is their only selling point.')
