I&#x27;d love to see some stats from those paid to report these matters. He was never the _shitpost on Twitter_ type billionaire.<p>Famous people saying something others don&#x27;t like, being lynched-mobbed online, then subsequently laying low are doing the exact same thing as Ma all the time. It&#x27;s basically a weekly occurrence in the West.<p>Honestly scary how many people believe any media speculation as the truth and how the media know they can get away with it.<p>When you read things like this it&#x27;s always likely wrong. If Bloomberg or the NYT tells you that Kim Jong Un is dead, bet everything against it and wait until someone with integrity can verify that info. They&#x27;ve said it a half dozen times now and no one even notices.<p>OT: I can&#x27;t help but see your posts in new all the time OP. Honestly intrigued why someone would post so much stuff to HN like this, any comment? Trying to earn points?')
