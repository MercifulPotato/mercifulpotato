If it means choosing random encounters for equivalent similar conditions, and ignoring price, the outcome in the US is consistently or on-average better, I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s true.<p>If you mean “where can the best care be acquired, without regard to how many people have access to it”, sure, that may be correct.')
