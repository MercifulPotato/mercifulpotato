How everyone PG knows including him are very special and deserving. This clouds my experience of reading his essays. I am unable to derive any value from them because of this.<p>The main reason for this is that I see a big divide between what he says about success people and what I have observed. Success has no set pattern. It can come from a huge variety of reasons.<p>I really hope this is not koolaid because a lot of young people are drinking it. It would suck if it was all just to suck them into applying for YC.')
