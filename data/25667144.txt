Item(by='coldtea', descendants=None, kids=[25667533], score=None, time=1609992075, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25666686, text='&gt;<i>Ask Amphetamine about how open they are.</i><p>That&#x27;s neither here nor there.<p>(a) Amphetamine could still be sold outside the Mac App Store.<p>(b) An app name could be problematic even in FOSS land. It&#x27;s just that instead of Amphetamine being the name that causes it, it will be something else. E.g. with the trend of banning&#x2F;changing terms like &quot;master&quot; (as in replication primary master, not as in the owner of slaves), unfortunately named apps could be thrown out something or ask to be renamed to be included in a distros package manager or a project.')
