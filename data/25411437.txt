I skim papers on sharrows when (very occasionally) I come across one, but they seem to be based on a small dataset from one city.<p>I personally treat them as preferable to nothing, and except on really busy streets, preferable to door zone bike lanes.<p>Of course there are options better than either, and I prefer those. But I also don&#x27;t really think bicycle affordances are the solution -- a legal&#x2F;policy war on cars and drivers is.')
