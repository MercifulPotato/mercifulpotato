From 20,000-10,000 years ago the Earth warmed 6 celcius. Humans benefitted greatly from this warming and we didn&#x27;t yet have technology which enables us to survive extinction.<p>We were leaving an ice age. The end of it enabled agriculture, more permanent settlements and civilization. Now we are more tied to the land, and we are far more than what we&#x27;ve been 15k years ago.<p>&gt; I believe asserting that climate change of an average increase of 1.8celcius as extinction level is quite inaccurate.<p>Don&#x27;t look at the photo, look at the movie. You are in the middle of it. Even without our intervention, it will keep warming up because the added carbon to the system. And it is a fast movie. Take <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xkcd.com&#x2F;1732&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xkcd.com&#x2F;1732&#x2F;</a> as a reference (it is visual enough, and backed with strong enough science), it took a thousand years to change just a degree, we are doing twice of that amount in 50.<p>&gt;&gt;And even if you can call &quot;record&quot; what can be indirectly deduced from ice cores, the records they are talking are methodically measuring and registering them live. Those records are the broken ones.<p>&gt;We could discuss why you believe that science to be inaccurate. Could you tell me more please?<p>I correct myself, ice cores don&#x27;t get that far, they can be used to measure less than a million of years ago.<p>The period you said that had like 12ÂºC over current temperature seem to be the Paleocene-Eocene termal maximum, google for it, it was caused by CO2 (tectonic activity in the oceans) and caused massive extinctions. And still, it was a process that lasted 10k years. We are doing that at a much faster pace.<p>&gt; I&#x27;m not sure I necessarily follow. The paris&#x2F;kyoto accords are focusing on reducing emissions but your assertion is that we are passed the limit and that it continues due to a positive feedback loop. Then the proposals by the paris and kyoto accords are wrong. That would make me want to re-evaluate the entire topic.<p>That positive feedback loop may have smaller dimensions and impact (yet, at least) than what we keep doing. But will add something even if we stop adding. And it is not just adding, but what is in place already.<p>&gt; Did you know that after 9&#x2F;11 terrorist attacks and air traffic being grounded for 3 days dropped global temperatures by 1.1 celcius? Certainly something the airlines don&#x27;t want the public to know; the amount of planes with giant engines spewing ridiculous amounts of diesel&#x2F;jet fuel in the upper atmosphere has a huge effect on temperature.<p>Regarding the planes for 3 days, we are dealing with global yearly averages of temperatures. What happens over 3 days is weather, not climate.')
