I have mixed feelings.<p>You would often make a point and then play snippets from him supporting it. You often gave yourself center stage and used him as evidence. I found it overedited and synthetic, more a performance than an interview.<p>I came for BWK and left unsatisfied. If that&#x27;s the style you were going for, that&#x27;s fine.
