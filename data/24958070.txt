Let me repeat, a FOUR MONTH lockdown. That is a bloody long time so anything but a huge dip during a four month lockdown would just be bizarre. Now they have summer, cases a low after a lockdown and due to the weather cases will remain low like we&#x27;ve seen in Summer across all of Europe, regardless what measures countries have taken. If Europe was to spend 4 months out of their Winter in lockdown, then cases will drop there too.')
