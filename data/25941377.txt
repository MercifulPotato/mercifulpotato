It would be impractical to authorize each individual use, let alone authorize it by several parties each time.<p>Instead we&#x27;d see &#x27;ongoing&#x27; authorizations on the level of an investigation, a person or team, or a whole sub-organization (modulo clearance &#x2F; position in that organization). And so you&#x27;d have copies of the complete key going around.')
