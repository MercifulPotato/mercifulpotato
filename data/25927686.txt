As far as I know, all the high quality fossil reservoirs we excavate have been accumulated in an exceptional era when the biological defense mechanisms of trees happened to have so much of an upper hand over all potential decompositors that their corpses basically stayed around forever. Imagine a C heap when for a while free() is a noop... (it has been fixed for quite a while now).<p>The closest thing we have today to those &quot;eternal tree corpses&quot; are peat bogs were decomposition is kind of broken even today (and guess who discovered that dried up peat can burn, even if it&#x27;s a very dirty fire? Humans. We just love oxydating carbons).')
