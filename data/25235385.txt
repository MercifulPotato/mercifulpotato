I actually corresponded on the guy about inconsistencies in his own debunking claims and he gave no satisfactory justification for his extremely superficial arguments, which essentially focus on his own perceptions of inconsistencies in the footage itself and simply disregard weeks of repeated sightings, radar tracking and up-close eye-witness encounters between trained, professional pilots and the objects themselves in the air. These are pilots who on at least a couple of these occasions observed the objects from fairly close range, in broad daylight and had their observations at least partially confirmed at the same time by also professional operators of sophisticated tracking systems (radar etc) onboard the Navy&#x27;s ships. In the case of the Nimitz &quot;tic-tac&quot; UFO events from late 2014 this happened especially, during weeks leading up to the brief video that was finally captured.\nMick West simply disregards all of this and in an email I wrote to him even claims that the weeks of incidents previous to the video being captured were &quot;separate&quot; events from the video because they didn&#x27;t concretely, confirmably show the same thing.... What? An absurd conclusion.<p>Debunking with a critical eye is good and necessary but sometimes one gets the feeling that certain internet debunkers feel a need to debunk at all costs because that&#x27;s their label, even if their own &quot;rational&quot; interpretations make leaps of logic much worse than simply admitting that something inexplicable was observed.')
