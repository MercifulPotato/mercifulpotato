Competitive elections are extremely expensive. So the group that gets ignored is just the group that has the least money to throw at candidates. It&#x27;s the average person that always loses in that case. That&#x27;s not fair either.<p>I would certainly prefer term limits, but if a population thinks their representative does a good job representing their needs - why shouldn&#x27;t they get re-elected? Nobody is stopping them from having a competitive primary. Remember, AOC only got elected because her district was so non-competitive for republicans, that the establishment didn&#x27;t bother channeling massive money into the primary for the incumbent. So this setup would actually make it easier for non-establishment candidates to sneak in, and even incentivize the other party to run a non-traditional candidate to compete (ie, like how dems used to win with blue dog democrats in rural areas).')
