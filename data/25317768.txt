Say for example legalizing drugs. They don&#x27;t believe in being open minded about whether or not that&#x27;s a good idea. Instead they believe supporting it is the &quot;open minded&quot; position and not supporting it is the &quot;close minded&quot; position. They have a similarly actually closed mind about most topics.')
