Item(by='acdha', descendants=None, kids=[24841197], score=None, time=1603195556, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24833465, text='&gt; This app linked above (my bank) contains NONE of the security you&#x27;ve mentioned above.<p>This misunderstanding is where you went wrong: your bank doesn’t have a choice about this. If they use FaceID, they don’t have a choice about implementing that - the app can ask it to perform the public-key authentication operation but there’s no way for the developer to choose to weaken the security of the system.<p>Similarly, you should read up about how these systems incorporate liveness checks. A dead body will not pass those and, if you weren’t aware, Apple’s implementation requires a password after a reboot or a small number of failed tries. It’s presumably possible for a well-resourced attacker to bypass those but you’d have to think about how much more vulnerable you are if you use only a password which is much easier for an attacker with that level of resources to capture. If you’re worried about Tom Cruise recording a mask from your still-cooling body, think about how much easier it’d be to get a camera to record you entering it - which you do a lot more in public if you don’t use biometrics - and how trivially this could be done without your knowledge.')
