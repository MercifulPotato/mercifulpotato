Item(by='Klinky', descendants=None, kids=[25094811], score=None, time=1605379910, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25093839, text='I think some of the confusion is people saying the hold killed him, but he appears to actually have regained consciousness after the hold, and was then given Ketamine, then shortly after the administration of Ketamine he went into cardiac arrest.<p>If he was actually killed by the chokehold, then no way should someone be injecting Ketamine into someone unconscious or without pulse, especially under the guise of them resisting or being a threat.<p>If he lost his pulse shortly after being administered too high a dose of Ketamine, then that kinda indicates Ketamine could have been a cause or contributed.<p>Regarding mindset, while Elijah did resist, the transcript suggests he was eventually compliant and pleading with officers.<p>&gt;    I can&#x27;t breathe. I have my ID right here. My name is Elijah McClain. That&#x27;s my house. I was just going home. I&#x27;m an introvert. I&#x27;m just different. That&#x27;s all. I&#x27;m so sorry. I have no gun. I don&#x27;t do that stuff. I don&#x27;t do any fighting. Why are you attacking me? I don&#x27;t even kill flies! I don&#x27;t eat meat! But I don&#x27;t judge people, I don&#x27;t judge people who do eat meat. Forgive me. All I was trying to do was become better. I will do it. I will do anything. Sacrifice my identity, I&#x27;ll do it. You all are phenomenal. You are beautiful and I love you. Try to forgive me. I&#x27;m a mood Gemini. I&#x27;m sorry. I&#x27;m so sorry. Ow, that really hurt! You are all very strong. Teamwork makes the dream work. Oh, I&#x27;m sorry, I wasn&#x27;t trying to do that. I just can&#x27;t breathe correctly.<p>He was on the ground for an extended period of time and threatened with dogs. An officer determined his &quot;need&quot; for Ketamine before emergency medical personnel arrived, not the medical personnel themselves. The medical personnel then gave him overdose based on his actual body weight.<p>The police tunnel visioned into the guy being whacked out on drugs, completely ignoring his pleas and explanations, and the medical personnel were complicit in unquestionably following orders of the officers and then administered an incorrect dosage of Ketamine.<p>Police should consider they might be dealing with someone neurodivergent, that someone &quot;acting suspiciously&quot; might just be anxious or panicking, and may not actually be a criminal or on drugs. Fight or flight and adrenaline are a hell of a combo on their own.')
