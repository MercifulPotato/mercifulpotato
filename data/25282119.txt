They have run an amazingly effective marketing campaign to make everyone feel like they are missing out if they aren&#x27;t using it.<p>The learning curve for working with AWS is similar to the learning curve of working on bare metal. It honestly does not take a specialist to use MySQL, Postgres, etc. They are really quite easy to make a HA turnkey solution. It&#x27;s as easy as learning how to effectively use an amazon service. We aren&#x27;t talking about the days where you had to shard out which was a big pain in the ass, because machines are cheap now with 128 physical cores, 1tb of memory, massive fast storage, etc. You can run the nastiest largest database on a single machine and achieve a pretty large scale doing it.<p>One of these paths costs about $2500 a month with server purchase amortization, and on the other about $20,000 per month. Either way I need someone to manage it (unless you are talking heroku level of turn-key, then up that $20k a month to $50k a month).')
