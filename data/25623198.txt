The only thing OpenNoteScanner does better is that it starts in camera mode, and therefore the workflow is a bit faster.<p>However, feature-wise this is seriously lacking. I would not consider using this until it can automatically crop and correct perspective distortion.<p>Also the default filters are seriously lacking. Either make them smarter or give the user more control (e.g. for B&#x2F;W allow setting the threshold, even for decently-lit documents I get poor results with random black areas)<p>You can do both by integrating with OpenCV. No idea how easy it is to integrate it with flutter though...<p>Anyways, good job! I&#x27;ll keep following the project and might consider contributing if you ever start working on these features.')
