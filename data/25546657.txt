Item(by='lostintangent', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609018875, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25546574, text='Ah, got it. Apologies for misunderstanding! I&#x27;m currently working on the ability to export a swing to CodePen and Bl.ocks, so that you can create your swings in VS Code, and then share them with the appropriate communities. I should have both of these done this weekend. Would that work for your workflow? Since you can export CodePens as gists, and all Bl.ocks are already gists, you can actually already open any CodePens&#x2F;Bl.ocks inside of GistPad right now. So I just need to finalize the swing-&gt;CodePen&#x2F;Bl.ocks experience.<p>Regarding GistPad: it bundles CodeSwing along with it (as an optional, uninstallable dependency), so that you can install GistPad and use it to create code snippets&#x2F;swings&#x2F;notes&#x2F;etc. So CodeSwing is the core &quot;interactive coding playground&quot; environment, that can be used with or without GistPad. And GistPad is effectively a virtual filesystem for VS Code, that allows you to edit gists and repos as if they were always-available files.')
