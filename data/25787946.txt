If the string and duct tape holds, then it works, but it&#x27;s unfortunately continually breaking.<p>Hell, in Slack, I watch their data scientists continuously wrestle with how to actually make their Jupyter notebooks work in production.<p>Whereas my company has far more data engineers than data scientists. The plan from higher up the corporate food chain was always that we&#x27;d give them our data to do their data science voodoo on, but we ended up getting a few data scientists of our own for specific projects.<p>So, we focused on ensuring our data stream was reliable, consistent and sufficiently timely, for them to work on. But as soon as it hits their systems, it&#x27;s a forest fire of hacks upon hacks, which inevitably break.<p>In the end, we had to send in our data engineers to stabilise their flagship &quot;real time reporting&quot; product that corporate was so amped about.<p>So yeah, I think that there&#x27;s probably a happy ratio of data scientists to data engineers, of about, say, 1:5 or 1:10, because the maths generally scales O(1), it&#x27;s the beauty of maths, but the actual engineering to get clean data delivered timely without breaking anything scales very differently indeed.')
