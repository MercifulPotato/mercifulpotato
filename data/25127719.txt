This is why smart watches with 3-4 days of battery have not prevailed over those with one heavy day of battery. They are annoying to know what day you are on so you might just charge it every night and if you do, the platform is trading off so much power that the experience is worse.<p>Plus, then you have to carry 2 days worth of battery or have half the power envelope as a laptop with one day.  the concept all sounds great but the reality of people using things really has honed in on the fact that these things need to fit into habit and use cases that make sense.')
