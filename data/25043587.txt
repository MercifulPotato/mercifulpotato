Item(by='50', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604993669, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25042412, text='&gt; I know the intent is good<p>Yes, also, consider how death is sort of a taboo subject. I think the simple act of <i>reaching out</i> to someone because of this death thing which is unknown and terrifyingly so to some is worthy and grand. To hell with what they say but look at what they did: they reached out to you. Many have no one reaching out to them. And sure, we all navigate reality our own and we go into the grave alone but reaching out to someone is a sort of illustration of this &quot;love of thy neighbor&quot; idea which says, &quot;What are you going through?&quot; As naive as that sounds.')
