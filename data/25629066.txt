Item(by='claudiawerner', descendants=None, kids=[25629150], score=None, time=1609751195, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25626976, text='&gt;Each employer offers an additional &quot;something&quot; on top of all the other &quot;somethings&quot; offered by the other employers.<p>And each politician does the same - whether they deliver on the promise is another matter, and they can only promise a certain amount. Further, you can get trapped at a local maximum; there isn&#x27;t much variation in what companies in sector X will offer you when you restrict the pool of companies to places close to you and (even more importantly, which makes this worse than the politician&#x27;s case) willing to hire you.<p>&gt;This is a step that does not have an analogous correspondent in the politicians&#x27; syllogism.<p>It has a correspondence in the syllogism I was replying to. Sure, you could become self-employed, but in the same way you could also become a politician. But neither a self-employed person nor a single politician can change the situation for everyone else (mind you, this is again worse in the employee&#x27;s case than the voter&#x27;s case; politicians often can make huge changes that benefit all voters, one kind employer cannot do that - in fact, cost-cutting and health risk-skirting employers drive employee rights because politicians decide to regulate them).<p>Employment seems to be even more of a sham than democracy.')
