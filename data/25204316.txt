So you&#x27;re immediately narrowing down to only cases where an unsalted hash is used, like Microsoft&#x27;s NTLM system or some older web systems that do MD5(password) or similar.<p>Building a rainbow tables is <i>much</i> more expensive (compute time, storage) than just breaking any individual hash. So unless you break hashes all day every day, you probably need to share that expense somehow, but then you can&#x27;t customize. Maybe a large group of you want all of the old &quot;NT hash&quot; values, that&#x27;s easy enough, but agreeing to do 5-7 alphanumerics for MD5() means the person attacking a site with an eight character minimum gets nothing out of it.<p>So aside from things like NT hash it has fallen out of favour.')
