Robinhood&#x27;s entire product is built on a manipulative and predatory premise that making people feel comfortable &quot;trading stocks&quot;, whether they fully understand what is happening under the hood, is a net positive.<p>It was bound to blow up eventually, but I disagree with your assumption that this is obviously &quot;market manipulation&quot;.<p>If they had to take this action to save themselves, the alternative was worse. Robinhood would have [edit: potentially] gone under while holding all of their customer&#x27;s stock, and I guess SPIC would have figured it out eventually? No one would have had the option to sell, and Robinhood going under would likely have had a <i>much larger</i> impact on the price of specific securities. I have *absolutely* no idea what would have happened if Robinhood wasn&#x27;t able to settle trades that it had already made. I assume it would have been an absolute catastrophy. By that logic, Robinhood &quot;manipulated the market&quot; in a way that prevented GME stock from tanking.<p>I would be very concerned here if Robinhood ends up going under for &quot;market manipulation&quot;, with no reference to the extremely poor and predatory product decisions that set this up in the first place. We&#x27;ll just have the next company pop up, promise to do &quot;nothing illegal&quot;, and then set up the same house of cards.')
