Medication is literally, demonstrably changing my life for the better.<p>I used to drink multiple cups of coffee a day and felt like it was almost baseline requirement just to attempt to focus. Actual ADHD medication makes coffee almost obsolete. The first time I took Ritalin it was almost scary to realize how chaotic my mind was minute-to-minute, every day without fail. Suddenly the noise all went away.<p>It feels like I can actually create coherent sentences. I stop getting overwhelmed by asynchronous communications (Slack, email). The &quot;volume&quot; of every single distraction that used to monopolize my attention gets turned way down. Yeah, I still get distracted -- but now it&#x27;s a conscious choice to either let that distraction take precedent or to re-focus to the task at hand.<p>The day to day benefits are great, but the big picture &#x2F; life-style benefits are the most appreciated. In general my anxiety and stress management is honestly 10x better. I&#x27;ve gone from being stressed over my career choice every week to finally feeling like I can thrive. I stop getting irritated by the most innocuous things someone might say or do. I stop waking up anxious every weekend trying to process the million things I need to get done just to exist and make forward progress in my life. I could go on and on and on about how &quot;real&quot; ADHD is, without even having a formal diagnosis yet.<p>I&#x27;m sure the discussions in this thread regarding the utility and risks of these medications sounds intriguing if you don&#x27;t have ADHD and already know how to sit still and focus <i>at will</i>. But anyone who doesn&#x27;t have our experience should understand this shit is honestly helping people live their lives for the better. My only regret is I didn&#x27;t know sooner.')
