I notice it when something goes wrong unexpectedly.<p>People who aren&#x27;t particularly talented at SW development, for a brief instant, give a facial expression of disgust when something crashes or behaves incorrectly. People who are awesome at development, instead, have a look of amusement like they&#x27;re actually looking forward to see what happened. These facial &quot;micro-expressions&quot; are really fast and subtle, you really have pay attention and it doesn&#x27;t always work but I&#x27;ve seen it enough times to believe it shows something.<p>I think this goes back to the impulse to &quot;improve&quot; things that Norvig mentions. You really have to enjoy the act of programming, to be willing to improve on it. It&#x27;s a kind of feedback loop. Just MHO.')
