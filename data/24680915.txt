They are the &quot;most famous of the secret religious rites of ancient Greece&quot;.[1] Their basis was an old agrarian cult,[2] and there is some evidence that they were derived from the religious practices of the Mycenean period.[3][4] The mysteries represented the myth of the abduction of Persephone from her mother Demeter by the king of the underworld Hades, in a cycle with three phases: the descent (loss), the search, and the ascent, with the main theme being the ascent (άνοδος) of Persephone and the reunion with her mother. It was a major festival during the Hellenic era, and later spread to Rome.[5] Similar religious rites appear in the agricultural societies of Near East and in Minoan Crete.</i><p>Conceptualizing something that matches one&#x27;s priors is easy.  Conceptualizing something that does not match one&#x27;s priors seems to be less easy, if not sometimes even aversive.<p>&gt; although there are people who claim to be using psychedelic drugs as a tool, but don&#x27;t seem to be very disciplined and are really just enjoying recreational drug use<p>There is what seems to be, and then there is what is - the latter portion is often many orders of magnitude larger, and often not conceptualized by the mind (it sees <i>NULL</i>).  &quot;Seeing&quot; what literally cannot be seen is non-intuitive - we seem to have the capacity to do it with ease in some domains, but in others it seems very difficult, and the mind is often even <i>strongly resistant</i> (techniques like Venn diagram based thinking can help).  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;There_are_known_knowns" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;There_are_known_knowns</a> [1]<p>&gt; which is probably safe but also not particularly valuable<p>Safe and Valuable are two variables, of which we do not know the range of possible values, even if it may seem like it.  The subconscious mind will gladly and near-instantly detect patterns though, which it presents to our conscious mind <i>as facts</i>.  One can easily see this in simple scenarios, like in people who fall for fake news or conspiracy theories.  Seeing it in ourselves is less easy.<p>&gt; what i find troubling is the idea that society would be better off right now in 2020 if most regular people just started taking mushrooms semi-regularly<p>Consider why you find this troubling.  The notion is True, or it is False, or somewhere in between (spread across millions of variables, sometimes forming binarily opposed conclusions, which can all be simultaneously True).  Ideas are ideas, they can produce positive outcomes, or negative outcomes, but I don&#x27;t think pondering them in the abstract should be thought of as troubling (I mean, that feeling is arguably sub-optimal, even if intuitive).<p>[1] While the remarks initially led to some ridicule towards the Bush administration in general and Rumsfeld in particular, the consensus regarding it has shifted over the years, and it now enjoys some level of respect. For example, Rumsfeld&#x27;s defenders have included Canadian columnist Mark Steyn, who called it &quot;in fact a brilliant distillation of quite a complex matter&quot;,[10] and Australian economist and blogger John Quiggin, who wrote, &quot;Although the language may be tortured, the basic point is both valid and important.&quot;<p>-------&gt; Psychoanalytic philosopher Slavoj Žižek says that beyond these three categories there is a fourth, <i>the unknown known, that which we intentionally refuse to acknowledge that we know</i>: &quot;If Rumsfeld thinks that the main dangers in the confrontation with Iraq were the &#x27;unknown unknowns&#x27;, that is, the threats from Saddam whose nature we cannot even suspect, then the Abu Ghraib scandal shows that the main dangers lie in the &quot;unknown knowns&quot;—<i>the disavowed beliefs, suppositions and obscene practices we pretend not to know about, even though they form the background of our public values.</i>&quot;<p>German sociologists Daase and Kessler (2007) agree with a basic point of Rumsfeld in stating that the cognitive frame [2] for political practice may be determined by the relationship between what we know, what we do not know, what we cannot know, but Rumsfeld left out what we do not like to know.<p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Framing_(social_sciences)" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Framing_(social_sciences)</a><p>In the social sciences, framing comprises a set of concepts and theoretical perspectives on how individuals, groups, and societies, organize, perceive, and communicate about reality.<p>Framing can manifest in thought or interpersonal communication. Frames in thought consist of the mental representations, interpretations, and simplifications of reality. Frames in communication consist of the communication of frames between different actors.<p>In social theory, framing is a schema of interpretation, a collection of anecdotes and stereotypes, that individuals rely on to understand and respond to events. In other words, people build a series of mental &quot;filters&quot; through biological and cultural influences. They then use these filters to make sense of the world. The choices they then make are influenced by their creation of a frame.<p>Framing is also a key component of sociology, the study of social interaction among humans. Framing is an integral part of conveying and processing data on a daily basis. Successful framing techniques can be used to reduce the ambiguity of intangible topics by contextualizing the information in such a way that recipients can connect to what they already know.<p>Framing involves social construction of a social phenomenon – by mass media sources, political or social movements, political leaders, or other actors and organizations. Participation in a language community necessarily influences an individual&#x27;s perception of the meanings attributed to words or phrases. Politically, the language communities of advertising, religion, and mass media are highly contested, whereas framing in less-sharply defended language communities might evolve[citation needed] imperceptibly and organically over cultural time frames, with fewer overt modes of disputation.<p>One can view framing in communication as positive or negative – depending on the audience and what kind of information is being presented. The framing may be in the form of equivalence frames, where two or more logically equivalent alternatives are portrayed in different ways (see framing effect) or emphasis frames, which simplify reality by focusing on a subset of relevant aspects of a situation or issue.[1] In the case of &quot;equivalence frames&quot;, the information being presented is based on the same facts, but the &quot;frame&quot; in which it is presented changes, thus creating a reference-dependent perception.')
