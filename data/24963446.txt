Don&#x27;t continue work until you have gone over deliverables with the person who is &quot;writing the checks&quot; at the end of each stage (every few days at first).  Agree on a fee for that upcoming period after discussing the work for that time frame.  Make sure they are comfortable and if not stay with the smaller periods.')
