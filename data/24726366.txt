If the candidate has been previously contacted then require communication with the candidate for any archiving or other rejection. Hell, require communication even if you reject them without ever talking to them. Sending an automated email tied to the HR system candidate status isn&#x27;t expensive or hard. You can then reprimand the recruiter or their manager as appropriate if they don&#x27;t do this or try to get around it')
