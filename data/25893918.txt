The unit I have is a counter top model from Apec and can be easily set up to use with your kitchen sink. I swear by it and as added bonus to clean drinking water from the tap you no longer have to purchase plastic bottles of water. The only maintenance is filter replacement, which is relatively straight forward. I tend to replace them every 6 months, though apparently they&#x27;re good for up to a year.
