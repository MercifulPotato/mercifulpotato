Unlike almost all current graduates I&#x27;m old enough to know the &quot;old world&quot; - back when I had my first computer, patches were either unheard of at all (cartridges with mask ROM programming) or had to be distributed on CD-ROMs - so software vendors were all but forced by the realities of the market to do proper QA and deliver a product &#x2F; game that was reasonably bug-free.<p>These days? It&#x27;s usual to have games that require multi-GB patches upon release day and for weeks if not months afterwards. It&#x27;s common wisdom to avoid new OS X releases for at least half a year until Apple and the software vendors (Adobe!) ironed out the worst critical bugs - and that&#x27;s <i>despite</i> many months of pre-release collaboration between Apple and the biggest vendors. The entire culture of making and delivering software is rotten because QA is seen as a pure &quot;cost center&quot; instead of avoiding actual cost of shipping physical replacement items to angry customers.<p>Sorry, but without raising a stink when corporate entities fail at basic QA the situation won&#x27;t ever change and I&#x27;m sick of playing the free beta tester for <i>multi billion dollars worth</i> corporations that could afford proper QA.')
