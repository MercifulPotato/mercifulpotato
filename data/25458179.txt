However, I would like to add that retail customers get better prices not primarily because they move less volume (though this is certainly a factor), but because their order flow is significantly less toxic. Retail traders don&#x27;t really know anything and their order flow contains less alpha, so market makers can quote better prices to them without getting run over.<p>It&#x27;s very important for market makers to separate out order flows and assign a toxicity to each flow. This way, they can provide tighter spreads and better execution on less toxic flows while being a little looser for highly toxic institutional flows.')
