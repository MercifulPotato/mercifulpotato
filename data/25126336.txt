I can&#x27;t stand see overly vague descriptions of what I&#x27;ll be working either.<p>I mentally filter out companies that are obviously spam agencies that all seem repost from the same pool of jobs. Unfortunately job boards seem littered with that crap.<p>I&#x27;ll try to scour the internet to get a little bit of info the things you mentioned, Glassboro seems fine for that, and if thr company is well known enough, I&#x27;ll try things like reddit.')
