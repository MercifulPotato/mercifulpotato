Network operators have a better view of the network than sources, and will know how to route packets more efficiently. At the end of the day theyâ€™ll still have route tables and send the packets on the path they want, defeating the purpose of having the source specify a path.<p>A kind of source routing has interesting applications in P2P routing. Yggdrasil uses a spanning tree to assign every node a location, so that peers can determine efficient paths upfront. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;yggdrasil-network.github.io&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;yggdrasil-network.github.io&#x2F;</a>')
