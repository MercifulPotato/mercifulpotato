Item(by='cosmie', descendants=None, kids=[25363558], score=None, time=1607542713, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25362048, text='These food delivery apps tend to execute it poorly, but multiples orders in a single run is pretty standard fare in food delivery.<p>If you order delivery from a pizza place during lunch or dinner rush, the vast majority of the time the restaurant is going to try it&#x27;s damndest to dispatch orders in a way that allows the driver to take multiple deliveries in one run. Even if it means letting one that&#x27;s ready to go out the door sit under the heatlamps for a bit while you make and cook another that&#x27;s going in the same direction. That said, your order goes from oven -&gt; metal table with heat lamps -&gt; insulated (or with an actual heat plate in it) delivery bag. So it should still end up getting delivered hot, even if not quite fresh.<p>I managed a Dominos when they started their pizza tracker[1] back in the day, and 99% of complaints were from online orders, which got quoted wildly optimistic delivery times and coupled with the following the progress tracker, gave a false sense of when to expect your order. Dominos recently updated their pizza tracker with driver GPS tracking[2] so that it works on par with the delivery apps, and I can&#x27;t even imagine how many complaints come from people who are second on a driver&#x27;s run and notice the driver taking off in the wrong direction from the store or taking a highly roundabout route to their house.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.huffpost.com&#x2F;entry&#x2F;dominos-pizza-tracker_b_5947734" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.huffpost.com&#x2F;entry&#x2F;dominos-pizza-tracker_b_59477...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dominos.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;about-pizza&#x2F;gps-tracker&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dominos.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;about-pizza&#x2F;gps-tracker&#x2F;</a>')
