Just trying to understand where you&#x27;re coming from and thought links might help.<p>I think I misunderstood &quot;lately&quot; to mean the censorship &#x2F; violent speech debate about the resulting Big Tech deplatformings, which is why I keep bringing those up. In the US, taking down violent, insightful speech is not considered censorship, which is why I was confused about who you&#x27;re referring to that is &quot;pro-censorship&quot;, but again maybe I crossed some wires there.<p>I care about free speech a lot and if there&#x27;s a growing trend that speech that&#x27;s always been protected by the 1st amendment is being targeted, it&#x27;s a line we all need to be very sensitive to and vigilant in defending.')
