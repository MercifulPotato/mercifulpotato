Our most recent graduating Summer &#x27;20 class includes a range of startups in finance, operations, developer tools, healthcare and more. Moreover, because of the nature of YC this year, opportunities are more widespread around the world, including the US, Brazil, Mexico, Finland, India and more.<p>We&#x27;re running YC&#x27;s S20 Startup Career Expo on December 3rd to introduce these companies to engineers and other talented people that are interested in working at startups. Founders from 30+ startups will each give 1 minute pitches on their company and why you might want to work with them. Following that, we&#x27;ll host an open Expo for you to meet the founders and their teams (in small groups and even 1-1) to learn about their technology and business, and see if it&#x27;s a good fit for you.<p>Our last Tech Talk was similar, and people stayed for hours after the talks to learn about these startups and make connections for job opportunities. Because of the demand, we&#x27;re asking people to apply to attend:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.workatastartup.com&#x2F;events&#x2F;startup-career-expo-s20" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.workatastartup.com&#x2F;events&#x2F;startup-career-expo-s2...</a><p>We look forward to introducing the newest YC startups and their founders to you.')
