If you look at what the press and medical experts were saying about Remdesivir throughout this period, it was lukewarm at best. But they were saying it so loudly and repetitively that it makes me wonder if the point wasn&#x27;t to sell Remdesivir per se but just to drown out other news.<p>Even if HCQ is useless, that doesn&#x27;t preclude the notion that it was seen as a threat to Big Pharma&#x27;s bottom line in mid-March. Of course it was. Like I said earlier, it&#x27;s cheap and out-of-patent.<p>I think all of us in this thread are circling around the same understanding when it comes to the facts of the matter. But where we differ is that I&#x27;m much more open to the idea that the authorities could have self-serving motives in play besides keeping us safe. The idea that policymakers and even scientists may be corrupt is not far-fetched. We have to try to keep an eye on them. Have a great day and thanks for the debate.')
