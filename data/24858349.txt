Perhaps until say $5M ARR for B2B SaaS.<p>My experience was that I have a much better command of the important levers in my business -- and can more easily scenario plan -- with a robust model that I built myself. Much easier to derive key metrics out of it too. And once you have a starting point, it&#x27;s easy to iterate and expand it as the business grows.<p>My limited experience with the &quot;financial model as a service&quot; apps are that they make a bunch of assumptions for you and make it a lot harder to ad hoc plan. i.e. What if we delayed our hiring round of 5 headcount 2 months? What&#x27;s the impact on ending cash balance? What&#x27;s the impact if I move part of my ARR pricing into an up-front setup cost? What if we offer quarterly payments instead of annual pre-paid, and 30% of our clients opt for that (where does that leave cash)? etc. These are things that you could do in Excel in about 10 minutes with even a basic model, but would be challenging to do in another person&#x27;s app.<p>IMO an early-stage SaaS startup&#x27;s initial model should be focused on ARR&#x2F;cash burn, looked at Monthly, with true planning cycles quarterly or maybe every 6-months if progress is more or less on plan.<p>I don&#x27;t think I was asked in a single board meeting until $4M ARR or so about Revenue. ARR and cash are king.')
