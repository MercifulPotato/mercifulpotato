Item(by='frequentnapper', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603694930, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24883015, text='&gt;When someone bombs your family you take the time to find out why they were bombed and try to understand the otherside before shutting down the otherside.<p>I didn&#x27;t say I would try to understand the side that bombed my family. Those would be the terrorists. I said I would get to the bottom of what happened and why it happened. I would not condemn an entire people or a culture (unless of course every single one of them believed the same thing as the terrorists) to seek some sort of sick justice. Please don&#x27;t invent things I didn&#x27;t say.<p>&gt;The man is obviously not supporting genocide. If the chinese are supporting genocide than the man obviously doesn&#x27;t know but an accusation of genocide needs extreme proof and right now there&#x27;s only rumors.<p>It&#x27;s not rumours. There is genuine proof. My own government declared it as genocide after investigation (Canada).<p>&gt;But when someone voices their own opinion. You just call their opinion disgusting and accuse them of genocide.<p>My comment was directed at the Chinese govt and whoever supports them (obviously knowingly). I didn&#x27;t call his opinion disgusting. Please learn to comprehend at a level above that of the sixth grade.<p>&gt;Maybe what&#x27;s really going on is you&#x27;re selectively applying your empathy to whatever suits your preconceived viewpoint.<p>Yeah and you are selectively applying your generosity in trying to understand those you disagree with to whatever suits your needs.')
