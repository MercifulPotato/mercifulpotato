Item(by='kbenson', descendants=None, kids=[24803455], score=None, time=1602869206, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24802575, text='That&#x27;s not what I would call a &quot;normal&quot; discussion on HN, but it does happen from time to time.  A seemingly normal user that has interacted fairly normally for a while (enough to get a fair number of points) gets set off by something here, or has something else going on, or some combination thereof, and goes completely against the norms here.<p>The user in question made ~16 replies, 4 of them top level, and the majority of them (including some top level ones) one word or one sentence (and generally disparaging).  When someone that has enough points here to indicate they&#x27;ve assimilated at least somewhat posts &quot;lol&quot; and &quot;there is no spoon&quot; as top level comments in addition to other ones and other disrespectful comments, my guess is there&#x27;s something else going on and this is just an outlet for it.  In that respect, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s indicative of HN, as I think it could have happened anywhere.')
