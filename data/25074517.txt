I mean, we travel now, but not way off the beaten path. And we&#x27;re mostly working around the school calendar (I&#x27;m ok being a little looser with that than my wife is). I&#x27;d also spend some time learning something that doesn&#x27;t translate to money - get better at golf, work on my skating, etc. I&#x27;d also do enough nothing to be ready to go back to work by the end of it!')
