Anyone can pull the rug out on iteration 1 and start a completely new attempt in a 2nd iteration bucket.<p>It takes determined engineering efforts and talent to iterate on top of the existing code base while not impacting the ability to deliver ongoing feature support to production.<p>We have historically tried to do complete rewrites with bombastic claims like &quot;We can do it right this time&quot;. Well, we did it &quot;right&quot; 3 times until we decided that restarting from zero every time is a bad way to make forward progress. I will advocate for a clean restart if you are just beginning or it is clear you have totally missed the domain model target. If you have been in production for 3 years, maybe consider a more conservative iteration approach.<p>The best analogy I can come up with is the Ship of Theseus thought experiment. Rebuilding the ship from the inside while you are sailing it to the new world will get you there much faster than if you have to restart in Spain every time someone is in a bad mood or doesn&#x27;t like how the sails on the boat are arranged.')
