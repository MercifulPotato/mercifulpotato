When it was released, _all_ computers booted using a 16bit BIOS.<p>Even today all desktop computers I know still ship a BIOS compatibility module meaning they still carry a BIOS which includes 16 bits code. All Windows 32-bits (not only supported, but still being sold) require a BIOS. OEMs regularly use FreeDOS for flashing stuff -- which requires a BIOS.<p>Only a couple laptops I&#x27;ve seen as full-fledged UEFI (no CSM) devices. They won&#x27;t boot 32bit Windows nor anything before Windows 8.')
