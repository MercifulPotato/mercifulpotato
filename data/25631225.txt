I&#x27;m think about adding a feature to connect your github repo with SidePage and adding a &quot;changelog&quot; feature where you docs on SidePage also show your latest changelog entries. Still need to work this out. Also would be cool if you could just import your poject and generate some pages from the project&#x27;s readme, but again I haven&#x27;t worked out the details yet. I will investigate this further to see what options are available to improve the workflow of updating docs.')
