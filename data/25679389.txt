I was thinking that for most accounts, I would use the password manager, but use 2FA for the password manager. My primary email account that everything links to, would just be 2FA.<p>Meaning, I would only really have to remember two strong passwords. The rest would be strong passwords, but without 2FA, and easily changeable without forcing myself to remember yet-another password and which account it belongs to.')
