Is this your first time with that specific doctor?  The doctor has to use one of the annual wellness visit codes, so if it&#x27;s your first time, the doctor will charge you a new patient charge code, which is higher reimbursement than a wellness visit code, so insurers will deny it.<p>However, I was able to tell my doctor&#x27;s office that I want the wellness visit charge code only, and they did that.  I don&#x27;t even see a reason for the new patient visit code to exist, since they are allotted the same time and subject matter.<p>For example:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;content.highmarkprc.com&#x2F;Files&#x2F;EducationManuals&#x2F;GeriatricResourceBinder&#x2F;gerbinder-cpt-codes.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;content.highmarkprc.com&#x2F;Files&#x2F;EducationManuals&#x2F;Geria...</a><p>If a doctor bills for code 99387, that might not covered under &quot;annual wellness visit&quot; or &quot;annual physical&quot; by the insurer, so you end up having to pay the whole amount if you haven&#x27;t met your deductible.  If the doctor bills code 99397, then it would be.<p>But it shouldn&#x27;t be this hard.  The insurer should be forced to show the codes that qualify for the free annual wellness visit, and you should be able to inform the doctor&#x27;s office that you want to purchase services for that code and that code only.')
