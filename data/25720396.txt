In the past I thought finder on macOS is terrible (it&#x27;s still the worst piece of macOS and I don&#x27;t like it) but GNOME files aka Nautilus tops it for sure (also because of space wasting issues).<p>XFCE and KDE both do a better job than GNOME in this regard. And also Windows Explorer was and is much much better in this area.')
