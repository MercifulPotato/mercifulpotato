Uhmm no, the sums don&#x27;t add up.<p>Factor in the the added (admittedly pennies per tonne) value of the the scrap metal and the benefits of just leaving it there are head scratching.<p>Being fair – perhaps a properly capped well with the jacket left as an artificial reef might make sense,  although the chances of it being snagged or snapped in the decades to come by a passing vessel probably outweighs the slight benefits of leaving it there for marine life to inhabit it.<p>I’m assuming that the proposal in TFA includes the costs of ensuring that all of that rusting infrastructure is properly decontaminated before it slowly corrodes and drops down to the sea bed but the article doesn&#x27;t seem to mention that.<p>The costs of ensuring that the topside structure (the &#x27;oil rig&#x27; bit that sticks out of the water) is properly decontaminated at sea to a level that would be safe(-ish) for marine life? Yeah, I think HN correctly spotted the smell of bs in the authors&#x27; proposal.')
