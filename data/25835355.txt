I’ve not seen Amazon give much back to open source relative to what they’ve gained.<p>On the other hand if you open source something with a license that permits selling the software, well... what do you expect? You gotta hand it to Amazon. They’ve really hustled the industry by hosting open source code. The code is free, literally anybody else could have done this, but Amazon did it especially well.')
