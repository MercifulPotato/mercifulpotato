Further, the current regulatory framework includes huge wealth transfers&#x2F;incentives for car ownership, so it&#x27;s not a fair comparison. For instance, the $130&#x2F;yr cost of a parking permit in SF is a huge wealth transfer to car owners as that is substantially below what the market-price would be for that permit.')
