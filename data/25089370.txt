I know politic topics have been getting heated on HN lately and I am probably more guilty of participating in that than the average user.  However I do try to stay on the line of what is allowed here and I legitimately don&#x27;t know what you are objecting to in my comment.<p>I also don&#x27;t know how this is a disputed fact when basically every news source from MSNBC to Fox News and practically every world leader from Angela Merkel to Xi Jinping all agree on it.  I don&#x27;t think there is a single credible source that disagrees with the outcome of the US presidential election.<p>I don&#x27;t think my comment would have been considered to have markers of a political flamewar or considered anything but a fact if I wrote it 4 years ago about Trump&#x27;s victory over Clinton.  That is basically the entire point of my original comment. Our standards have eroded in the last 4 years.')
