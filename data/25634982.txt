You cannot duplicate them and cannot replace them seamlessly if something happens.<p>In a real way you are now reliant on that specific person and they only have so many hours in a day (and only so much motivation).<p>Experience tells me that the “20% time” way is the right balance: Support employees in exploring unknown (and possibly much better) ways, and spend 80% of the time following processes that are known to work. Black boxes can cripple a company if work is 100% at the will of single employees, and so much valuable insight is lost when it swings 100% the other way.')
