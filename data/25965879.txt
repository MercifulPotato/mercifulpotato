Right now the market cap of gamestop is $22B, which is calculated by multiplying the share price times the number of outstanding shares.  If some news comes out over the weekend that causes people to value the stock lower, we could see the first trade at $33&#x2F;share instead of $330&#x2F;share.  $20B of money just disappears.  It never really existed in the first place.')
