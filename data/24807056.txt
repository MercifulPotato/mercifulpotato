Item(by='ghaff', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602902507, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24806897, text='I assume that so long as you&#x27;re officially working out of an office in a location and the company won&#x27;t change your payroll status, that&#x27;s where you&#x27;re working out of as far as taxing authorities are concerned no matter what the &quot;public information&quot; is. I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s not even especially legit but very few entities are pushing on it at this point--except in cases like this one where there&#x27;s a big advantage to employees pushing to switch their work location.')
