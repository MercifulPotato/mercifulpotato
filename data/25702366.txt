Over-saturation in this context means the FCS was effectively overwhelmed because a multitude of conflicting inputs were competing for limited processing power. Over-saturation can result in latent or ignored flight control inputs. This over-saturation cued FCS logic to direct the horizontal stabilizers to default to, and remain in, a trailing edge down position and caused the nose of the aircraft to go down”')
