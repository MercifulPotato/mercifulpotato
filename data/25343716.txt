Platforms like Github Actions and Travis CI basically use YAML as a really bad syntax for shell scripts (with their own if statements!), and then embed more shell as strings.<p>So Oil should basically generate JSON like this:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24945449" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24945449</a><p>and allow you to embed unevaluated (but parsed) literal shell blocks.  So I&#x27;m adding the missing &quot;declarative&quot; part to shell.  That alone gets you pretty far.<p>Although there are some more language semantics that most builds need, like coarse-grained dependencies, ephemeral or persistent state, etc.<p>gg is a related &quot;multi cloud&quot;  system that&#x27;s very interesting:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lobste.rs&#x2F;s&#x2F;virbxa&#x2F;papers_i_love_gg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lobste.rs&#x2F;s&#x2F;virbxa&#x2F;papers_i_love_gg</a><p>I&#x27;m writing a blog post about this right now!<p>----<p>An improved shell is the natural language for this problem because shell is for gluing tasks together.  It&#x27;s the language of heterogeneity.  I view Make as a form of shell with dependencies, and Make has already been parallelized and distributed by many systems going back many years.')
