Mainframes vs Distributed (cloud, kubernetes, etc) systems have different behaviors at different scales and are useful for different kinds of applications and business sizes. A perfect example is the startup economy. I can spool up a service for a few hundred people essentially for free, but still have the ability to scale if things catch on and I need to serve hundreds of thousands. That same scaling using old technologies would be a lot less smooth.<p>I mean, even if we do assume each new tech fad is mostly driven by hubris, if the results benefit the ecosystem, which cloud undoubtedly has through democratizing scalability, so what?<p>As far as the secret keeping of industry, I don&#x27;t by that at all. I&#x27;ve worked for a diverse set of organizations, and every single one of them wanted to either trumpet their own practices to build clout with developers, or utilize knowledge in the public domain so that talent was easier to find. If anything companies avoid having secret sauce in their infra at all costs.')
