Item(by='takeda', descendants=None, kids=[24760226], score=None, time=1602538252, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24759371, text='While I am not that big fan of serverless projects (I am strongly convinced lambda should be used as a glue to automate AWS infrastructure and any other uses is just abusing it) you can use poetry with lambda.<p>I&#x27;m sure there are other ways of doing it, but the way I do it is using serverless framework (is a nodejs app) together with serverless-python-requirements plugin. The plugin understand poetry (make sure you don&#x27;t leave requirements.txt because it will use that, you don&#x27;t need that file if you use poetry).<p>Anyway it has warts, one big thing is that nodejs developers don&#x27;t care about norms and standards and constantly reinvent the wheel so for starters you&#x27;re pretty much forced to create project.json project-lock.json files, which then will create node_modules directory in root of your project. Then you need to start project through npx command (I believe you could still install serverless globally but looks like that&#x27;s being depreciated).<p>The node_modules directory will contain over 200MB of javascript code after you install it.<p>But after all of those things, when you get it to work it is not terrible.')
