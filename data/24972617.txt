Our pedagogy is based on years of research that shows that once students understand the logic behind constructing sentences, their ability to read and write improves dramatically. Unlike common multiple-choice-based learning tools, our tools allow students to practice writing sentences and passages in their browser, while still receiving real-time, focused feedback. This is a challenging engineering problem that we use a variety of methods to solve, from simple regex to machine learning.<p>Some info about Quill.org:\n- We were named one of Fast Company’s Top 10 Most Innovative Education Companies in 2018 \n- We served over 2 million students last year and are continuing to grow. \n- In April 2019, we won a grant from Google’s AI for Social Good initiative which provides us with both funding and mentorship from Google’s NLP experts. \n- We’ve been funded by the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, AT&amp;T, Black Rock, and the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (to name a few).')
