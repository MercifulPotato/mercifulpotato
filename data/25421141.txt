Item(by='pc86', descendants=None, kids=[25422035], score=None, time=1607970275, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25420158, text='Edit: Surprised it took almost twenty minutes for the downvotes to start. It also proves my point perfectly. For what it&#x27;s worth I&#x27;m not saying bicycle licenses are good or should be implemented. But it&#x27;s the most well-understood example of this phenomenon.<p>This is the argument about why &quot;bicycle licenses&quot; aren&#x27;t a thing. The number of drivers who aren&#x27;t cyclists dwarfs the number of cyclists by many orders of magnitude in most US states. In many municipalities, some cyclists regularly break traffic laws and cause (at best) frustration or (at worst) deadly accidents. This leads to drivers-who-aren&#x27;t-cyclists making the seems-reasonable comment that you should need a license to drive a bike the same way you do for a vehicle.<p>So let&#x27;s say a politician supports bicycle license. This isn&#x27;t enough to get anyone who supports a bike license to vote for them, because it&#x27;s not a Top Ten issue for anyone on that side. But not only will every cyclist in their district vote against them, they&#x27;ll campaign and donate to any opponent of that bill. If they even <i>think</i> you support the legislation they&#x27;re writing checks to your opponent.<p>I&#x27;m not making an argument on bike licenses in particular but I can see a similar effect where a minority percentage of HN feels strongly enough about a given topic that they upvote the articles based on title alone. When an issue is particularly divisive, the odds increase that people feel strongly on both sides so you end up with the #1 posts on two different days expressing diametrically opposed positions, but both very heavily upvoted.')
