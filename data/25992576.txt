For me, its about easily tracking deliveries and general security with a bonus of cool storm footage.<p>That being said, my camera alone has stopped multiple porch pirates (one even got to the door and yelled &quot;he&#x27;s got a NAME BRAND CAMERA&quot; and then they snapped 180 and bolted.<p>I&#x27;ve also recorded gunshots when a drunken party got out of hand and helped confirm with police the exact time of the shooting.<p>I watched a fedex driver jump my 6ft fence TWICE to deliver a package to my back door.  Completely idiotic here in the south...<p>I&#x27;ve captured multiple crashes as well as a hit and run at my neighbor&#x27;s house from a distracted driver.<p>I captured footage of a thief sneaking into and out of my neighbor&#x27;s house as well which led to an arrest.<p>A single one of those instances would have been worth it to me to have a camera let alone these and more.<p>I think most people have no idea what is happening in their little neighborhood and having photographic evidence can really change your perception of the area as well as potentially provide footage&#x2F;evidence (at your discretion) to the relevant authorities.')
