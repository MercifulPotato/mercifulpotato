I was extremely tired all the time. I didn’t get it properly diagnosed for nearly 15 years, and in that time I turned down going to Ivy League schools and a bunch of other opportunities. I have to admit going on HN can be a bit of a bummer as I always thought I was destined for the lives a lot of people have here (Silicon Valley, startups, etc).<p>I still got a degree in computer science but with that path I was put on...  I’m now a photographer and still live in the same area I grew up in.<p>I realize you have more years “wasted” but I’ve had quite a bit of time to come to terms with all of that. I think it’s important to keep in mind we all have advantages and disadvantages in life, and chances are if you’re on here you’ve still had a pretty charmed life.
