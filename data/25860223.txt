AFAIR they offered the app for free and said after one year you have to pay 1â‚¬&#x2F;$. I paid this once or twice and then it was free again (probably because of FB).<p>However it was very clever to give a whole year for free, lock everyone in and then start taking a small fee. I like that strategy. Now with FB it&#x27;s just a plain data grab.')
