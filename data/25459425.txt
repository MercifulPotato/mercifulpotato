If you are doing systems programming you may quite reasonably care about fine details and at least C++ is one of the languages that gives you the tools to do so <i>if it matters to your use case</i>.<p>But the high (abstraction) level of C++ development, in particular modern C++ which is largely pointer-free, make is pretty easy to rapidly write code with a minimum of foot gunning.<p>I&#x27;m more concerned with the unpredictable performance of java or python.
