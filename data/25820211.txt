I was running about once a week before I got a dog (which is significantly less movement than recommended, so I would count that as sedentary) and with one I have to go on 3-4 walks a day, of 20m or more. Hitting the recommended movement goal with a life setup like that is very easy and no longer going on walks is not an option because that would be sad for your dog.')
