We are the product when there is no product.  If people don&#x27;t share on facebook, facebook doesn&#x27;t exist, hence people are the product.  Same with Twitter.  They sell information and access to the people using the platform to corporations, hence the people are the product.<p>Frankly, this isn&#x27;t a new concept, people are at least part of the product in almost every business that sells data or &quot;insights&quot;.  Credit reporting agencies, hello we don&#x27;t pay for it (except to see our own data which is perverse), but we are the product.  Acxiom and similar companies, we are 100% the product and they collect all our data through sources in the public domain and through buying access and then reselling &quot;insights&quot; about us, which makes us the product.<p>If you go to a big box store and do a survey with one of those people walking around that give you a $10 off or whatever, you are the product, they are selling your data and &quot;insights&quot;.<p>I don&#x27;t think there needs to be a comeback for the point that &quot;people are the product&quot;, it is a fact and there isn&#x27;t necessarily anything &quot;wrong&quot; with that, it just should not be hidden or denied IMO.')
