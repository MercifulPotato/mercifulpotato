They&#x27;re not even competitors, because Apple doesn&#x27;t have a social network, Facebook doesn&#x27;t sell computers, and indeed Facebook is currently among the grossing apps in the iOS App Store, 30% of which Apple gets.<p>If Facebook was as terrible as Apple makes them out to be, why would Apple allow Facebook in their App Store and take 30% of the generated revenue? It&#x27;s hypocritical for Apple to criticize Facebook. If anything, the App Store made Facebook more popular than ever, so it&#x27;s a &quot;monster&quot; that Apple helped create.<p>EDIT: My perspective is that the App Store and iOS lockdown have been harmful to user privacy, and Facebook is merely a convenient enemy to distract from the harmfulness of Apple&#x27;s own current business model. On the Mac, I can install Little Snitch and prevent software from phoning home to <i>both</i> facebook.com <i>and</i> apple.com. I can&#x27;t do any of this on iPhone. (And indeed, Little Snitch is not even compatible with the restrictive Mac App Store rules, so it has to be distributed outside the MAS.) The iPhone platform is designed such that software like Facebook thrives, and software like Little Snitch cannot exist.')
