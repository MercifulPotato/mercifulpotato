When I did this, we were using a very fast custom wire format, but entirely hand-coded. Say flatbuffers without the code generation part. And having massive trouble with schema evolution.<p>Another group had already evaluated pb and found it way too slow. They had designed something similar but faster. I wrote my implementation of pb to prevent this, and showed pb could be fast enough. It was definitely the right choice at the time, as it gave us C++ speed close to the old format, plus easy interop with other languages.<p>&gt; If protobuf works for Google then it essentially works for 99.999% of every other company on the globe.<p>Uh.. no. Google is a massive company, but if you browse the comments in this thread, you&#x27;ll find multiple remarks like &quot;this was built for Google&#x27;s servers&quot;. Google have specific use cases, and they build software for that. The software may well be lacking for other use cases. I can totally imagine Blizzard wanting to write their own implementation, think of the benefits of reducing parse time in a multiplayer server.')
