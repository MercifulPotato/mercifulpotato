Are they going after Pornhub simply because it sounds &quot;bad&quot;? Is it because they are caving to pressure from religious groups or feminist groups or some other organization? Or is it because other offenders may espouse political views that Visa&#x2F;Mastercard are aligned to? Or is it that Pornhub is smaller and they can afford to lose them? Either way, I am not a fan of duopolists picking winners and losers, instead of the law picking them.')
