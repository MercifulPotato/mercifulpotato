In the beginning, I hadn&#x27;t a lot of experience managing a large open source project. I would accept all kinds of feature PR&#x27;s or tried to implement all the features people suggested and wanted from me. Obviously that was one of the main drivers of vim-go&#x27;s popularity. \nHowever, this popularity also brought me down and I had a burnout.<p>The problem with this one-person&#x2F;popular projects are, it&#x27;s not scalable. People recommend finding a maintainer, but that&#x27;s not always possible and pretty hard. The main problem is, it&#x27;s a niche product. Like you need to find someone who loves Vim, loves Go and also wants to be a part of a project. (I was lucky to find someone like that though, thank you Billie!).<p>I still enjoy writing software on the side, but I think I&#x27;ve lost the energy and appetite to work +4 hours (on top of my full time job) every single day. Having two kids, getting older probably contributed to it :) I&#x27;m happy though how things have evolved right now. I found my inner peace.')
