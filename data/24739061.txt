I don&#x27;t even think there&#x27;s a current smartphone that fits my parameters (high-end, 5&quot; or smaller, waterproof, dual SIM.)<p>That said, I&#x27;ve arrived at the &quot;Waste of Money&quot; conclusion regardless.  What exactly is the point of buying a new one? I&#x27;ll rather replace the battery on my XZ2c.  It&#x27;s the green option too.')
