All you need is a pw manager that saves you from non-malware attacks (email compromise aside). Yubikey cannot save you from persistent malware, which makes it useless in almost all scenarios. The only hardware device that makes sense is the one with a screen (like trezor). Simple click-to-use devices carry no protections that you wouldn&#x27;t otherwise get with a pw manager.')
