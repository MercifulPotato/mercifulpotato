Item(by='munk-a', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610747798, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25796665, text='&gt;  What did informing the cops about the burglary do, precisely?<p>It mostly just made me feel better - the chances of recovering items after a theft or burglary is nearly nil.  However, after having my home invaded by a stranger and my personal belongings rifled through it was quite cathartic to report the crime, give all the information I could to try and make sure the criminals were eventually caught, and help restore my sanity by just seeing a system in place for these issues.<p>I received no recompense for the crime and, at the time, I wasn&#x27;t insured, but I was also dirt poor and didn&#x27;t have much to lose except my privacy.<p>On the topic of murders I agree that detectives and investigators are the ones that will end up catching murderers and beat&#x2F;patrol police do very little to apprehend criminals but they do make the system dramatically more visible and do a lot to de-escalate situations[1] from becoming as dangerous.  The chances that you will be mid-being-murdered and be rescued by the police are nearly zero - the chances that someone who may have murdered you decides not to do so is more significant and, I think, aided by a visible patrol police force - even if they don&#x27;t significantly contribute to resolving justice.<p>So I both agree with you that police are pretty useless when it comes to dealing with crimes after the fact - but disagree with you about their general efficacy.  They should exist to de-escalate situations before they become real problems and make visible the rules of society that we should all abide by.<p>Oh, this is all very much my opinion so I&#x27;ve not got a lot of sources or references to pull on as to how to make police into a force that does that.<p>1. In this point I&#x27;m speaking as a now-Canadian - I don&#x27;t really feel qualified to speak on the US system as 1) I&#x27;m white and 2) I haven&#x27;t lived there in over a decade.  So please do excuse this statement if you (the reader) have personally suffered unreasonable escalation of force.')
