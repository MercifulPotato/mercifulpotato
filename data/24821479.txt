Most homes below $1.5mil in the peninsula have some serious compromises (especially if you are trying to get a home that is above 1200sqft). You&#x27;re going to have to take a hard hit on the schools and - well - then you&#x27;re just going to pay for private schools then. What would you rather do? Spend $5,000&#x2F;month for your two kids to go to some private school or put that $5,000&#x2F;month into your mortgage instead?<p>San Jose != Peninsula btw.')
