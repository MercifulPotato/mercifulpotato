Item(by='musicale', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606448823, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25223919, text='&gt; What do they gain?<p>Possibly the following:<p>- Happier customers<p>- Additional positive news coverage and better PR<p>- Customers buying more games (and sending more money to Sony) instead of putting money in scalpers&#x27; pockets (in addition to the commission fees pocketed by eBay etc.)<p>- New players who can&#x27;t afford the scalpers&#x27; excessive markup but might become long-term PlayStation customers if they could just find a console at MSRP<p>I almost wish Sony had offered PS+ subscribers the chance to preorder a console that would be factory locked to their PSN ID for a year or something, sort of like a phone upgrade.<p>Fortunately Sony seems to have a better availability track record than (cough) Nintendo, so I expect that the supply will improve fairly quickly. Also since many transition games work on PS4 as well as PS5, there&#x27;s not a huge downside to waiting.')
