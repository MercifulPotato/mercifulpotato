It&#x27;s a bit of a pain, but it&#x27;s not too bad. I&#x27;ve used Dell and CDW in the past.<p>The minimum volume license buy is 5 licenses. Any good reseller will sell you 1 copy of LTSC and 4 of the cheapest SKU in the catalog (usually $5-10 &#x2F; ea) to get your volume license contract started. After that you can purchase piecemeal for 2 years before you need to fulfill the minimum purchase again. The licenses themselves are perpetual.<p>I don&#x27;t like it, but it&#x27;s not too hard to do either. The trick is finding a reseller who will leave you alone after the purchase (no sales calls, etc).')
