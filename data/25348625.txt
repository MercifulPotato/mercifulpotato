Item(by='WJW', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607449142, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25347383, text='&quot;Design belongs to management&quot; is definitely better than &quot;no design at all&quot;. But this needlessly conflates leadership and management. There is no reason that the most capable at design would also be most at home doing all the other management tasks like performance reviews and inter-team communication that are typically the managers&#x27; domain. Also vice versa btw: I&#x27;ve seen multiple times how people wanting to grow as people managers would have to make deep technical decisions (on the spot, no time to ask the team about it) about things they had very little experience with.<p>An even better spot in the solution space would be to separate people management and tech leadership into different roles to be filled, though for this to work a high level of trust between the types of leader needs to exist.')
