Item(by='janfoeh', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606397668, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25219444, text='&gt; None of the suggestions in the post would increase the complexity.<p>Apart from maybe sideloading, I agree with you. It&#x27;s not the list of suggestions I disagree with, it&#x27;s the fundamental assumption of the article that iPads can and should become pro devices.<p>The needs of power users and non-power users are at odds with each other most of the time - so far, so obvious. Improving a product for one group usually comes at the expense of the other - this is pretty visible in iPadOS already, which arguably has become a lot more intimidating and less user friendly than, say, iOS 6.<p>I believe that trying to bridge that divide is ultimately futile, at least for the foreseeable future and barring some major breakthrough in human computing interfaces.<p>Apple should once and for all position iPads as a non-pro machines, to free iPadOS from these contradicting expectations and requirements. Beefing it up in ways the article suggests only deepens the problem.<p>In that light, I would consider the iPad Pro line to be a strategic mistake.<p>A &quot;pro&quot; tablet line should either have come with macOS, or not exist at all. I&#x27;m not even sure it should have been called iPad.')
