Certainly not.<p>The one thing that makes the context different is if the venue wants very specific musicians, and all of their choices are pros who expect to get paid. The venue can&#x27;t get any of the musicians it wants without paying and that&#x27;s that.<p>If a venue is not picky about musicians, it can easily get free ones. So many free ones that if three of them cancel, it can still call a fourth to come over.')
