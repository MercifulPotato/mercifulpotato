To this day lithium is considered the gold standard in suicide preventative treatment. There is a lot of research that leads to the conclusion that due to the realities of modern civilization we may not receive enough lithium which in small concentrations is is an essential mineral. While I have not read the article you linked to, it may not be that far off base, but may very well be snake oil, nevertheless, the general scientifically held belief is that there is a strong probability that due to modern society norms we do not receive enough lithium in our diet and that the average human would benefit in metal health from a small boost in lithium in their diet. With that stated it is a good reminder that, you can take too much lithium and an lithium overdose has some nasty side effects. It is really something that should be monitored by a doctor as they take blood serum samples and ensure that you are not running high lithium levels which can destroy your kidneys and other organs.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.psychologytoday.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;blog&#x2F;evolutionary-psychiatry&#x2F;201201&#x2F;could-you-have-lithium-deficiency" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.psychologytoday.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;blog&#x2F;evolutionary-psychia...</a>')
