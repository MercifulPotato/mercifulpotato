Gore wanted some select counties recounted, bush wanted no counties recounted, but if there was going to be a rexound then bush wanted the whole state recounted. In the end the SCbrules that the 14th amendment said that including votes with &quot;hanging Chad&#x27;s&quot; and other clear intent required the whole state to be recounted. Gore conceeded because there wasn&#x27;t enough time and he believed that a whole state recount wouldn&#x27;t have favored him in the end. History reflects that it may have been a bad strategy for Gore to try and recount just some counties because he may well have won if he argued for a state wide recount from the beginning.')
