It was, like all campuses, annoying to find parking &#x2F; work out transportation.<p>Then one day I just needed to run get something, so I parked in the hotel loading zone. I ran into someone and chatted for about close to an hour and then, remembering where I parked, freaked out and ran outside.<p>Car was still there, no problems.<p>In true hacker fashion, I went and sat in the car and waited to see when someone would a campus metermaid would come along.<p>They never did!<p>And so for the next 2 years I parked there every day.<p>In the end I did receive 6 $25 tickets and, ingloriously, I was towed once which cost me $250.<p>Compared to a parking pass it was an absolute steal, and in true &quot;things you&#x27;re allowed to do&quot; form, it helped me realize the risks of transgression are lower than you think.')
