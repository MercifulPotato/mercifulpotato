As a longtime C# guy I can&#x27;t even find the up-to-date &quot;blessed&quot; way to do things with ASP.NET anymore.  They change it every version it seems.  The DI&#x2F;IoC stuff is definitely too pervasive, particularly in an ASP.NET context.<p>That said, the new C# language features really do reduce boilerplate when used judiciously - multiple return is now available, &quot;expression-bodied properties&quot;, improved template strings etc.  Lots of good stuff that is hard to find good documentation for :)')
