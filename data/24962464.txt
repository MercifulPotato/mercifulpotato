Item(by='pron', descendants=None, kids=[24963130], score=None, time=1604264402, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24961750, text='&gt; just using mathematical reasoning as you derive your program text makes it considerably easier to build systems that satisfy the specification.<p>And I am saying that since this has never been achieved in practice for systems of considerable scale, this is a rather hypothetical use of the word &quot;easier.&quot; Is it possible that one day this will actually be easier? Sure. Is this the case now? I don&#x27;t think so.<p>&gt; The human act of writing the program is exactly the same as deriving a proof.<p>The human act of painting your ceiling is exactly the same as painting the Sistine Chapel and the human act done by a first-year student taking a calculus exam is exactly the same as a Field medalist writing a proof in a paper. Look at how, say, a verified quicksort is written in Idris [1] and compare that to how it&#x27;s written in Java&#x2F;Python (one could write Quicksort in Idris as in Java, but then the program will <i>not</i> serve as proof of its correctness). I think that the claim that with what we know how to do <i>today</i> producing the former is as easy as the latter, let alone easier, requires some <i>empirical</i> evidence.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;bmsherman&#x2F;blog&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Quicksort-in-Idris" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;bmsherman&#x2F;blog&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Quicksort-in-Idris</a>')
