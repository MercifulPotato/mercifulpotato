In the EU every car insurance has to cover minimum 1 million euro in personal liability and 5 million in 3rd party liability. My own with Aviva covers 5 million euro for personal and 20 million for 3rd party. But car insurance typically doesn&#x27;t pay healthcare bills since healthcare is nationalized, so it&#x27;s very hard to imagine how payouts would be anywhere near those sums. You&#x27;d need to crash into multiple buggati veyrons to get close to the maximum liability limit. I&#x27;m paying Â£400&#x2F;year.')
