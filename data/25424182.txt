In the 1980s, it was possible for young people in Europe to get a all-in-one ticket where you could travel as much as you could for four weeks in the summer. The tickets costed about 250 â‚¬. It was a bit a thing that defined my generation. People who traveled on budget did meticulous time-tables to spend as few nights as possible in paid hostels, traveling to Paris then to Vienna to Athene to Rome then to some small place in Portugal and so on. Returning hungry, exhaustauted and longing for a good shower but with bright eyes and full of experiences, meeting unknown people, made many new friends, and seeing a nice bit  of the continent.<p>It is perhaps one of the reasons why my generation defines itself as Europeans. And it is utterly painful to me that my  young niece and her generation, at least at the moment, can&#x27;t do it.')
