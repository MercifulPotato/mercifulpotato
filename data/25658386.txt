You copy the link to your &quot;create post&quot; and you will see your post filled with text. You can then edit and share.<p>Inksprout utilizes the latest AI summarization technique from Google (called Pegasus). It will add more context to your friends&#x2F;followers, increasing engagement.<p>Why this project?<p>I used to have a Twitter account for sharing long-read quality articles. I didn&#x27;t want to just share the clickbait headline, so I always made sure to include a good quote.<p>The problem was that it took lots of time. This idea is trying to automate that process. I think adding more context when sharing links are helpful to people too.')
