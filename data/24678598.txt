The reality is the bike lanes in the parent are built with French money.<p>I dont think France has a leading role in the EU, whats the last French initiative that was carried all the way to implementation? Reforming foreign workers rules didn&#x27;t work, taxing tech giants didn&#x27;t work.<p>As for the largest trading bloc, it also comes with so many regulations that a lot of SMB can&#x27;t even take advantage of it due to costs.<p>Anyway, my main comment was just on these &quot;financed by the EU&quot; signs that you see everywhere but people don&#x27;t even understand what it means, its just their own money.')
