I believe the current state of knowledge is that it <i>likely</i> works like this:<p>Mask on virus spreader: Mask will capture a very large amount of the viral load being shed.<p>Mask on non-spreader: Will filter <i>some</i> amount of the air you&#x27;re breathing in and <i>lower</i> your initial viral load. Giving you either<p>A) a low enough dose your immune system kills it off or<p>B) a low enough dose your immune system has more time to mount a defense before the viral load in your body rises high, potentially leading to a more mild infection.<p>That&#x27;s why we ALL need to wear a mask and stay 6ft&#x2F;2 meters apart.<p>BTW, further is better 6ft is not a magic bubble.<p>Also there is aerosol transmission(floating covid in the air). Ventilation is CRITICAL for this to be stopped. Germany is spearheading ventilation as a way to stop the spread as far as I know.<p>They are making rules about intervals windows need to be opened etc.<p>Heres a BBC article covering Germany on this: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;world-europe-54599593" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;world-europe-54599593</a><p>Here&#x27;s a random blog that gets into it: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dirkpaessler.blog&#x2F;2020&#x2F;08&#x2F;13&#x2F;corona-wie-co2-messgerate-aerosol-infektionen-in-buro-klassenzimmer-vermeiden-konnen&#x2F;#more-2965" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dirkpaessler.blog&#x2F;2020&#x2F;08&#x2F;13&#x2F;corona-wie-co2-messgera...</a>')
