At least that way I could be an a more familiar environment.<p>My emacs init checked argv[0] -- if the name started with &#x27;-&#x27; then it asked if I intended to log out before exiting.<p>That was on the original GNU machine -- yes, when the FSF&#x27;s entire computing resource was an unused VAX 750 that nobody wanted and that had been purchased and installed by someone unknown for reasons also unknown and was just taking up space in a small machine room.')
