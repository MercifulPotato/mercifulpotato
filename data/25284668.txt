We have occasional brownouts&#x2F;blackouts in summer when everyone is running their aircon. Not often, but likely to happen more with higher temperatures. I am keeping an eye on things like Tesla&#x27;s Powerwall as a luxury item for that concern. Especially for when I am over 60 years old... (20 years away but still a thought.)<p>I plan to visit the Great Barrier Reef now, while it is living.<p>Operating temperatures for outdoor mechanicals.\nFor me, small aircon, cars. But big building infrastructure, factories, farmers etc buying and building for the future will have to expand their operational parameters, if only slowly and only a comparatively small amount.<p>Highly underrated though is more energy in the system will mean more extreme weather events more often.<p>Floods, heat waves, hail storms, but also with large shifting air cycles it often surprises people to realise that blizzards or cold snaps will happen differently too. They may be &quot;warmer&quot; but with faster moving air they will travel more to areas that didn&#x27;t experience them. Or they may be colder as the air travels faster carrying air from the poles. Weather is not an easy thing to predict. But I think it will be even less predictable.<p>In the US it may mean that hurricanes or tornados are a thing more often. Here in Australia Queensland will get hit more often. Insurance premiums will adjust accordingly.<p>I suspect international migration will also be a thing. People moving away from the equator and to the poles more.<p>TL;DR: Plan for slightly more hot, windy and extreme weather events. :-P<p>NB: rereading this almost casts a picture of drastic disasters every day. But I want to clarify that it will be incrementally more than now over time and only a bit more by the end of my lifetime. But who wants &quot;a bit more&quot; hurricanes in their life? And where does it stop for the future?<p>PS: maybe this question should be asked of an insurance company quant?')
