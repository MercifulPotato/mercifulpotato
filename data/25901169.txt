Item(by='reissbaker', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611566522, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25900106, text='The article is citing needing 6-8 panels between 320-330 watts to charge a Tesla Model S; 8 if you live in the northeast United States (it&#x27;s not backyard orientation, it&#x27;s about where you live geographically), 6 if you live in the southwest United States. Tesla&#x27;s &quot;small&quot; panel arrays (240 sqft) are 4.08 <i>kilowatts</i>, which is more than enough even in the northeast to charge a Model S, or any EV. They take up 240sqft, which would fit in most backyards, although a roof mount would of course be preferable both because it&#x27;ll get less shade and because it won&#x27;t take up backyard space. (I am confused why anyone is focused on backyard installation when roof installation is far superior. I don&#x27;t think there is much of a market for backyard installation.)<p>Really. There&#x27;s a reason Tesla sells these panels, and it&#x27;s because they can charge the cars Tesla makes.')
