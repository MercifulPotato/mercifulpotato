Item(by='reissbaker', descendants=None, kids=[25906482], score=None, time=1611566522, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25900106, text='The article is citing needing 6-8 panels between 320-330 watts to charge a Tesla Model S; 8 if you live in the northeast United States (it&#x27;s not backyard orientation, it&#x27;s about where you live geographically), 6 if you live in the southwest United States. The &quot;small&quot; Tesla panel arrays that I mentioned are 4.08 <i>kilowatts</i> [1], which is more than enough even in the northeast to charge a Model S, or any EV. They take up 240sqft, which would fit in most backyards, although a roof mount would of course be preferable both because it&#x27;ll get less shade and because it won&#x27;t take up backyard space, unless you have a lot of open backyard space away from any existing structures.<p>Really. There&#x27;s a reason Tesla sells solar panels, and it&#x27;s because they can charge the cars Tesla makes. They can also lower your electric bills (or drop them to zero, or make you money depending on the region you live in), since even the smallest panel array they sell produces more electricity than an average American driver needs per year for an EV.<p>1: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tesla.com&#x2F;support&#x2F;energy&#x2F;solar-panels&#x2F;going-solar&#x2F;sizing-and-design#tesla-solar-sizes-anchor" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tesla.com&#x2F;support&#x2F;energy&#x2F;solar-panels&#x2F;going-sola...</a>')
