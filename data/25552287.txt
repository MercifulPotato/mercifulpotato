On my laptop with a 256GB SSD, a common restic scan with cold caches takes less than 15 minutes; an hourly backup is a few hundred megs, a daily backup is often close to 2 gigs, depends on how many files you have, and how many (and how much) of them change.<p>Alternatively, you can do an rsync-based snapshot.')
