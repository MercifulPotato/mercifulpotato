I&#x27;m not even sure what the main article meant, because I could only find four mainstream reviews covering the 1.0 release. The first one by RockPaperShotgun[0] is essentially glowing and mentions how they&#x27;ve closed so many bugs. The second one by Game Enthusiast which seems pretty happy about it, the only reference to the word &quot;bug&quot; in the review is:<p><pre><code>    Let’s just say, Factorio has always been a diamond in \n    the rough. Or more like just a lump of promising coal. \n    And after 8.5 years, 18,855 bug reports, 5,603 mods, \n    and probably thousands of man hours, we can finally \n    conclude that Factorio has become a spectacular \n    diamond. Albeit, a diamond for gamers with a highly \n    specific acquired taste.\n    - GameEnthusiast review[1]\n</code></pre>\nThe only other reviews I could find were both by PCgamer, and only one mentioned the number of bugs left, but was overall positive. Here is the reference to bugs, which is almost entirely factual, and seems mostly-positive about it aside from a single line:<p><pre><code>    The rush to get it out a month early does mean that the \n    1.0 build is still a bit on the buggy side. According to \n    Wube, there are around 150 reported bugs and 80 internal \n    tasks that still need to be tackled, but they&#x27;re \n    apparently smaller issues rather than critical ones. You \n    can see the known issues and current bug reports on the \n    official forum. They&#x27;ll hopefully be dealt with in the 1.1 \n    update, which will focus on fixes and &quot;filling the most \n    obvious gaps&quot; rather than adding new stuff. \n    \n    Factorio was pretty much feature-complete already—though \n    Wube was also planning a campaign and some UI improvements \n    that have been cut [...]\n    - PCgamer review [2]\n</code></pre>\nThe fourth review is particularly glowing. When talking about bugs they say:<p><pre><code>    Factorio has been in early access for four years, so \n    most of its creases have been ironed out. There are some\n    minor flaws. Visually it isn&#x27;t the most exciting game, \n    with an odd penchant for beige and brown. The top-down \n    perspective can also obscure potential spanners in your \n    works, like a missing piece of conveyor belt or an \n    inserter facing the wrong way.\n    - PCgamer review[3]\n</code></pre>\nthey give a 91&#x2F;100, and have this particularly glowing passage at the start:<p><pre><code>    Let&#x27;s skip the preamble, shall we? Factorio is \n    brilliant. If you&#x27;re remotely interested in games about \n    management, construction, and above all production \n    chains, then hop aboard the nearest conveyor belt and \n    grab yourself a copy of Factorio this instant. Then \n    pick up another copy for the most important person in \n    your life, because they won&#x27;t be seeing you for a \n    while, and at least this way they&#x27;ll understand why.\n    - PCgamer review[3]\n</code></pre>\nI&#x27;m honestly not sure why one line in a mostly-positive-but-factual review that is mostly not subjective, results in in the need to disparage the entire journalistic profession? Could you explain why? I&#x27;m extremely curious, thanks.<p>[0 (RPS review)]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rockpapershotgun.com&#x2F;the-fantastic-factorio-has-launched-out-of-early-access" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rockpapershotgun.com&#x2F;the-fantastic-factorio-has-...</a><p>[1 (GameEnthusiast)]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;game-enthusiast.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;08&#x2F;18&#x2F;factorio-review&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;game-enthusiast.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;08&#x2F;18&#x2F;factorio-review&#x2F;</a><p>[2 (PCgamer)]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pcgamer.com&#x2F;uk&#x2F;factorio-finally-leaves-early-access-after-4-years&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pcgamer.com&#x2F;uk&#x2F;factorio-finally-leaves-early-acc...</a><p>[3 (PCgamer)]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pcgamer.com&#x2F;uk&#x2F;factorio-review&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pcgamer.com&#x2F;uk&#x2F;factorio-review&#x2F;</a>')
