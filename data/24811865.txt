Most of the time when you run into non-native english speakers, they would rather practice their english with you, even when in their country of origin.<p>Additionally, there&#x27;s very little lingual diversity in the US as it stands. Sure, there are plenty of spanish speakers, but early education doesn&#x27;t really focus on teaching spanish with any sort of fluency as a true end-goal.<p>So situationally it just makes learning a second language that much more difficult. Nonetheless, I do agree with you that there are obviously huge benefits to it; the few that you mention, along with many others.')
