After the agreement was signed, the new investors joined forces with another investor achieving control. A new entity was set up, controlled by the investors, and they used their control to force the sale of the company at V, instantly destroying all common shareholder value.<p>All of this was announced (in a rather gloating manner) by the new head of the company. &quot;You report to me now&quot;, basically.<p>This did not sit well with the staff, who had been working hard for a while. I walked that day, and within a few days the entire engineering team did as well.<p>For their $5 million, they got office desks, a bunch of PCs, and some half-built software they had no idea what to do with.<p>I suppose that did not work out particularly well for anybody ;)')
