The author\nclearly doesn&#x27;t mean that learning by a human really _is_ machine learning,\nbecause obviously a human is not a machine.<p>There is however a danger, in anything to do with artificial intelligence (the\nbroader discipline to which machine learning belongs) when extracting conclusions\nfrom superficial similarities between the behaviours of AI systems and humans.\nFor example, it is easy to assume that, because a human mind can make\npredictions about the behaviour of other road users and a machine learning\nsystem (driving a car) can make predictions about the behaviour of other road\nusers, the human and the system are &quot;doing the same thing&quot;, or, even more\negregiously, &quot;doing it the same way&quot;. In particular when comparing statistical\nmachine learning with human learning it is easy to see that, beyond the\nsuperficial similarities, there are significant differences that suggest each\nsystem operates in a very different manner than the other. For one example, a\nhuman who learns to predict the behaviour of other road users can also give\nan account of this behaviour to a third party at a later point in time without\nadditional &quot;training&quot; on the task, while a machine learning system that can\ndrive a car cannot also generate text to explain its decisions, etc. Whatever\n&quot;models&quot; humans build of the world, they are very different than statistical\nmachine learning models.<p>&gt;&gt; P.S. The above are my conjectures and loose thoughts. There could well be a\nliterature on all of this. If so, feel free to inform me about it in the\ncomments.<p>Indeed, there is. For an early introduction to the field of machine learning\nresearch I would recommend to the author Tom Mitchell&#x27;s textbook &quot;Machine\nLearning&quot;. Or, going even further back in time, Ryszard Michalski&#x27;s &quot;Machine\nLearning: an Artificial Intelligence Approach&quot;. For a shorter introductory\nread Tom Mitchell&#x27;s &quot;Generalisation as Search&quot; paper is a good introduction to\nsome early ideas on the theoretical underpinnings of machine &quot;learning&quot;.<p>These are old papers and textbooks, but I believe this is exactly the kind of\nliterature that should be brought to the attention of experts from other\ndisciplines who wish to understand the field. Machine learning looks very different\nwith the perspective of a body of literature going back to the early &#x27;70s,\nthan it does with the perspective of a few articles in the lay press waxing\nlyrically about the progress achieved in the last few years.')
