It is possible to define the documents language via the `lang` metadata field; `ltr` and `rtl` attributes can be set for individual text elements.<p>Core contributors are westerners or Russian (US, UK, Switzerland, Germany, Russia), and we rely heavily on user reports to improve non-LTR scripts and languages. But the goal is to make pandoc work flawlessly for everyone.')
