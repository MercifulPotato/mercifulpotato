That&#x27;s compared to 95-97% in other developed countries because there are always some people who fall through cracks, like (say) a Canadian who doesn&#x27;t get a new provincial health care card after moving, or a German who neglects to buy into a new sickness fund after changing careers. The only such systems with actual 100% (or as close to it as possible) coverage is something like the UK NHS, which does not have a requirement to show a membership card (because, well, there isn&#x27;t one) to receive treatment.')
