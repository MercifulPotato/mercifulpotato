Historically there are plenty of examples of communities that have managed to get along for extended periods with reasonably good outcomes. What we humans don&#x27;t (yet) have a good handle on is how to protect such communities against invasion from outside--other people outside the communities just won&#x27;t leave them alone, but insist on trying to make them part of some larger social experiment.')
