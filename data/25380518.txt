For example, Azure templates allow looping and conditionals and all sorts of fancy stuff. Approaching a typical library of ARM templates is a massive undertaking: reading a JSON (or YAML) if statement is not ergonomic in any way - causal relationships can be multiple screens (or files) apart because of the sheer amount of JSON required to represent executable code.<p>It should be kept relatively lightweight, with stuff like CloudFormation GetAtt to glue deployed things together. Anything more complex should be solved with tooling designed for computation, i.e. programming languages (that emit config, e.g. Pulumi).')
