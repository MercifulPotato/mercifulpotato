They don&#x27;t offer instant settlement (or may be they do, but the same was applied to settled money). They blocked buying GME stock on nonmargin accounts with settled money. What&#x27;s the risk for them? \nI don&#x27;t know if the same was applied to RH (blocking GME stock on non margin account with settled money) but what I read is RH even removed GME ticker from the search, so you can&#x27;t buy it.<p>edit: from the Bloomberg article you posted: &quot;The trouble on Thursday began around 10 a.m., when after days of turbulence, the DTCC demanded significantly more collateral from member brokers, according to two people familiar with the matter.&quot;. \nSo I have my money settled in my broker&#x27;s account for months, I&#x27;m buying without lending any additional money, why can&#x27;t my broker show that I have all the collateral needed or even transfer my money? \nAm I missing something here? Does it work per broker and not per broker&#x27;s account maybe? So people with settled cash are affected becasuse of other people doesn&#x27;t have enough collateral? Or may be because showing&#x2F;transferring collateral to DTCC is not instantenius?')
