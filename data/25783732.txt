He&#x27;s done some pretty important investigative stories there, one of which they tried to indict him for. None of those stories had to do with the Snowden leaks.<p>He also continues to rewrite&#x2F;update the same plodding OpEd about how no one should forget that Democratic apparatchiks and pundits are also hypocritical, self-serving and untrustworthy asshats. Not the most incisive journalism by any metric, but again unrelated to Snowden leaks.')
