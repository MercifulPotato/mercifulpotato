It feels as if they think that one type of “file”, as in the file that is a block of storage, is the “true file”, and the others are “fake files”, whereas the file that maps to a block of storage is no more or less an abstraction than a file that maps to a some segment of a process&#x27; memory or a hardware driver.<p>Would it be different of <i>Unix</i> files were instead named “vectors” as a more abstract name and that some vectors mape to what others might call a “file”, <i>id est</i> a block of storage.')
