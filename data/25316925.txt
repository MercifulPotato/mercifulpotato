Daily users? Unique visitors?<p>Do you think in that case the government deserves to know much visitors your website has?<p>Also wasn&#x27;t the idea of Section 230 to be more for the internet companies? Would repealing mean that the internet provider can be sued for what you do? Wouldn&#x27;t that be the end result?<p>For me Section 230 is the cornerstone of the web, and I&#x27;d be very against its repeal unless you can show me that the web after that is better&#x2F;safer for me and for my parents. I am all up for some clarifications as long as they do not limit my right to have a website that won&#x27;t be sued out of the world for something that someone else does.<p>And about FB, Twitter, Google, Apple deal with them with a proper tool -- antitrust. Noone will ever explain to me why FB was allowed to buy Whatsapp and Instagram.')
