Some of those are:<p>1.  Inertia.  Most folks are already on centralized SN platforms, as are their contacts, friends and family;<p>2.  Complex installations[0] keep many folks from even attempting to install such platforms;<p>3.  Lack of symmetric, high-speed broadband access limits the ability to self-host such platforms;<p>4.  Limited&#x2F;expensive access to domain names, DNS hosting[1] and static addressing (in the absence of widespread IPv6 adoption by consumer ISPs).<p>Given that most consumer-grade computing systems are mostly idle and storage costs continue to plummet, the argument for decentralized platforms just becomes better and better.<p>As such, why aren&#x27;t more folks promoting them and&#x2F;or developing mechanisms for broader access&#x2F;acceptance?<p>[0] Yes, there are Docker images for many of these platforms, but implementation&#x2F;adoption of Docker is limited and most of these platforms require significant IT and development knowledge&#x2F;skills to implement.<p>[1] This could also be addressed via containerization, but there seems to be limited interest in promoting such self-hosted platforms.')
