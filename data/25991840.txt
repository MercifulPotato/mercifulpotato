The full context was talking about Bush&#x27;s approval ratings:<p>&gt; &quot;Now, I know there are some polls out there saying this man has a 32 percent approval rating. But guys like us, we don&#x27;t pay attention to the polls. We know that polls are just a collection of statistics that reflect what people are thinking in reality. And reality has a well-known liberal bias ... Sir, pay no attention to the people who say the glass is half empty, [...] because 32 percent means it&#x27;s two-thirds empty. There&#x27;s still some liquid in that glass, is my point. But I wouldn&#x27;t drink it. The last third is usually backwash.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s a tongue-in-cheek way of saying that liberals are more grounded in reality than conservatives.')
