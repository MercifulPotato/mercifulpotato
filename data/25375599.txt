Maybe it holds true in a couple of Slavic languages, but I&#x27;m familiar with a handful of them and this isn&#x27;t a thing in any of those.<p>Regarding the &quot;insulting&quot; part, you&#x27;re probably mistranating it. What would be insulting in many Slavic languages is using the &quot;middle grammatical gender&quot; (rough literal translation) which is equivalent to using &quot;it&quot; to refer to a person in English. If you insist on  translating literally, using third person gender neutral (in Slovene and many Slavic languages) is actually a sign of respect and is how talks to their superiors (antiquated in 3rd person, but still the norm in 2nd).<p>Not that it matters anyways, as we&#x27;re all talking in English and thus English grammar is the only one that matters. Even if you know for a fact all parties in the conversation speak the other language, if you&#x27;re using English, the rules of the other language don&#x27;t matter.<p>P.S. Re: Latinx: yeah, that&#x27;s stupid and I&#x27;d see it as mildly offensive if directed at me, but that is neither a pronoun nor common practice, so is entirely irrelevant here')
