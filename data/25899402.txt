Item(by='throwaway894345', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611550728, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25898393, text='As someone who is very critical of fighting racism with racism and other similarly ill-conceived ideas, I don’t think this is censorship in any meaningful sense of the word and this certainly isn’t the right hill to die on with respect to wonky left wing policies. In fact, I don’t see how this policy is left wing at all... They mention that they’re doing it to avoid perpetuating racism or something, but the actual meat of the article doesn’t suggest that they’re doing any sort of progressive race testing with respect to whose records will be altered and whose won’t. The racial prelude seems to be empty virtue signaling, and the actual policy doesn’t seem to be very progressive at all; rather it appears to be perfectly egalitarian.')
