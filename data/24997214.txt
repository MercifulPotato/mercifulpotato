If Twitter had been posting a warning everytime someone pretended the &quot;fine folks on both sides&quot; hoax then they would have been in a better position now. Same if they had come up with the rule against hacked materials when Trumps tax papers supposedly leaked.<p>Do you have a link that refers to this cryptographic verification? Last time I saw this talked about on HN, the summary was that there really wasn&#x27;t even an ounce of evidence, and that the people who supposedly had it were not sharing it for no good reason, so I&#x27;d be interested if there has actually been a proper verification of this.<p>&gt; have finally started to improve lives of people in the midwest - without hurting the coasts<p>What do you mean, and what&#x27;s the source for this? Again I&#x27;m not that informed about this topic, so I&#x27;m genuinely curious about a source. That&#x27;s also the problems when half his tweets make the headlines: that skews the information towards what he says rather than what he does, and given the votes of this election I tend to think that (at least the perception of) the latter is better than the former.')
