I&#x27;m not saying your wrong but we can talk about the failings of our country without whataboutism to &quot;defend it&quot;.<p>Capitalism is too broad a concept to boil it down to a short description. My argument is about what Capitalism lead to the greed and moral failings of our country. Capitalism is so en-grained in the American way of life its hard to separate the two. Our style of government lead to more and more greedy people doing more and more underhanded things to make a profit and thus in turn maintaining that profit. America is pointed out as the shining example of how successful Capitalism is as a form of government and its not.<p>You point to the failings of the USSR to protect its environment and ignore our own. Yes we have an EPA which is a good step, but our form of government enabled private citizens and corporations to essentially purchase the ability to pollute. To put chemicals in our food and water that was cheap, but necessarily safe. Our country is failing just as poorly at protecting its citizens health and environment as the USSR. We just have the ability to point to the EPA and say we are trying harder so that&#x27;s good enough. Its not,<p>The EPA has refused to add a single chemical to its watch list for public water since the clean water act of 1972. Our water standards are based on science that is almost 50 years old. If you think its because in those 50 years we haven&#x27;t learned anymore about health, then i have a bridge to sell you. Its because updating those standards would cost money and not have any direct monetary benefit in return, because we live in a country&#x2F;exist in a form of government that prioritizes profit over the health of its own citizens.')
