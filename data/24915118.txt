Previously an unmistakably strong RED icon, I do understand the value of it looking like all the other apps and that I really should learn to memorise the locations of my app rather than expect icons to look the same over time.<p>And oh, how I love how they packed MEET into my Gmail app, so that I don&#x27;t have to have that as a separate application. It saves a lot of time, because I start those all the time on my phone, and where better to do so than from my email? I also love the real estate it takes at the bottom of my email list, as I don&#x27;t like that being used for the primary purpose of my email app - which used to be to display emails. My phone&#x27;s display was too large anyway.<p>Truly a _S_OLID effort by the Alphabet soup team.<p>(EDIT: I did notice that hidden away in the settings, under each account, there&#x27;s the option to toggle this feature off. I&#x27;m glad they made it intuitive should I ever decide to do so, and I&#x27;m sure I wouldn&#x27;t have missed it the first time I looked for such an option, should I have desired to do so, and the 2nd as well).')
