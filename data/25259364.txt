Item(by='touisteur', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606772391, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25258991, text='Ricky Gervais gave a mocking lesson-giving turn on this <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;m.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=L3dxMGzt5mU" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;m.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=L3dxMGzt5mU</a> , and I think there&#x27;s comedy in their twitter&#x2F;social-media reach that we don&#x27;t get to experience. They are on the other side of the firehose, and their experience doesn&#x27;t relate to ours.<p>It really must be demoralising to see how frail our ears have become. Or have always been? I mean listening to some Carlin&#x27;s stand-up can be a bit hard for younger generations (I sometimes wince) and some of his jokes might not be tell-able today... Especially not at work. Or on the bus. Or on the street. Or in front of your mum. Or that friend that doesn&#x27;t want to hear &#x2F;some&#x2F; words (and you know the words)... Well OK you might still want to tell the joke without believing any of its content. Except, someone might be recording. Filming. OK so no more racist&#x2F;sexist&#x2F;transphobe&#x2F;fatshaming&#x2F;flatearthmocking jokes.<p>I deeply regret the validation we give to &#x27;just transgression without humor&#x27; humor when we rage about it. The best solution to bad jokes is just no one laughing. Silence is a powerful motivator for a comedian to improve... And the people you want to reach are the ones laughing, not the ones making the joke. And making them feel horrible about a laugh they had might not be the way to reach social justice.')
