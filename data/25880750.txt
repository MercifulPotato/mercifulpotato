I now live in Berlin, which is in the middle of an area the Germans consider unsuitable to agriculture due to poor soil quality.<p>And yet in Israel people managed to employ advanced ag tech to grow food in areas with much worse soil than Berlin-Brandenburg &amp; with less abundant water reserves (and they also did this back when Israel was a much poorer country than Germany). In fact aside from some grains import Israel is mostly self-sufficient in food production (Germany is not despite being less densely populated and having much better natural conditions for growing food because it is more expensive than importing food).<p>If need be these areas can produce food if the climate is suitable, it will just not be as cheap as the food we can now get (but then again ag technology continues to advance and economies of scale kick in). Anecdotally as a consumer groceries in Israel cost about 2-3x as much as in Germany but both countries suffer a lot more from obesity than hunger.')
