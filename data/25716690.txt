It&#x27;s a very pessimistic argument and assumes that people don&#x27;t use the saved energy for productive endeavors. The fact that civilization has prospered indicates to me that they do in fact simply find other things to spend their mental energy on. Do you want Einstein spending mental energy on picking his next restaurant or solving the fundamental questions of the universe?<p>edit: Much has been written about how the most productive people aggressively remove having to make trivial choices from their lives. To the point of having fifty copies of a single set of clothes.')
