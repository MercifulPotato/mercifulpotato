I can&#x27;t disagree with anything you&#x27;ve said. I do remember 2006 very well and the &quot;I landed under sniper fire&quot; from Hillary.<p>I agree Bill Clinton was outside of it, but he got in and they started their entrenchment. Prescott Bush spent decades preparing for his son to become the president, but it was his long term intention.<p>Trump started planning this in the 80s and his extended family are also much easier to listen to and less ... squawking. There&#x27;s a good chance they&#x27;ll rise despite all of this as another political family like the Kennedys.<p>Kennedy wasn&#x27;t corrupt enough, and got taken out by his own people, and somehow to this day over half of the world believe it was just one guy with an axe to grind.<p>The actual undercarriage of what is going in is deep and complex, held by powerful people who will rip each other, and the peasants, in order to maintain their control and power.<p>Just look at how people on here are ripping at each other, accusing every Trump supporter as being a Nazi or fascist. I think back to the quote from Wargames about thermonuclear war .. the only way to win, is not to play.')
