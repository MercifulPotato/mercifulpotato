It is too broad, and doesn&#x27;t capture the nuances of this. The free internet is the only &quot;platform&quot; that you have any chance to control. It&#x27;s not perfect, but it&#x27;s the only one we have (there&#x27;s also amateur radio). If you want a platform, get a co-located web server in a jurisdiction that won&#x27;t unplug you due to your views.')
