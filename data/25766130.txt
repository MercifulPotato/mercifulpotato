Pat is very much an engineer. If you ever wanted an engineer as your CEO, then that&#x27;s Pat. That comes with some goods and some not-so-greats. Pat isn&#x27;t very inspiring, at least not when he first became CEO. But I always got the feeling that he genuinely love engineers and is more comfortable around them than anything else. I once hosted a fun little engineering challenge (building bridges out of spaghetti). It wasn&#x27;t a fancy event -- just a bunch of engineers having fun. Pat actually agreed to come by to hand out the awards at the end. I left VMware partly because I&#x27;ve been there so long and partly because I wasn&#x27;t excited about it anymore. I felt its best days were behind it. Well, Pat proved me wrong by a wide margin. If no-nonsense engineering is what you need to win, then Pat is the right person for the job. It&#x27;s a good day for Intel I think.')
