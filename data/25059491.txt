Let&#x27;s say the maximum is 6 years, in keeping with tradition<p>- The Senate appoints the President and cabinet directly, instead of using the Electoral College first and then approving the Cabinet. Since the Senate is now national, it&#x27;s essentially national popular vote for President.<p>- The House remains on a 2 year limit, but add more Reps (1 per 100K people is good) and do things like Instant Runoff Voting and multimember constituencies.<p>- For the House districts, have the Federal Election Commission draw up plans andâ€¦<p>- Have the plans approved by citizen juries. It&#x27;s crazy to just send one random person to congress and expect them to do well, but it&#x27;s not crazy to ask random 100 people from across the country to come together to give oversight to bureaucrats. We have 12 random people give oversight to criminal trials already. Juries are good at oversight.<p>- We could also use citizen juries for some Supreme Court stuff, but that might be harder because the cases end up being very technical at that level.')
