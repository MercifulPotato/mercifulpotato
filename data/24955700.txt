Item(by='mehrdadn', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604183010, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24955326, text='First, it&#x27;s far from clear to me he&#x27;s <i>lied</i> (which is not equivalent to saying he didn&#x27;t). So far as I see, it may well have been that (a) he honestly forgot there were some old lines still remaining that they didn&#x27;t rewrite, (b) or he did know that, but he felt any vestiges of old code were insignificant and not enough to justify changing the sentence. If he rewrote like ~99% of the code, you might <i>disagree</i> about whether the remaining &lt;1% was insignificant or not to justify calling it a &quot;complete&quot; rewrite, but <i>surely</i> you can also understand this might not be an instance of bad faith, but rather an instance of merely having a different threshold for &quot;complete&quot; than you?<p>Second, let&#x27;s just assume he had bad faith and lied about it being a complete rewrite; I don&#x27;t know, but for all I know he might have. It&#x27;s possible he&#x27;s been trolled a lot by other people recently (sounds like he has, though I haven&#x27;t checked the history) and he thought lying would get people to stop. Or maybe he&#x27;s an awful guy. I have no idea. In any case, unless they had a dependency with a viral license, have distributed something based on that dependency, and that dependency&#x27;s license required them to provide source code with it... they simply don&#x27;t have any obligation to provide you with any source code, in which case you still wouldn&#x27;t get anywhere, right? Are there such grounds for you being entitled to the source code at all? If there are, it seems this should be mentioned explicitly in the beginning so he understands he has an actual obligation he&#x27;s not already fulfilling?<p>&gt; 2. Do you mean me (Christian Bundy)? I asked a question because I was unhappy seeing the maintainer lie to one of my friends about the &quot;complete rewrite&quot;. Lies bad, truth good.<p>In (2) you&#x27;re referring to (b) in my post, right? I actually <i>didn&#x27;t</i> mean you (I meant everyone else on the internet who just piled onto your post afterward), because I didn&#x27;t think that&#x27;s something you had control over, but <i>now</i> I&#x27;m seeing you&#x27;re the one who specifically went out of your say to submit the post on HN too... which is <i>begging</i> for people to pile on and cancel this guy because you (or I guess your friend) didn&#x27;t get the source code you wanted. All because you (who apparently aren&#x27;t even the person who was wronged?) are upset because you <i>think</i> he lied to one of your <i>friends</i>, and you <i>think</i> contributors who <i>might</i> be ones to have a stake in this <i>might</i> also be on your side and <i>might</i> want you (whom they don&#x27;t even know) to seek vigilante justice on their behalf? Isn&#x27;t this how Twitter justice works...? Do we really need this on HN? Is this kind of public cancellation really making the world a better place?')
