I didn&#x27;t check mine, and found the battery charger had failed at about 1 am when my wife had a flight out that morning. That was fun.<p>(We don&#x27;t have everything on the generator, so it&#x27;s not as effective as yours, our utility wiring is actually pretty fragile, and our well pump is one of the things not on the generator, buying a portable genrator for that seems to have helped, but I did have to roll it out a week ago)')
