Pretty sure all IPS display are at least okay.<p>The cheapest displays are TN because it&#x27;s cheaper to manufacture, sadly that technology has very bad angle of vision, move a feet to the left and another feet and you&#x27;ll see the image looking different, it also has a more limited rendering of colors. Not great.<p>Typically you realize how bad a screen is when you try to calibrate it (looking at a few pictures is enough, no need for expensive equipment). With a really shitty screen, you will notice that the display literally cannot render half the colors.<p>For example looking at a picture with 16 shades from pure white to pure black, the 4 first levels of white look the same.<p>Typically that&#x27;s the part where you have to adjust brightness&#x2F;contrast until it&#x27;s showing a difference. If you have a really shitty screen, there&#x27;s no settings where half the colors will render. The example above being extremely skewed toward bright white will slowly destroy your eyes, being too bright and removing details&#x2F;contrasts.')
