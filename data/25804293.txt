Such a commonly used feature, hidden behind shaking your phone? That’s not even an interaction. They’ve slightly improved it with three-finger swipe to the side, which at least is a bit like a gesture, but again completely undiscoverable. Apparently under no circumstances will we just be getting an undo button.<p>It’s not just Apple, though: there’s a whole page of useful settings for Instagram’s Hyperlapse app. Guess how you open it? You tap the screen four times with four fingers. Why on earth did they build and maintain a settings page and then hide it like that?')
