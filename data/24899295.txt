(pre-covid) asking us to cancel a family trip to her home country because her youtube channel says the police are just randomly shooting americans for being american<p>2. Refusing to go outside at all for months post-covid. In the first few weeks she tried to convince us not to even open the windows!<p>3. Having family members send us HCQ as a &quot;just in case&quot; even though we literally are more cautious about covid than probably 99% of households<p>4. Trying to convince us that she should take the HCQ as a preventative even though she goes outside the house for maybe an hour a week and takes no significant risk of exposure<p>Anyways, I think the easy part is avoiding discussions about politics and world events. Ultimately it matters very little to me why she thinks democrats are evil and which boogeyman she thinks secretly controls the world&#x27;s finances. It becomes problematic when it leads to irrational behavior. I&#x27;m concerned what her youtube channel is going to convince her to believe or to do should Joe Biden win the election.')
