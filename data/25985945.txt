Also, the investors in LTCM still lost a ton of money.<p>But LTCM is still a great prototypical example of &quot;vacuuming up nickels in front of a steamroller&quot;, i.e. these traders can take these positions (LTCM was focused on merger arbitrage IIRC) that seem like a license to print money, except they invariably can lead to some giant risk blowup. And when they fail, they have a knack for taking down the whole financial system with them so the government has to get involved (even if it is just cajoling other bankers in a room) to bail them out.')
