Inequality can be mitigated, but it canâ€™t be eliminated, especially durably.<p>&gt; Would that be a better society considering your arguments?<p>That&#x27;s really an objectively unanswerable question for many reasons. You can&#x27;t really measure, on more than an ordinal scale, individual utility, or aggregate it, except by interposing non-objective judgements. Would it be better for lots of people currently above the poverty line? Maybe, depends how far below the poverty line the equal society was.')
