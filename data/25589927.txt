Item(by='justicezyx', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609393185, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25588289, text='&gt; public transit is unreliable<p>I read the Power Broker [1] about Robert Moses&#x27; obsession of disallowing public transit in the public lands that under his control. That results miserable comutting for New Yorkers nowadays. Bob mastered the political system in a way that he can do obviously irrational things under public eyes, and without any fallout at the time, until the book was published much later after Bob actually has died.<p>I haven&#x27;t researched extensively in US public transit, but I am inclined to believe that the public transit were handicapped intentionally through the market operators, in collaboration of the political apparatus.<p>I could not see any obvious evidence of this particular event being positive or negative. But, I am more sure that the political system in US is crippled to the point that it&#x27;s not capable of producing long-term positive policy any more.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Power-Broker-Robert-Moses-Fall&#x2F;dp&#x2F;0394720245" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Power-Broker-Robert-Moses-Fall&#x2F;dp&#x2F;039...</a>')
