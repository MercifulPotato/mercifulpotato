People move in&#x2F;out of state, people split time living between multiple states, students may temporarily move states for the school year, cars are frequently purchased in one state and shipped to another, used vehicles auctions redistribute cars all over the place, people pass in&#x2F;out&#x2F;through the state while traveling. All of which ultimately has to be taken into account for the entire lifespan of the vehicle.<p>Even ignoring the cost and complexity of the logistics, the manufacturers will open themselves up to an expensive and drawn out stream of lawsuits litigating every conceivable edge case (such as the above examples). All with little minimal upside for themselves, since right-to-repair primarily harms dealerships and minimally harms manufacturers (since most if not all states make it illegal for auto manufacturers <i>to</i> own dealerships).<p>Plus all of the above leads to higher costs the manufacturers have to bear, which will ultimately get pushed down to dealers&#x2F;consumers. And isn&#x27;t limited to just Massachusetts, due to the ripple effect of increasing overall complexity in their manufacturing&#x2F;distribution&#x2F;sales processes. Which could decrease sales volume across the entire market if everyone went this route, or result in loss of market share if other manufacturers <i>do</i> implement it nationwide and you can&#x27;t maintain competitive pricing.<p>At the end of the day, it&#x27;ll end up going nationwide, because there&#x27;s no real reason not to. And every reason <i>to</i> go nationwide. Auto manufacturers would love to be able to have direct-to-consumer sales, and starving the primary profit stream of dealerships makes that easier to happen. It&#x27;s drastically cheaper - every car rolls off the production lane exactly the same, there&#x27;s no enforcement mechanism to maintain, and no potentially costly class action lawsuits to worry about. \nAll while having a perfectly valid rationale to show they aren&#x27;t deliberately harming the independent dealership model, and are simply complying with their legal requirements as efficiently as feasible.')
