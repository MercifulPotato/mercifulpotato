The law of unintended consequences applies to corrupt officials just like it applies to everybody else. The reason corrupt officials in our current system can avoid those consequences is that they don&#x27;t have to live in the places they govern. That&#x27;s true even of many so-called &quot;local&quot; officials: mayors and city council members often don&#x27;t live in the cities they govern.<p><i>&gt; Not if the local people with power disallow it.</i><p>How are they going to prevent people from leaving? If the only resources they can draw on are local, their power will be too limited.<p>Basically, your picture of &quot;local&quot; seems to be the way &quot;local&quot; works in our current society, which allows localities that are politically favored by higher level governments to draw on resources from those governments. But that&#x27;s not actaully local; it&#x27;s the higher level, non-local governments using the lower-level governments as political tools.')
