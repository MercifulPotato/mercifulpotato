It just looks instant on the app. During the time it takes for your cash to go to rh to dtc to the other end, robinhood has to put up a collateral for some guarantee that the cash for the transaction will exist.<p>Usually this collateral is between 1-3%. Because of how volatile gme is at the moment, dtc upped the percentage to 100%. So for every buy, rh has to put up cash collateral equal to the price of the purchase of gme.<p>Obviously this isn&#x27;t a big deal if gme is at $50. This is a big deal if gme is at $350. This is an even bigger deal if robinhood is doing this for millions of trades a day.<p>The reason these mechanics exist is if you sell your stock, you should be guaranteed to get your money for the stock. Whether that money comes from a user of RH, or RH, or dtc, does not matter. Someone will give you the money for your stock. Therefore, sell trades are not restricted. Buy trades are because they require collateral.<p>Some firms have cash on hand to cover the collateral. That&#x27;s why some firms are letting you buy while others like RH aren&#x27;t. RH paused buying of gme, took out a billion dollar loan and got hundreds of millions from investors, and will now enable buying again now that they have more cash on hand for collateral.<p>Anyone please feel free to correct me on anything. This is my understanding from WeBull&#x27;s CEO.<p>Full video: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;4RS4JIEVyXM" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;4RS4JIEVyXM</a>')
