It&#x27;s not just the language but the codebase and the norms it and its dependencies use.<p>Some TypeScript codebases, the types are usually accurate, but not enough to rely on them, so you still need to do runtime checks in many places. In others, if something says (string|null) then you know with confidence that it is either a string or the null value, nothing more and nothing less.')
