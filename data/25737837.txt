Taibbi&#x27;s claim is there a unified underlying incentive structure that has manifested in emergent behavior across all of the media. Your mental model about tribes is purely incidental: it is tribeless, so the idea of &quot;sides&quot; even coming into it is your own construction. The reason Taibbi uses the tribalist framing to articulate arguments is because it helps readers understand the alternative sub-incentives that lead to different emergent phenomena grounded in the same root incentives.<p>The reason Taibbi&#x27;s explanation should be taken seriously at this point, beyond it&#x27;s intuitive explanatory power and first-principles oriented construction, is because it&#x27;s proven itself quite predictive in the broad strokes of this march towards a civil war, even if it cannot predict the specifics.')
