They could have independent quality reviewers (it works in almost every other industry) and make all contracts with publishers require the refund clauses. Perhaps ms&#x2F;Sony could even sit on the money for a while after release (a few months?) to ensure companies aren’t defunct after a big release. If the game is a dud, the money is refunded.<p>Even if publishers fix critical issues, the stores could have a system of fines for games that aren’t good enough initially. If I buy a $60 game and it’s not acceptably playable until after the first 2 weeks - that’s a 50% refund and I also keep the game.<p>No publisher should get away with pushing a half finished buggy game a few weeks to soon just because the holidays are close. Basically there should be financial incentives in the console stores that always makes it less expensive to slip the release and fix the bugs. L<p>I’d buy the console that did this.')
