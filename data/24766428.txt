The Altaic theory is not really supported by most linguists, and is the author claiming that Japanese and Korean are incredibly easy to learn for English speakers, or that Japanese is incredibly easy to learn if you&#x27;re a Korean speaker and vice versa?<p>Regardless, interesting blog. Would be great as a first draft to expand upon with more examples to make you imagine what it would feel like.')
