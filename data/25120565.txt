Item(by='salamimonger', descendants=None, kids=[25120660], score=None, time=1605590991, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25120092, text='&gt;Let&#x27;s hear some specific predictions of things that the Trump administration has been behind that you believe those who opposed him will support if the Biden administration does them.<p>This is explicitly making it about Trump, when I did not mention him at all. Perhaps he lives rent-free in your head? Seems to be the case for many people.<p>What I said, could be said the same of Trump in 2016. His constituents voted him in because x, y, and z reasons. And then he proceeded to backtrack on them because of &quot;reasons&quot;. And his supporters then shifted, instead of calling him out for his betrayal of their ideals. I argue that the same will happen again with Biden. Too many people voting against Trump, rather than for someone they actually wanted, who could uphold their ideals. Biden is heavily entrenched within the establishment government. How could anyone expect otherwise? He should know better than anyone what is possible and what isn&#x27;t possible, yet he&#x27;d campaign on those things anyway and people eat it up.')
