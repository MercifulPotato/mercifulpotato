CentOS also gives you that, just without the support contract, which many organizations just replace with their own capable admins. People may want the stability but don&#x27;t otherwise benefit from the pricing model.<p>What actually never made sense to me was Red Hat officially embracing the CentOS project. A free clone will inevitably happen because that&#x27;s exactly what the GPL intended. Red Hat has made lots of money by adding incremental work to a large body of other people&#x27;s work. They make their money delivering value to their customers who do value faster patches and support, but the source code must remain free for everyone else. I&#x27;m not really sure what anyone, Red Hat or the community, got out of CentOS current &quot;official&quot; status.')
