I&#x27;ve been wanting to tinker more with ARM I guess.  I&#x27;m thinking there&#x27;s probably a sweet spot halfway between NUC and RPi.  In a small board configuration, the amount of cool embedded things you could do would be interesting.<p>Edit:\nTo add, apparently other people desire such a thing.  All my searches for such a device only lead to other people asking the same question, and sometimes being told to buy a NUC just the same.')
