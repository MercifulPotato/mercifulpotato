Although i wonder if it would really make a difference - would the site operator notice such a mild UI change. After all, if they were paying attention they would already have monitoring for cert expiry.<p>&gt; You couldn&#x27;t think of expiration dates for things that aren&#x27;t at the extreme? Maybe for things whose gravity is a little bit more comparable to visiting a website than, say, crossing an international border?<p>Passports are a credential, so are certificates. Generally expiry dates are strictly enforced on credentials. Same thing applies to driver licenses, health cards, etc.')
