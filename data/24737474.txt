It seems plausible, but a lot of COW systems optimize for the case where there is only 1 reference and modify in-place. I don&#x27;t MMAP much, but it would be nice to know if Linux doesn&#x27;t do the optimization I think is possible.<p>In this particular case, I would hope it only copies to memory from disk. If only one program is accessing a file, I would expect the &quot;copy&quot; of copy-on-write to be the copy to memory.')
