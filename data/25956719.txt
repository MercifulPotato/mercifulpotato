I&#x27;ve seen people involved in a few.<p>In conspiracies, people keep secrets. Ergo, there&#x27;s a poor mapping between actual conspiracies and conspiracy theories. People are speculating with no evidence. On the other hand, the conspiracies I&#x27;ve seen, you haven&#x27;t heard of, and you probably won&#x27;t.<p>The CIA is quite literally the US government covert agency set up to meddle in foreign affairs. It&#x27;s raison d&#x27;Ãªtre is to:<p>1. Collect covert intelligence for the US<p>2. Undermine enemies of the US &#x2F; support friends of the US<p>A vague statement like &quot;The CIA is involved in conspiracies&quot; or even slightly less vague &quot;The CIA lies and sometimes vilifies people&quot; are almost vacuously true. That&#x27;s literally what a covert government agency is designed to do.<p>A conspiracy theory is much more specific. &quot;The CIA assassinated [leader] on [date] by [some action that looked like an accident] in order to [favorable outcome].&quot; Most of those, with blanks filled in, are paranoid nonsense. If the CIA is doing it&#x27;s job, I&#x27;ll never find out about whom it assassinated or why. On the other hand, a blanket statement like &quot;The CIA sometimes engages in assassinations&quot; is obviously true. We have plenty of records from times the CIA slipped up.<p>As far as associating people with crazy by associating conspiracy theories with them, we&#x27;re not even at the level of CIA. We&#x27;re at the level of municipal politics, divorce cases, executive battles, and corporate PR smear campaigns.<p>If the CIA isn&#x27;t involved in conspiracies, where are my tax dollars going?')
