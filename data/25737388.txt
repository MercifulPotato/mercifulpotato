They rely on motorists yielding to cyclists, or cyclists yielding to motorists.  This causes problems when cyclists believe they have pedestrian style right-of-way when there&#x27;s no law supporting that notion and it&#x27;s not possible to see a cyclist moving at 20 to 30 feet per second in time to yield to them as they&#x27;re about to cross the path of the motorist.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;i&#x2F;status&#x2F;654674368597852161" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;i&#x2F;status&#x2F;654674368597852161</a>')
