So much work went into this!\nWe don&#x27;t understand how we got here in the first place. It&#x27;s so big! Look at all this legacy code and technical debt! There is no way we or anybody else could rewrite this in Java let alone C++ in any useful time frame! We sunk decades of work into this monstrosity!!<p>The text boils down to a &quot;time to market&quot; argument. I find that surprising because you&#x27;d think for high speed trading correctness is more important than time to market.')
