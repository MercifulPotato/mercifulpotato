It requires expertise in everything from physical construction to thermal engineering to networking. It requires significant amounts of capital. It takes months to years to complete.<p>compete with who? If you simply want to save thousands of dollars every month, start with a single 1&#x2F;4 cabinet at a colo and build up from there as one&#x27;s needs grow. There is no need for the extreme expense view you state. One $8K server placed in a colo pays for itself in two weeks!<p>I am only discussing people that require computation for what they do. If you&#x27;re just &quot;showing a web page&quot; get out of this discussion. I&#x27;m talking about people that require computation above some bloated react framework displaying pretty interfaces for consumer time wasting.')
