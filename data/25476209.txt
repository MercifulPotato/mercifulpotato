(MCAS existing in the first place, it didnt have reliable sensors, pilots were not instructed on it)<p>How would you react if a loved one died due to boeing or any company greed?<p>Cynic in me is hoping this is only allowed to fly in the US until it proves safe and boeing execs and employees are forced on every damn flight.')
