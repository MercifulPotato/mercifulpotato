It&#x27;s generally easier to break imperative code into fractal-like steps, sub-steps, sub-sub-steps etc. D&#x2F;F just can&#x27;t be dissected fractal-ish like that nearly as easy. It&#x27;s just a magic property of imperative code that&#x27;s hard to replicate in other paradigms. It&#x27;s why imperative still dominates after 50+ years of D&#x2F;F attempts.<p>Someone once said that D&#x2F;F makes it easier to express what you intend, but imperative makes it easier to figure out what&#x27;s <i>actually</i> happening. One improves writing, the other improves reading (or at least debugging).')
