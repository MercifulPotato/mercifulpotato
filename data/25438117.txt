Back in the day Google relied on DMOZ (and perhaps relies on Wiki a little nowadays, WRT knowledge entities). Search (and social) rely on signals to indicate that something is of relevance... you&#x27;re sort of implying that the monopolies and their single perspectives on how information should be ordered is satisfactory for us right now.<p>Sometimes there&#x27;s 10&#x27;s, 100&#x27;s or 1000&#x27;s of pages&#x2F;sites that are relevant to what we are searching for. All I&#x27;d say is that if we diversified the way in which we search&#x2F;discover new information a little bit more, there&#x27;s less reliance on a platform or a single algorithm- to me that sounds healthier.<p>It is totally worth remembering that as much as the likes of Google and FB control a huge share of browsing time and clicks, their algos don&#x27;t make them the arbiters of truth and information discovery. Sounds quite daft to say it but that is pretty much what the reality is of the modern web- if the portals don&#x27;t want to rank you, you aren&#x27;t seen.')
