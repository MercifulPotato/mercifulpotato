For your Desktop Debian is not good, but bearable because of the variety of packages. Fedora still the best, or Arch if you want to break your machine every few months. Some even like Ubuntu or Mint, but those should be ignored nowadays.<p>But if you need a stable and secure server Debian or Ubuntu are a joke. There are no engineers with Debian, only lawyers and community managers.\nThere your can use RHEL, Oracle Linux (with dTrace and ZFS), or SLES. Those do have the experts.
