While it could be argued that the &quot;cloud provider&quot; space is an oligopoly (though I would <i>not</i> argue that), simply deciding to not serve a specific business, even as group, is not an antitrust issue. No business has a &quot;right to service&quot;.<p>Antitrust is more concerned with anti-competitive behaviors: pricing-fixing, group boycotts[0], buying a competitor with the express purpose of removing competition, etc. Amazon and Parler are not in the same market - they are not <i>competing</i> for anything. Antitrust is not going to be a fruitful legal avenue.<p>If Amazon were somehow influencing Parler&#x27;s ability to &quot;do it themselves&quot; (e.g. preventing a seller from providing them with boxes), then yes, there may be some legal standing.<p>[0] Look this one up. It&#x27;s not what you are thinking.')
