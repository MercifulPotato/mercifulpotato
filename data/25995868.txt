I could try to sue the website for violating my copyright by distributing my content without my permission.<p>Post-DMCA, if someone posts content that I created to a website, I can file an un-ignorable DMCA complaint with the website, and there are defined timelines and processes that must be followed if the website does not want to take on liability for distributing my content.<p>It&#x27;s unfortunate that big content owners abuse the system, but it&#x27;s unfair to say that there are no benefits for small content owners.')
