My view is that governments should have some general moderation rules, no death threats, no CP, ect. Sites should be able to have stricter moderation rules, no claiming that Obama was born in Kenya.<p>I personally prefer smaller communities like forums such as this one, slack groups, or other forums, compared to Facebook or twitter.<p>I am not sure how a W3C standard for tagging a URI comment would work. Aren&#x27;t a lot of URIs not even opinion&#x2F;fact based things? Like if my uri is a product on Amazon or a piece of sheet music there wouldn&#x27;t be any rebuttals right? But idk seems interesting, would like to see if it worked.')
