Try it.<p>I don&#x27;t mean take your phone anyway but don&#x27;t use it. That is not the same thing.<p>The value in this experiment is not to have your phone to fall back on.  Initially you feel anxiety, but it soon becomes quite liberating. Having to look at road signs to navigate, relying on personal interaction or reading notices to find things out etc etc. Sounds old fashioned but it improves my quality of life when I do it.')
