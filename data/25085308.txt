I&#x27;ve had the opposite experience of this author. In my 10 years are a software developer we&#x27;ve made amazing strides towards making sense out of the software itself and the data flowing through my systems.<p>Honestly I feel like we&#x27;ll have a decent base to our craft in another decade or two.<p>The biggest problem I do see in software is that people with no software design experience often drive the most important software design decisions.
