Once a Japanese bargain-bin staple, people started buying it for $60 a pop in the United States.<p>The popularity of the song went as far as Warning Music reissuing an anniversary edition of the album in Japan and recording a music video for the song, both in 2019 [1] yet for some reason, they refuse to stream the song outside of Youtube.<p>I don&#x27;t get it. Youtube pays the least for streams, and there is an obvious and known to Warner Music interest abroad ... so why not release it world wide on apple and spotify?<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=XMmUXamntPI" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=XMmUXamntPI</a>')
