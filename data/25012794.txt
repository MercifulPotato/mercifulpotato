Dear ImGUI is a few files that generate a vertex list. It then as a bunch of &quot;examples&quot; that show how to render that list with various APIs. Any slightly competent graphics programmer could take that vertex list and render it in any API. Those Examples are not Dear ImGUI. They are just examples.<p>This is the code<p><pre><code>    for each command list\n      upload vertex data\n      upload index data\n      set scissor\n      bind texture\n      draw\n</code></pre>\nThat&#x27;s it! Adapt that to any API, whatever your using<p>Because it&#x27;s an example and because so many unexperienced programmers use it they assume it&#x27;s some official part of the library. It&#x27;s not.')
