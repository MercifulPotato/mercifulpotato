That&#x27;s &quot;still sick since I had it back in March&#x2F;April&quot;.<p>(It hasn&#x27;t been around for a year so nothing can be said about that timescale yet.)<p>That&#x27;s significant enough that public health officials are talking openly about it as a concern, so it&#x27;s not just a few isolated anecdata.<p>There are some reports suggesting neurological impairment.  Along with observed blood changes (thickening), which is concerning regarding long term damage for rational reasons.  If that turns out to be true, that sort of damage tends to never completely recover.  Rather you learn to adapt and live with it.')
