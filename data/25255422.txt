Consider the classic NP problem of the traveling salesman problem.<p>&quot;[Modern heuristic and approximation algorithms] can find solutions for extremely large problems (millions of cities) within a reasonable time which are with a high probability just 2â€“3% away from the optimal solution.&quot; [0]<p>When close enough is enough, NP problems can often be solved in P time, and I suspect this is one of those cases. For crypto however, close enough is not enough.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Travelling_salesman_problem#Heuristic_and_approximation_algorithms" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Travelling_salesman_problem#He...</a>')
