Item(by='toast0', descendants=None, kids=[24944463, 24944421], score=None, time=1604077214, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24944020, text='I haven&#x27;t gone through this article, but I&#x27;ve read several incident reports from testing in Mountain View and seen several test vehicles driving around in that area.<p>Waymo cars are often unnaturally cautious, which is usually a factor when they get rear-ended. Ex: vehicle behind expected waymo car to turn left when there was an opening large enough for it, but it didn&#x27;t.<p>These are probably worse because there&#x27;s a safety driver who is probably actively engaged. If you can see the (apparent) driver looks actively engaged, you&#x27;ll expect them to see the gap, and go for it. If the car had no one in the driver seat (or they were looking at screens&#x2F;passengers), you might be more cautious.<p>Added: of course, that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s waymo&#x27;s responsibility; this type of collision occurs with human drivers too, and it&#x27;s the driver to the rear&#x27;s fault, but either driver could have avoided the error: the front driver by going when it was safe to do so, as expected; and the rear driver by waiting to confirm the front driver actually went. Sometimes it&#x27;s tricky because the front driver releases the brakes and then reapplies them; the rear driver saw the brake lights turn off and moves forward while watching oncoming traffic, but doesn&#x27;t see the brakes were reapplied.<p>Added later: I read the verge article. It sounds like Waymo is working on not getting rear-ended, so they acknowledge there are things they can do (and that, in many cases, the safety driver was able to do).')
