Some people have parents that are abusive. Unsure if you&#x27;re looking for why some people do want to move out as soon as possible but that&#x27;s a main one for a lot of people. I know a lot of college adults cannot afford to go to university while having a part time job and living alone. Sucks for them if their parents are abusive. Not so much if parents are okay.')
