It requires a personal approach tailored to each individual&#x27;s needs based on their upbringing and cultural context.<p>Upbringing and cultural context are certainly heavy influences. But it is totally possible to teach &#x2F; develop critical thinking skills in students. Instead of focusing on memorizing facts &amp; information, we should focus on the techniques used to break down problems, seek evidence, extract alternate readings &amp; motivations, etc. Easy. The problem is this stuff isn&#x27;t taught in school, and if it is, it&#x27;s only brushed over as a particular topic and not part of everything. This stuff needs to be embedded in the core operating system of our citizens.<p>Putting the fate of liberal democracies aside. I believe the economic activity lost from the under development and under capitalization on the potential of our populous is significant.')
