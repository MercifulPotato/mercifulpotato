This is why is has so much resources put into SP campaign with special units, recorded audio and cutscenes.<p>IMO this is why RTS genre really died out - the studios focused too much on eSport aspect and abandoned most of their paying customer base which wasn&#x27;t interested in crazy clickathrons. Multiplayer games are very very loud, but they&#x27;re not the ones paying most of the money.<p>When smaller studios tried to copy Starcraft 2, they usually cut down on singleplayer content and sales tanked with that.')
