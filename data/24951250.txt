Them posting in a thread about pain, along with saying they’ll read research if people have it - even “If you have research, fine, I&#x27;ll read it. One day. Maybe months from now.” - says they are open to it. You have no idea if them answering would add to the discussion - quite arrogant of you. Not sure why you’re coddling. My asking questions isn&#x27;t the same as offering unsolicited advice.')
