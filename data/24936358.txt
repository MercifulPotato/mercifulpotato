Then I just started thinking about how to formalize mechanical things. One of the very things I remember is coming to the conclusion that all motions of a machine can be implemented as a combination of linear and rotational motions (and that&#x27;s where the two things that move on mockmechanics, the track and the wagon, come from), but I don&#x27;t know if that is true. But I don&#x27;t really have any prior art, I had a 2d version that didn&#x27;t work years ago but I think I lost it.')
