I did a test drive and liked it more than I thought I would.  To me, the throttle response felt immediate and direct, reminiscent of driving a manual-shift car in the correct gear.  You&#x27;re just ALWAYS in the correct gear!<p>That being said, I suspect I&#x27;ll probably do the same as you and keep a fun, old-fashioned ICE roadster in the garage for the occasional spin.')
