They&#x27;re bulky, slow, they kind of do their job, but they&#x27;re not something everybody wants.<p>VR has to get better. The resolution and FOV are terrible. The gameplay paradigms kind of suck because movement is such a pain.<p>AR honestly seems even further away. Pokemon Go and all the other AR trinkets are clunky toys. I can&#x27;t ever see holding up a device for anything other than picturing furniture in a space, and none of these apps even work well.<p>An AR headset outside of industrial&#x2F;military uses is a pipe dream that will rely on miniaturization and being fashionable. Google Glass wasn&#x27;t cool, and nobody is going to wear a bulky HoloLens anywhere. There&#x27;s a lot of work that needs to be done.')
