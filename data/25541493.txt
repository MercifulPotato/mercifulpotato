With PCBWay and JLCPCB making it super cheap and delivered in a few days, it means you don&#x27;t have to worry about mistakes so much.<p>My process is largely:<p>- mock it up with arduino boards<p>- mock it up on a breadboard with straight chips wired up like an Arduino but without all the stuff I don&#x27;t need<p>- make a KiCad design that matches that<p>- make the PCBs, realize I made a few holes the wrong size, make more PCBs<p>- build, test, use<p>- plan to do it without the Arduino parts, but then give up after trying and failing to make Atmel Studio do anything')
