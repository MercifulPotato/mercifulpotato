My issue with IKEA is most of the furniture is not solid wood but chipboard, screws just don&#x27;t hold well in it. Some of their products handle repeated putting apart and together fine, some don&#x27;t. Sometimes people mess up with complex pieces of furniture.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t blame IKEA specifically, any chipboard furniture would be prone to this.')
