Nobody has a magic wand that will prevent that.<p>How should a company respond when they do?<p>Immediately cutting the contract is one option, which will immediately put a lot of people out of work, and may do nothing to change the practices of the supplier.<p>It also may simply give the next supplier leverage.  If there are only a few suppliers, there is only so many times you can simply fire them.<p>On the other hand, giving them a chance to change, and only firing them when they don’t, is a pretty normal practice.')
