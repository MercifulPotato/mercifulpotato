Item(by='triceratops', descendants=None, kids=[24936346], score=None, time=1604003520, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24928034, text='&gt; it is normalizing not conceding.<p>That&#x27;s not what I got at all. I believe the article can be summarized as &quot;If Democrats lose, where do they go from there? They&#x27;ll have to concede that everything they&#x27;ve been saying for the last 4 years doesn&#x27;t matter to the electorate. That would be a crushing blow and very hard to come to terms with&quot;. Which is obviously true when someone&#x27;s entire worldview is shattered. That statement could apply to anyone.<p>Not once does it say &quot;They mustn&#x27;t concede&quot; or &quot;It would be totally fine if they didn&#x27;t concede.&quot;<p>&gt; The Atlantic is a left-leaning publication<p>I feel like you&#x27;re letting your biases creep into your interpretation.')
