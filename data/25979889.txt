It still allows a form of blackmail. Why should the target of defamation have to pay to do this? What happens when most people&#x27;s online reputation is mostly a matter of how much they were willing to pay to a reputation-washing company, and people in the lower economic echelons can&#x27;t afford to play? These kinds of companies already exist, and make as much money burying genuine misdeeds or making up accomplishments as anything else. How is increasing the size and importance of that industry a good thing?')
