This last year I&#x27;ve been grooming a business partner in order to make an attempt at moving up the value chain from &quot;Software Engineer&quot; to &quot;Software Developer&quot; (implying ownership of the results).<p>I believe we have developed a strong process, which puts a Lean spin on rigid PMI-style management. We describe it as moving slowly in the right direction over moving quickly in the wrong one.<p>We are looking to test this process of project management in the real world, possibly even for free, with early adopters willing to provide us quality feedback.<p>I apologise if this is seems spammy, or if this was not the right venue for this request.<p>Sincerely,\n~ Constant Lurker, Occasional Poster')
