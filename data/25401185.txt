I have stability&#x2F;slowdown issues, but I don&#x27;t attribute it to anything more than I&#x27;m a native software&#x2F;device control developer, and often running dodgy, hacked-together tools. I generally have to do a &quot;deep cleaning&quot; of my system once a year or so.<p>I do often have a windowserver hang.<p>I don&#x27;t really use Chrome much (just for testing, or the odd times that a site won&#x27;t work on Safari). Not a big deal for me to rip it out.<p>If it were a tool that I use all the time, though, I might be more comfortable with a posting that had a bit more detail.')
