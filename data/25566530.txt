No matter how many points I make, musicians do like Spotify less than prior solutions, and musicians have a really hard time turning Spotify into a living. I was really only arguing against some causes for that observation (specifically, allocating a pool of funds based on some &quot;usage&quot; metric seems reasonable), but they&#x27;re not necessarily off the hook. Here are a couple thoughts more in line with what I think your position is:<p>(1) Inflation adjusted, per capita we spend 5x less for music now than we did 20 years ago. Is that because Spotify doesn&#x27;t charge power users more? Is it because users won&#x27;t accept higher rates for song rentals? Regardless of the cause, there&#x27;s less money to distribute.<p>(2) Popular music is more popular than ever. For a variety of reasons (some potentially Spotify-induced -- e.g., it&#x27;s pretty hard for me to get it to recommend somebody who isn&#x27;t soundly leading a genre it thinks I might be interested in), the top X% of artists are more listened to than ever, and that&#x27;s going to exacerbate any other problems for the long tail of artists.<p>(2a) That idea is affecting a lot of industries right now. At some point in recent decades it was easy to be the best &lt;thing&gt; in your local small town or group of peers and get all the business. Plenty of formerly in-person industries are now competing globally though. E.g., I would have a hard time recommending the best ML practitioner in my hometown as a teacher rather than just taking Andrew Ng&#x27;s courses. I&#x27;m not sure how that&#x27;s going to play out in general, but if the top 1% of the population in any field can make everything we want&#x2F;need then the idea of having to work for a living might need to be revisited? Maybe we&#x27;ll eventually all transition to biomedical research when nothing else is scarce? In any event, in the short term a lot of professions are being disrupted.')
