The ask in Chicago falls below the bid in New York, so you buy for $12.25 in Chicago and sell for $12.27 in New York until there is either nobody willing to sell for $12.25 in Chicago or nobody willing to pay $12.27 in New York anymore. Which happens almost immediately, so whoever is fastest gets the money.<p>That means you want to be sitting right on both of the exchanges, but also that you want the fastest possible link between New York and Chicago.')
