Item(by='dane-pgp', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610997597, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25824910, text='&gt; haphazardly leaking to the press from HK prior to obtaining asylum seems to be out of character.<p>His original plan, supposedly[1], was to remain in HK and fight extradition to the US.  It wouldn&#x27;t have taken the US government long to notice he was missing from his job and had travelled to Hong Kong without approval, so it was not particularly haphazard for him to start sharing his story openly as soon as he was in HK.<p>&gt; had contact with actors who had the knowledge and contacts to plan such a ruse in advance.<p>It&#x27;s not clear how the deal with Russia was brokered, but it&#x27;s possible that the Beijing government didn&#x27;t want to sour relations with the US by letting him stay in HK, as reported by the New York Times[2]:<p>&gt; “Behind the door there was definitely some coordination between Hong Kong and Beijing,” said Jin Canrong, professor of international relations at Renmin University in Beijing.<p>That also makes sense of the ridiculous story about HK rejecting the US arrest warrant request due to the US getting Snowden&#x27;s name wrong.[3]<p>Having to arrange travel, on short notice, from HK to a country that could preserve Snowden&#x27;s safety from US capture, and meet with approval from Beijing, would severely limit his options, even if there were no other concerns, and it is possible that assurances were given to Snowden about the possibility of onward travel, which were later broken.  It would certainly have been unwise for Snowden to publicly call out that he had been tricked and betrayed by Putin.  Instead, he claims that the US cancelled his passport to deliberately trap him in Moscow, so they could portray him as a Russian spy[4], which also seems to match what we know.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Edward_Snowden#Hong_Kong" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Edward_Snowden#Hong_Kong</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2013&#x2F;06&#x2F;24&#x2F;world&#x2F;asia&#x2F;china-said-to-have-made-call-to-let-leaker-depart.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2013&#x2F;06&#x2F;24&#x2F;world&#x2F;asia&#x2F;china-said-to-...</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.news.com.au&#x2F;technology&#x2F;hong-kong-says-us-documents-got-edward-snowdens-middle-name-wrong&#x2F;news-story&#x2F;08566de6003a0d99ee21f088705fcf15" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.news.com.au&#x2F;technology&#x2F;hong-kong-says-us-documen...</a><p>[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Edward_Snowden#Russia" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Edward_Snowden#Russia</a>')
