Another interesting one is the smalldatetime, and the biggest annoyance the division to varchar and nvarchar -- the n-variants of cource using ucs2 to store the data.<p>This only changed in the 2019 version, where one can use varchar to store utf8 data with a special collation.<p>Still prefer mssql over mysql, any day.')
