The simple reason is that the numbers just don&#x27;t work out. They&#x27;d have to charge a lot per article and have people pay for a lot of them to break even with the current subscription or ad-supported model, and that&#x27;s not going to happen. And even if they do, there would just be too much day-to-day variance in sales. The reason subscriptions are popular is that businesses like a steady, predictable stream of revenue.<p>What the newspapers need is something like ASCAP that can act as a single revenue management entity for microtransactions.  What no one wants is to have 30 news subscriptions, and so what actually happens is everyone has ~zero news subscriptions.  It&#x27;s happening with video now too as Disney+, HBO, Prime, Netflix, etc. are each fighting over limited monthly subscriptions to segmented markets as opposed to Spotify, Pandora, etc. being gateways to one large market.<p>I don&#x27;t know the details of how or why ASCAP has managed to do for the music industry what pretty much no other industry has been able to achieve.  ASCAP isn&#x27;t even exclusively licensed.')
