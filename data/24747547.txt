Your approach either requires being able to memory map the CSV data or storing the CSV data in memory. And to be honest, it&#x27;s not clear to me that your approach would end up being faster anyway. There&#x27;s a lot of overhead buried in there, and it sounds like it&#x27;s at least two passes over the data in common cases. And in cases where there are line breaks in the data, your approach will perform very poorly I think.')
