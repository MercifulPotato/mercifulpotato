The colors inside the line are distorted in a regular pattern: whites are always pinkish-purple, blues are a bit greenish, greens are only a bit lighter, greys do not change at all. This is why I am using dark theme on MacOS and all websites.<p>I&#x27;ve consulted repair services and they are convinced it&#x27;s the LCD matrix issue and there is no way to replace the matrix without replacing the entire display itself, which costs about 700 USD. At the moment, I cannot afford the repair.<p>I was wondering if there is software that can provide a temporary solution to color distortion. Maybe it can adjust the pixel colors inside the line so that they correspond to the actual rgb value they are supposed to be.<p>I realize it sounds kinda dumb and may not be possible at all but still.')
