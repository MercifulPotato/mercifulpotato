Item(by='vaduz', descendants=None, kids=[25884132], score=None, time=1611418128, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25881804, text='&gt; What uses are you talking about?<p>&gt; As far as I understand it suppliers are generally more than happy for you to use more of their electrons and don&#x27;t particularly care what you use them for.<p>In the UK the law differentiates &quot;domestic customers&quot; using services for domestic purpose (this part is important, commercial use is is excluded!) and, &quot;non-domestic&quot; which includes all others. Domestic customers get to have a fuel price cap and lower climate charge levy thanks to that (though caveats apply, as it does not include &quot;green deals&quot; and fixed terms) but &quot;non-domestic&quot; users do not.<p>Of course you are right: the suppliers would indeed be more than happy to suply you as much of their electrons as you could obtain - at the business rates, not domestic, ideally at one where caps don&#x27;t apply.<p>Take this little innocous line from the British Gas (Centrica) standard rate T&amp;Cs:<p><pre><code>    Supply and supplying: The gas or electricity (or both) we provide, or what we do to provide them. The supply is for you to use entirely or mainly for domestic purposes\n</code></pre>\nThere is a reason for it - a significant enough jump in energy use (say, if you want to charge an EV or put up a multi-GPU bitcoin miner) does trigger an investigation. EV users get a to select a preferential rate [1], suspected commercial users are asked to move to business rates (or show why that shouldn&#x27;t be the case), any detected pot growers get referred to the appropriate police force. The energy company does care - at least so you can pay it more.<p>&gt; &#x27;Smart meters&#x27;<p>I agree that the move to more accurate&#x2F;higher resolution measurement would make it possible to offer pricing that is more reflective of &quot;true cost&quot; - Economy 7 is well known to skew incentives, especially as more and more energy is used outside of traditional &quot;day&quot; hours (and with more and more solar powr in the mix, the overgeneration during the day hours) - but I would not be so optimistic that the consumers are going to be the primary beneficiaries of the change when the dust settles, they never are.<p>As for privacy, well, there is one substantial additional difference: your bandwidth and internet usage patterns generally have to be monitored by your ISP or internet services you visit, whereas a SMETS2 meter will create a nice new 2.4 Ghz network (and 868 Mhz, if&#x2F;when it is available), so sooner or later it will be readable by a local attacker, if it isn&#x27;t already. This is a device that is supposed to last as long as 20 years (though SMETS1 proved this might be a bit optimistic...).<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.britishgas.co.uk&#x2F;GetAQuote&#x2F;tariff-information&#x2F;tariffs&#x2F;standard&#x2F;tariff-rates" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.britishgas.co.uk&#x2F;GetAQuote&#x2F;tariff-information&#x2F;ta...</a>\n[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.britishgas.co.uk&#x2F;GetAQuote&#x2F;tariff-information&#x2F;tariffs&#x2F;electric-drivers-energy-plan-sep-2021&#x2F;tariff-rates" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.britishgas.co.uk&#x2F;GetAQuote&#x2F;tariff-information&#x2F;ta...</a>')
