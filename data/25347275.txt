Hybrid assembly works really great because you&#x27;re combining the best of both worlds, accurate short illumina sequencing and to span the gaps or ambiguous paths across contigs; use the Nanopore longer reads. This is important for use cases such as genomic surveillance of novel changes (e.g., synthetic engineering or horizontal or foreign gene transfer) - as you can&#x27;t rely on a reference genome but need to detect a small change in the genome in an denovo fashion.<p>For use case of iterative synthetic biology design, we find that Illumina short reads don&#x27;t cut it when you&#x27;re doing a high throughput screen sequencing of a pool of say synthetic genes where they have similar barcodes, promoters or gene sequences (you&#x27;re screening for which family of enzyme would work best, so you end up with sometime very homologous sequences). Because Illumina&#x27;s 100-250bp doesn&#x27;t span the entirety of a sequence and having a pool of very similar sequence makes the demultiplexing very tricky. We used Nanopore and the results were mixed given the high error rate of MinION.<p>Just sharing b&#x2F;c it&#x27;s been interesting to hear other people&#x27;s application of Nanopore MinION!')
