I made that image.  I was searching for &#x27;rails documentation&#x27; and accidentally hit the &#x27;Images&#x27; link.  That photo was in the first page of results.  Its presence was so absurd and out of place that I felt like I had to do something with it.  It was made in an era before actual Nazis had re-entered the public dialogue, so it felt like Google Image Search was denigrating Ruby on Rails by including this sort of imagery in the results.<p>Generally speaking, 4chan types read it as an endorsement, which sucks.  More recently, people who are not assholes have <i>also</i> begun to read it as an endorsement, which is even more unfortunate.<p>I had a conversation on Mastodon with the author, where I explained some of this, but the author&#x27;s followers filled my client with Nazi (and more) accusations, and then the author started demanding names of responsible parties and I didn&#x27;t really feel like he was engaging in good faith.  Probably could have gone better, but here we are.<p>This whole sort of thing has led to much confusion, which is why over the years the project home page has sprouted explicit anti-Nazi and Black Lives Matter links.  As far as I am aware, there are no anti-semites (or other brands of racist) involved in the project.<p>and an edit:  A couple of replies here ask the reasonable question:  &quot;why not just remove the image?&quot;  Bluntly, if we removed everything that confused or angered people, it would be a full-time job.  It&#x27;s more likely that we&#x27;ll include some version of the above in order to further clarify our rejection of Nazi values and provide the context that was missing.<p>Besides, if we just delete the damn thing then the next message will be &quot;9front devs are secret Nazis, look at archive.org&quot; -- we&#x27;ve been down this road before with other contentious content.')
