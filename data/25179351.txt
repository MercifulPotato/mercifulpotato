I truly thought that the term was probably centuries old and had something to do with family legacy, old rules being followed to keep tradition, etc.  You live, you learn.<p>I often hear people use the phrase &quot;call a spade a spade&quot;, thinking it&#x27;s saying &quot;if a card shows a spade, call it as a spade (when showing the hand)&quot;, but I&#x27;ve heard for a long time that phrase is also racist.  Not growing up around anyone who ever used that phrase, I would have had no idea.<p>Makes me wonder how many other phrases out there in every day use don&#x27;t have a happy meaning, even though at first glance they might seem innocuous.')
