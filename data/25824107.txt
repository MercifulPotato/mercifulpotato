For example, the model in question could define custom plotting recipes[1] so that you can just call plot() and have it produce something useful.<p>Also, why <i>shouldn&#x27;t</i> dplyr perform comparably against data.table? Seems like there would be no need for a fragmented library ecosystem here if the abstractions the tidyverse is built upon were lower-cost. Moreover, what if my data isn&#x27;t CSV or in a table-like shape at all? &quot;real world&quot; does not mean the same thing across different domains.<p>[1] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.juliaplots.org&#x2F;latest&#x2F;recipes&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.juliaplots.org&#x2F;latest&#x2F;recipes&#x2F;</a>')
