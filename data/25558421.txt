I built this because I wanted to help my classmates use flashcards, because I believe they genuinely help with retention.<p>I started from scratch with a blank html document, and now ~600 hours later I have landed on a nuxt&#x2F;laravel stack. I have learned so much from building out this platform. I have spent a lot of time on the dynamics of public&#x2F;private decks, checkout: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;memordo.com&#x2F;app&#x2F;public&#x2F;244" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;memordo.com&#x2F;app&#x2F;public&#x2F;244</a> to get an idea of the platform.<p>Anyways I would love to hear what you guys think about this. I myself personally use this tool everyday to review flashcards.<p>&#x2F;Morten')
