Shall we chat about Itemsy a bit more?<p>Me: Is your service 50% reliable?<p>Bot: Yes, it is.<p>Me: That&#x27;s rather low. Could you provide a service that is 99.9999999999999% reliable instead?<p>Bot: I&#x27;m sorry, I did not understand that. Could you please try again?<p>Me: Is your service 99.9999999999999% reliable?<p>Bot: I&#x27;m sorry, I didn&#x27;t get that. Could you please try rephrasing it?<p>Me: Is your service 99.99999% reliable?<p>Bot: Yes, it is.<p>Me: Will hackers obtain my password if I give it to you?<p>Bot: No, we don&#x27;t store your password.<p>Me: How long is my password?<p>Me: Your password is 16 characters long.<p>I&#x27;m seeing that you&#x27;re updating the chatbot script&#x2F;dataset as I type some of these questions to fix some bugs. I first asked what the service level agreement was and got nothing, then 15 minutes later I was told to send an e-mail for more information. Now you can&#x27;t ask if the service is 50% reliable and get a &quot;yes&quot; answer!')
