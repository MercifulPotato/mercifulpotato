Yup, like thousands of other weightlifting tracker apps, but mine has one unique feature - you can write code right in the app!<p>It has a powerful exercise editor, where you can define the logic for progressions and deloads using built-in scripting language Liftoscript. Like, you can express that after 3 successful Squat sets you want to increase the weight by 5lb, or decrease weight if you didn’t hit 12 reps total, or anything like that.<p>It also has all those features all other weightlifting trackers have - rest timers, plate calculator, history editing, cloud storage, progress graphs, etc, etc.<p>You don’t have to be weightlifting expert to use it though. It contains a bunch of prebuilt programs (built by using the same built-in scripting language Liftoscript) from <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thefitness.wiki" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thefitness.wiki</a> - IMHO the best starting guide for those who wants to get into weightlifting. So, you could start with “Basic Beginner” routine, and after 3 months of running it switch to GZCLP or 5&#x2F;3&#x2F;1 For Beginners. All you need is to read about the program in the wiki, and then just do whatever app tells you to do, it will handle progressions and deloads properly for you.<p>Thanks for checking it out!')
