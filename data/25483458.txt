If they were using serverless, they would not have needed to hire me.<p>Deployments and system upgrades were very toilsome. The dev lead would spend a few hours deploying new code and we’d only do it around midnight in case there was a problem (our customers were almost entirely US based). I spent a lot of my time automating OS upgrades on the web servers behind our proxy. All of this work would be unnecessary for that small company if they were using serverless.<p>Additionally, as mentioned before, the majority of their traffic was during the day so they could have scaled down automatically at night, cutting costs. Would this be cheaper than running machines 24&#x2F;7? I’m not sure, but I could see why you’d be interested in at least looking into it')
