And the scandal is that Joi knew that he was <i>persona non grata</i> and therefore took steps to hide Epstein&#x27;s funding.  That is unquestionably terrible but in my mind doesn&#x27;t tar the Institute.<p>I&#x27;m certainly not defending (or criticizing) MIT as an institute (there are bigger problems than the dreadful press releases from the publicity office).  But if my understanding is correct, Epstein, while lurid, might not be a useful line of attack.')
