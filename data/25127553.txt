Item(by='mikpanko', descendants=None, kids=[25128070], score=None, time=1605637722, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25125302, text='I have built a similar tool to help me edit my PhD thesis a few years back: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;expresso-app.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;expresso-app.org&#x2F;</a>. It helped me improve my writing but was also picked up by some English teachers to use as a scalable way for providing initial feedback to students, so they can later focus on deeper feedback in their own grading. So I now keep the tool running for the small community.')
