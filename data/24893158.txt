Because that is nonsense.<p>&gt; I really don&#x27;t agree with people comparing ubiquitous global telecom monopolies like Facebook to small businesses and private citizens ...<p>You can compare two things without them being exactly the same in every way. Two things being different doesn&#x27;t mean they shouldn&#x27;t be compared. The point the GP was making is that in this context, the difference between Facebook and HN (or any other small site) is one of scale, not kind. They acknowledge that there may be a need for regulation anyway when they write:<p>&gt; But we as users think about them as public spaces because they facilitate similar things to public spaces in the offline world.<p>Which I think is clearly indicating that Facebook&#x27;s property should not necessarily be treated the same as someone&#x27;s lawn.')
