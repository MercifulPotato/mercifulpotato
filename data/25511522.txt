If that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re after, look at Go instead.<p>But I question the premise.  C++ is a more complicated language, which lets you do certain things much more simply than you could in C.  (It also lets you make bigger messes.)  If you care about doing those kinds of things, then C++ lets <i>your</i> code be simpler, even if the <i>language</i> is more complex.<p>As always, use only the parts you need, and learn enough about them to use them well.')
