If this comment is against the rules I will remove it. There are repeated issues with articles from nautilus on HN:<p>- they are posted by people who submit a lot of nautilus articles<p>- the authors of these articles are often freelance writers (as is the case here) whose job is to write income generating content<p>- nautilus articles are often low quality with little insight, like the article here<p>- nautilus articles seem to frontpage on a regular cadence around weekends<p>- nautilus articles have relatively lower engagement in the comments than other articles')
