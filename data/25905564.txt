Contrary to popular belief, the amount of cars driving over a road doesn&#x27;t really contribute to how often it has to be repaved&#x2F;repaired -- a road&#x27;s wear is almost entirely based on its age. The more cars you have, the less fuel taxes will be to maintain the same amount of road surface.<p>This means that when EVs become more popular, there&#x27;ll be clever ways of taxing them too, whether it&#x27;s an insurance surcharge or an up-front purchase tax or some sort of special &quot;electricity for EVs&quot; tax. This is the honeymoon period when they seem super cheap to drive, but that&#x27;ll change as they replace fuel-powered cars and <i>someone</i> needs to pay for the roads&#x2F;infra.')
