Item(by='ahelwer', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608834409, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25529750, text='I&#x27;ve been replaying the first Dark Souls in co-op with a friend over the past few months. As long as you stay out of the shield-turtle playstyle trap (something that took convincing for my friend) it&#x27;s a lot of fun. I will say there&#x27;s a steep quality drop in the back half of the game (post Anor Londo). The Artorias DLC matches the best of it, though.<p>Only advice I&#x27;d pay to newbies is to get good at dodgerolling instead of using a shield. Turtling behind a shield is very effective in Dark Souls 1 (fixed in later installments) but becomes dreadfully boring after a while. The game has a reputation as being difficult but if you summon NPCs or other players for boss fights they are quite easy (purists might say this defeats the entire point).')
