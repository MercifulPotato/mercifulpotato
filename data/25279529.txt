With an artificially constrained supply of taxis, they could do this without penalty, possibly even profitably.<p>With Uber, sure an individial driver can decline a ride based on the destination and assumptions he makes about the passenger, but it&#x27;s far more likely that <i>someone</i> will take the ride, since there are many more drivers. They also have less to fear with Uber since they don&#x27;t carry cash or deal with cash payments, and there&#x27;s some level of trackability&#x2F;identifiability of the passenger in comparison to picking up a random person on a street hail.')
