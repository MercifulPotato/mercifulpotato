Huh, four letter banks.<p>Axos was super slow with set up such that half way through the process I applied to Azlo and got approved in a couple days and went with them instead. Bye.<p>Brex I used with my first startup beginning in 2018 (having migrated from SVB) and I loved it. There used to be a higher bar for getting an account but looks like they got rid of the $10K minimum. The rewards were pretty good and dunno if they still have it open bc pandemic but the Brex Oval Room (members only club) in South Park was a dope place to work and hang.<p>Based on prior experience, I&#x27;m leaning towards giving Brex a go again unless one of you can convince me otherwise.')
