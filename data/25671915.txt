Knowledge and discovery need to provide more than cynicism and irrelevance.<p>Cruelty: Empathy first made us human, practical telepaths. Criticism provokes people, poking mental burn victims. Fights devastates. Fighters eventually miss the people they just wholesale killed.<p>Ignorance: Force people to fix telephone poles. Spend decades ignoring their requests for mobile. Overnight fire them for not having mobile skills, a practical death sentence. Universal healthcare has wait times and job guarantees have relocation requirements.<p>What&#x27;s the minimum you need to call yourself a government? People telling other people what to do all the time from far away? No matter what you stand for, your subject to your own laws, or else there is no law, just bullying and everyone should ignore you as best as they can. Laws themselves have their own rules. You can&#x27;t tell someone what to do when you can&#x27;t even do it yourself, like speak perfectly for one.<p>You do it. If it works, I&#x27;ll look at it and start doing it myself too. If you mess up, best just to walk away. Leadership belongs to others, not just just you.')
