The result is the same on the 1.5x display, and on the 1.1x display it&#x27;s worse, because now you&#x27;re re-scaling the line that is already anti-aliased, blurring it twice.<p>If you get a 133px box, you are cutting off pixels at the bottom.<p>Edit: What you are asking is possible, right now. Just leave your primary display at 1x scale, change the secondary to 11&#x2F;15 scale, and then turn up the sizing in your applications. It&#x27;s actually better that nothing is needed in the Wayland protocol to do that.')
