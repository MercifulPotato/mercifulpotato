I won&#x27;t ever allow analytics or doubleclick scripts. When I pop into a media site with 20+ third party scripts I just say nope and spend my time somewhere else. For basket case sites needed for work or e-commerce that are too fubared to work with script blocking I have a clean Chrome browser. None of those sites get to have tracking cookies from my main browser instance.')
