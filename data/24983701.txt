It&#x27;s another to be sloppy and say &quot;this is how science works&quot;.<p>There is a difference, but since both kinds of errors are widespread among humans, and science addresses both problems with a common solution, and nonscientific methods of generating systems of belief about the material world are prone to error due to their failures to correct both problems, I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s really that material of a difference unless you mean “you” in the narrow individual sense of the specific actor making the initial error, in which case—and only in which case—is the difference at all significant.')
