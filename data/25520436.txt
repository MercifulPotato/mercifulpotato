Then, every time I refresh the Queue playlist from Discover Weekly, I first move the current Queue contents into a YYYY-MM playlist (e.g. 2020-12 for this month).<p>I&#x27;ve been doing this for several years and it&#x27;s been great — I&#x27;ve got a timestamped record of what I was enjoying&#x2F;discovering during those months, and it does seem to have helped Spotify to keep recommending me things I really do enjoy. (Weirdly some weeks seem _really bad_, like I delete virtually everything — but I guess there&#x27;s some A&#x2F;Bing going on there.)<p>(Also: I&#x27;ll only like&#x2F;heart tracks I _particularly_ like, and sometimes I&#x27;ll just listen to my &quot;Liked Songs&quot; playlist; I think this helps teach Spotify what I really like.)')
