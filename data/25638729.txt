What I&#x27;d give to be ignored and neglected again.<p>I&#x27;m going to chew on your &quot;second chasm&quot; notion. Thanks.<p>Maybe it&#x27;s just how things go. Fads, &quot;selling out&quot;, poseurs, fashion, lost in translation, etc. Uncle Bob also references the rapid growth of our profession, where warm bodies are added faster than best practices can percolate.<p>To do list item: Maybe Everett&#x27;s Diffusion of Innovations talks about this.<p>I&#x27;ve been getting a lot out of David Graeber&#x27;s books, most recently The Democracy Project and Utopia of Rules. They&#x27;re the first description of workplace democracy (collaboration, empowerment) which matches my own experiences. Back then, I was just kinda winging it (eg &quot;What would Drucker do?&quot;), because I really didn&#x27;t have a lot other options.<p>Graeber considers the paradoxes better than most sages. eg How a movement begats its own destruction.<p>I keep thinking about that cliche of how anything taken to its logical extreme becomes it&#x27;s own opposite, related to an abundance in one area causes a deficit in another.<p>Bringing us back to Goldblatt&#x27;s Theory of Constraints. All balance is completely lost with all the players trying to hyper optimize their own little corner. Worse, &quot;rationalists&quot; weaponize fallacies like &quot;beware the slippery slope!&quot; to actively reject any kind of nuance, moderation, judgement, balance.<p>Thanks for listening. Trying to articulate my grievance helps me organize my thoughts.<p>--<p>Oh. One parting thought. I&#x27;m trying find a rhetorical basis for advocating moderation, proportional solutions. Something akin to rational altruism. I want a mashup of algorithms, game theory, and hedges (eg basket of investments, NPV) to guide decision making and governance. To make it okay to do 100 crazy ideas, because maybe 3 will hit the jackpot. To make it okay to try a variety of mitigations, because there is no one right-sized solution. Etc.')
