It helps if at least the communciation is clear: Like &quot;Fill it all or don&#x27;t file&quot; or &quot;Try to file as much as you can&quot;.<p>I really don&#x27;t want to make it later for devs that give me so much. I&#x27;d be ok with: &quot;Closed: Too little info&quot; from a bot. I may decide to have another crack at it later when I have more time.<p>Edit: Btw, I&#x27;m using software for fee but, I&#x27;m also beta-testing for free. It&#x27;s not just a one-way street: &quot;I derive value from a free product so I should never complain.&quot; Is that really true?<p>I also invest time beta-testing (some times for products that make money on support or are open-core or are a gateway to paid software). Sure there are trolls, but there are also many users that make crappy reports that really want to help but just don&#x27;t understand how (or why their report is a waste of everyone&#x27;s time).')
