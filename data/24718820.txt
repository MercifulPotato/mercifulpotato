I honestly think it ranks pretty low on the scale Asimov&#x27;s works. The &#x27;big reveal&#x27; isn&#x27;t very interesting or unexpected, and there aren&#x27;t even any really interesting ideas explored in the work.<p>Then again, I&#x27;m apparently in the minority in my belief that the Foundation series isn&#x27;t that good either and The God&#x27;s Themselves is clearly his best work, so YMMV.')
