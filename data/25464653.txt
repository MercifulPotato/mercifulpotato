Much cheaper than a hitch mounted version, much more compact so I&#x27;ve been able to hang it in a little storage closet in the last few apartments I&#x27;ve lived in and goes on a wide variety of cars without any damage. Rock solid with 3 chunky mtbs on it too. I&#x27;ve even had people come up to me in car parks asking me for details!<p>Not wanting to derail the discussion but if it was that that put you of the review site you mention, it could be worth reconsidering..')
