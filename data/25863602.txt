We did this very thing when we visited Rijksmuseum -we had half a day and wanted to see everything we could. But the point is taken that smaller museums would get nicer collections. We could enjoy our local Museum more if it had more Dutch masters!<p>This is definitely true about visiting a local zoo or museum when you have a membership. Our son just want so see the lions? That&#x27;s fine! We&#x27;ll come back some other time and see the rest.')
