You can see this in your first &quot;hello world&quot; application where the entry point ends up getting wrapped in a class definition. Something that makes zero sense, and does little but obfuscate. I tend to like a bit of OOP here and there, but the little java programming i&#x27;ve done, it always feels like I was forced into pounding the square peg into a round hole.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.programiz.com&#x2F;java-programming&#x2F;hello-world" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.programiz.com&#x2F;java-programming&#x2F;hello-world</a><p>Compared with say, C++ where you can write entire programs that never declare a single class. Its the same thing with purely functional languages, in any significantly large program you reach the point where your solving problems using the wrong paradigm because the language is too dogmatic.')
