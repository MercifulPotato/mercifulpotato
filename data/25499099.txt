If the valuation of Stripe is 70 Billion today and one gets granted 100k worth of stock this year (say 100 units), if valuation is 140 Billion next year, employees get 50 units next year (ignoring dilution etc), instead of 100 units each year.<p>I meant that it is fixed dollar amount not fixed RSU count per year at Stripe, if that helps clear it')
