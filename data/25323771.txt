Item(by='danparsonson', descendants=None, kids=[25324539], score=None, time=1607266054, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25323283, text='&gt; Ethical and considerate _actions_ are important at all times<p>Agree with that;<p>&gt; Actions have real life, often irreversible, effects on those around you<p>agree with that also;<p>&gt; Many very dishonest people help themselves sleep at night by pretending that being polite excuses their actions<p>I could believe this is true, although I suspect most habitually dishonest people don&#x27;t even see themselves as dishonest or think they&#x27;re doing anything wrong.<p>None of these things are opposite to what the GP wrote though - so I don&#x27;t understand what you&#x27;re disagreeing with.<p>A classic example of the value of respect and courtesy in dealing with a difficult situation is when you have a problem with a food order at a restaurant. You can choose to shout at the person serving you, or approach the problem in a respectful and courteous way - in my experience, the latter is more effective at getting the best outcome, regardless of who is nominally at fault.<p>Respectful discourse also gives you an easy route to backing down when it turns out you&#x27;ve made the mistake, and some moral high ground if you need to escalate the situation.<p>Finally I would also say that even if someone is behaving unpleasantly towards you, that does not necessitate an unpleasant response. They may be having a terrible day for other reasons, and a little patience gives them a chance to relax a bit and respond in a more constructive way, which is to your benefit. It&#x27;s hard for someone to stay angry with you when you&#x27;re treating them fairly.')
