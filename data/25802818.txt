Responsiveness by Google is not great, as expected, we recently contacted Google to get access to the paid WebRisk API and haven&#x27;t heard anything in a few months...<p>However, phishing detection and blocking is not a fun game to be in. You can&#x27;t work with warning periods or anything like that, phishing websites are stood up and immediately active, so you have to act within minutes to block them for your users. Legitimate websites are often compromised to serve phishing &#x2F; malicious content in subdirectories, including very high-level domains like governments. Reliable phishing detection is hard, automatically detecting when something has been cleaned up is even harder.<p>Having said all that, a company like Google with all of its user telemetry should have a better chance at semi-automatically preventing high-profile false positives by creating an internal review feed of things that were recently blocked but warrant a second look (like in this case). It should be possible while still allowing the automated blocking verdicts to be propagated immediately. Google Safe Browsing is an opaque product &#x2F; team, and its importance to Google was perhaps represented by the fact that Safe Browsing was inactive on Android for more than a year and nobody at Google noticed: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.zdnet.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;mobile-chrome-safari-and-firefox-failed-to-show-phishing-warnings-for-more-than-a-year&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.zdnet.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;mobile-chrome-safari-and-firef...</a><p>Lastly, as a business owner, it comes down to this: Always have a plan B and C. Register as many domains of your brandname as you can (for web, email, whatever other purpose), split things up to limit blast radius (e.g. employee emails not on your corporate domain maybe, API on subdomain, user-generated content on a completely separate domain) and don&#x27;t use external services (CDN) so you can stay in control.')
