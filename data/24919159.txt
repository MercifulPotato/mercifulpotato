Meaning that without authorisation your data is still encrypted.<p>I&#x27;m not completely familiar with Windows service management and how it handles logins - but doesn&#x27;t the TPM auto decrypt function of Bitlocker mean that if you have a compromised system which has a dodgy service that starts at boot time it can potentially exfiltrate data from the machine without a user logging in?<p>Of course, if this is the scenario you&#x27;re experiencing you have much bigger problems already haha.')
