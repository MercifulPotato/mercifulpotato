We eg organized a worldwide soccer tournament <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;homelessworldcup.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;homelessworldcup.org&#x2F;</a>\nand are selling a news paper distributed by homeless people.<p>Most homeless in western european countries come either from losing their job and having drug problems, or losing their wifes and thereby homes. The many eastern homeless cross the borders because they can live much better by begging on the streets here than in the east. But there are plenty of homeless, squatters there also. Eg nost of the abandoned village houses in the east were subsequently squatted by gypsies. The city center in Bucuresti is also full of homeless. When writing a book about homeless over the world in the US and Russia, the problems were the same, just that in the USA there&#x27;s a homeless shipping industry to get them out of the city, but they still prefer the warm south where it&#x27;s easy to survive. Who wouldn&#x27;t. Even the rich old folks prefer Florida over NY. Just politicians and police are more inhuman there.')
