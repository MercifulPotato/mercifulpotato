Make sure hot&#x2F;cold water get all over your torso, chest and spine. You will feel really good afterwards even though the cold water isn&#x27;t very pleasant. \nAlternatively, in the summer, take cold showers for invigoration, especially if you feel sleepy in the morning. It is unpleasant for the moment but it makes you feel great afterwards.')
