The author&#x27;s self-confessed desire to engage in antisocial behavior due to the associated thrill is a risk to herself, her husband, and her daughter. The author gloats about her misdeeds and treats the fact that they are frowned upon like an inconvenience. She even tries to claim that she can&#x27;t help it because she was born this way. Her husband is attempting to moderate this behavior, but she still &quot;gets up to no good&quot; and simply indicates this to her husband as though the primary issue is trust.<p>I don&#x27;t know what the point of this article is, I&#x27;m going to view it as a demonstration of what a functionally sociopath person look like and use it to broaden my definition of people to fear.')
