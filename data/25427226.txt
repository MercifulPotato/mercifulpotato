Yeah attribution is hard, yeah someone could have been trying to frame them, but in general these groups tend to use a lot of in-house tools and consistent infrastructure and techniques.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Cozy_Bear" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Cozy_Bear</a><p>Did you read the Fancy Bear incitements for the DNC hack?<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.justice.gov&#x2F;file&#x2F;1080281&#x2F;download" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.justice.gov&#x2F;file&#x2F;1080281&#x2F;download</a><p>The evidence was absolutely overwhelming.
