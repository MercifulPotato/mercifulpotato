A git hash is a pretty robust way to know whether the code in the repo is what it is supposed to be, so a &quot;git fetch&quot; rather than a fresh &quot;git clone&quot; should be safe, but we can&#x27;t trust the build steps to not trash the build-runner so the entire thing needs to be thrown away.<p>Edit: for context, I wrote this comment while waiting for `npm ci` to run. Its first step is to delete the node_modules folder, as otherwise it can&#x27;t be trusted to update correctly.')
