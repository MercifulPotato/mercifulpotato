I&#x27;m literally locked in my house in England, and all of the pubs are shut, and I&#x27;m banned from hanging out with my friends or my family. I want all that to end. I want to get back to seeing the world and going to festivals and for everyone to be able to do the same. I want my elderly grandmother to be able to see us again without worry. It&#x27;s nothing to do with me being afraid.')
