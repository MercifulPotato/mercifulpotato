Specifically, I don&#x27;t see this leading to a ban of reasonable people.<p>If I&#x27;m reading your thoughts correctly, your main concern seems to stem from the fact that you&#x27;re assuming the goal is to stop these people from communicating with each other.<p>However, I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s the point of these bannings. I think the goal is to stop them from reaching a new audience and expanding (however, as I am not a CEO of a major social media company, I can only guess what the motivations are).<p>In that sense, if everyone switches to using code words, or to using non-broadcast media (eg, Signal), it&#x27;s significantly less concerning, and there will not be a strong push to ban people from those sites.  By only de-platforming clear violators, I bet they can still have a big impact.')
