Why are we all  trying to work around models that involve blocking on IO? I feel I almost never hear about using  non-blocking IO as an alternative?<p>Maybe I don&#x27;t understand what you mean by non-blocking I&#x2F;O, because it seems to me that it <i>is</i> the norm in many environments, for better or worse. Async&#x2F;await syntax is now available in C#, JavaScript, Python, Rust, and possibly others. And before that we had callbacks in JavaScript and in Python frameworks like Twisted and Tornado. So it seems to me that non-blocking I&#x2F;O has been widely used and discussed for quite a while now.')
