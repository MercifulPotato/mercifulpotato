But the stations seem to be only reluctantly installed; so they come in small groups, poorly maintained, crappy interface, and in many cases brutally expensive.  Some of that is because of local regulations on who can sell power by the kWh, so the charging companies had to use per-minute billing.<p>It&#x27;s coming around, but it&#x27;s rough around the edges.  I have a Tesla and a Bolt, and supercharging is definitely superior.  But we haven&#x27;t really had any trouble with DC fast charging the Bolt, either, like some folks have.<p>In either case we only DC fast charge once every few months, 99% of the time we plug in at home with our own L2 outlet.')
