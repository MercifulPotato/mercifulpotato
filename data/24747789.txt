Furthermore, if you buy stock from NASDAQ or NYSE or London stock exchange, you should get the same price. This idea that you should pay the same price for an asset regardless of where you buy it is enforced by HFT firms, as outlined in the article. Clearly, HFT firms need to get paid for this service, so retail investors typically pay the bid&#x2F;ask spread.')
