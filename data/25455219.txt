Let someone else pay the depreciation on the new phone and then get it cheaper.  This also means you own the phone outright and switch carriers on a whim. We have iphones and they are 7 plus, 7, 7 and 11. The reason for the 11 is because switching providers gave us a discount. I was thinking about upgrading but it does what it needs to and the only feature I might take advantage of is better camera.<p>In my mind the cool new tech phase of phones has been over for a long while.  They are like refrigerators now - any new features (TV in fridge) are mostly just gimmicks.  There might be minor advancements in various features but they don&#x27;t seem like reasons to upgrade. If people choose to put their disposable income into new phones every year, have at it, I&#x27;d rather spend it on hobbies.')
