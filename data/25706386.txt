I kinda liked swimming but now that pools are closed, apart from a short walk at lunch time (we have curfew in the evening) I don&#x27;t do anything. Tried yoga but always scared to hurt myself, also I have very little room in my apartment to move... I can&#x27;t run also because of body pain.<p>I&#x27;m surprised I only gained 4kg. But my whole body is itching and aching and I&#x27;m really feeling the effects of less physical activity.')
