I don&#x27;t do devel on the gateway, but I create &quot;web things&quot; (IoT devices) that connect to it.<p>I use the gateway to manage my smart home and I love it. Love the privacy. Love the rules. Love the add-ons.<p>Going forward, I&#x27;d like to see companies adopt it yes, but my main focus will be pushing the gateway and framework to be used for STEM education around IoT. I currently work with the <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;MicroBlocks.fun" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;MicroBlocks.fun</a> team, an awesome FOSS STEM edu tool for programming microcontrollers. I drove a Mozilla Open Source Software (MOSS) support grant to fund the core MicroBlocks devs to build a &quot;web thing&quot; library, when at Mozilla. The combo of the two projects is awesome imho.<p>If you can&#x27;t buy an IoT device to suit your needs, you can easily build one. :)<p>A talk I gave in Sept shows a &quot;walk around the house&quot; demo at about 13:00min. It gives you a small taste of what you can do. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=6a0gXt8m9Yw" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=6a0gXt8m9Yw</a>')
