For example, a classic way to work with a file in Haskell is to use  the function withFile:<p><pre><code>    withFile :: FilePath -&gt; IOMode -&gt; (Handle -&gt; IO r) -&gt; IO r\n</code></pre>\nYou pass a function to withFile, and the file handle is valid for the scope of the function. However, this means you can’t do the following:<p><pre><code>    open file A\n    do stuff\n    open file B\n    do stuff\n    close file A\n    do stuff\n    close file B\n</code></pre>\nBecause the usage of files &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; don’t nest, you can’t achieve it with withFile. But you <i>can</i> get the same level of safety using linear types.')
