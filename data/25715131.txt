We were ready to move many of our core services to AWS when COVID hit but our systems were designed to run on a Kubernetes cluster so we could theoretically run locally or on any cloud.<p>This takes me back to my first Internet connection which was a partial T1 line back to a mid-tier Internet provider.  We ran everything over that connection except for our main sales page and had a lot more autonomy.  The provider didn&#x27;t care what was running over that connection so long as they got paid.<p>My point is that I don&#x27;t think the higher education institutions (where the Internet initially flourished) will be affected, nor will the big companies who already have connections as described above.  Those of us who have traded our autonomy for cheaper operating costs and more convenience will indeed find that we&#x27;ve lot a lot of the control we used to have.')
