I didn&#x27;t play them as a kid when they came out, but as an early-20s adult through emulation, and while SMW was difficult, it never felt unfair or impossible. Yoshi&#x27;s Island is more like a story, not really that difficult, it&#x27;s probably my all-time favorite game overall.<p>A Link to the Past was <i>significantly</i> harder to beat.<p>Earlier NES-era and older games could be absolutely punishing. The original Metroid is bonkers hard and Super Mario Bros. 3 is <i>much</i> harder than Super Mario World.<p>I think it&#x27;s a matter of acclimatization. I grew up playing mostly platform games (mostly on PC), which I think has given me an innate sense of how the 2D world physics and interactions work most of the time. I remember the jump to 3D games being like learning to ride a bicycle all over again.<p>Fun addendum: because I grew up playing Commander Keen and Duke Nukem and so on, using directional keys with my right hand is hard-wired for me, I simply cannot do it with my left hand, and I&#x27;m actually left-handed. I can use a mouse equally well with both hands, but I just can&#x27;t do WASD normally for 3D games. I have to remap and flip the controls to IJKL. Today I just play most games with a controller, aside from FPS games.')
