You can take pretty much any model you trained on a desktop GPU and run it on the board without any changes which is nice for the right kind of project. And they sell a range of modules with a spectrum of price&#x2F;performance&#x2F;power draw depending on how much processing power you need.<p>If you are manufacturing something in larger volume, they will sell you production modules without the dev boards that you can mount on your own boards. But those are still aimed at more expensive products. So this isn&#x27;t a solution for low-cost high volume consumer products, but there is definitely a market for it.')
