I am aware of the existence of shadow profiles and it doesn&#x27;t invalidate the general point. Them having a shadow profile of me is an annoyance and is rather minor one at that.<p>However I have no such choice when it comes to Government. Whatever they choose to decide I have to abide by or face fines, jail and other reprocussions. Some of those decisions maybe just which aren&#x27;t a problem. However some of them maybe unjust. If those decisions are unjust I have almost no direct way to address it especially if I am in the minority.')
