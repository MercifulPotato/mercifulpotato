Sorry if my comment came of as negative towards them. (But I also like Marvel movies, for what it&#x27;s worth.)  Just wanted to point out Fincher is not art cinema as the top comment suggested. (And Spielberg is not just family friendly subjects either.)<p>I don&#x27;t know about &quot;multiplex pleaser&quot; - Gone Girl, Finchers previous movie, &quot;topped the box office for two consecutive weekends&quot; according to Wikipedia.')
