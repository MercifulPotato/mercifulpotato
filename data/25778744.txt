Not to say that there definitely isn&#x27;t a liberal bias in Twitter moderation, but this article&#x27;s evidence is that they banned <i>the US president</i> but didn&#x27;t ban <i>three rando tweets with five or fewer likes&#x2F;retweets</i>. Surely the more likely case here is that moderation has missed them so far? On the other hand, the KillTrump hashtag is indefensible, since surely this isn&#x27;t the first time that&#x27;s appeared, and it seems super easy to spot and ban without needing a ton of user reports (though admittedly, looking right now, all tweets under that hashtag are using it to criticize the hashtag...).')
