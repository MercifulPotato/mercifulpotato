This pandemic is effectively solely a problem caused by this decision.&quot;<p>you say this of literally the fastest development of a vaccine in the history of our planet.  vaccines only work if people take them.  people only take them if its safe.  (and even when they are safe, anti-vax crowd actively works against uptake).<p>so your proposal is to give an untested vaccine to the entire planet, because the harms of doing that would be fewer in number in the short term while completely destroying the ability for society to deliver any vaccine in the future.<p>scenario plan for this:  the next pandemic is 10x worse than this one and you blew all of society&#x27;s goodwill on an untested vaccine this time around.  nobody takes vaccine. everyone dies.')
