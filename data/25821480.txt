New recipes are worked into our regular meal times. If it takes me an hour longer than the estimated time to prep and cook, I&#x27;ve made everyone wait an extra hour, throwing off any other plans for the evening. That can be discouraging and lead to wondering &quot;why did they say it only takes 20 minutes? Are they just guessing, or am I just a slow cook?&quot; Hence this thread. :)')
