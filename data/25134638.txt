An app uses the OS sockets API to create plaintext sockets, and the OS adds TLS to them (based on policies configured by the sysadmin) transparent to the application. (There are IOCTLs that apps can call to discover this is going on, turn it on&#x2F;off, configure it, etc, but the whole idea is you can add TLS support to some legacy app without needing any code changes, so adding those IOCTL calls to your app is totally optional.)<p>In some parallel universe, TLS would have been part of TCP not a separate protocol and the Berkeley sockets implementation in the OS kernel would handle all encryption, certificate validation, etc, on behalf of applications. AT-TLS is a bit like visiting that parallel universe')
