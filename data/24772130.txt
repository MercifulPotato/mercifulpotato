Except... my reddit is very sparse. From where did it draw these conclusions?<p>This tool highlighted my suspicions. It&#x27;s very biased towards these results (I don&#x27;t know if Myers-Briggs is also, which might be possible). For example, &quot;lorem ipsum&quot; scores IN<i>XX</i> all above 0.13, with everything else below 0.08. Similar results for &quot;youtube reddit&quot; or &quot;the quick brown fox&quot;.')
