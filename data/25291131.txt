Coal sludge, tar sands mining, and fracking have nothing to do with hydropower generation.  Those are the activities renewable energy alternatives are specifically intended to replace, and as such, they address any related concerns directly.<p>I&#x27;m unaware of any substantial credible literature describing toxic accumulations in hydro projects <i>due to the hydro project itself</i>.<p>&quot;Cancer alleys&quot; along major riverways due to other streamside and watershed activities (e.g., the lower Mississippi river &amp; delta region) are prevalent without any accompanying hydroelectric facilities.  Hydro isn&#x27;t the cause.<p>This seems to be a shifting of the argument on your part.')
