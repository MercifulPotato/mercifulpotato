It is the exact reason Facebook is a nice way to login to mobile multiplayer games.<p>&gt; They care about it only insofar as it gets you to use a Facebook account.<p>Right. Facebook acquired a niche gaming platform that posed absolutely no threat to any Facebook business not because it was cool and extremely risky and why not. They acquired it to grow user counts in (checks notes) the one app that has already possibly acquired every user it ever will in the entire world.<p>I don&#x27;t know dude. There are kids who use YouTube for years on the same device, easily and uncontrovertibly trackable without an account, who are bombarded with more advertising in a day than most high-tech-proficiency adults using Oculus, like me, using adblockers, see in a year. YouTube targets ads to users without accounts! Everyone tracks everyone without accounts, every day, every website you visit, all the time! And of course that includes demographic factors, as though watching <i>kids YouTube material</i> doesn&#x27;t give away that a <i>kid</i> is watching. You don&#x27;t need an account to tell you the user&#x27;s demographics. Their friends and likes. You don&#x27;t need those things.<p>And then what? So what if <i>game developers</i> learn the demographics and friends of their users. People have been measuring stuff about who goes to movie theaters, who checks out books, who listens to radio, for decades. What&#x27;s the worst they&#x27;re going to do, make more video games that find diverse, niche audiences they did not otherwise serve? Oh the humanity.<p>And then what the hell is some conventional brand going to learn from someone&#x27;s Oculus play history? It&#x27;s completely moronic, there&#x27;s absolutely no economic value there.<p>Next you&#x27;re going to tell me, oh it&#x27;s horrible they created a VR Chat clone. Nobody is going to force Oculus users to use their shitty VR Chat clone (Horizon). What then are they going to learn from people? There is nothing to learn from VR Chat.<p>The user account story is just so absurd, it&#x27;s so off the mark. Account or not they will be able to easily create quality, targeted advertising.')
