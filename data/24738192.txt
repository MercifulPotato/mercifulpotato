Are you saying the author is arguing a call like<p><pre><code>  new Customer()\n</code></pre>\nshould return something valid? I think the FP way would be to disallow constructor overloads with no arguments, as really, there&#x27;s no reasonable thing to be done here. If you don&#x27;t have all the necessary information to initialize a customer yet, you don&#x27;t get to initialize one, and you pass around a partially applied constructor function instead.<p>ie, The argument is that (in pseudocode):<p><pre><code>  Customer(name = &quot;Jimmy&quot;, address = null)\n</code></pre>\nis not really a customer if address is a necessary piece of information, so we should distinguish at the type level by passing around a function that takes the address and returns the correctly initialized Customer like so<p><pre><code>  \\addr -&gt; Customer(name = &quot;Jimmy&quot;, address = addr)\n\n</code></pre>\nAdmittedly, this prevents you from accessing name until you provide an address, but I don&#x27;t think there are many valid use cases where you want to access data before the Customer value is corrrectly initialized. I&#x27;d consider this a code smell to be refactored.')
