From your suggestion: flagging the “ad hominem part” is moderation and could be open to interpretation if flagged statements are or not. Thus brings to mind Burke, “The majority of the citizens is capable of exercising the most cruel oppressions upon the minority.” True as that is, though, there’s been a growing popularization across groups for adopting a victimhood complex to feel justified in claiming oppression. So, no - ironic to post here, but actually cogent debate requires a base degree of mutual respect - which requires a shared (global) “culture” - and less anonymity.')
