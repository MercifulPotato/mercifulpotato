And don&#x27;t try to evaluate something like anti-trust in a marginal way, when the effects are so numerous. Better to take a more stateless &#x2F; path-independent approach and just find the new equilibrium, for the first rough-cut analysis.<p>From those perspectives, higher Gini coefficient clearly means lower median, etc.<p>From your other comment it looks like you agree with my conclusions, at least.')
