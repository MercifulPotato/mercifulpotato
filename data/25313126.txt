She was terminated, effective immediately.<p>Without taking sides (I don&#x27;t know the full story to understand who is objectively in the wrong here), that&#x27;s not completely true.<p>She basically gave an ultimatum - meet my demands or I can work on a last date.[1] It is quite common at big tech that once you resign - officially or unofficially - you could be asked to leave effective immediately. Usually happens when you work in critical areas or moving to a competitor or a disgruntled employee.<p>Could this have been better handled? Maybe, but no matter who was in the right or wrong, she wasn&#x27;t technically fired.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;timnitGebru&#x2F;status&#x2F;1334343577044979712" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;timnitGebru&#x2F;status&#x2F;1334343577044979712</a>')
