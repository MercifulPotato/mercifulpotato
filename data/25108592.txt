There&#x27;s a particularly obnoxious culture of purism in the gaming community, particularly for platforming games. People having difficulty are told to &quot;get gud&quot; or stop playing. I could complete the game VVVVVV because it has a slow down option. Although I have no serious disability, my reactions are not as good as a teenager&#x27;s and my joints are stiffer. I&#x27;ve got nowhere with the Hollow Knight because it has no difficulty controls. The game&#x27;s fans just say get gud, which is impossible for me, and make the community repellent.')
