Specifically, it doesn&#x27;t say that 67,000 people died <i>of the flu</i>, it says that 67,000 people <i>died</i>.  The entire report is about all-cause mortality, and so is that sentence. The flu was the reason for a spike in deaths, but it was not the cause of all 67,000 deaths in France that month.<p>What I believe to be a more accurate translation:<p>&quot;In addition, the winter flu epidemic that began at the end of 2016 led to an exceptional peak in deaths in January 2017: 67,000 deaths in mainland France this month.&quot;')
