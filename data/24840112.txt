That wouldn&#x27;t make much sense unless it&#x27;s made out of people that are OK with doing illegal stuff (Mafia?). So of course most employees don&#x27;t believe that.<p>And whether or not such training is meant by executives to hide illegal behavior that they are aware of it&#x27;s also catching many cases where people are just dumb and use wrong words to mean different things, words that have specific meaning in a legal context and that can hurt the person and the company although there was no illegal act being done.')
