Then when they don&#x27;t work out, instead of reflecting on his models to improve them (at least publicly,) he just tells people they don&#x27;t understand probability or his models. His sports models are -especially- bad; no better than a coin flip in some instances. I know there are a ton of Silver fanboys, but surely you can agree he has a pretty big ego, which always makes me take him with a grain of salt. When it comes to politics his former work with Obama&#x27;s campaign and DailyKos also make me question if he can be truly unbiased in his predictions, but that&#x27;s a separate issue.')
