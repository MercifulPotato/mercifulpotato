It integrates messily with its host platform (hn comments on the last thread I read about it indicated that Google&#x27;s algorithms were inadvertantly tagging unrelated content as &#x27;music&#x27;), and dilutes focus on the prior project&#x27;s core feature-set.<p>Just because another product&#x27;s abstract contains some of the product I&#x27;m using&#x27;s core doesn&#x27;t mean I want to switch over to it because Google&#x27;s got a short attention span, and wants to reimplement the product I&#x27;m using in the most approximate manner possible.')
