They’re definitely not losing steps during normal operation.<p>The topic of steppers vs servos has been covered over and over on every hobby CNC forum for the past two decades. Closed loop systems are great if someone has extra budget to spare, but they’re unnecessary for machines using hobby-level spindle power.')
