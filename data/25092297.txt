The vast majority here don&#x27;t care that much because they use a password manager but I&#x27;m worried about the ones that don&#x27;t, they can be impacted if there is a database leak or if the site owner is shady and starts looking through its database for passwords that look reusable and try them on other important website. How easy would it be to set a nice honeypot website that requires a username&#x2F;password?<p>A properly set up google sign in makes it impossible to do that at least. Thoughts?')
