I definitely agree that some policies require nuance and changes with new data.<p>&gt; So what happens if we have multiple theories that no one can accuse of being wrong because we simply don&#x27;t have enough insight into some very complicated matters? Which one do we put in practice? Or do we wait years before we gather the data for it, by which time it might be irrelevant anyway<p>I wasn&#x27;t addressing your statement that policy is often difficult to pin down, only the inference that there are no right answers.')
