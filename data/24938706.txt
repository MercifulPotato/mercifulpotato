Item(by='ddevault', descendants=None, kids=[24940397], score=None, time=1604027036, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24938096, text='A good practice when firing off an email to a list like this is to do a git blame on nearby code, identify the maintainers, and come up with a list of people to Cc directly on the email.<p>If you can get the git repo, you don&#x27;t need the list to contribute. It helps, for sure, but you can work without it pretty easily.<p>And as I said in the article, I don&#x27;t think it would be necessary to turn off the list in the event of a DMCA request, at least not on SourceHut. On GitHub the git repo is <i>the</i> single source of truth, so when a git repo is pulled, so too go the issues, pull requests, and so on. Not so on SourceHut.')
