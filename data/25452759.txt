The really substantial changes here are getting closer to what you would have to do to port an application from Qt Widgets to QML&#x2F;QtQuick, although not quite as drastic. (The whole scene graph design has changed, but you don&#x27;t need to change all of your widgets to use it effectively, only some of them) The incentive here is the same: Make a modern and flexible toolkit that works for a wide range of applications. If something is deprecated and removed with no replacement or migration plan, it&#x27;s the same thing there too: customers didn&#x27;t see enough of a need to pay for it to happen.<p>AFAIK the systray icon support in GTK was removed because nobody was willing to maintain it. I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a great example because it doesn&#x27;t even need to be in GTK anyway, it relies entirely on platform-specific functionality and has little to do with the toolkit. Someone can just make a library for that. (And I think Ubuntu did, but it was not upstreamed for a few reasons, one of them being that it didn&#x27;t support multiple platforms) Regardless, that is the point I was getting at. The upstream policy is really not that different between these projects, you can&#x27;t avoid it just by jumping ship.')
