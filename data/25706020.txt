Gatekeepers (in this case, any media labeled &quot;mainstream&quot; and any popular social media corporation) exist to spread disinformation.<p>2. These gatekeepers are <i>part of</i> the government (or governance structure); they operate on the direction of the government.<p>3. They will not give you &quot;good information.&quot; Any of them.<p>All of this to argue that President Donald Trump, perhaps arguably the most powerful man when acting President is speaking the truth about widespread election fraud, which - in 2016 would make him look better, as he claimed he won the popular vote, and in 2020 would <i>preserve his position of power and influence over you</i>.<p>To accept that lie, you need to believe that the vast majority of news outlets and social media corporations are all <i>secretly</i> conspiring, planning, communicating and executing alongside election officials, bipartisan judges, etc. and all at the behest of a &quot;deep state&quot; shadow government, but the only people that are willing to &quot;admit&quot; this exists are people that are Trump&#x27;s biggest fans.')
