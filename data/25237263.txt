In bars, the people walking around are guests.<p>- restaurants are a quiet atmosphere, and people at the same tables can usually have an easy conversation. In most bars, there&#x27;s music blaring at loud volume so people must lean in towards each other for every sentence.<p>I don&#x27;t see how you go from &quot;bars and restaurants have far and away been the driver&quot; to &quot;restaurants are one of the highest risk places&quot; with a straight face. Can you point to studies showing how these differences don&#x27;t make a diffference?')
