My recommendation:<p>If your horizon is “finish same day”, buy what you like. This is the only horizon acceptable for frequently oaked varieties (like Cabernet Sauvignon), highly alcoholic varieties (like GSM), or bottom shelf supermarket wines.<p>If your horizon is “finish next day”, this is optimal for complex but light varieties such as Pinot Noir, Chardonnay. No technology needed.<p>If your horizon is “finish in 3-5 days”, the best bet is to buy unfiltered (and un-fined) wine. Generally the bottle fermentation continues and the flavors change over time. These have a lot more funk. With unscientific certainty, I posit this must be how the ancients enjoyed their wine!<p>If your horizon is “finish the next weekend”, then start looking at the technologies in this thread.<p>If your horizon is “finish within the month”, buy 375ml, then see above.<p>And as a PSA, generally avoid added sulfites. Wine is alive! Embracing its natural state extends the lifespan of drinkability. No technology should be needed.')
