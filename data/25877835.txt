Then I experienced that people under their real names are just the same as the anonymous crowd. All it takes is to view the comments under any news article, or visit a group for regular people dealing with regular things.<p>That&#x27;s why I stick to niche, focused communities - like HN. There you can find some semblance of civilization. The &quot;general&quot; Internet takes away whatever faith in humanity I have left.<p>There&#x27;s something about commenting on-line in general, that seems to bring the worst out of people. My hypothesis is that you have to have a certain set of values around civility and rationality to be able to interact with other people on-line in a sane way. Without it - and I think most people haven&#x27;t developed these values - it&#x27;s just a mess. Why it doesn&#x27;t happen so much in meatspace? I think it&#x27;s a combination of social customs, taboos, and having more control over participating in conversations with random strangers.')
