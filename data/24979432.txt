On the other hand very few of the people I heard saying &quot;not for the world&quot; ever properly tested their resolve.<p>I think you choose to see the tip of the pyramid in this particular &quot;cameraman&quot; case. You pick the few with the better conditions, rather than the many, many with the worse ones. It&#x27;s pretty much a certainty that most cameramen in the world do not have upper middle class incomes, good benefits, or unions on their side yet their job is just as targeted by automation as the ones you think of. The couple or truckers I know making $200+k a year are also the exception rather than the rule.<p>Look, I know camera operators who are expected to process and edit the material and get paid their weight in gold. Most others are &quot;just&quot; camera operators and get paid barely middle class salaries.<p>The jobs that get automated are these second type because it&#x27;s easier to train an algorithm or another human to do them than for many other jobs. It also means there&#x27;s less room to be choosy. And people also learn to love what they do.')
