Item(by='vidarh', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609849487, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25635920, text='&quot;Fuck&quot; in the context of &quot;Fuck &lt;name&gt;&quot; is really not particularly offensive in the UK. Furthermore, merely being offensive is insufficient under the law. Section 5 of the Public Order Act requires:<p><pre><code>    &gt; &quot;(1) A person is guilty of an offence if he&#x2F;she:\n    &gt; (a) uses threatening [or abusive] words or behaviour, or disorderly behaviour, or\n    &gt; (b) displays any writing, sign or other visible representation which is threatening [or abusive],\n    &gt; within the hearing or sight of a person likely to be caused harassment, alarm or distress thereby.&quot;\n</code></pre>\nOne might conceivably argue that these are &quot;abusive&quot; words. But case law also suggests that prosecuting merely on the behaviour of speech is only justified if it serves a need to maintain public order, so let&#x27;s deal with your hypothetical:<p>&gt; If an aggrieved third party had been present, and her refusal to cover up created a likelihood of imminent breach of the peace then - perhaps - a temporary arrest might be justified, would you accept?<p>In principle, if the language had been bad enough, yes. In this case? No, I would not. It&#x27;s not nearly offensive enough language that you won&#x27;t hear far worse on a regular basis. If someone can&#x27;t handle seeing a t-shirt like that, they would not last long in London.<p>Here she&#x27;d be more likely to cause offence  people by wearing a &quot;Boris is great&quot; t-shirt. Personally I&#x27;d find that horribly offensive (I&#x27;m not being facetious - the guy is a threat to life and liberty), but I wouldn&#x27;t argue for it to be banned, because it&#x27;s nowhere near bad enough for a reasonable person to disturb public order over.<p>[This is <i>especially</i> true because Boris is a politician, and people need to expect coarser language used to express frustration]<p><i>If</i> an actual aggrieved party had been present <i>and</i> reported her, then they would have had a reason to intervene to at least consider the issue. But that aggrieved party is and was entirely hypothetical.')
