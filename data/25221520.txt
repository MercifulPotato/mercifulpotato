Item(by='dragonwriter', descendants=None, kids=[25222720], score=None, time=1606409330, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25220972, text='&gt; I would not expect a trip on the highway without traffic to be better at all with a hybrid car than with a gasoline car.<p>Hybrid systems allow the gas engine to (essentially) always run at its ideal speed if it is running at all, storing extra energy when less is needed and drawing power from the battery when more is needed. On an idealized highway drive, with cruising speed at exactly the pure gas car engineâ€™s ideal speed, with no variations due to turns, hills, traffic, etc., this is no benefit, but real highway driving tends to differ from this ideal enough that hybrid cars have benefits even in freeway driving.')
