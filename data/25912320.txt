It just didn&#x27;t mention a lot of the science that made the book interesting.<p>I don&#x27;t remember too many glaring examples from The Expanse either.  They generally have artificial gravity when under thrust and not when they don&#x27;t.  When slowing down, they generally have the engines pointed towards the thing they&#x27;re approaching.  The characters in high-G maneuvers don&#x27;t look the way people would actually look in those situations, but that&#x27;s hard to fake without actually sticking actors in a centrifuge so I&#x27;m willing to give them a pass.<p>Scientific accuracy isn&#x27;t really the focus of the show, though.  It&#x27;s a show set in space that needs reasonably accurate physics in order to have a plausible setting and not detract from the the story and the characters.')
