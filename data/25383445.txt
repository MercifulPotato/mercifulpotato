Couldn&#x27;t there be some package that is installed <i>by default</i> in, say, Ubuntu (and that Ubuntu can&#x27;t boot without), so therefore millions of users are using it -- but perhaps the &quot;downloads&quot; seen by GitHub or SourceForge are mostly by OS packagers or by developers contributing to that package. Whereas if there is something where, for some reason, end-users customarily or commonly get it from GitHub or Sourceforge, it might look more widely used even though it is actually <i>less</i> used overall, potentially even by orders of magnitude.<p>(Like GNU coreutils, at an extreme, is probably not that popular at all for end users to download from a source control system, yet it might be running in tens or hundreds of millions of devices, which could not even boot without it.)')
