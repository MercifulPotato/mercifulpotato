That made it easier for you to get into a top school compared to someone without those advantages. That is not a sin or a flaw, and it doesn’t make you a bad person.<p>Now you can (and I would) say that this kind of privilege should be counteracted at the systemic level, by better funding public schools for example.<p>I don’t think those two ideas are in conflict.')
