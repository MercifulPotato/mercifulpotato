As a former gearhead, I&#x27;d argue that cars from the late 70s&#x2F;early 80s are effectively unfixable - it was the era when emissions standards were ratcheting up, but controls were still mostly analog. Engine bays were a giant morass of rubber vacuum hoses that nobody sane wants to deal with anymore.<p>Mid-70s and earlier cars tend to be simpler, but they would never pass modern emissions tests. We picked clean air and fuel efficiency over simplicity. I don&#x27;t think this was wrong.<p>It&#x27;s really hard to know what to think about the direction cars are heading. Yeah, there&#x27;s a lot of closed software and electronics. On the other hand, I have at least one friend with a hacked Tesla. And the huge emissions regulatory and inspection regime that prevents you from making changes to engines doesn&#x27;t apply to electric cars. So it&#x27;s a mixed bag.')
