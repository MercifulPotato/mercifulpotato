Once I confronted him about that behavior and he stated that those who fix problems get promoted while those who create them get passed over, and he believed that by pointing other people&#x27;s flaws he would improve his chances of moving upward.<p>I firmly believe that&#x27;s the main reason most people don&#x27;t praise anyone else. If they do, they are calling out their competitor&#x27;s positive contributions, while no one reciprocates in kind.')
