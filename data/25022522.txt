A long time ago I had a little ski boat, and was pretty concerned about running out of gas. So I put a gallon jug of emergency gas in the boat. Now, the boat was completely open to the breeze. No matter how tightly I closed the cap on that jug (and it was a standard gas can) the fumes made me nauseous. I finally gave it up.<p>The same goes for filling a gas can at the station to transport to the boat to fill its tank. I would not spill a drop of gas, and driving it home I&#x27;d have all the windows open on the car and drive with my head out the window and it would still make me sick.')
