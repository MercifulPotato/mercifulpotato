I want to find durable products that are still on the market with a similar quality for years.<p>Have you ever looked at the BIFL subreddit?<p>One user explained the problem with the BIFL community very well in his post:<p>&quot;I joined this sub for the purpose of buying stuff like lifetime warranty backpacks (osprey), great tools, camp gear, kitchen wear ect. Yet this sub has basically became an Instagram for the old shit people find in they&#x27;re grandparents house which offers no benefit to me now. I&#x27;m not going to buy, nor could I even find a kitchen aid mixer you grandma still uses from the 70s. Most stuff back then was made to last, we know that. I want stuff thats still made today with quality.&quot;')
