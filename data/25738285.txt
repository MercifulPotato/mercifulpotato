That’s not a whole lot of data transfer ability, measured in the low kbps range rather than mbps. Very low kbps when you add in error correction.<p>We are moving out of &#x2F; have left the solar minimum so the MUF is usually well above the 20 metre band each day now so going forward, it might be a good capability to have while it lasts for the next 8 years or so.<p>[1] I don’t know what scale division the ticks at the top represent but the SSB signals to the left would be up to around 3khz wide.')
