No one can. It&#x27;s an impossible task and that&#x27;s where civil conversations like these come in. I quit Facebook quite a while ago because civil conversations were becoming rare and spiteful rhetoric was becoming the norm. I obviously don&#x27;t have the answers.<p>I think a very good first step, especially since schools have been forced online, is to see internet access become a public utility before we ever worry about the likes of Facebook. A public space to voice one&#x27;s concerns can be made at a .gov space or hosted at one&#x27;s own website once internet access is a utility. The only barrier to entry then is learning to set up your own server (I always thought it was fun when I was younger). Though security certificates are a harder hurdle to clear, these days.<p>As for data collection, well, I trust neither corporations nor government. They&#x27;ve both proven to be dishonest when it comes to that particular topic, laws be damned =[')
