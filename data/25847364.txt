I&#x27;m not entirely sure how it works with the cloud instances thoughâ€”they say you can run it on AWS, etc., but do you have to tie in some sort of subscription manager from those running instances back to your account?<p>In any case, if it&#x27;s more complicated than clicking a button once (e.g. if I&#x27;d have to automate any subscription stuff to get it going), I&#x27;m just going to drop RHEL-based distros as a target and move on.
