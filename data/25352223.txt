Putting its removal at Apple&#x27;s feet alone is a bit disingenious when it was the obvious direction for smartphones. Eventually one of the manufacturers was going to be &quot;brave&quot; and the rest would follow.\nAlso, a long trailing cable from your TV &#x2F; accessories across your living room to a y-connector to two more long trailing cables to two headsets is incredibly inelegant and for some houses, an impractical solution. Having wireless headphones that support a Bluetooth standard (because no two implementations are the same) that allows multiple speakers for a single source, is very nice.')
