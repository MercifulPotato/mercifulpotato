In fact in Australia I know of several workshop only bike &quot;shops&quot;, essentially with the raise of online sales lots of people just need their bikes fixed.<p>I find it interesting though that you  say the bike business is commoditized. In particular there are several bike manufacturers who have transitioned into live-style brands (the big one being specialized). Their prices have gone through the roof, while their manufacturing is all outsourced to cheapest bidders in China. It&#x27;s now common for top of the line race bikes to cost &gt;$10,000 while the frames for the bikes cost them ~$300 shipped to the US (and the total bike might be on the order of $1000-$2000 max). Mind you nothing of that ends up with the dealers.')
