One of which is where we don’t engage in doxxing here.<p>I also don’t think or care if dang should delete it, even if I think it’s bad or fuck em. Cultural chastising with plenty of upvoting and downvoting is enough IMO in order to  keep a community not shit.<p>As in any major subreddit if you want an example of shitty.<p>The enemy in my mind is fostering internet mobs which is going too far and abandons due process. And them thinking they are contributing to the world by mixing IRL destruction with their internet activism or vigilanteism<p>Those tactics should not be embraced or encouraged on our site given the obvious downsides, two of which being a) they get the wrong person way too often though newbie investigations that should be left to professional. Beyond handing them tips and advice by the work of autists AND b) it encourages thought policing on and c) doling out overly harsh punishments that don’t fit the ‘crime’, etc etc<p>We figured out these risks already long in society. We’re just mostly repeating them in far too many cases to make mob internet justice worthy of our time.')
