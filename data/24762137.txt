HJKL is in a row on QWERTY, but Dvorak at least has JK together, and H to the left of L.<p>CUA keybindings like Ctrl X, Ctrl C, Ctrl P can be a pain with Dvorak. (I also don&#x27;t think shortcuts like Ctrl+Insert, Shift+Insert are widely supported across OSs, nor USB HID&#x27;s copy and paste keys).<p>Other than that, it&#x27;s just about remembering the shortcut by the letters, not by the position of the keys.')
