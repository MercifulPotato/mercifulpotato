For example my car&#x27;s maps knows where it is in a tunnel because it can dead reckon with the speedometer. My phone cannot do that. For my example my car has a DAB receiver and my phone does not. For example my car&#x27;s infotainment has cameras I can use to park, sensors to tell me how deep I&#x27;m wading, my range left, etc. Obviously my phone doesn&#x27;t any of that. How is none of that useful?')
