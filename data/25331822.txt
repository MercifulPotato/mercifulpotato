An easy example is binary search, which I think is a reasonable &quot;piece&quot; of code by your definition. One should never check its preconditions _inside_ the binary search function (that the list of elements being searched is partitioned by the search predicate). Checking the precondition is O(n) while the algorithm is O(lg n).')
