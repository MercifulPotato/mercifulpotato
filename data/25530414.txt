Turn over on sofa, get told &quot;congrats! you finished your activity&quot;<p>2) sleep tracking is fake. Forget to wear it, get told &quot;You slept great!<p>3) water proof is useless. I bought it because I was going to be surfing and wanted to know if it was close to time to meet up with others. But, while it is water proof you can&#x27;t use it if the screen is wet<p>4) Not good for telling time - because often I&#x27;d twist my wrist and the face would not light up, try again fail, try again fail, RAGE! get out other hand to manually wake it up<p>Sold it 2 months after I got it.')
