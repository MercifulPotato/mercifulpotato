I live an area with a large number of insurance companies and banking HQs, so COBOL jobs are a little more common than most of the US.  Most job postings are for contractors paying mid-30s to lower 40s per hour, with a handful in the 50s.<p>That&#x27;s an okay salary in absolute terms, but it&#x27;s not a great one for a software engineering position.  Even in a fly-over state.<p>But taking that job is basically career suicide.  After 3-5 years of doing that, you&#x27;ll be completely unemployable outside of insurance unless you spend time on your own learning useful skills.  And if you do that, you&#x27;re probably starting back down in a junior or mid-level role.<p>Anyone would be much better off getting an AWS cert and learning to write SQL.')
