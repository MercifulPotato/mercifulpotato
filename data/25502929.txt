I had used Python in the past, but the performance tuning once the application scales is counterproductive and expensive to say the least.<p>I wanted a language which has predictable performance, decent standard library and most importantly not waste my time; time I can focus on my health. Go was the answer, even if it meant that I had to let go of some of my decade long programming patterns and practices.<p>Now my only wish w.r.t to Go&#x27;s future is for it to stick with its utilitarian philosophy and not succumb to pressure of including features which might compromise it and leading to the several forks of Go.')
