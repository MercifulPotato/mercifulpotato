I&#x27;ve tried adding higher levels of detail to the game, but gave up pretty early on. Unless it looks great and stylized, highly detailed art that&#x27;s just <i>okay</i> ends up looking cheaper than intentionally simple and under-detailed art. I ended up settling on something a little bit above Sega Saturn style and I&#x27;m feeling immersed in my own test levels.<p>Whenever I see a game with super detailed forests and houses and human models, it&#x27;s almost impossible to get interested in it. It&#x27;s too real and bland. Maybe it&#x27;s a mental association from seeing a bunch of cheap Russian and Chinese games on Steam that use premade assets.')
