I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any real expectation that a baby monitor is a reliable alerting system that can be depended on.  There are definitely people in the thread who believe that&#x27;s the case, and it also looks like some products are built to those high standards, it&#x27;s not legally required, and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s even desirable.<p>I don&#x27;t hold the people who care for my children to the standards that you would hold a video camera (IE, they&#x27;re allowed to go to the bathroom with the door closed without alerting) so I can&#x27;t see why I would expect it of the technology that approximated it.')
