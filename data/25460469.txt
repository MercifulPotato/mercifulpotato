This seems to be the highest reviewed result for search term &quot;webcam&quot;, at least on my page.<p>Here on HN, we have a savvy audience that understands the problem on Amazon with counterfeits, fakes, and low-quality items. I don&#x27;t usually have this problem myself, because I go out of my way to buy things from sellers that I recognize, such as Logitech for instance, which owns the top results for &quot;webcam&quot; even though they have fewer reviews and higher prices.<p>In your case, I think there are warning signs for the product in question. An unknown seller hawking a cheap knock-off looking webcam with a fake sale price... I really do not enjoy being the devil&#x27;s advocate but, <i>come on</i>.<p>Amazon might reprimand the seller. They might even ban them. But if so, they will just pop back up over night with a new name. Their cheapo products are unlabelled, unbranded and modestly packaged for exactly this benefit.')
