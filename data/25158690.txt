A quick look shows that you can get a 16TB server for $92&#x2F;month [3], which is $5.75&#x2F;TBmonth.<p>But overall it looks like the dedicated server market in the US is still super expensive. You can always keep your bulk data in Europe.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kimsufi.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;en&#x2F;servers.xml" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kimsufi.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;en&#x2F;servers.xml</a><p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.soyoustart.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;essential-servers&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.soyoustart.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;essential-servers&#x2F;</a><p>[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;us.ovhcloud.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;us.ovhcloud.com&#x2F;</a><p>[3]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;us.ovhcloud.com&#x2F;bare-metal&#x2F;advance&#x2F;adv-stor-1&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;us.ovhcloud.com&#x2F;bare-metal&#x2F;advance&#x2F;adv-stor-1&#x2F;</a>')
