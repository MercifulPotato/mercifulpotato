The easiest way is to apply the same framework to a different thing and then hope it will come to an equilibrium by itself eventually. \nFor that you would also need a good chunk of propaganda in the tune of drugs are bad, just say no, saying phones from China are bad and then subsidise companies who are manufacturing in the west and heavily tax stuff with Chinese origin and so on. I am talking about about decade worth of slow transformation.\nFortunately for China they are so corrupt just like our politicians, that any attempt to do this could be thwarted with money under the table. They managed to do this with drugs because you had no cartels and any organisation selling or manufacturing drugs wouldn&#x27;t have enough money to influence the government (and ironically they got so rich because of essentially tax free high margin product that they pay for &quot;war on drugs&quot; to continue). Try that with Apple that essentially can do whatever they like.')
