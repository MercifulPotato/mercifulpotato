This argument seems to imply that languages are copyrightable based upon creativity in ordering, punctuation, use of certain expressions such as `&amp;`, etc. How is that different from your example? In fact a computer language itself is nothing but an API to a human-readable specification for machine behavior. I can see the specification being a creative work and hence being patentable. I don&#x27;t see the same for the API code.<p>I&#x27;ll have to think more about it. I can&#x27;t offer a more substantive counter-argument now.')
