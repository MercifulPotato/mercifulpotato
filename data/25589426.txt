What other country has lifted a BILLION people out of poverty in 30 years? What other country built the worlds biggest high speed rail network in 15 years? What other country is both the biggest producer of steel and iphones? I say this as someone who has a great admiration for western values and lifestyle. A western level university system or free press will probably not be coming there anytime soon. When it comes to building new things china is #1 by far.')
