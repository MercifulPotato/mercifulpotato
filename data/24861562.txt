Normal 3d printer filaments don&#x27;t have the fire retardants required by UL&#x2F;etc for power electronics. I&#x27;ve experienced power supply and battery failures that were contained by their enclosures enough times in my life to take this very seriously. Had any of those cases been wrapped in common PLA&#x2F;PTEG&#x2F;ABS from a 3d printer, i&#x27;m sure it would have been much worse.<p>So, if your printing anything that has a likelyhood of catching fire you should probably be doing it with something like: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.3dxtech.com&#x2F;flame-retardant-filaments&#x2F;firewire-flame-retardant-abs&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.3dxtech.com&#x2F;flame-retardant-filaments&#x2F;firewire-f...</a> or just wrapping that part of the design in sheet metal.')
