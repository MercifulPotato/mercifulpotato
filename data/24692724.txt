(Seeing ANY rocket launch in person is a highly encouraged activity by the way!). The timing of it allowed us to drive there, see the launch, and drive back the same day, but getting home pretty late.<p>Getting into the bay area, it was dark, and I was damn tired.  Had this been a long trip of some kind, I&#x27;d have at least pulled over and done a power nap, but I foolishly decided to press on, since we were less than 30 minutes from home and bed.<p>I&#x27;d been using autopilot for most of the trip, closely supervising it of course.<p>Suddenly I was awakened by the frantic, loud beeping that you get when you don&#x27;t keep some minor torque on the steering wheel for a while.<p>It scared the hell out of me and my family in the car.<p>With their help, we were able to make it home safely.<p>Your specific use case is valid, but the other commenters are also correct.  Autopilot still needs to be supervised, and one should NOT be driving while extremely drowsy.<p>In my many decades of driving, and countless long trips, this is the first time I&#x27;ve fallen asleep, and I&#x27;ve always done the right thing and (at a minimum) taken power naps as needed.<p>But circumstances conspired and I did the wrong thing.<p>I&#x27;m not claiming that Autopilot saved our lives or anything; I would almost certainly have been woken up by the rumble strips when the car drifted out of the lane.<p>To those who might argue that using Tesla Autopilot might tend to cause people to take bigger relevant risks: that&#x27;s possible, but it&#x27;s been a godsend for us.  Using it doesn&#x27;t make me, personally, any less attentive of a driver.  Indeed, I&#x27;m quite a bit more alert to the important things than without it.')
