Item(by='astrange', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611942548, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25959932, text='&gt; Prior to 2020, most medical professionals believed most viruses, and corona viruses particularly, could not be transported as aerosols.<p>That’s most American medical professionals. And they mostly seemed to believe you would get yourself sick faster by touching your eyes after taking the mask off wrong, or that masks provided 0% protection unless you wore an N95 with a fit test, or that if they didn’t lie about them being useless people would steal them from hospitals. They certainly didn’t believe they were truly useless, since they were all wearing them for procedures.<p>Actually, wasn’t the excuse for suddenly being like “face masks are good actually” that they didn’t know COVID had asymptomatic spread before then? That’s even worse than not knowing it spread through aerosols.<p>&gt; This was a subject of research where the data had not come in.<p>By using the technique of “not assuming all of Asia is primitive and superstitious”, it was easy to figure out what to do without an RCT. Note there isn’t evidence that surgical masks help during surgery either.')
