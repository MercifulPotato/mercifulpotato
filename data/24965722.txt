We focus on fixing bugs that affect Firefox, so if the bug in XULRunner doesn&#x27;t affect it you&#x27;re on your own. Feel free to send a patch.<p>- Yeah we did that, the patch have been sitting in Bugzilla for 2 years<p>- ... <i>shrug</i><p>Anyway even with full support of Mozilla they probably wouldn&#x27;t have survived to iTunes+iPod, but clearly using a technology that the vendor has no interest in didn&#x27;t help them.')
