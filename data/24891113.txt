I would never live in a converted office building.<p>The resi tower has concrete separations between floors and if you are lucky, between flats on the same floor. Office buildings donâ€™t have any real separation between floors as you are supposed to walk on accessible fake floors and have fake ceilings too.<p>The sound insulation between flats on a converted office building must be nil.')
