At the point where you become a global payment processor (Paypal, Mastercard,...) a different ruleset should apply to you: no banning unless directly criminaly charged.<p>Because as it is now Paypal can ban you for whatever reason you want.<p>When you become global and directly affect people&#x27;s livelyhoods it should be illegal to cancel people just like that.<p>The &quot;it&#x27;s a private business it can do whatever it wants&quot; argument simply doesn&#x27;t apply anymore (unless you want to end up with corporations for nations since you now have to bow down to private corporations if your opinions are not acceptable. In other words: corporations own your mouth, they own your speech, you cannot go against privot corps. Nightmare fuel. Well you can go against them but you will then lose all of your income which is centralized in a few global corps who also most likely share data on dissidents).')
