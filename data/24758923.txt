No matter how much better than the competition it is.\nOn the other hand, corporations or hotshot startups are connected to big VC money so they have a very good chance of success and most of the founders of these companies don&#x27;t fully realize how lucky they are and so it&#x27;s easy to get a sweet deal from them... You can get a lot more money for a fraction of the work. You don&#x27;t need to add any value, just support the status quo (which requires almost 0 effort).')
