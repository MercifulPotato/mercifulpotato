The virus didn’t magically halt economic activity.  Governments did, and we need to keep that in mind, because depending on the state, the government response was often far too harsh and not backed by science.  Outdoor dining being shut down in California likely caused the spike they are seeing now, by driving people to socializing indoors in private locations.  \nSaying businesses closed due to pandemic gives the government a pass they don’t deserve.  Too often, they could have chosen to require businesses to implement rules and procedures, but instead decided it was easier to just shut them all down.\nIn the recent court decision that overturned LA County outdoor dining ban, it was discovered that the indoor dining ban was implemented because 10 percent of restaurants weren’t following distancing rules.  So they shut them all down as a response.  In the same case, it was also discovered that LA County had no scientific evidence of any form to shutdown outdoor dining.  Every study they cited was indoor transmission.  When the court sided against the county, Gavin Newsom immediately responded by making the outdoor dining ban a state rule, forcing the litigants to challenge the law in state court, still with no science backing him.<p>A lot of economic damage could have been avoided if governments in the US weren’t filled with quantitatively illiterate do-gooders who say “follow the science” but aren’t capable of understanding it.  The age stratification of risk from COVID-19 was essentially absent from public health discussion because of this.')
