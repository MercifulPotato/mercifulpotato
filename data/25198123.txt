(Private sector armed security is basically illegal here.) Of course, what really really gets me is when they talk about our total ban on guns while insisting that their security guards don&#x27;t count because they have handguns and not big scary rifles, because the total UK ban they&#x27;re likely thinking of is on <i>handgun</i> ownership specifically.')
