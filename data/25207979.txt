I&#x27;m on 1Gbit down&#x2F;1Gbit up at home, there are no caps, and the full speed is always available. It&#x27;s not throttled, it&#x27;s equally fast at all times as far as I can tell. It&#x27;s not expensive, there are no hidden charges. I use my own router (though I&#x27;m also using the equipment that came from the provider, for the fiber-to-Ethernet part).
