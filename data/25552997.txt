This implies that after a certain period of time, you will have the insight to know these things are bad. If you don&#x27;t agree, then are you just a bad programmer? If I have a differing opinion, have I not programmed enough to come to the same conclusion?  What about programming languages like Lisp, Scheme, Nim, and Haxe where Macros are their bread and butter?<p>Different programmers use different tools. If the end product is the desired result, then let people use what works best for them. I don&#x27;t use dynamically typed languages; I avoid them like the plague, but that doesn&#x27;t mean there isn&#x27;t a ton of good work being done in Python.<p>Walter is a brilliant language developer and has a lot of firm opinions of programming semantics. I hope to see him expand upon this post and share why he thinks programmers need to be careful using these constructs.')
