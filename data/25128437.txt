It&#x27;s all been stations that are then left basically where they [0] are so we don&#x27;t really have the experience of how to do that yet. Also that takes a long time because it&#x27;s just slow to move around in space.<p>It does need to support it&#x27;s own mass through during maneuvering and pointing operations as well so it can&#x27;t be completely flimsy. Also you&#x27;d want to get further from the earth to avoid all that drag from a huge mirror in LEO.<p>[0] Beyond periodic small orbit boosting burns')
