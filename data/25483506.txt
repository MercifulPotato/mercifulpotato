We&#x27;ve fallen quite far in Windows, with ads everywhere, hundreds of services that do God-knows-what, fresh installs that break as soon as the updater runs for the first time. I&#x27;m really not impressed and I try to use it as little as possible. Just a bloated, unstable mess designed to sell Microsoft&#x27;s value-added services.')
