It&#x27;s a bit like having finally decided every single one of the big decisions of life in the same split second (because that&#x27;s what it is in the moment).<p>It&#x27;s also stronger than that because the very likely &quot;normal state&quot; of your brain up to that point is severe depression, so you&#x27;re not anywhere near what people might consider an average state of mind, and you&#x27;re getting that strong of a kick.<p>You can ride that euphoria for quite a while even through some of the nagging doubts clawing their way back between the initial feeling and the last action. I doubt much research can be done for what I&#x27;m about to say (and I might be very wrong), but I have the feeling that when you&#x27;re alone (mentally) you can ride that wave for a decent amount of time yet with just a very brief REAL interaction with another human being you can snap out of it. It might not fully dissipate but still break the trance-like state.<p>Not a lot of interactions might feel real like that, but when they do they can be life-changing (for obvious reasons) even when the subject matter is frivolous.<p>You&#x27;ll likely never know just how many you changed, nor why.<p>We often notice how &quot;easy&quot;&#x2F;quick it is to hurt somebody by saying something even light-hearted, but when it comes to that extreme you&#x27;d be surprised how very few words about mundane things can prevent a collapse (at least that time).')
