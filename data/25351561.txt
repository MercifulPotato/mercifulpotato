Does someone get it right? I&#x27;m sure, but my guess is if you did brand survey&#x27;s, people would KNOW that apple gets it pretty right, and most players don&#x27;t.<p>That&#x27;s partly because apple ignore HN. I need a modulare phone that I can ugprade the ram on. Apple is ignoring you, they seal their phones up with epoxy so they are pretty darn waterproof. But for normal users, this is a positive.<p>They call out fake third party batteries. OH NO says HN. For normal users, a plus again.<p>They offer BY FAR the longest and most reliable operating system support. First gen ipad pro&#x27;s STILL have value! My old android tablet has been unsupported since the DAY I bought it.<p>Or built in junkware and adware. If I buy a samsung TV can I be pretty sure it won&#x27;t datamine my viewing habits? Even top competitors turn out to be basically scammers. Will you guarantee me that samsung won&#x27;t jam ads onto my TV after I buy it?<p>&quot;Towards the end of 2019, owners have started to voice their dissatisfaction with larger, increasingly obtrusive, and unrelated ads showing up on their Samsung TVs. These include ads for canned beans or discount supermarkets&quot; - this is on $2,500+ frame art TV&#x27;s etc.<p>It turns out, despite your claims, these other very large companies selling very expensive items are scamming folks to often, it only takes getting burned ONCE by this to just reduce your circle of trust dramatically.<p>Is there a perfect bluetooth device out there? Sure. If I go through the amazon listings will I find that device? I doubt it. If I buy from apple will I get it? I think so.<p>The price of these headphones is ridiculous, I don&#x27;t defend that. If they are able to sell them at this price I&#x27;ll be a bit surprised. But overall, they have built user trust up pretty high.')
