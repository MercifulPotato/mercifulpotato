If it is sharing a document view it could jitter the pixel colour (like a printer dither) or the position of characters.<p>It&#x27;s basically impossible to be sure, though if you had multiple endpoint recordings you could probably identify likely deltas.<p>Examining the state of the zoom client might also be useful, because it is free to do this client side.
