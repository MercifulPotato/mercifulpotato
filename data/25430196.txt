Back when I worked in HPC, I had a Panasas fail hard and it required one of their techs to login with the super special root password. Normally they would do it remotely, but this was at a DoD facility and we couldn&#x27;t make an allowance for that. So instead of sending a tech on site, the support person I was working with gave me the root password and made it very clear I shouldn&#x27;t share their super secret password that allowed (remote) root access. I don&#x27;t remember it exactly, but the password is something very similar to P@nA$as!.')
