I nuked my account and just bookmarked the subs I was subscribed to. Now whenever I feel like I need a hit of Reddit, I visit one of my bookmarks and do a quick catchup. I&#x27;ve done the same with YouTube and have found I spend far less time on these sites now with just the slightly added friction of deleting an account (which I believe now offer no real benefits at all if you&#x27;re just consuming the content).')
