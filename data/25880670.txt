Adding Type2 plugs and kWh meters to street lights is not a technical issue, it&#x27;s a political thing of who gets the money and who pays for the up-front costs.<p>230V&#x2F;8A per car with smart load balancing will charge 100km of charge overnight. Up that to 12 amps and you&#x27;ve covered the majority of Europeans&#x27; daily commute.<p>Won&#x27;t work for the US though, your two hour commutes are Mad Max -levels of madness =)')
