At its core, it&#x27;s simply a heuristic your genetics have supplied you with, to make better certain you will survive and reproduce. Like any other heuristic (hunger, thirst, perhaps even suffocation), it can be overriden with enough conviction; whether you should or should not, is another matter.<p>I&#x27;m reminded of Pavlov&#x27;s dogs. The more you resist against being broken, the harder it will be to bounce back when you do.<p>So, in a Zen Buddhist sort of way, let go -- it&#x27;s unimaginably freeing.<p>For those of more stable temperaments, let the local fire department burn down your house for training, along with all of your belongings inside. I assure you, the results will be splendid; and all that baggage you&#x27;ve carried around -- material, and otherwise -- simply vanishes.<p>Poof; gone!<p>You have no past any more. There is nothing left to tie your sense of self down, and you&#x27;re free to decide to be whatever you wish -- with the aforementioned caveat in mind.<p>Surviving great suffering makes the less trivial in comparison; so too does facing the fear of death make all others disappear.')
