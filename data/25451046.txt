Especially not in quicker time controls. It just cements your current habits unless you&#x27;re explicitly reviewing, changing and working on aspects of your play. You have to be making the right choices, then you can work on speed.<p>Quicker time controls are REALLY good at producing a lot of games for you to identify patterns of your own errors, though! Take a given game, slap on stockfish, then check what tactics you&#x27;re missing and what positional decisions you made that significantly impacted the bar. On an individual level, not so important, but if you start noticing trends in your errors, you can mass-puzzle the areas you&#x27;re weak at, etc.<p>That said, this analysis only works if you know your openings. Contrary to the OP, if your openings are mediocre you can&#x27;t learn that much from your games. Understanding a system or two in depth will help you develop a &#x27;feel&#x27; for what positions are dangerous, which positions are full of potential, etc. At a certain point that intuition will stop requiring 10-15 moves of theory to be sound, and you can start free-styling.')
