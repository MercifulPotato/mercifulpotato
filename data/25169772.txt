Even the most secure generator (or true randomness) will generate &quot;weak&quot; results with dieharder if you run it a few times.<p>Dieharder is useless for everything except spotting obviously and blatanly broken RNGs.  Also, dieharder (like all other statistical tests) make absolutely no statement about security.  A generator that scores high may be trivial to predict.<p>It&#x27;s also worse than PractRand or TestU01.  Generators that score consistently well on dieharder can fail predictably and consistently PractRand and TestU01 (because the generator has actual flaws that Dieharder cannot detect but the others can).  I don&#x27;t see any reason to use Dieharder at all, it&#x27;s ancient and has not been relevant for a long time.')
