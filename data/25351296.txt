Item(by='WorldMaker', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607461258, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25347260, text='Austin Powers borrowed a lot from the original Casino Royale (the 60s spoof version), and the classic 60s spoof duology In Like Flint&#x2F;Our Man Flint (fun watches that still hold up; Austin Powers even directly name drops them). Those 60s spoofs didn&#x27;t kill campy&#x2F;fun James Bond, and also show us evidence of this sort of spoof&#x2F;serious cycle in Bond (and elsewhere) is likely cyclical. If history is to judge, we&#x27;re about to the point where Austin Powers flutters out of collective consciousness again and given the right actors&#x2F;directors&#x2F;producers the Bond movies can do fun stuff again.')
