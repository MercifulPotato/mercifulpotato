Back in the day, using my CD player or cassette player didn&#x27;t seem like hard work.<p>The gulf between the &quot;issues&quot; that these devices solve and real problems in the world (starvation, war, death by covid) has never been wider.<p>I honestly am happy that they&#x27;re useful for people but they feel like devices looking for a real purpose. I know someone with 70+ &quot;smart&quot; lightbulbs and cameras and devices all over his house and I do not understand how turning the light on or off can be considered too difficult for him to do.<p>I think reading through this thread confirms it! Didn&#x27;t mean to target your comment in general but this is as far as I&#x27;ve got reading through this thread.<p>Like you, I wouldn&#x27;t trust the Google or Amazon devices at all!')
