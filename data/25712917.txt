It&#x27;s the yak shaving of &quot;I just want to compile this thing here&quot; that turns into &quot;what options do I need for building Python&quot;, and &quot;how do I then get these third party Python modules with a custom install script to install into the correct Python path. And what exactly should I set PYTHONPATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH to&quot;.<p>Keep in mind that I have to do all this just to build some C++ binary because someone decided to not use autotools.')
