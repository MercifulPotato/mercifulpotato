Everything dies, it is a natural process. None of us, nor will the Earth and Sun itself, escape fate. Learn to appreciate and maximize the time you have.<p>Or take the blue pill and die all the same, you won&#x27;t exist consciously in any way, shape or form anyways, so no harm there. So perhaps its a useful, comforting delusion if you find that you can&#x27;t accept the reality presented by the evidence.')
