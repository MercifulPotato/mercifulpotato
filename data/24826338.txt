This way people can re-sell their items to IKEA, and IKEA will sell it in good state to other people that can re-use it. This seems like it would be better for the environment than everybody logging around heavy furniture cross-country (or cross-continent), because unnecessary transport costs are avoided, and is certainly much better than the status quo of people throwing away old IKEA furniture that is still perfectly usable.<p>To me this seems like a good idea. Do you have any better ideas? Reduce would be <i>theoretically</i> preferable, but good luck convincing people not to use a bed, a desk or a dining room table.')
