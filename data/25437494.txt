Who gets to decide what is true or false, or what is misleading v.s. true?<p>The issue is that different people disagree about what is true and what is lies, and that is the entire point of why we have free speech. Reasonable people can disagree. Who decides which reasonable party gets to forcibly muzzle the other?<p>A true patriot is someone who will give his life in the fight to protect free speech, and he will fight to protect even the speech he personally disagrees with. The people who are against free speech are the true fascists, even though they ignorantly think they&#x27;re against fascism. The truth is they don&#x27;t know <i>how</i> to fight fascism. Censorship ain&#x27;t it. Censorship is nothing but a cornerstone of dictatorships.<p>EDIT: Another way to say it is that freedom of speech is required for healthy democracies, because an open debate about political ideas is how societies reach a consensus. The minute you give one person the ability to stop another person from speaking, you have created a dictatorship. Speech is a human right and the most basic of freedoms, and our Founding Fathers put it in our constitution to stop people like you from eroding our freedoms.')
