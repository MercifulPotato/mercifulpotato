That&#x27;s the beauty of Excel - but _managing_ these apps is the nightmare of my specific profession :)<p>I&#x27;d say two things would make it better:\n - Have a &quot;code&quot; version of the cell editor that has formatting&#x2F;indentation + basic linting. [Sometimes 75% of the challenge is reading the code in linear fashion and figuring out what it does]<p>- Integrate git-like versioning and some sharing features with Office365. Basically, make it so that you can roll-forward or roll-back on both the code and the contents, and make it so that you are _not_ emailing files around to share them.')
