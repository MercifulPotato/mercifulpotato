The top 1% of Americans pay 37% of the tax burden yet own over 60% of the wealth.  They are grossly underpaying.<p>Cutting entitlements and putting MORE of a financial burden on people who have nothing isn&#x27;t going to fix the problem.  AT BEST it&#x27;ll result in massive social unrest and the end of the American Experiment.<p>&quot;I know you can&#x27;t afford healthcare, and can barely afford food, but we&#x27;re going to need to take away your food stamps, and your subsidized housing because Larry Ellison just can&#x27;t afford another 1% increase in taxes&quot;.  That&#x27;s what you&#x27;re going with?')
