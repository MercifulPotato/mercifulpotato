Item(by='dragonwriter', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603150887, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24819445, text='&gt; I&#x27;ve said this here before I think, but the Segway inventor was claiming cities would be designed around it and everyone was laughing, but with an electric scooter I can totally see this happening.<p>Powered (both electric and gas) scooters in the same form factor as is now becoming more popular were around before Segway; Segwayâ€™s innovation was a new form factor tied to a balance-based control system (sure, the brand later got applied to traditional-layour scooters, but that wasn&#x27;t what Kamen was hyping when made his bold predictions.) The key enabling developments from the scooters before Segway to the modern electric scooters were battery improvements; the original Segway was mostly a distraction. (There are balance-based devices which owe something to it, but basically-traditional-layout scooters like Boosted Rev aren&#x27;t among them.)')
