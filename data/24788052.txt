It&#x27;s insanely barbaric and shouldn&#x27;t be happerning. But I think people like Alex Jones have given it more credit. I don&#x27;t have enough data to make valid conclusion about it. But the Falun Gong practitioners I have met scared the crap out of me. It felt a lot like Scientology vibes. Does that mean we should harvest their organs? No, clearly. That&#x27;s insane to like the nth-degree.<p>e: also, as the wiki states, Ethan Gutmann&#x27;s investigations are pretty striking. Same as the China Tribunal in London. This has moved on a lot since I last read up on it. Christ.')
