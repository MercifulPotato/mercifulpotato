Makes brand lock-in pretty difficult.<p>If I had the option for either a pure-electric or diesel-electric I would have seriously considered it. At least in our case the workload is a lot of hauling, intermittent groundwork and field mowing(&lt;10ac) all of which would have fit really well.<p>Also all the JD DRM stuff only applies in the larger 100hp+ market. In the SCUT&#x2F;CUT&#x2F;Utility Tractor market there&#x27;s a fairly robust set of companies(Kubota, LS, JD, Mahindra, Yanmar, etc).')
