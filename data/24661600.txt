Item(by='apexalpha', descendants=None, kids=[24661918], score=None, time=1601639031, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24660887, text='<i>One of the difficult things about racism is that it does not matter how we (ie, people of European descent) feel about it, but how the people we&#x27;re talking about feel about it.</i><p>For what it&#x27;s worth you are doing the EXACT same thing the post in this article is about: you are pushing a very American view on racism.<p>First of all, racism is absolutely not White -&gt; Black. Or White -&gt; Aboriginal. If you think that I&#x27;d assume you haven&#x27;t met a lot of people form other parts of the world. Racism is everywhere and it&#x27;s not a White-only issue. That&#x27;s a very American view.<p>Second of all, it absolutely DOES matter what &#x27;we&#x27; (white people) think of it. Saying only people we talk about get to have a say in this is also a very American viewpoint.<p>We really don&#x27;t need to &quot;defer to an aboriginal person&quot;, as you say. Just like this article states you are now assuming that all aboriginal people agree on this subject.<p>Saying we aren&#x27;t qualified to say what&#x27;s racist but we need a minority for that is the kind of generalizations the article pushes against.')
