Item(by='iamsrp', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610326401, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25720148, text='Dexter has a couple of different input systems: PocketSphinx and DeepSpeech.<p>PocketSphinx seems to have better language coverage but lower accuracy than DeepSpeech, which only has English and Mandarin Chinese.<p>DeepSpeech was not great about 2 years ago when I first started Dexter and, being a Brit, I had to fake an (awful) American accent to make it work. It&#x27;s come on well in that time though; I can use my own voice now, which is a relief to those near by. No clue how good its Mandarin recognition is however.<p>Other folks in surrounding threads have flagged Kaldi which I&#x27;ll try to take a look at as well (though it also looks to be only English and Mandarin too).')
