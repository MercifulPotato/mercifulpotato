And the rest of the bullets were pointing at why it&#x27;s difficult to pinpoint them with additional terms.<p>&gt; The easiest way around this is for a blanket catch-all clause such as &quot;you have 1 year to start negotiations with us, after which this license automatically expires&quot;.<p>Which is great if you have some kind of legal foothold on megacorp, but if they&#x27;re sufficiently legally isolated from you via intermediaries then additional clauses won&#x27;t help.<p>&gt; AGPLv3 is enforceable by contract law<p>In some jurisdictions (and copyright law in most others), but it doesn&#x27;t magically hold third-parties responsible. It holds first-party users of your license responsible in a way which transitively affects third parties (copyleft being the mechanism). You might then claim that you could just do that for this contract too, but that&#x27;s precisely my 3rd point above; doing so is unnecessarily restrictive to &lt;X randocorps.<p>Elaborating on those restrictions, if randocorp is directly responsible for transitive users then they take on a huge risk whenever they have any customer because that customer might acquire megacorp as a customer at any point in time unbeknownst to them. If randocorp is not responsible for transitive users, then the mechanism for generating a connection between you and megacorp needs to be something like copyleft, but critically it has to somehow apply to contracts and interactions beyond copyright. At least it does if I&#x27;m understanding you correctly -- hypothetically, if you build a search tool, randocorp hosts the search tool, and megacorp buys searches from randocorp, would you like them to be targeted by the revenue sharing portion of your &gt;X licenses? Anyway, assuming that&#x27;s what you meant, copyleft by itself doesn&#x27;t suffice, and you&#x27;d need something significantly more invasive than AGPLv3 to accomplish your goals.')
