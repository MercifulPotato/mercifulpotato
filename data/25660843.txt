Like - totally clean&#x2F;non-offensive t-shirt and jeans.<p>In a lot of my engineering roles I have had to be internal&#x2F;external facing and do things like budget presentations, work with partners, etc. Before that, I was a general web&#x2F;app dev and we would get pulled along to client meetings all the time to collect spec, ensure that it was a good sales fit, etc. I&#x27;m not saying I had to be fully decked-out but being able to throw on a button down and tuck it in means that you &quot;fit-in&quot; to these situations.<p>For me, if someone is showing up in a t-shirt and jeans it&#x27;s a red flag that you can&#x27;t be bothered to dress semi-professionally which has been an occasional (but hard) requirement of me since day-1 of my career. 100% this all is anecdotal, and specific to my own needs&#x2F;experiences.')
