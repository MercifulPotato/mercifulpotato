That would be insane; all human activity is full of errors.<p>What we are saying is that literally all experts and the people who run the elections themselves — from both political parties — have stated that they don’t believe that there is any organized fraud, and that any error they have isn’t significant.<p>The fact that several recounts didn’t change the results shows exactly that: the detected errors did not make a significant impact on the results. The election was safe to call because Biden was ahead by more than the margin of error.<p>There is one man who has objectively lied constantly for his entire life in the public record, who had lied about his results in polls (both political and entertainment related) his entire life, and who has repeatedly stated that he will not admit defeat. (In the past, he even called magazines under a fake name to try to convince them that he should be higher in their “richest people” rankings!) On the other side, we have literally every election official in the country across party lines.')
