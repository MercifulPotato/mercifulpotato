They work so they can:<p>1. Have real practical advantage over other people in their community\n2. Have real practical power to shape their community<p>For #1 that&#x27;s mostly the middle class, who want better schools for their children, and safe pleasant environments for their families. Actions that remove that incentive, make the middle class irrelevant. Very few people are willing to work 9+ hour days during the start of their career, just so they can have more toys, and not a larger house in a good neighborhood later in life.<p>For #2 that&#x27;s mostly the elite. If they&#x27;re denied influence via money, they&#x27;ll simply go into politics or religion where we&#x27;ll end up with a society shaped by lucky <i>charismatic</i> people, and not necessarily anyone who has any skill. At least we can say non-hereditary wealthy people are lucky, and skilled as opposed to just being lucky.')
