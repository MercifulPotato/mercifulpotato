The rational part comes second. Daniel Kahneman calls these System 1 and System 2, respectively, but more colloquially they’re called the lizard brain and the monkey brain.<p>This doesn’t mean that we should ignore the facts. But it does tell us that any message devoid of emotional content will be absolutely ineffective in changing our behavior. It’s not what our brains evolved for. If we want to change our behavior, for better or for worse, we need to satisfy that first brain.</i><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alexpetralia.github.io&#x2F;epistemology&#x2F;2018&#x2F;11&#x2F;01&#x2F;communicating-effectively.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alexpetralia.github.io&#x2F;epistemology&#x2F;2018&#x2F;11&#x2F;01&#x2F;commu...</a>')
