They don&#x27;t want us going P2P and using the network the way it was designed. They want to sell to people who buy 10x the bandwidth that they need and only consume contnet. People who find innovative and new uses for tech are exactly what the ISPs don&#x27;t want. They don&#x27;t want to upgrade their networks. That&#x27;s why we have data caps, blocks on self-hosting, and shitty upload speeds.')
