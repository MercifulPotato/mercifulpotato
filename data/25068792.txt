It&#x27;s entirely possible that they&#x27;re missinformed and it wouldn&#x27;t be for the first time.<p>I however cannot find anything that says differently from apple or a source showing how non signed systems can be booted on this chip.<p>The only thing I could find was apples statement that your system is even more secure now because non signed code won&#x27;t be run.<p>Do you have any resources I can read so we can clear up this misunderstanding?<p>Or are you referencing my auto-correct error which replaced cant with can? If that is the case... I&#x27;m sorry for that but it&#x27;s too late to fix and my intent is (I think) quiet clear considering I said that they&#x27;re both locked and this lock is without an off switch.')
