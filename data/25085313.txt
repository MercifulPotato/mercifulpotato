You flip one bit on a 32kb frame and you&#x27;ve gotta resend the whole damn thing, and if you&#x27;re doing TCP over TCP that retransmission might happen a dozen times or more due to the way the timers interact.<p>If you absolutely must do TCP over TCP the only sensible thing to do is have the outer tunnel terminate and buffer the stream internally.  This is fairly memory intensive so routers won&#x27;t do it, but applications can get away with it.')
