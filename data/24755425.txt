It may well be that case that, right now, most of the arbitrage of the sort you’re discussing is done by HFT firms, but I see no reason at all to assume that a market in which latency is less relevant will not be efficiently arbitraged.<p>There are certainly human beings who <i>manually</i> arbitrage some markets even today, but that tends to be more complicated kinds of arbitrage.  The only real connections between latency and trading strategy that I know of are:<p>Certain strategies don’t work if you aren’t the fastest kid on the block.<p>Certain strategies are too complicated to do if you are the fastest kid on the block. (For an example of the latter, you are unlikely to succeed in reading news reports, doing complex analyses, and executing trades based on your analyses in 100ns. No amount of money spent on top-of-the-line nVidia gear or tensor processing units is going to change this.)')
