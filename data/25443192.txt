Depressing, perhaps.<p>I&#x27;m saying, though, that a hack can be sophisticated even if the initial compromise was something pretty basic like this.<p>As an example, <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;about.fb.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;bug-bounty-program-10th-anniversary&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;about.fb.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;bug-bounty-program-10th-an...</a><p>&gt; Earlier this year we received a report from Selamet Hariyanto who identified a low impact issue in our Content Delivery Network (CDN), a global network of servers that deliver content to people accessing our platform around the world, where a subset of our CDN URLs could have been accessible after they were set to expire. After fixing this bug, our internal researchers found a rare scenario where a very sophisticated attacker could have escalated to remote code execution. As always, we rewarded the researcher based on the maximum possible impact of their report, rather than on the lower-severity issue initially reported to us. It is now our highest bounty â€“ $80,000.')
