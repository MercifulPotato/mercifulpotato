Item(by='baobabKoodaa', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605001024, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25041893, text='&gt; Your entire comment is essentially &quot;I have no objection to anything you actually said I said but I still want to build a strawman to tear down&quot;<p>I laid out very specific objections to very specific claims made by you. In particular, I used the knife attack example to demonstrate that - contrary to what you claimed - &quot;innocent until proven guilty&quot; is not an obligation that people must apply to their thoughts and opinions. And I very specifically asked &quot;If you still disagree, please explain how this obligation should work out in the context of the knifeman attack.&quot; Based on your tone I get the impression you&#x27;re still holding on to your extreme belief about &quot;innocent until proven guilty&quot;, but you&#x27;re not willing to reconcile it with this example. Instead, you&#x27;re trying to weasel out with vague claims about strawmanning. You know, if someone actually was strawmanning, you would be able to point out how the strawman is different from the actual argument presented. In this case you don&#x27;t even attempt to do that, because there is no strawman, you were very clear that people have an obligation to assume everyone is innocent until proven guilty (in their thoughts and opinions, at all times).<p>Since you&#x27;re not willing to address the claim you made in the context of my example which clearly demonstrates that your claim was nonsensical, there&#x27;s no point in continuing this conversation beyond this.')
