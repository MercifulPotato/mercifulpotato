I do not endorse it. But I cannot completely agree with the article and given that the comments on site are turned off (understandable), this might be the place to raise objections.<p>I think there is an obvious flaw in the comparison. The larger the entity you want to have under your control, the less likely is that you succeed just by occupying one concrete location. An ancient city-state was tiny compared to even modern Greece, much less so than modern and fairly decentralized USA.<p>By storming an important government building, you can do some damage (esp. reputational one), kill certain people, but overthrow of a political system in a huge country is much harder to pull off. In modern history, such primitive actions usually fell flat on their face after mere hours. Which is precisely what happened here.<p>I would be more worried about a potential &quot;rebellion in the provinces&quot;, which is basically what Francesco Franco did. That would have a potential to spin into a full fledged civil war or violent secession. This is something that was effective in certain cases.')
