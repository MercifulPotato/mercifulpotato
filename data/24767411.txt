Yes, Netlify is amazing at first, and yes, it&#x27;s a pleasure to build sites without fighting a wonky old-school PHP CMS.<p>However, this will wear thin after you start to care about creating regular content and the nuances of SEO (as the person who wrote this article discovered). I&#x27;ve gotten SSG fatigue over the last couple of years and have completely switched over to building marketing sites and blogs in Webflow.<p>No worries about build process, no setting up SEO from scratch every time, no wiring up a wonky headless CMS and building rigid content models, no writing blog posts in VScode and then forgetting how I set up my front matter, no PITA trying to set up a new section on your site and then realizing it breaks your headless CMS wiring, Etc. etc.')
