I like to give myself purpose or pretend I have one. In 2020, I began a project and turned it into a book, collecting the stories and gaining insight into the lives of 530 women from every country in the entire world. And well, it is now historical to have done it. Is it so meaningless to get a perspective of what life is like for a woman living in that country? You can tell a lot about a country by the way it treats its women. Looking back on this project in 2120, a hundred years from now, will it have been so meaningless? Or will the way these women describe their lives be exactly the same? <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mylifeasawomanproject.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mylifeasawomanproject.com</a>')
