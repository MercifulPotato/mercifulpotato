I expect this to change overtime as more migrate to Serverless but Cloudflare is like Serverless 2.0 (Durable Objects, runtime APIs) while everyone is building for 1.0 (quick cache clearing and server less functions).<p>Has been a couple years and still nothing I think.<p>The link on this post is cool to compete with Netlify and eat up all those small simple static sites but we developers really need a bit more of an ecosystem for app development (framework)')
