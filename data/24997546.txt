But when someone posts on Twitter, and the platform <i>literally doesn&#x27;t let them post</i> the link they want to, that seems to me to be far more egregious - and can definitely be called censorship.<p>So that which Google could come up with a left-wing site they de-ranked, and Twitter and Facebook couldn&#x27;t, becomes even more damning for them. <i>Their</i> censorship is far more real.')
