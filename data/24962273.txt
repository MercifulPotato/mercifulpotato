Item(by='Lammy', descendants=None, kids=[24962509, 24963056], score=None, time=1604262935, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24960166, text='The PRISM slide you&#x27;re incorrectly referencing shows Skype collection beginning &quot;2&#x2F;6&#x2F;11&quot;, which in our stupid American short-date format means June 2nd 2011. It&#x27;s fine if you choose to believe that date has nothing to do with Microsoft&#x27;s announced-in-May-2011 acquisition of a service that began operation in August 2003, but it&#x27;s very rude of you to denigrate my completely reasonable observation as a &quot;conspiracy theory&quot;. Enjoy your Skype calls :)')
