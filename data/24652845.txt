For some they can&#x27;t ask or run a background check until after an offer is made. For some jurisdictions they can&#x27;t discriminate on that basis unless it&#x27;s highly relevant to the job (i.e. convicted sex offender can&#x27;t work with children). For some jurisdictions it&#x27;s totally legal to run the background check upfront and to discriminate at will.')
