She said something like &quot;imagine I&#x27;m an alien, and tell me how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich&quot;. I got so caught up in sharing my special technique I had at the time (extra glob of PB in the middle after covering both sides) that I just got a bit deflated when she stopped me to ask what I meant by what seemed like a basic step. (It was something like &quot;okay, I have the bread&quot;, and I hadn&#x27;t asked her to pick up the knife before applying the peanut butter)<p>Oddly I don&#x27;t remember the point of the exercise at all, or if we did anything building on it. We certainly didn&#x27;t do any programming.')
