Item(by='skohan', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606388558, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25218062, text='&gt; Thinking in terms on software design and architecture you can start using a similar vocabulary.<p>But I think that&#x27;s exactly the example of where the metaphor starts to give us bad information.<p>The biggest difference between the brain and a computer is that the brain is fundamentally parallel.  Not more threads in a GPU parallel, but rather the processing the brain does <i>is</i> the manifestation of the parallel actions of a mass of information processing units interacting with one another.<p>To give an example of where using the computer metaphor gives rise to very misleading assumptions because of this: in many cases with a computer, more data equals more cost.  If you need to iterate through a million data points to get a result vs. a thousand, it&#x27;s going to take a lot more time to reach the answer.  But with the brain it&#x27;s precisely the opposite.  More data points means a denser network of interconnections which can give a better answer sooner.')
