Which is also very much what you&#x27;re looking for with trials.<p>Having things look good after 3 months in a vaccine trial doesn&#x27;t tell you if they look good after a year necessarily - and all of this is really weighted against &quot;a sensible response to limit the spread of the virus is possible, the US is just not doing it&quot;.<p>EDIT: The other possibility is that a vaccine that just straight up doesn&#x27;t work very well would also make the situation worse - churn out millions of doses, get a limited amount of immunity in the recipient population, government is compelled to wind back &quot;mechanical&quot; spread prevention measures - and the epidemic cinders for a while and then rips through the population because everything thinks they&#x27;re immune.')
