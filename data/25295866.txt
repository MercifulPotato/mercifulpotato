I too have been paying the high prices to support the idea of on demand new releases that skipped the theatre. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if this means a price hike on the HBO subscription price, and I&#x27;d be willing to pay more for that in this case.<p>Before covid, we still got to the theaters once in a while, but this will be awesome. Hopefully you can find a good babysitter and get back to the theater more too (when it&#x27;s safe of course).')
