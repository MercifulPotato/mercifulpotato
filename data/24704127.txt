The answer to the question however is that would depend on the stimulant being ingested. If it is an amphetamine like adderall, there isn&#x27;t that much cross interaction in their pharmacology. Adderall (amphetamines) in ADHD medication based doses primarily act in increasing dopamine in between neurons while psilocin is primarily acts on serotonin and its receptors. While there might be some compounding sympathetic nervous responses at standard therapeutic doses it is unlikely to cause any noticeable side effects.')
