I&#x27;d be impressed if someone here has an account on every chat client here.  Back over a decade ago, the chat client you used I felt in many ways represented who you might be in the world.  Living in the U.S.:  ICQ: techy, AIM: your close friends, msn: international contacts.  And no, there was no skype at this time.<p>In retrospect, I felt that skype was one of the first here to begin gaining momentum bridging many users into one platform.  Not saying here it was good or bad, but an observation my own contacts migrating new a new platform.  I had used pidgeon as long as I was actively using a desktop computer which was &quot;always running&quot; so I could see who is online, away, etc.  It was a norm then, I find to believe to share your online status.')
