Bernie, AOC, etc. The Dems did not manage to show that these are not the mainstream democratic goals.<p>The pictures of rioters, combined with &quot;defund the police&quot; scared a lot of people, and if you start out skeptical, you might not look close enough that this doesn&#x27;t mean &quot;get rid of the police&quot;, but &quot;descope the police, let them do their job, and find other people to do the things which are not their job&quot;.')
