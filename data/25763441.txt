With minimal UI support it&#x27;d be orders-of-magnitude more effective at raising money for WireGuard than a web link, regardless of Apple&#x27;s markup.<p><i>Dumb question 2:</i> Why isn&#x27;t it a good idea to create a non-profit, or distribute via a partner non-profit, to reduce the App Store take to 0%? (Even without that, Apple&#x27;s take would be 15% until the app hits $1 million in annual net sales there.)<p>I see people in the thread asking for special treatment for this (important and worthy, of course) project, which Apple obviously can&#x27;t do that without creating a thousand other problems.')
