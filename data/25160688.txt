The article clarifies it in great detail.<p>Let&#x27;s compare this to the recent PC brigade efforts of banning &quot;master&#x2F;slave&quot;, or &quot;blacklist&#x2F;whitelist&quot; terms in software. Whoever introduced &quot;master&#x2F;slave&quot; terms into e.g. database software certainly did not have an agenda to defend slavery, yet people still got mad.<p>And if something as minuscule as a simple word can spark so much outrage, then a mainstream, ridiculously popular game doing such blatant and heavy-handed history whitewashing of an entire culture is a veritable powder keg waiting to explode.<p>(&quot;Whitewashing&quot; is also a potentially dangerous word, I hope I did not trigger someone here.)<p>But you are correct in one thing - Ubisoft, being a greedy corporation, optimized for getting the most money, even at the expense of making the game&#x27;s &quot;made by diverse team&quot; disclaimer a sad, tone-deaf joke.')
