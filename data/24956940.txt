So to get Earth to leave the solar system (the inverse of capturing a planet under the most optimal circumstance), you would need to give it 12 km&#x2F;s.  Earth is ~6 * 10^24 kg, so that represents ~4.3 * 10^32 joules.  The sun gives out around 3.8 * 10^26 joules per second (i.e. watts).<p>So with perfect efficiency, working just from conservation of energy, this would require around 13 days of the entire energy output of the sun.  Or around a trillion years at Earth&#x27;s current energy consumption.')
