Sometimes one side of the regulator has jumped off track, or one side gets sticky and hangs up. The whole raising and lowering the window mechanism provides lots of opportunity to put a kink in some tempered glass - <i>especially</i> when that window is designed to fit tightly to shut out wind noise or improve aerodynamics.<p>A quick search suggests that Tesla&#x27;s had intermittent window regulator problems in the model 3 and others, and there sure are a lot of ads for replacement&#x2F;rebuilt Model 3 rear door window regulators.')
