Even if we restrict to just fission power, on a thousand year time horizon we can expect thorium reactors and extraction of uranium from seawater, which multiplies the available energy by a factor of at least a thousand.<p>Furthermore, on that time horizon we can expect fusion to be available, and deuterium from seawater multiplies the available energy by a factor of about a billion.<p>Not to mention that on a thousand year time horizon, we should be making full use of the available solar energy in Earth&#x27;s vicinity by means of orbital power stations, in which case we won&#x27;t even <i>need</i> any other energy source on that time horizon except for specialized uses like fast spacecraft.<p><i>&gt; On a thousand year time horizon it&#x27;s entirely plausible that maintaining a purely renewable economy makes the production of certain materials impractically expensive</i><p>And it also makes it practically certain that any material that&#x27;s that expensive to produce <i>won&#x27;t be needed anyway</i>, since cheaper substitutes will be found.<p>&quot;Limited resources&quot; by itself simply doesn&#x27;t strike me as a plausible Great Filter.')
