On desktop browsers, there&#x27;s no forced shuffle &#x2F; variance. It just plays the album from start to finish, and, of course, no ads. Pick something manually you like. When you&#x27;re done, pick a an artist from their list of similar artists. Play entire albums at a time. If you&#x27;re not immediately dissatisfied, you&#x27;ll probably feel good about the next half hour of music.')
