I think we&#x27;ve failed to teach young people about what is right and wrong and why. You can have the government applying blanket control over things to prevent bad actors and disinformation in society. You can also teach people from a young age what is right and wrong so that when they grow up and are in positions to make these decisions, they won&#x27;t need  blanket decree by the government saying &quot;no you can&#x27;t do this&quot;. The topic may come up in a boardroom and everyone ideally would say &quot;what the fuck? That&#x27;s not a good idea. Let&#x27;s not do that because it&#x27;s wrong even if it makes us money&quot;.<p>This is more of a bottom-up approach which can take a few decades to show results. With that argument, I&#x27;d be inclined to look back on the last 20-60 years. What have we been teaching&#x2F;instilling in our population when they were young? I look at the stuff that&#x27;s happening as a symptom of a long history where we dropped the ball repeatedly.')
