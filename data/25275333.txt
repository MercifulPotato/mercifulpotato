A program can exit via ‘return’ calls (as normal), or at any time by some internal function way down the stack throwing an exception for something that could have been an error code.<p>Exceptions are not Structured Programming: they are worse than goto, because at least goto is scope-local. If, maybe, the language enforced that all throwable exceptions are declared by the prototype, then it’d be alright. But I don’t know of any that do. So, given a function call, will it error out? Can you know without inspecting the source, if you even have it?')
