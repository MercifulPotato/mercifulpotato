It is  interesting to see how this prerequisite is set as an unchangeable principle, with the result of very complex solutions to try to make the results representative, when one could simply release one self from the winner takes it all limitation and just count each vote and make a representative result from there. This is how we do it in Norway. If you go through the numbers,the representativeness of the Norwegian parliament is at almost 100%, with a special system for what we call &quot;distribution seats&quot; for the smallest parties to avoid the negative effect of having few voters spread across voting districts. I think this article shows how easily we humans fall into the trap of creating complex solutions to simple problems.')
