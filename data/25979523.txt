The things that make or detract from HN being a friendly and welcoming place have a lot to do with its size and heterogeneity -- ideology included. You&#x27;re trying to neuter the disagreement and rephrase it in terms of a question. That&#x27;s not always a bad thing, but in some cases you really do just disagree. If that&#x27;s going to be the case, why not be upfront about it, so long as you can be civil? (GP&#x27;s point does seem to be phrased in a pretty civil manner IMO)')
