I love these books that really transport you there, like having a really good friend explain things to you casually.<p>First of these is &quot;Street of Eternal Happiness: Big City Dreams Along a Shanghai Road&quot;. What it&#x27;s like to grow up while having family in a labor camp. What it&#x27;s like to have your entire business or house confiscated. How hard it is to be a student. Also just plenty of interesting little tidbits on day-to-day life.<p>Second one is &quot;The Empty Mirror: Experiences in a Japanese Zen Monastery&quot;. It&#x27;s about a foreigner who leaves his life behind and joins a zen monastery in Japan. It covers in detail the day-to-day experience of it, such as collapsing on temple grounds from lack of sleep during particularly demanding meditation sessions. But monks are human too, and on some occasions sneak over the temple walls for some fun outside.<p>Both of these transfer to you the &quot;feel&quot; of these places.')
