Often a precise externality tax is too difficult for a government to implement so a ban is done instead. The UK banned free plastic bags at large supermarkets and it was incredibly effective.<p>It makes sense for rural and suburban services to cost more in taxes because they cost more for the government to deliver (simple example being a more extensive road network). The status quo is actually that rural and suburban living is being subsidised by government.<p>I agree with you about the soda tax though!<p>Edit: I see you updated your comment but I will leave mine as is.')
