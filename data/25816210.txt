What kind of editors is he using, anyway?<p>What I _don&#x27;t_ like is his coding style. If he&#x27;s writing C++, let him use modern C++...<p>* He should use C++ standard library header names, not C library headers.<p>* He should use std::array&#x27;s rather than plain arrays.<p>* He asks whether there&#x27;s a way to define arithmetic ops that&#x27;s simpler&#x2F;shorter than using macros - perhaps not, but using lambdas, `std::arrays`, and `&lt;algorithm&gt;` and `&lt;numeric&gt;`, you can get pretty close.<p>* Way way way too much magic numbers.<p>* Seems like a bunch of wheel-reinvention. Aren&#x27;t there libraries for raw interaction with the hardware? e.g. EGA&#x2F;VGA palettes?<p>etc.')
