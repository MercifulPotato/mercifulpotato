I believe primality testing was suggested as a topic for the prize by a panel of scientific advisors, who were mostly mathematicians.<p>In that timeframe, the main technical advances that helped GIMPS get more efficient were being made by Richard E.

If these folks are trying to help governments keep a monopoly on expertise about number theory and the difficulty of the RSA problem, they seem to be doing a pretty bad job of it.')
