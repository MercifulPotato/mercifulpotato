Each service publishes its protobuf files to a repository or registry during the build step, and if you want to call it from another service you just import the protobuf file and get a defined and documented interface with little to no boilerplate required to use. Protobuf has clear rules on how to evolve the interface in a backwards compatible way, so services can usually stay on the old definition until you need some new functionality, at which point you import the newest definitions.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;uber-archive&#x2F;idl" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;uber-archive&#x2F;idl</a> defines a good workflow for this, though the tool is sadly unmaintained. Done right it really reduces the pain of crossing repository boundaries.')
