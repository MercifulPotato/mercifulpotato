And you&#x27;ll learn all sorts of things that never come up in simulated environments. Something like the nvidia jetbot (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nvidia.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;autonomous-machines&#x2F;embedded-systems&#x2F;jetbot-ai-robot-kit&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nvidia.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;autonomous-machines&#x2F;embedded-sy...</a>) is easy enough to get started without much fuss and thanks to the onboard camera and GPU, can get you pretty far in implementing advanced deep learning-based algorithms.<p>(That said, the default camera isn&#x27;t that great, which you can consider either part of the fun, or just making your life unnecessarily harder. I would consider adding something like a realsense D435i to get IMU+depth for state estimation).')
