But that still wouldn&#x27;t be a charitable interpretation. Please follow the hn guidelines.<p>Masks and social distancing are always important, and <i>always</i> reduce the likelihood of spread. There are situations when those aren&#x27;t possible. For example my dentist can&#x27;t exactly maintain 6 feet of distance from me at all times. But can I wear a mask while in the office.<p>For that reason we should maintain social distancing and mask precautions where possible, to keep the chance of spread low.  While most transmission is via super spreader individuals, you can&#x27;t know if the one person you give covid-19 will end up a spreader.')
