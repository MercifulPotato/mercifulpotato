Many API formats pack many logical entities in a single response, and that doesn&#x27;t work well with caches.<p>Wouldn&#x27;t it be nice if the next paradigm shift in API development goes towards every entity being addressable, cacheable by a browser but not suffering from the penalty of having to do many requests?<p>That&#x27;s mostly where my work on Prefer-Push came from.
