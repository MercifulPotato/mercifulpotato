Going down the route of &quot;if you become successful, you&#x27;ll get &quot;nationalized&quot; and placed in the public domain&quot; seems to be, well, not likely to get much support.<p>Of course nothing stops you creating a project, placing it in the public domain, and then driving the project, getting funding, attracting an audience, becoming a meaningful social good. (See SQLite as an example of this approach.)<p>But turning over existing, valuable, successful projects to a &quot;Trusted Public Body&quot; (whatever that is? trusted by whom? which public? .org debacle anyone?) is simply a good way to kill successful projects.<p>And that&#x27;s before we get to impossible questions like &quot;who decides what gets moved to public domain?&quot; - the Greek government? Silicon Value investors? my mom?')
