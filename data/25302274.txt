What you describe is how InnoDB works.<p>PostgreSQL stores the actual records separately from the primary key index so the actual records won&#x27;t fragment but the primary key index will. The records themselves will roughly be stored in insertion order. A random primary key in PostgreSQL mainly means that inserts into the primary key index will be more expensive and that it will bloat the primary key index to some extent.')
