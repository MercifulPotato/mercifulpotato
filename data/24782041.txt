I have an iPad pro, 13&quot; MBP and work-issued 15&quot; MBP, and all have different sized USB C chargers. You can charge them with any of the above, but the smaller chargers can&#x27;t keep up with the more demanding devices. This was already the case with the iPad vs iPhone charger, and the older magsafe chargers as well that came in different sizes.')
