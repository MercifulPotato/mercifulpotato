Gaining knowledge and expertise in one area can inform your work in another. The idea would be to broaden abilities, not focus on being &#x27;exclusively prepared&#x27;.<p>&gt; the biggest value of a university degree is teaching someone how to think and learn in combination with some domain knowledge.<p>I would add also: &#x27;how to work&#x27;, &#x27;how to learn&#x27; and &#x27;who to know&#x27;. By &#x27;certs&#x27; I didn&#x27;t just mean tech specializations. Courses can be about broader topics. A course on politics can be absolutely beneficial to an engineer. A more modular approach could also encourage lifelong learning rather than the &quot;checkbox&quot; that a degree satisfies.<p>&gt;We have accreditation boards to determine what is required for a common base.<p>That&#x27;s the problem. Those boards&#x2F;requirements vary based on Universities and available instructors and resources. Yet, everyone comes out with the same degree.')
