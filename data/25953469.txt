Item(by='striking', descendants=None, kids=[25973360, 25954613, 25953663], score=None, time=1611890914, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25953149, text='I&#x27;ve heard people &#x27;just ask questions&#x27; or &#x27;make observations&#x27; or similar a million times before, and you most certainly have comments that fit the profile of what you&#x27;ve been arguing in favor of. It reads like a deflection, as a result.<p>Moreover, this is kind of what I mean by comments that aren&#x27;t falsifiable, that don&#x27;t really add anything. You&#x27;re not giving me anything to work with when you gesture vaguely to theoretical comments rather than specific examples. All I have to go on are yours. And yours make for very good counterexamples.')
