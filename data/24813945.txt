A laser galvanometer is a precision closed-loop voice coil that translates input voltage to a specific position&#x2F;displacement.  The mechanical components to ensure repeatability and the electrical components that &#x27;close the loop&#x27; are what generally make them (much) more expensive than speakers.<p>Picking off a mosquito will require positional accuracy of say 1mm.  If you want a range of 10 meters you&#x27;re going to need positional accuracy of ~.1 milliradian.  Most galvos have a rotational range of .3-.5 radians, so you&#x27;re not going to need extreme positional accuracy relative to what&#x27;s on the market.  A controller, pair of quality 16 bit dacs, galvo hardware and decent power supply should be adequate.  I have some of the cheap $300 ebay 2-axis galvos and those are <i>not</i> sufficient.  You&#x27;re going to need a step up and are easily getting into the thousand dollar range for the galvos alone.')
