You can use poems that should rhyme, plus commentary from linguists at the time, to guess what certain words would sound like “back then”.<p>Just saying that Korean is another super rare but fun random fact that I have heard of being used at least once in combination with ancient Chinese poems, to guess at the old Chinese pronunciation.')
