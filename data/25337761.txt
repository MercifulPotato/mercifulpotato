The majority of the world oceans are unpoliced. And honestly, I don&#x27;t see why I, as a developing nation, shouldn&#x27;t overfish the seas. The developed nations (excluding perhaps the US for being so young) are where they are because they chopped their forests, killed their wildlife, and burned what else they could find.<p>England isn&#x27;t going to reforest. Germany isn&#x27;t going to reintroduce all the wildlife they hunted. And the peoples of neither nation have paid reparations to the Earth (for good reason, they can&#x27;t afford to). If I were running China, the right thing for me to do is to strip the Earth dry, and then a century later when I&#x27;m rich demand that &quot;All nations must do their part&quot;.<p>After all, it&#x27;s not like anyone will make me pay for everything that happened a century ago. So you&#x27;ll either have to make me not do this or you&#x27;re going to have to suck it up. China&#x27;s navy doesn&#x27;t have the ability to protect her shipping fleets so that&#x27;s her problem.')
