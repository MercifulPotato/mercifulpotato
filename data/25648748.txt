It was only in 2006 that Shiites and the SSNP finally kicked them out of South Lebanon, where they regularly committed war atrocities. Add to this the historical genocides that the nation of Israel completed and rejoice in within their scriptures -- the Ammonites, the Moabites, the Jebusites, the Canaanites (the assault on which happened the day after the Israelites convinced them to get circumcized, then went door to door killing them while their dicks hurt) are all tribes that were completely physically wiped out by the Israelites.<p>This argument should apply to Israel, which is the biggest per capita committer of genocide, land theft, rape, and fraud in the entire world. The entire history of Israel is one of genocide, from the ancient world to today. We need BDS now and a just society would absolutely shun your nation until they respect human rights.')
