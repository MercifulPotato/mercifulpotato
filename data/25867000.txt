But you think it&#x27;s unfair to call this a &quot;gap&quot; that ES is now trying to close?<p>EDIT: I do think it&#x27;s fair to point out ways in which the new license for ES is worse than the AGPL, but I do think it&#x27;s important to point out that it&#x27;s possible to believe in open source licenses and to think that the way AWS uses software violates the spirit of open source. The people who work on GNU seem to think that!')
