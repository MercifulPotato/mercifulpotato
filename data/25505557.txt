Randomness is the key here, since probably  no one is going to brute force a unhashed password, since the password would already be known. Not all websites automatically truncate a password, although yes, using the first &#x27;n&#x27; letters would be a good idea. Some websites straight up say the password is too long, and you might have to try and guess the limit.<p>I don&#x27;t think the algorithm matters here, but only the length.')
