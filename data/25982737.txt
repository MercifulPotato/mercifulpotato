Sooner or later you have to pick a micro-controller and read the data sheets, learn all the vendor tools that come with it, experiment with open source options, etc.<p>It also depends on your objectives.  Are you studying for fun&#x2F;general improvement or are you angling for a particular job&#x2F;vocation?  If the latter you better be using the tools the job is likely to require.<p>Not disagreeing that fundamentals are important, they&#x27;re vital.  But I wouldn&#x27;t say there&#x27;s &quot;no need&quot; to study specific technologies.  You&#x27;ll never be competitive if all you do is train fundamentals with no applications or objectives.  And not all employers are willing to let a new hire &quot;learn on the job&quot;.  Also technologies do not &quot;come and go all the time&quot; outside of webDev.  My knowledge of c++ and Java from 17 years ago serves me well to this day.')
