You can trivially write a `getproperty` method for a tuple. It is considered to be type piracy and thus runs the risk of colliding with someone else&#x27;s definition, but the language absolutely lets you do it.<p>2. You can broadcast over the fields of a `NamedTuple` by defining appropriate methods. Again, it&#x27;s type piracy, so take that into consideration, but the language lets you do this easily as well.<p>3.
