Item(by='PragmaticPulp', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605554299, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25115451, text='&gt; Every time I try just 400 IU per day for a week it makes me dizzy and woozy.<p>I guarantee that you&#x27;re consuming more than 400IU of Vitamin D in your regular diet. You can consume almost double that amount just by eating a decent sized salmon filet.<p>I doubt the miniscule amount of Vitamin D (10 micrograms) in your supplement is causing your problems. It&#x27;s possible that you&#x27;re allergic to the capsules themselves, or fillers, or something unique to the supplements.<p>&gt;  I eat plenty of meat and veggies with K2, and nuts and fish with magnesium. Vitamin-D containing foods like milk, eggs and fish are totally fine. I can bake all day in the sun and don&#x27;t burn easily.<p>If you&#x27;re getting plenty of Vitamin D from diet and sunlight, you don&#x27;t need to supplement. I know the popular sentiment will beat the drum of &quot;more is better&quot;, but it&#x27;s not true. The goal is to get Vitamin D levels into an optimal range and keep them there, which, despite internet opinion, is entirely possible on a healthy diet with light sun exposure.')
