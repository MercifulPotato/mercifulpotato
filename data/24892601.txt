Provided you can put the air where it&#x27;s needed (e.g. a 1 foot fan can&#x27;t &quot;focus&quot; air onto a 6 inch radiator) a larger fan will just about always be quieter and more efficient.<p>Oh, and having a water cooled PC with the radiator and fan inside the PC itself is silly.  If you run the pipes outside or into your basement, your PC is almost completely silent, plus the cooling capacity will usually be much, much higher, because not having to cram fans and a radiator into a small enclosure lets you make them bigger and more efficient.')
