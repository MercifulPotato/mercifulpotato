And &quot;math scores went up by 0.20 standard deviations and English scores by 0.18 standard deviations, and the results hold up even when you control for &#x27;detailed student demographics, including residential ZIP Code fixed effects that help control for a studentâ€™s exposure to pollution at home.&#x27;&quot; This is &quot;comparable in scale to some of the most optimistic studies on the potential benefits of smaller class size.&quot;<p>This was an area that didn&#x27;t have high levels of pollution, either. So, 1) in worse areas you&#x27;d expect bigger gains, and 2) even if your area isn&#x27;t &quot;bad&quot; it&#x27;s still having an impact.<p>Pollution is invisibly doing weird things to our brains, especially children, without us realizing it. Even just taking the TEST in a filtered room raises scores!')
