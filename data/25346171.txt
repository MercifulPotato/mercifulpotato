What the F are you paying for? To me there is paying for a quality brand and just throwing your money away. I sometimes buy a nice pair of Nike shoes. They cost me 150$ vs 35$ for a cheap pair. But the difference in weight, feel under your foot, the quality of rubber all makes for a better shoe that you feel the difference. \nThe AirPods is not one of those situations however that warrant this price and I think that is where the contempt comes from. Not that people should really care since we can buy many brands at a lower cost with same quality. But people like to hate on things that cost a lot of money I believe it is just human natural. I see it a lot on Facebook marketplace when someone posts something priced high several people will come on and make fun of the post and laugh at it. They never wanted to buy what was in the add to begin with but bother to take the time to complain about it. I am really sure there is some sort of human psychological drive happening in these cases. We just love to hate on expensive things.')
