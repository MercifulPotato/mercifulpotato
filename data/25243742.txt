We offer PayPal and credit card checkout - 75% of users choose PayPal. When we buy a lot of our products to sell, we get lots of them from small businesses in lots of different locations, many of them also offer PayPal to us (even on wholesales transactions), because it gives some level of comfort with international transactions. Because we often have cash in our PayPal account and itâ€™s cheaper than paying our bank to send internationally, we often pick PayPal.<p>So PayPal get a cut of the wholesale price and a cut of the sales price, on literally the same goods. Some of our customers create their own products from our products and use PayPal to sell them on again, making it a 3x cut for PayPal.<p>Being a payment processor and solving that last click purchase problem &#x2F; apps store is incredibly lucrative.')
