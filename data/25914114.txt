This is new.<p>- This year the workforce in much of the world has gone from 90% in the office to 99% at home. This is new.<p>- Data bases have gone from 10&#x27;s MB to 1000&#x27;s of GB, and from scores of tables to tens of thousands of tables.<p>- Cloud computing; when was it that your company outsourced it&#x27;s entire IT infrastructure? I bet it wasn&#x27;t 30 years ago!<p>- Outsourcing itself, 30 years ago very few people had lumps of their IT done by SI&#x27;s, this is a huge change that everyone has just got used to.<p>- Security and tfa and firewalls and all that jazz: 30 years ago this was all terribly naive and often implemented with airgaps. I remember one project doing billing automation at a power utility where we installed networking, workstations (in branches) and built a completely independent network out from the mainframes. It did not touch the internet, sign on was via user name and password only with no changing policy. I don&#x27;t even remember seeing a security policy!<p>- End user consumption; this is big. 30 years ago the c-suite never saw emails. Their secretaries printed them out. Execs didn&#x27;t type, or look at screens. There was a weekly report and it was given out on friday, reviewed at the weekend and discussed &#x2F; actioned monday morning. Now every exec has a notebook, and a phone (see above) they want dashboards, they want to explore the data themselves - and they do do that (often badly). Their level of interaction and requirement from IT is orders of magnitude different from 30 years ago.<p>- Lack of cash. Every company outside China with the exception of FAANGS has had the cash squeezed out of it by investors in the last 30 years. 30 years ago utilities and investment companies sat on what (in hindsight) were rivers of cash. Funding was so heavy that there were special offices set up to oversee it&#x27;s dispersal (who else remembers central program offices?) Now projects are managed in line and are part of 0 build budgets (start every year with everyone on 0 budget and make them make the case to add $1 at a time). It is incredible to think of how we used to act in projects and how empowering and facilitating of progress and quality it was - but also how expensive. People would think nothing of spending 10 or 20 times their yearly salary on machines and software - there was no motivation to imagine what else could be done with the cash!  Of course all that spending floated great chunks of the economy along with the spend going into other peoples pockets. It was another world.')
