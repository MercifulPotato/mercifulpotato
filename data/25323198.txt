We had our main business phone line go down and Verizon customer service basically shrugged their shoulders and said there was nothing they could do and no way to escalate.  One call to the state regulator and not only did they fix the phone line within a couple hours, they begged us to tell them what they could do to make the regulatory complaint go away.  We told them we&#x27;d like access to FIOS but had always been told fiber wasn&#x27;t on our street and wasn&#x27;t going to be.  Three weeks later, fiber was run down the entire street and we were hooked up to gigabit internet.  That roll out can&#x27;t have been cheap for them.')
