The most cynical of us say that the web is irreparable.<p>It seems to me, from a user perspective, that they haven&#x27;t found what works at all. It also seems to me that they don&#x27;t care about finding what works anymore, they&#x27;re happy to rest on their megalithic laurels the way Blockbuster and Radio Shack thought they could ad infinitum.<p>I think you&#x27;re right about novel features and things breaking for no good reason, and I think the next phase in innovation of communication and networking technologies are already beginning to adopt some new axioms: less is more, and the idea that there will be one place to do everything online is flawed and cannot be achieved.')
