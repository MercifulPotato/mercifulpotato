I do wonder what impact this will have on mail ordering. Currently rural deliveries are subsidized by the more densely populated areas. Because the ratio of subsidized rural dwellers to densely populated area dwellers is so lopsided in favor of density, the subsidy doesn&#x27;t matter much. If that ratio changes, so might the economics of companies like Amazon being able to deliver anywhere, usually by piggybacking on the USPS&#x27;s rural delivery infrastructure. That said, I&#x27;ve seen Amazon&#x27;s own delivery vans in some pretty low density rural areas so maybe it works out somehow.')
