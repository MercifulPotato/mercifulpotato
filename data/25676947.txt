This leads to shortsighted and misplaced anger. And importantly, the largest powers will sidestep your lashings out&#x2F;solutions.<p>Every power since civilization wields its power and pushes its own propaganda. Misinformation and censorship fall under this umbrella. If you honestly think the MSN, social media, tech giants, large donors, or even the current government are worth revolting over, this message is for you.<p>Any routing of power will be temporary and follow with quick usurpation by the next most powerful. I&#x27;m sorry to say, there is no quick solution to power coalescing, and you and I are not the next most powerful. There is only the steady march of technology, capital, and laws that equalize and distribute power which will lead to any sort of widely shared power equilibrium.<p>Stop pointing blame at this or that company, this or that politician or party, and build something lasting. The game is played with power, and none of us have enough to make a worthwhile difference sorry to say. Something lasting  could be spreading good will, developing a piece of software, making a scientific discovery, educating yourself or others, or even building capital for some end. Slowly and steadily pluck the reins of power from the few to the many. I don&#x27;t know what a truly equally distributed system of power will look like, but I believe it&#x27;s the only end worth fighting for. Maybe you have to align yourself with current powers to get there, but wielding the power should never be the end.<p>If this diatribe seems out of place, it&#x27;s because you aren&#x27;t seeing all the terrible takes that were filling this thread in the first hour. But who am I to say.')
