Item(by='Agentlien', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611472840, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25886104, text='I once (2010) had an oral exam in neural networks during which I had to design a system to solve a particular task. My solution used two neural networks connected by a simple logic circuit. The professor,  who was actually a neuro scientist with little understanding of the technical, asked why not a third neural network. This was a neural network course, after all.<p>Thinking this was a trick question I excitedly explained how stupid it would be to build and train a network to approximate a function which could easily be precisely described with a tiny circuit or code statement.<p>The professor was not amused. He said that&#x27;s what he would have done. After a few similar incidents he concluded the exam giving me an 8&#x2F;10 saying my answers were perfectly correct but he didn&#x27;t like my attitude.')
