I&#x27;m so glad the net is neutral in the united states at least. It&#x27;s interesting to see Twitter taking a more active stance in banning accounts here, and I wonder what the long-term repercussions of that will be. In the last few days we&#x27;ve seen companies act faster than government, which I think will generally be true. But hopefully when government acts it will be a bigger and longer lasting change.')
