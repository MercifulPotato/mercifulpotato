It is very comfortable, and much quieter than a sleeper train -- it was like being in a slowly rocking &quot;cabin hotel&quot;, where you don&#x27;t have a window and the room is tiny.<p>(You can get a room with a window, but for an overnight trip it seemed a bit pointless.)<p>I find it difficult to sleep on sleeper trains, and usually arrive tired at the destination. Where there is the option I will use a night train out of principle (it&#x27;s still usually more comfortable than a plane) but, if I have time, a daytime rail journey is much nicer.')
