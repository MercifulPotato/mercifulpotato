If I need a news article or some other webpage translated I can do it thanks to Google Translate.\nIf Google Translate was not here, I would simply not get it translated and lose the information, there is no way I would contact a translation firm for that kind of stuff. \nTo me it is firmly value creating.<p>At any rate here are way more than 3 other uses of DL today off the top of my head:<p>* Autocompletion (be it in search engines toolbars or in Gmail&#x2F;Word&#x2F;...)<p>* Superresolution GAN, the most interesting example to me being NVIDIA DLSS, you render a game at ~720p or less and then upscale it to the target resolution of 1080p or 4k, allowing to get quality that the machine would not have been able to support at the target resolution directly.<p>* Image recognition&#x2F;tagging: Most of this is used in the security domain, but there is also a lot of stuff around inventory management, safety etc.<p>* Semantic search<p>* Protein folding (AlphaFold)<p>* In astrophysics: detection of supernovaes, FRBs and probably a bunch of other stuff I&#x27;m not aware of<p>* Self-driving cars: Even assuming self-driving technology does not evolve anymore from now on, the current state of the art is still a selling point.<p>* Predictive maintenance: Used for plane engines and other things')
