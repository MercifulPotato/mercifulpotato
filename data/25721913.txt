Item(by='29083011397778', descendants=None, kids=[25724875], score=None, time=1610323037, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25720922, text='Perhaps not the Mattermost bridge, but <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;matrix.org" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;matrix.org</a> is pretty straightforward in my eyes. The &quot;Try Now&quot; button is clearly visible, and takes you right to multiple different clients and a clear option to open it in your browser. From there it&#x27;s the login &#x2F; sign-up flow.<p>Is there something I&#x27;m just too familiar with? I really like the project, so I&#x27;ve been through the site (and set up my own server) enough that maybe I&#x27;m glossing over a rough point.')
