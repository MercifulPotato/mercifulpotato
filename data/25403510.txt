For singleplayer games there&#x27;s really no reason to not wait a few months for the major bugs to be fixed, or even a year or two to get all the dlc with the game at a discount. I also stick mostly to indie or AA games which don&#x27;t have this problem nearly as bad to begin with and have new, interesting ideas and mechanics way more often then triple A games that cost twice as much anyway.')
