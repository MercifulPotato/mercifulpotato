Be aware with who you align with as you will probably learn the hard way that people&#x27;s actions and words aren&#x27;t always the same.<p>B. Cashflow coming in immediately is super rare. However you distribute or make a deal, it easily takes 1 month to actually see the real, usable money. I&#x27;ve had a lot of deals that were &quot;ready to go&quot; and still took about 2 to 3 months to finalize.<p>C. Your mental health is your most prized, valuable possession. Avoid burnout. Sleep regularly and well. Stay to a schedule. Eat healthy. Exercise. Do not work more than 10 hours a day, no matter how badly you want to. That 18 hour sprint means you&#x27;ll work 40% efficiency the next day. Plus you risk burnout. One day off a week minimum devoted 100% to fun and&#x2F;or relaxing.<p>D. Organize and learn you will be juggling short, mid and long term goals. Dont sacrifice one too much for the others. Find balance.<p>E. Dont bite off more than you can chew or be too ambitious. Yes, ambition is good, but you&#x27;re juggling high risk. If you make an easier game 1 to do that extends your dev time by another year in cash flow, game 2 could be grander than your current vision. Plus you have experience to help you. You might be better off build 2 to 4 smaller games that help you build cash flow and experience that all give you the skills to tackle your dream project with precision.<p>F. Theres a lot of shitty advice on the internet. In the end, trust your hard earned experiences over someone else&#x27;s &quot;never did it&quot; bullshit.<p>Good luck.')
