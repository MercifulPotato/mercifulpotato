However, I disagree with fundamental precepts they are using because they do not take culture into account. The representative system works best when it&#x27;s able to group people with similar interests and values and lets them elect someone who can share those interests.<p>I do not think that valuing &quot;compact&quot; districts is necessarily helpful for that. The better approximation here should be to aim for grouping similar population densities together. For example, rural voters should have much larger districts, which are  made up of mostly other rural voters and urban voters should have much smaller districts.<p>Likewise, &quot;minimal county splits&quot; is not especially meaningful either. In NC, Charlotte is in Mecklenburg County - that county probably shouldn&#x27;t get split. However, the population which lives edges of the counties which surround Mecklenburg (ie, southern Iredell, parts of Cabbarus county, Gaston county - are hugely impacted by Charlotte. Those counties have tons of growth from commuters to Charlotte and have very different needs depending on how close they are to Charlotte. These outer suburbs voters should be represented together, across county lines.<p>And finally - I don&#x27;t every district needs to be all that competitive. We shouldn&#x27;t be pitting people with totally different needs against each other for representation just for the sake of it.<p>It&#x27;s a cool idea and interesting to see what a &quot;fair&quot; algorithm says - but the fundamentals here are critical.')
