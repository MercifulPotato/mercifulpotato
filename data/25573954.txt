As the time passes it _seems_ to be diminishing - as we can see by the rejection of violence against woman or other minorities becoming ever more common - but our heroes tend to be aggressive, our tales and stories contains death, killings, etc. Again, less than before, but far from zero.<p>Studies so far are controversial (to say the least) and it&#x27;s hard to take sociological statistics at face value, therefore is hard to conclude anything. But it&#x27;s impossible to believe that spending several hours a week pretending to do violence against ever more realistic cyber impressions of life wouldn&#x27;t have ANY effect on our selves.')
