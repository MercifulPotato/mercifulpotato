If don&#x27;t want Amazon to use your software, then license it as such, whatever. However, that software is not open source.<p>Furthermore, if you <i>change</i> a project which is open source, to a licensing model which is not, it&#x27;s a dick move.<p>It&#x27;s not important if the needs of the business are &quot;reasonable&quot;, we could argue about that but it&#x27;s beside the point. Open source has no relationship with the requirements of your business. It has a specific meaning, and if you betray those principles, you betray the people who trusted you on those terms.')
