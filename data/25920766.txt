I tried seeking with a transcode just now and it takes ~1s from interaction to the video playing again, which isn&#x27;t too bad and I don&#x27;t think is avoidable.<p>If you watch transcodes a lot and  this bothers you though, consider whether &quot;Optimized Versions&quot; (transcoding ahead of time) would be good for you. Aside from that, I don&#x27;t think a solution exists, it&#x27;s a problem inherent to seeking while transcoding.<p>Not a Plex employee or anything, I&#x27;ve just been using it for what feels like close to a decade now.<p>EDIT: I just watched some stuff through Plex on my Apple TV and seeking is actually instant. On the Apple TV, each button click jumps forward ten seconds or so and as far as I can tell, each jump is instantaneous, no buffering or delays whatsoever.')
