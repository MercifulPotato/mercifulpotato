My point is that their content quality hasn&#x27;t degraded during the social media age. Publishers are willing to spend money on investigation but in order for people to read it, publishers need to package it for consumption, which involves some degree of sensationalization. Social media and the reliance of ad revenue have made this a lot worse.<p>&gt; The economic value is &quot;just an article.&quot;<p>I think that this is also essentially saying that people want nice things for free (or at a very low cost). I don&#x27;t think the original commenter is actually trying to blame people for not paying for the news, even if they phrased this point in a more condescending way.')
