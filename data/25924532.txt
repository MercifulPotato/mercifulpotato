If your browser requests Evil Resource without telling advertiser the name of top-level site, the advertiser gets little. They get to know, that user 9062342154 is online and they are asking for Evil Resource X, but that&#x27;s all. They can&#x27;t even tell, which specific website is being visited!<p>The real problems start, when the top level web site cooperates with advertiser by running a Javascript &quot;bridge&quot;, that acts both as an arbiter and a communication channel for siphoning your information. In addition to transferring information, the bridge acts as anti-fraud measure to confirm, that there is no foul play on the part of web site operator. Since the script is Turing-complete and can be updated anytime, there is no way to restrict it&#x27;s actions.')
