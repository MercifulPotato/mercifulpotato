There is a long history of ways to increase neck muscle strength.  The Nautilus 4-way neck machines are the best engineered, though you won&#x27;t find them in many gyms, probably because they can be very dangerous for untrained people.  Under full load, a distraction that causes you to twist your head suddenly can seriously injure your neck.<p>For cheap and safe neck exercises, the best method today is a combination of timed static contractions (TSC)[1] and a cheap webbed strap[2].  As with all strength training, intensity of effort is 80-90% of the training effect, followed by proper form.  The disadvantage of TSCs is that there is no simple way to record your progress week to week as you grow stronger.  But if you load and unload your neck slowly, you can exercise each of the four directions to momentary muscular failure (MMF) in a safe and very time efficient protocol.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=ph8If3u67kw" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=ph8If3u67kw</a><p>[1] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;ren-ex.com&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2010&#x2F;11&#x2F;TimedStaticContractions.pdf" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;ren-ex.com&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2010&#x2F;11&#x2F;TimedStaticCont...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.strapworks.com&#x2F;Side_Release_Buckle_Belts_p&#x2F;srbb2pew.htm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.strapworks.com&#x2F;Side_Release_Buckle_Belts_p&#x2F;srbb2...</a>')
