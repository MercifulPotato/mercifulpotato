The resouce system was very cool too.<p>It was super streamer friendly; any viewer could look at it for 10 seconds and understand what was going on - zero nerdiness required. And it was gorgeous for its time.<p>Then Relic started making a lot of mistakes:<p>- New factions with units a viewer would need to &quot;learn&quot; to be able to understand what was going on in the match.<p>- Introduced a super defensive faction which could fight the old defensive faction, resulting in long, abhorrently boring games.<p>- CoH2 which sold new mini-DLCs each month with special units purposely not balanced for online play. Top scummy.<p>- A plethora of other things I won&#x27;t bore you with. But Relic became a customer-toxic company in my eyes.<p>But vanilla CoH could be examined to find gold, IMO.')
