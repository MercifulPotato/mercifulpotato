Our entire observational knowledge of black holes consists of radiation emitted from the accretion disk (deep in the classical regime), orbits of nearby objects (even farther in the classical regime), and one blurry radio picture (predicted by GR and containing nothing, yet, to our knowledge, outside of GR&#x27;s predictions.) I guess you could count gravitational waves, but guess what, that&#x27;s GR too... ;) Given the observational knowledge of today, even a true theory of quantum gravity beamed back from the future would fail to produce verifiable experimental evidence in the realm of black holes.')
