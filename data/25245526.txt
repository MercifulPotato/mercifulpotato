Service and Ingress are just routing rules.<p>Service with ClusterIP creates an internal IP that redirects traffic to that service&#x27;s pods. Service with NodePort creates a CluserIP <i>and</i> creates a port on every node that lets external traffic also reach those pods.<p>Service with LoadBalancer creates a ClusterIP, NodePort, <i>and</i> a whatever load balancer implementation exists in that cloud to route external traffic to those K8S nodes and nodeport port numbers. This is the part that&#x27;s missing in your bare metal setup, but you can create a nodeport service using port 80&#x2F;443 and have DNS pointing to your nodes&#x27; public addresses.<p>That&#x27;s all it takes to get cluster access and you can point this Service to another downstream Service&#x2F;Ingress if you want the routing rules to stay in YAML too.')
