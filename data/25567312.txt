I don&#x27;t think that makes sence (how does the provider make money?) and I think it&#x27;s not what 95% of the public needs.<p>The author also appears to want an email service that doesn’t store your email or have a spam filter, because they are offended by these parts of FastMail’s privacy policy:<p>&gt; We process mail sent and received from your account to block spam and fraud.<p>&gt; We also collect the email content you create, upload, or receive from others<p>It seems to me that what the author wants does not resemble email, which is why they are so unhappy with so many email providers.  Perhaps they would be happier with some form of E2E-encrypted instant messaging.  In any case, getting angry at email providers for storing your email seems like a waste of time and energy.')
