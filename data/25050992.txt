(and RAM is shared between CPU and GPU)<p>230€ for 512 to 1TB SSD.<p>They sure know how to milk their customers.<p>So while the starting price seems surprisingly low, an acceptably specced 13 pro comes in at 2139€. And that&#x27;s without knowing how the GPU will hold up.<p>The presentation is brilliant marketing though and so much better than the competition. As long as you disable your brain for claims like &quot;Universal Apps are the fastest and most powerful apps you can get!&quot;, and never mentioning specifics like the chips the benchmark actually compared with or what that game is that runs faster under emulation than native.')
