Unlike FOL, it itself is incomplete.<p>In a formal set theory, like ZFC, we postulate the existence of the set of natural numbers. This is something most logicians are comfortable with as being &quot;mathematically foundational&quot; (&quot;God made the natural numbers; all else is the work of man&quot;). Then, to describe the set of sets of natural numbers we use the powerset axiom that defines what exactly we mean by &quot;all sets of natural numbers.&quot; Then, Löwenheim–Skolem appears and says that there are models of this set theory where the number of sets that satisfy this definition is countable (not inside the logic, but looking from the outside), to which we say: well, so be it. The reason this happens is because there is a fundamental limitation to the power of describing things using finite strings of symbols. Second-order can just say, no, when I say &quot;all subsets&quot; I mean absolutely all. But can we precisely formalise, i.e. write down in symbols, what we mean by &quot;all&quot; using some basic, &quot;simple&quot; foundation? The answer is no. Second-order logic just vaguely gestures toward &quot;all&quot; and says, &quot;by all we mean all&quot;. It circumvents the limitations of formalisation -- i.e. describing things in finite sentences -- by alluding to non-describable things.<p>Most logicians feel this isn&#x27;t very foundational to rely on allusions to things that aren&#x27;t themselves reducible to axioms in a basic foundation.<p>Even when higher-order logics are used in formal mathematics, like various set theories or Isabelle&#x27;s HOL, they are (at best) picked to be as powerful as (multi-sorted) FOL rather than &quot;actual&quot; SOL.')
