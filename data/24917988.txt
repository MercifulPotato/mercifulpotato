As it currently stands, our tools for cleaning up these chemicals are extremely crude.</i><p><i>&gt; Why can&#x27;t we develop a nanobot that is able to detect the chemical in the soil or ocean and then break down or decompose that molecule?</i><p>We could, in theory, but a faster approach (that is already being used) is harnessing existing organisms.<p>Bioremediation is an approach being actively researched, and recent advances in genetic engineering (eg. CRISPR) ought to help a lot.<p>A search for &quot;DDT bioremediation&quot; will show you the research on this that is being done (not a huge amount, but progress is being made). There are probably some opportunities for B2G startups in this area.')
