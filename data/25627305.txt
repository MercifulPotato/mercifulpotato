I fully agree with you. Time destroys everything in the end. Rome especially is full of ruins that, if left untouched, will one day no longer be with us. Far too many to preserve in exactly their current state. I think we know enough to restore buildings with a decent degree of accuracy. I agree that we should try to be as faithful to the original as possible, but letting the buildings crumble to dust just means our descendants won&#x27;t be able to enjoy them anymore. We could always be sure to document their pre-restoration state digitally, so we can double check the data in the future should we need to do so.')
