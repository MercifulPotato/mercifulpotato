But somehow you believe that your specific, personal interpretation is the absolutely correct one? Why?<p>It&#x27;s not correct, it&#x27;s just &quot;standard&quot; in the context that I&#x27;m using it. But whether or not it&#x27;s &quot;standard&quot; is largely irrelevant--the question is whether the concept that I&#x27;m labeling &quot;free speech&quot; is consistent in my framework with the other concepts (which I&#x27;ve labeled, &quot;harassment&quot; and &quot;criticism&quot;--which are also labeled according to standard definitions, for convenience). Let&#x27;s stay away from semantic arguments--they&#x27;re tedious, pointless, and boring.<p>&gt; What makes your answer correct and the other 100 answers incorrect? You refer to &quot;widely accepted definition&quot;, as if a dictionary definition could somehow be applied to real world situations to judge whether an expression is harassment or not. Maybe it can be in _extreme_ cases, like if someone said &quot;gays should be killed&quot; we could easily judge that as harassment<p>That&#x27;s not harassment. It&#x27;s an abhorrent idea, but &quot;abhorrence&quot; is different from &quot;harassment&quot;. If you&#x27;re shouting your abhorrent idea while burning a cross in someone&#x27;s yard, that&#x27;s harassment. If you&#x27;re following someone around shouting your abhorrent idea, that&#x27;s also harassment. Abhorrent ideas tend to be accompanied by harassment (and if you think about it, we consider these ideas abhorrent because they&#x27;re very likely to lead to harassment and violence); however, they aren&#x27;t equivalent to harassment. This is true even for a very broad definition of &quot;harassment&quot; like what you would find in a dictionary and even more so for very precise definitions such as a legal definition or probably all philosophical definitions.<p>&gt; But there&#x27;s a huge gray area where expressions can be interpreted either way and it&#x27;s up to each individual to assess whether they feel like an expression is harassment or not.<p>I think we can reasonably define harassment as &quot;an action based on an intent to intimidate or pressure someone&quot;. I think that definition is very <i>precise</i> and there isn&#x27;t much <i>gray area</i>; however, litigating the intent to determine whether any given action is harassment is difficult. We can devise increasingly better tests for assessing intent (e.g., &quot;we assume intent is to intimidate if a significant majority of people would feel intimidated under similar circumstances&quot;), but difficulty of assessing intent is different than the precision of the definition.')
