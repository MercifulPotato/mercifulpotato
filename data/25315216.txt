From a commercial development standpoint (ie. my day job), it&#x27;s fantastic.<p>BUT: What a lot of developers, myself included, feel like is the source control in git is great. The project management tools (issues, actions, etc...) require centralization of certain processes, that for some projects (open and closed source), don&#x27;t fit well. Sometimes the &#x27;how it works&#x27; is a bad fit. Other times, it&#x27;s where it has to be to work. For example, running CI on a container on Azure from actions. Yes you can move where it runs. But for some projects, localhost is where that should happen. I&#x27;m really happy to see people working on this, because it will be just as transformative as git and Github has been.')
