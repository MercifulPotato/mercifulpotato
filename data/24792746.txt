Item(by='kurthr', descendants=None, kids=[24792980], score=None, time=1602790056, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24792187, text='The problem I see with that approach is that modern transformer based NLP like GPT3 make generating this sort of &quot;review&quot; text almost free. The value you place in those reviews is the perceived effort put into them. When that effort goes to zero... it&#x27;s just more automated spam reviews with a &quot;believable&quot; statistical spectrum.<p>Honestly, I don&#x27;t see how to trust reviews if the reviewers have no skin in the game (either their reputation or money). If identities and reputations can be faked&#x2F;generated at low cost, then we&#x27;re back to just money. Honestly, one theory of advertising (like McD and bigC) is that they throw money at pretty ads to convince you that lots of people have given them money so they must be good... it&#x27;s pay to play, but it&#x27;s not completely wrong. Limiting reviews to those who have actually bought the item also helps, if you time limit&#x2F;delay it and weight by the cost of shipping&#x2F;stocking.')
