In June I believe they cut support for DJ:ing apps, which really sucks (especially for beginners who donâ€™t want to invest too much, which those apps are generally geared towards). Apparently it was something about buffering multiple tracks at the same time. Possibly an understandable anti-piracy move, but stopping something like songshift is really just worsening the experience for the users. People have mentioned the curated playlists being an important part of their product, but people must anyways pay to get those.<p>Strangely, Spotify have also made their API a lot more powerful, even with embedable players on webpages. Kind of seems like a step in the opposite direction, although they might have tightened up that as well since last time I checked.')
