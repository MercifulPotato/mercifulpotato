Item(by='2-tpg', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606603365, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25240494, text='&gt; We can also punish someone for discrimination simply for exhibiting a pattern of discrimination regardless of intent to discriminate.<p>It is scary, right? &quot;We can also punish&quot; hides behind the &quot;we&quot;, unclear if they mean &quot;We, the people, the court system&quot; or &quot;We, the racial justice movement, public opinion&quot;. Then what is this &quot;punishment&quot;? A bad article in the NYT? Calling up your network and suppliers with a 100 people (with too much time and too much anger) to cancel you for being racist? Jail time or a fine for illegal activity?<p>They are power hungry, totalitarian, and evil. Other comments talk of &quot;subconscious racism&quot; or &quot;white privilege&quot;. This comment demands responsibility for outcomes they perceive as unjust, where it is very unjust to demand demographic parity, when it is not possible to attain that, without severely dropping in quality (there are not enough Black people in tech to fill those positions with talent). So they demand you pay&#x2F;invest to increase Black people in tech. But if too vocal or direct about it, they accuse you of &quot;stating in general that Black people are less capable&quot; as if reasoning from racist motives. So don&#x27;t look to closely at the reason for not being able to hire as much Black people as society, activist, or the board wants you to.<p>This activism is a very strong and dangerous and toxic meme. It leads to Qanon levels of delusion, accusing criticism of racism, so it can&#x27;t be attacked. Where Qanons see the deepstate and pedophiles when looking at government or big business, these activists see a racist society and neo-Nazi&#x27;s when looking at government or big business. You can&#x27;t change their minds. They&#x27;ve been in Whatsapp groups for years, pointing out targets for collective actions, and finding counters to often used criticism. It&#x27;s why no activist would use the word &quot;Identity Politics&quot; even though that&#x27;s the animal&#x27;s name (evil Neo-Nazis use that term to attack our efforts!).<p>So that&#x27;s why you hear: reverse racism is impossible! Racism has to do with power, and whites have all the power! When nearly every white person can recount cases of being discriminated against, and how terrible it made them feel. Accused of cultural appropriation for liking rap music. Challenged by Black men for having a Black girlfriend. Chosen as victim of robbery, because perceived weak and rich. Accused of getting your promotion, not due to hard work, but because your white old boys network favored your dumb white ass over a Black deserving queen.<p>If this NYT article was about over-representation of not white Libertarian crypto bros, but of over-representation of Jewish people in positions of power, you&#x27;d hear a different tune. Even suggesting that clear fact labels you as anti-Semitic. Apparently white people don&#x27;t have enough shared culture, shared activism, to make racist anti-male anti-white anti-autist hit pieces like this controversial, even though we supposedly run the world, actively suppress entire races and genders, and create non-inclusive companies out of principle.')
