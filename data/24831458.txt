And before you say it&#x27;s a good video, I actually tried watching it once. I think I got through about 30 minutes of saying nothing of substance when I gave  up. I actually recommend the exercise - try rewatching and make a note when he actually makes an argument or references a source.<p>Right above my comment is another linking the wikipedia page on IQ heritability. That would be a good example of a source. Meta-studies are a good option. Longitudinal studies are a decent one. Single studies are usually useless, but they&#x27;re at least a good starting point for a productive conversations.')
