I don&#x27;t love that it&#x27;s like this, but basically the product page just lists every known-to-work device, including Nintendo Switch:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.ca&#x2F;Charger-Adapter-Replacement-Thinkpad-MacBook&#x2F;dp&#x2F;B07SXH337S" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.ca&#x2F;Charger-Adapter-Replacement-Thinkpad-M...</a><p>Now, I&#x27;m a cheapskate, so most of my electronics are older devices, and as a consequence we still also have various other cables kicking aroundâ€” Lightning for both our iPhones and wireless earbuds, Micro USB for Kindle and PS4 controllers, even Mini USB for a few random devices.<p>But as far as USB-C, I would attribute the current mess to growing pains. For a few more years, charger pages will explicit list the products they work with, and eventually it will settle down to a list of must-work-with products for all chargers, and any new products with be tested to ensure that they work in the same ways as one or more of the items on that list of known-working products. Didn&#x27;t HDMI have pretty much this exact issue with EDID and other chaos, until everyone basically agreed that whatever Sony was doing was the right thing and they&#x27;d copy them?<p>The main losers here are people trying to do new ground-up implementations, since they can&#x27;t just work from the standard; they also need expensive consultants to tell them the precise subset of the standard is the actual part they can depend on. But for end users, the trend is toward an overall state of reasonable compatibility, with non-working devices quickly acquiring a reputation as such and being shunned out of the marketplace.')
