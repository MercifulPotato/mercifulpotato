I&#x27;d encourage you not to just accept others. Cairns have a long tradition in hiking and at their most basic are a simple wave to a fellow wanderer in remote areas. Dark Souls has the same concept as a built-in game mechanic with it&#x27;s tagging.<p>I don&#x27;t build them myself because I don&#x27;t have the patience (and dogs tend to make sitting still problematic :P), but I appreciate most every one I see for what it is: someone came to this same place I&#x27;m enjoying and did so in such a calm and focused manner, there are stacked rocks to show for it.<p>I can imagine that someone somewhere has built a massive cairn with disregard to the site and the other wanderers there. That person sucks.')
