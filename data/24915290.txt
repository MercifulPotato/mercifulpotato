I&#x27;ve had discussions with my American colleagues where I asserted that we were overpayed for what we do. They insist that it&#x27;s deserved because we&#x27;re the top engineers of the world working at a top company. But I&#x27;m 100% certain the only reason we&#x27;re paid as much is because of the insane cost of living in the Bay Area. I know many great engineers, or even my former-self, in my home country who are not paid even 1&#x2F;3rd of what we get paid in the Bay Area. I think this WFH revolution will be a real reckoning for the software industry and the entitlement of many Bay Area engineers.')
