So it sounds like giving the i3 to an outside foundry is just a way for them to get rid of their least profitable work and is  not a sincere effort to move the company forward!  When I worked for Google I learned that the i3 was not allowed to be designed into corporate-grade laptops and by that I mean Chromebooks.  Because of this Google would never approve an i3 Chromebook for internal corporate use!')
