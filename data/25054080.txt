It is what they are bound to and how they are prepared. The idea of &quot;micronutrients&quot; popped up during the mass production of food post-war--(think of all those cereals that were fortified, fortified because all the nutrients had been stripped out during manufacture!)--and went out of vogue in the 70&#x27;s. This was the idea that you could reduce food (like a steak) to just a bunch of chemicals, eat those chemicals, and have the same outcome as eating a steak. We&#x27;ve learned a lot more. (That&#x27;s a crass way to describe it, but close enough.)<p>I am treating bone loss and I take a prescription Vitamin D because the kind found in OTC single- or multivitamins are not biologically available due to their (inexpensive) preparations.')
