I think that both Rust and C++ are <i>fundamentally</i> built around a design concept that I find distasteful and wrong-headed for low-level programming -- <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24840818;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24840818;</a> I guess you can call it too much implicitness aimed to make it appear something it isn&#x27;t when printed on the page. Rust does it somewhat more elegantly and perhaps has other justifications for it (like sound guarantees) -- which is why I prefer it to C++, although not enough to justify a large investment until it has a significant market share -- but it espouses the same foundational design aesthetics. I think that whether people like or dislike Rust mostly has to do with whether they find that aesthetic appealing. I&#x27;m sure many people do and many people don&#x27;t.<p>BTW, I haven&#x27;t &quot;adopted&quot; Zig that I would need to drop it for anything (it&#x27;s not even 1.0 yet). I&#x27;m still with C++ for the time being. But I&#x27;m deeply impressed by Zig&#x27;s revolutionary design and complete rethinking of low-level programming that I&#x27;m keeping a watchful and hopeful eye on it.')
