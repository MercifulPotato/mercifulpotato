A fresh pandas install takes ~10s to import and then reads this file in 81.2 ms Â± 1.25 ms. CSV.jl takes 38 ms on a second run so it is twice as fast, however especially to someone that just starts using Julia, these &gt;100x slowdowns constantly happen. Especially when using libraries that heavily rely on multiple dispatch specialisation for performance.')
