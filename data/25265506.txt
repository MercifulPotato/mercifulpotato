How that works out: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.ethhub.io&#x2F;ethereum-roadmap&#x2F;ethereum-2.0&#x2F;eth-2.0-economics&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.ethhub.io&#x2F;ethereum-roadmap&#x2F;ethereum-2.0&#x2F;eth-2.0...</a><p>If you want to dig into the actual formula, it&#x27;s explained here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;benjaminion.xyz&#x2F;eth2-annotated-spec&#x2F;phase0&#x2F;beacon-chain&#x2F;#rewards-and-penalties" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;benjaminion.xyz&#x2F;eth2-annotated-spec&#x2F;phase0&#x2F;beacon-ch...</a><p>Until PoW migrates to PoS, probably in about a year, they&#x27;ll operate in parallel and we&#x27;ll have both rewards added together.<p>A final factor is an upcoming change to the way transaction fees work, which will burn most of the fees instead of awarding them to validators. That will reduce net issuance further, possibly even taking it negative.')
