Sometimes later I&#x27;m in airplane mode and I modify the task as &quot;buy condensed milk&quot;. Do your library updates the changes automagically once online?<p>- how realistic is it to run your own server? Is it a couple hours of config and forget about it or it&#x27;s a multi-days endeavor without certainty of success?<p>- in your examples you use the name Cyberdyne. If I use Etebase do I unknowingly contribute to Skynet? ;)')
