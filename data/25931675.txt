This is institutional investor shorts vs intentional investors stockholders.  Retail is just along for the ride but the institutional shorts did something crazy so other large funds came in like Michael Burry’s and bought large positions.  This happens every once in awhile where other institutional investors see an opportunity to take out competitors who is over leverage.<p>So just sit back and watch for the margin calls to go out and GameStop will skyrocket to something ridiculous while the shorts try to unwind their position.  Still don’t get how this mess is going to get cleaned up since it’s impossible for the shorts to cover.')
