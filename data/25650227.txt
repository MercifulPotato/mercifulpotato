We will replace jobs that require creativity and talent before we will replace most manual factor workers, as hardware is significantly more difficult to scale up and invent than software.<p>At this point I have replaced a significant amount of creative workers with AI for personal usage, for example:<p>- I use desktop backgrounds generated by VAEs (VD-VAE)<p>- I use avatars generated by GANs (StyleGAN, BigGAN)<p>- I use and have fun with written content generated by transformers (GPT3)<p>- I listen to and enjoy music and audio generated by autoencoders (Jukebox, Magenta project, many others)<p>- I don&#x27;t purchase stock images or commission artists for many previous things I would have when a GAN exists that already makes the class of image I want<p>All of this has happened in that last year or so for me, and I expect that within a few more years this will be the case for vastly more people and in a growing number of domains.')
