Basically all the pain points the author mentions (deciding on router, DI, http client, working in multiple teams, reliable hot-reload, deciding between class or functional components, whether or not to use hooks) are all things in which angular shines.

In fact in comparison over the last 5 years, angular has been much more consistent whereas react has become a scattered mess.')
