They&#x27;ve tried to physically restrain him, but he is stronger than them, they&#x27;ve tried to taser him but he ripped the wires out. He&#x27;s got a knife and he&#x27;s trying to get in the car that the kid is in.<p>&quot;P.O. Sheskey stated &#x27;Blake, for the first time, showed intent to harm by driving the knife towards his (P.O. Sheskey&#x27;s) torso.&#x27; P.O. Arenas also said, &#x27;at that moment, he feared the armed subject (Blake) was about to stab P.O. Sheskey.&#x27; He (P.O. Arenas) would have tried to stop Blake&#x27;s advances with the knife, but &#x27;he did not have a clear shot due to the positioning of the door.&#x27; P.O. Sheskey &#x27;feared that Blake was going to stab him, and he could not retreat because the child could be harmed, taken hostage, or abducted by Blake.&#x27; &#x27;For these reasons, he discharged his firearm towards Jacob Blake.&#x27; He stated that he later determined that he shot (7) shots and did not stop until Blake dropped the knife.&quot;<p>That&#x27;s from the independent evaluation at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kenoshacounty.org&#x2F;DocumentCenter&#x2F;View&#x2F;11830&#x2F;Use-of-Force-Expert-Noble-Wray-Independent-Evaluation-and-Report" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kenoshacounty.org&#x2F;DocumentCenter&#x2F;View&#x2F;11830&#x2F;Use-...</a>, video at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nbcnews.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;us-news&#x2F;video-shows-police-kenosha-wis-shooting-black-man-back-n1237819" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nbcnews.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;us-news&#x2F;video-shows-police-keno...</a>.<p>I&#x27;m so glad I have a desk job.')
