There&#x27;s a lot of range between being so transparent you scare everyone and being the mayor from Jaws.<p>I got it from regional news, at the time. If building a lake is how you bribe people into doing something they don&#x27;t want to do, and then you take the lake away, then from their perspective you&#x27;ve lied.<p>There are other ways to build a cooling plant for a nuclear power station, btw. Lots of places make them do that now, because dumping the heat back into the environment instead of into the sky causes far more mundane problems than this. And occasionally weirder ones. And since the thesis was about heat pollution, not regional nuclear politics, I&#x27;ll thank you not to nitpick.')
