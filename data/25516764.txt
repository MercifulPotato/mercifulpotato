Feel free to take it with you, we’ll add it to your bill no questions asked.”</i><p>Now, imagine guests being offended and not coming back to the hotel and leaving negative reviews out of spite, even if they didn&#x27;t have any intention of stealing the robe.<p>That would make the hotel staff less snarky and rude, and more mindful about what they write on notes to guests...<p>Because this is the rude equivalent of the store clerk following around the aisles assuming you&#x27;re a thief. A high end hotel for the rich would never dream of writing something like this -- at least not in the good days before the race to the bottom.')
