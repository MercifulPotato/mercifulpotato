Item(by='albertzeyer', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604593491, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24999348, text='Yes, for Turing machines (TM), or a machine which is as powerful as a Turing machine, you need infinite memory. A Turing machine always infinite memory (the tape is infinite). This is an important property of a TM. Once you have a finite tape only, it is strictly less powerful. That means, for any model &#x2F; machine with finite memory, it is not as powerful as a Turing machine, i.e. not Turing complete.<p>So, (standard) RNNs with finite precision (standard floats) have finite memory, and thus are not Turing complete.<p>This paper (On the computational power of neural nets) shows that RNNs with infinite precision are Turing complete. But in practice, we never model RNNs that way. There are other ways we can add external (conceptually infinite) memory to a RNN. E.g. see neural turing machines (NTM) and differentiable neural computer (DNC).')
