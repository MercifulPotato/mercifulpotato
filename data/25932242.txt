IE, allow people to have the user page.<p>&gt;  It would be functionallly undiscoverable<p>Disagree.  There is still value in having that youtube user page for someone with existing audiences, even if they do not have youtube discovery.<p>Furthermore, even if youtube refuses to do discovery for these pages, it would still be possible for 3rd parties to do discovery.  Imagine if you could subscribe to a different discovery website that just takes information from youtube pages.<p>That would be interesting to drive competition in discovery algorithms and give people choice over that.')
