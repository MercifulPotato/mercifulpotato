I go to him when I have questions. People on the internet are obsessed with edge cases. “I once had a former employer come after me for X” might be a true story (or might be exaggerated) but you don’t hear from the thousand other people who never had that issue. A good lawyer can look at a contract and tell you the legality and enforceability but also things like “yeah they can technically get you there but it’ll cost them dollars on the penny to sue you so don’t worry too much about it “. Basically let you understand the risks you are taking.<p>So if you are very worried, I recommend dishing  out a few hundred dollars to talk to a lawyer. Call a few... sometimes they’ll give quick advice for free.<p>Side note, I am very curious what these new clauses are!')
