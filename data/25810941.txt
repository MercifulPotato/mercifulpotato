There are alternatives for this use, but all have various disadvantages, e.g. a lower lifetime or a lower efficiency.<p>I agree that wasting indium, which is probably the element with the lowest known resources compared to the known future needs for it, to make something like pigments, where there are a lot of mostly equivalent alternatives, is a serious mistake.')
