Those coal plants will still get their $4&#x2F;kW and the turned off renewables also get their $2&#x2F;kW because we want to subsidize them. It would be foolish to punish renewables for the failures of fossil fuels. So in the end you pay $6&#x2F;kW.\nA carbon tax would turn off the coal plants for good and replace them with something that can throttle faster. Ironically this means carbon taxes make energy cheaper.')
