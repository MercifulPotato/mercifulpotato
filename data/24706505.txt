These sorts of heat pumps come pre-charged with coolant, so after you connect the copper piping between the head (indoor) unit and the external compressor, you then need to pull a vacuum, validate the system is stable, then finally let the coolant into the entire system.<p>To me, this only highlights how some things are easily done with low cost, off the shelf parts.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.ca&#x2F;gp&#x2F;product&#x2F;B01N6IOBWF&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.ca&#x2F;gp&#x2F;product&#x2F;B01N6IOBWF&#x2F;</a><p>When I was a kid, there was no way to easily, or effectively find such things anywhere my small rural town.  Nor was there any easy way to even find magazines, which might have ads for companies selling such things!<p>What a world we live in.  Awesome.')
