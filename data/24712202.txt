Then it wouldn&#x27;t have side effects<p>State mutation is a side effect. If you mean it builds it up locally, it would then not have nonlocal side effects (e.g., it would have a pure functional interface even though it has an imperative implementation). But to do that, you&#x27;d have construction and mutation overhead in the code, whereas with functional idioms &#x2F; comprehensions, you would not.<p>This is especially the case when (as is often the case in practice) you are taking collection datastructures and producing collection structures to work with.')
