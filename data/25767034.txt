Do you think the numbers are useful though? Or just the &quot;status&quot;, e.g. popular or unpopular, which would be a simple change.<p>I would personally prefer to never see the actual numbers, as I know really high scores make me feel good, and low scores make me feel bad, and in a lot of people that sort of thing drives addiction and unhealthy habits (like checking and re-checking your upvotes as some sort of personal validation). Every so often I see people complaining about their scores which suggests it does affect people more than it should.<p>I think one of the reasons HN is so much better than other sites is the minimalist design, including the avoidance of &quot;engagement&quot; (i.e. addiction) anti-features, like emojis&#x2F;reactions, automatic scrolling, and personalisation of the feed. Showing the scores also falls in that category to me and should be removed.')
