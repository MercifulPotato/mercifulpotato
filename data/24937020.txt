It&#x27;s the Second Law of Thermodynamics: information cannot be created, only lost, and creating a faithful copy of document A requires you to discard an equivalent amount of information (usually in the form of “there&#x27;s usable energy over here”, in a very lossy process, but physics doesn&#x27;t <i>require</i> this) – which you can then recover by comparing your copy A with the original document A, and discarding one.<p>You&#x27;re not going to get the Complete Works of Shakespeare by any means other than by copying an existing copy of the Complete Works of Shakespeare; the odds are astronomical. You <i>might</i> get a description of calculus by other means (expending the effort <i>yourself</i> to produce it), but it&#x27;s not very likely you&#x27;d come up with it before somebody else made such a discovery public, unless:<p>• it&#x27;s recently become obvious that such a thing would be useful; and<p>• it&#x27;s easy enough to discover that you could figure it out in a year or two; and<p>• enough people were looking in that direction at the time (or one of them was a secretive sort of person).<p>That&#x27;s not to say that authorial monopolies are necessarily a <i>good</i> thing. But they <i>are</i> a meaningful concept.')
