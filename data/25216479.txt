I do wish you well in expanding the field. It&#x27;s a difficult problem.<p>Have you thought about personalizing the model with input from what a user has liked&#x2F;upvoted on various forums? Even with that, it encourages bubbles and echo chambers though.<p>I&#x27;m from a group that thrives on busting of um.. chops. If someone isn&#x27;t jabbing you, that&#x27;s when you should be concerned. Don&#x27;t tell the governor, but a group was hanging out tonight and hairstyles, music choices, fatness, and politics were all fair game. The same goes for online groups, family, and work.<p>Facebook and Twitter have tried this with the result being a total failure. Again, it&#x27;s a very difficult problem and if your team is able to pull it off, the product is going to be worth more than a browser plugin. Best wishes and much respect for taking on a difficult task.')
