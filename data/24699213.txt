Surely tech has reached the status of being a national interest, especially in relation to information and communication? What stops foreign firms from buying out large swaths of American tech after it has been broken up? TikTok shows how far foreign tech can penetrate the US market, and how nervous that makes the government.<p>I feel that the only reason the current Trump administration would want to break up tech giants, is so the remnants can be auctioned to the highest bidder. Maybe they are feeling emboldened by this TikTok&#x2F;Oracle deal, as botched as it is.')
