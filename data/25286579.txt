Which is backwards compatible with HTTP&#x2F;1.1, because, you guessed it.... nobody wants to add ports 82 and 440.</i><p>I’m not sure what you mean by backwards-compatible here. HTTP&#x2F;3 is not running over TCP port 80. It conveys the same <i>semantics</i> as older TCP HTTP, but that’s so applications can transparently use one or the other.<p>I’m afraid your rant only goes downhill from there. Your IPv7 and UDPv4 are quite implausible, especially where you’ve put them in the stack.<p>Look, we’re dealing with <i>people</i> here. You can’t just say “we’re dropping this thing you’ve been using for years, effective immediately”. We’re also dealing with capital investments: half the world is built upon stuff that only supports TCP and UDP at the layer on top of IP and can never support alternatives like SCTP. So <i>replacing</i> things takes a great deal of time. Therefore, sitting on top of existing protocols lets you do <i>something</i> rather than nothing.<p>All progress in all fields is developed on top of existing things.')
