If the airline changed the flight number but still flew the same passengers to the same destination at the same time, you wouldn&#x27;t say the flight has gotten canceled, right? I&#x27;m saying caring about the flight number is breaking the abstraction relevant to the passenger. The passenger isn&#x27;t purchasing a flight number; he&#x27;s purchasing a flight. What matters to the passenger is that the flight happens, not that a flight with a particular number happens.')
