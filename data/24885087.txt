White cells are empty rooms. Black cells are walls. The green cell is the starting point and the red cell is the finishing point.<p>Basic exploration algorithm:<p>Search adjacent rooms for the first unvisited room\nIf found, move there and place the direction of the movement made to the new room\nOtherwise, move to the opposite of the current room direction (backtracking)\nThe explorer only knows the rooms he has seen before. He can&#x27;t see the exit, the rooms that he has never passed by or the maze boundaries. The explorer tries to find the exit in the fewest moves possible, given that he has no clue where to search first.')
