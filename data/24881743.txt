Item(by='lucb1e', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603571293, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24881476, text='&gt; I&#x27;m not sure where people get the idea that Git provides what a blockchain does.<p>I think it&#x27;s often used as a joke for how broad the definition of &quot;a chain of blocks&quot; is. Probably some people take the comparison too literally. Unless we manage to convince everyone and their moms that when EvilCorp pushed TheirCoin as &quot;blockchain tech&quot; (when really EvilCorp is the party controlling it) we should just laugh and call it EvilCorp Credits, which (last time an evilcorp tried that) we didn&#x27;t, we need a more specific term than blockchain to distinguish EvilCorp Credits from Bitcoin.')
