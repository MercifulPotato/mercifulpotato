Many people view &quot;rights&quot; as only being negative rights - IE someone else&#x2F;the government <i>can&#x27;t</i> do X to you. Any talk of positive rights devolves into slavery, because at some point someone needs to do work to provide you with your positive rights, and what if they just don&#x27;t want to?<p>That is - if water is a human right, is <i>providing</i> water to people required for that right? Who is on the hook for that? Who pays for the pipes, the drilling, all of the infrastructure and operations to extract and transport it? If the answer is the government, then that is fair enough since it is just really a collective of every member of society mutually providing each other their rights. But is Nestle denying someone their human rights if they don&#x27;t give them a free glass of water?')
