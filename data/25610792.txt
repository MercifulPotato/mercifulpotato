Our current prison system delivers a horrible punishment, but in a way people can pretend it&#x27;s not occurring.  It would be better to deliver a less horrible punishment and make it public so people know it is occurring.  Not only would this be more humane, it also improves the deterrent value of punishment.  With the current justice system, people can pretend like doing crimes makes them into some sort of badass.  Public humiliation &#x2F; castration helps clarify that.  The goal is to deter crime effectively with as little suffering as possible.')
