Why can&#x27;t we all get comfortable downloading from the Web on mobile like we are on the desktop?<p>The only benefit to them I see is discoverability, so instead of building &quot;stores&quot; why don&#x27;t we build collections of applications from around the Web and display them in an app store-like interface. Developers can submit applications, they will show up in our &quot;store&quot; making them searchable and discoverable by users, and when users hit download it will take them to the developers Website to download and install an apk or whatever.')
