When using Mercurial back in the day I would manually split up commit, usually by copying over sets of files into a clean repo and committing there.<p>In Git tho the staging area is a lie. It encourages you commit half-truths. What I&#x27;d really want is to be able to enter a commit mode where the on-disk and staging area roles are flipped.<p>I want the stuff on disk to be what I commit, I want the &quot;staging area&quot; to be the changes that I&#x27;ve made that are not yet committed. This way I can pick a set of changes, compile, run tests and commit.<p>With Mercurial you could sorta do this with stashing I think, but I swore off it after losing changes a few times.')
