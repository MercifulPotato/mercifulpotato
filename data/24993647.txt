If we only have a minimal RISC instruction set, it can generate a large batch of RISC instructions.  If we have a wizard SIMD instruction to speed things up, we have a higher likelihood of being able to put it to use.<p>For languages of a lower semantic level (just a wrapper over loads, stores, and arithmetic), making a compiler that can figure out whether the source is a good candidate for a particular hardware feature can be an intractable problem.')
