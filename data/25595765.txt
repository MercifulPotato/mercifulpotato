I found the third act really deviated from the rest of the story compared to how tight the other mentioned films were. Did you think it seemed out of place?<p>It was a fun watch, and it made me want to watch &quot;Oklahoma&quot; again, but it was somewhere in the middle in terms of rankings. I literally just added the book to my library checkout list, and I&#x27;m #22 on 15 copies, so I guess it is popular. :)<p>Can&#x27;t wait to read Antkind tho.')
