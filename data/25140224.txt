Their engineers in rural areas are much cheaper and they now have a <i>strong</i> incentive to hire more people in Des Moines than in SF.  They do so, thus driving up the demand for (and thus, price of) engineers in Des Moines.  Likewise, by hiring fewer SF engineers, they&#x27;re driving down the demand for (and thus, price of) engineers in SF.  Give it a while and the national price for a given engineer converges.<p>I don&#x27;t know exactly what the timeline here is - probably longer than a couple years, but less than 20.  As an SF engineer, this&#x27;ll probably pull my salary down, but the salary of engineers throughout the country up.')
