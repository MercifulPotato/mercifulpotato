But with everyday life increasingly dependent on online services, he said Singapore has decided it is time to provide the infosec equivalent of clean tap water to all.<p>One way the nation is doing so is with services that the private sector can – pardon the pun - tap into. To that end the country offers “SingPass”, a national identity scheme that links citizens to services and is also offered to private enterprise such as banks as a free-to-use alternative to developing their own authentication schemes.</i><p>I&#x27;m pretty envious when it comes to the quality and pragmatism of government in Singapore and the degree to which they&#x27;re on top of changing and raising their standards as tech becomes more and more part of public infrastructure.<p>If there&#x27;s one constant that seems to go through Singapore&#x27;s history it&#x27;s that the administration doesn&#x27;t just stop when they&#x27;ve accomplished something and then declares everything else to be someone&#x27;s private obligation, but continues to raise standards.')
