Item(by='mattnewton', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606066863, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25178452, text='Maybe, but I guess the key question is whether facebook has standing and a duty to make that decision on behalf of their users&#x27; privacy, or if it should be left up to the user. Whether or not we trust facebook is relevant to that argument. If we don&#x27;t buy that this is necessary for facebook to intervene and defend user privacy, the only conclusion I can come with is that they are making this decision because of a threat to their business. And I can&#x27;t see much of a difference between &quot;we should let the users share their information with Facebook for a better experience on the platform&quot; with &quot;we should let users share their information with NYU to power publically available research in ad targeting&quot;')
