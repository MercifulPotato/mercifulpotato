They are blinded by the numbers they see in other&#x27;s people&#x27;s checks.<p>Instead, if companies give coupons to pay for rent and food, nobody would complain because they wouldn&#x27;t see the real value of different cities&#x27; coupons.<p>IMO, the effort should be focused on improving the conversion formulas. Although from what I&#x27;ve seen, people living in cheaper cities are getting a better deal than their colleagues living in SF or NY right now.')
