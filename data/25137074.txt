I worked on this as a side project because I wanted to test the new web based 3D engine - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.babylonjs.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.babylonjs.com&#x2F;</a>. It quickly grew into something I actually wanted to do for a while - a free, easy to use, and beautifully visualized breathing techniques app. Recently I moved the project to this new domain - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;breathing.tips" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;breathing.tips</a> and refactored a bit so that it&#x27;s super easy to add new tips with minimal HTML skills. Iâ€™ve been sharing it with people on reddit and I&#x27;m getting pretty positive feedback so far, so I decided to share it here as well. Let me know what you like (or not). Here&#x27;s what I think is cool about it:<p>- Free &amp; open source<p>- Minimalistic and easy to use. No apps, no logins, no charts<p>- Looks great on both mobile and desktop<p>The most popular tips, it seems, are the anxiety and relaxation ones. What other technique would you like to see?')
