My RPi4 has a Noctua 40mm x 20mm fan that is inaudible from more than a couple feet away.<p>Sure, it would be fairly easy to design a die cast housing to cool the RPi silently, and the part cost would be about the same as a fan, but the tooling costs are going to be fairly high for a product that really won&#x27;t sell a ton of units.')
