It is preferable that the system running the code should make\nthe decisions on how best execute it. Especially as hardware becomes more specialized and diverse. Additionally,\nguarantees of stability necessarily increase maintenance burdens, so they should be avoided whenever possible.<p>IMO, the best solution would be something like SPIR-V. That is, programs are shipped in an intermediate\nrepresentation which a platform-specific compiler would reduce to the final program. That way no stable ABI is\nneeded, there is less maintenance for distros and toolchains, and end users still get high quality binaries.<p>Of course there are issues with protecting the intermediate representations of programs from reverse engineering.\nBut the combination of strong DRM with obfuscation should satisfy most software vendors. After all, most companies\nare comfortable shipping <i>Java</i> based programs.')
