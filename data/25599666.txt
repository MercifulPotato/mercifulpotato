People can message me whenever is convenient for them and I&#x27;ll read and respond whenever it&#x27;s convenient for me.<p>I work with people from different time zones and people who like to keep different schedules, some waking up very early or working very late, and I myself wake up pretty late. It just doesn&#x27;t make sense that I should demand people message according to my schedule, but I&#x27;m also not going to wake up early or work late to match theirs.')
