RMS is Richard Stallman, the originator of the GNU project on which the Linux kernel is based, as well as the GPL.   RMS disagrees with ESR, in that he argues that the term &quot;open source&quot; is a distraction from the larger goal of free software ( <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gnu.org&#x2F;philosophy&#x2F;open-source-misses-the-point.en.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gnu.org&#x2F;philosophy&#x2F;open-source-misses-the-point....</a>) .<p>There have been plenty of other authors with strong opinions on the subject but these are the two whose names most often come up in the context.  Point being, it is unreasonable to say that &quot;open source&quot; is a term of art (as the GP did) whose meaning will be agreed upon by practitioners and advocates everywhere.')
