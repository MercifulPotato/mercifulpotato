Item(by='triceratops', descendants=None, kids=[25182720], score=None, time=1606091930, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25181898, text='&gt; often unable to speak English<p>Friendly reminder: the US does not have a national or official language.[1] They only harm themselves by not knowing English and usually they try very hard to learn so as to not be at a disadvantage.<p>&gt; while either committing fraud by using someone&#x27;s SSN or avoiding paying tax entirely<p>If they use someone else&#x27;s SSN, the payroll taxes are still being paid, so the taxpayer isn&#x27;t losing out. In fact, it&#x27;s free money for the SSA because they&#x27;ll never have to pay out benefits to most of these people later. (Would <i>you</i> take the risk of claiming Social Security if you were here illegally?)<p>If they get paid cash under the table, there are two parties acting illegally - the employer is also to blame (and possibly, laundering money, which is an additional crime). I don&#x27;t see much vitriol directed against employers though. I hear &quot;Build the wall&quot; but never &quot;Shut them down&quot; (for employers who illegally employ undocumented workers).<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Languages_of_the_United_States#Official_languages" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Languages_of_the_United_States...</a>')
