You write an imperative program and make functions and objects as &quot;compressions&quot; of your original code, where suitable. That way you don&#x27;t end up with a jungle of objects, and, on the other hand, don&#x27;t start constructing monads or producing hundreds of tiny functions just for the ideology of it all.')
