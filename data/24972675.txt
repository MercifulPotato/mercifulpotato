I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;re not accessible and hard to make so, and some sections are so narrow as to be positively dangerous.<p>Building new platforms that were just &quot;as wide as the original subway platforms&quot; would be the bonkers thing.<p>Sure it&#x27;s more expensive to build it big, but I bet its more expensive still (if not totally impossible) to build it small then _re_build it big a few decades later.')
