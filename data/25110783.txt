An anecdote, but I live in a city centre, quite close to a primary school. There are multiple range rovers parked outside in the mornings and afternoons. Living in edinburgh, your primary school is assigned based on your post code, so these kids are being driven less than a mile to school in 2L SUVs, in an area where the roads are gritted, and it&#x27;s snowed a handful of times in the 7 years I&#x27;ve lived here. From speaking to my neighbors, most of the trips my neighbors make are less than 10 miles, and even at that, it&#x27;s only an occasional 30-40 mile trip to one of the nearer seaside areas. _all_ of these trips are feasible with an EV.<p>&gt; but diesel engines do last longer.\n&quot;Longer&quot; kind of doesn&#x27;t matter these days. Sure, a diesel engine will literally never die, however my first car was a 1.4L peugeot with 260,000 miles on it. The engine and chassis were the only parts that hadn&#x27;t been replaced by the time I got it, which is 25 years of your current mileage.<p>&gt; I&#x27;m not opposed to EVs but I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;ll be cheap ones like my Diesel if ever or at least for a long long time.<p>A person commuting 200 miles per week, driving an old, heavily polluting car is likely to be one of the most affected by these changes. People with your driving habits are the reason that regulations like this have to exist in these forms. Poeple will hyper=optimise for their own benefit, as all of the externalities aren&#x27;t costed. At the very least, buy a post-2008 diesel with a DPF in it.')
