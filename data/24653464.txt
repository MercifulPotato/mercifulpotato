I was hired down here this year, so no more corporate expensed AAdvantage points for me.  I just got my AAdvantage card so I can earn airline points when I buy groceries or whatever.<p>Sometimes I need to travel, but if I had enough points for a  roundtrip or two, I might take a weekend and fly to go see someone some weekend - when things get back to normal any how.  If I had to buy a roundtrip plane ticket for over $300, I might think twice about it, even though I can afford $300.  If I get the flight on points, I might just go for a weekend getaway.  My card has no annual fee, and I don&#x27;t plan on carrying anything other than a small balance, if any, so it all works out for me as far as I can see.')
