If the AG is busy, I should be able to sue. If I can&#x27;t afford to sue, an AG should be able to take it up on my behalf.<p>2) Go back to circa 1800 style courts, where you don&#x27;t need a lawyer to represent you. You both make your case to the judge. Not too much procedure. Perhaps extending small claims court up to $100,000 would do much of the same.')
