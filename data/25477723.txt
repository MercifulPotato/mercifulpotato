I always feel bad for the US that it doesn&#x27;t have a decent use of the rail network for such a beautiful country.<p>Hands down one of the best things you can do as a young European is get an Interail&#x2F;Eurorail Pass. Wake up with your friends in a hostel in Berlin? How about looking on a map and deciding going to Prague that day? Easy.<p>We did about 15 countries in five&#x2F;six weeks the first time and it gave such a great feeling of being a European, of the benefits of EU membership and getting to explore the culture, history, partying etc of the place. For very cheap. The train is so nice to chill out compared to a car and to see things you wouldn&#x27;t see by flying. Plus you find yourself going to places you wouldn&#x27;t do otherwise as you can just jump off somewhere along the way and maybe stay there for a few hours or days.<p>It&#x27;s so awesome that the EU is bringing in a discounted&#x2F;free pass for young citizens soon. It&#x27;s by far the best way for people to really appreciate some of its best benefits as you sit chatting to people doing the same thing from half a dozen other countries over a beer on a train adventure somewhere.')
