Second, I&#x27;m not Western either. Third, I&#x27;m not an Apple user.<p>With that out of the way, the number one way to empower children is not to send them to factories but to give them an education. Make them part of a system where their basic needs are taken care of (free Healthcare, education, school meals). Your basis of &quot;empower economically&quot; is pointless if their monetary gains come at the cost of social development.')
