Hindustani (Indian which is influenced by both Hinduism and later Islamic contribution, Carnatic which is mostly Hindu).<p>People familiar with Indian music can easily distinguish between classical music and non classical music but for a layman like me the test is :<p>1. Is the piece being based on some well known Raga (Raga - is a mood or a tune in very rough sense). \n2. Is it being sung by a person with years of training in classical music which is learned from a Guru.')
