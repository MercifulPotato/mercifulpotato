These are whopping 50% heavier than Sony MXs, which I already rarely use because of the weight on the top of my head. The mesh looks like a definite improvement (the Sony’s top cushion gets hot from the pressure on my hair), but I doubt that will make up the huge difference.<p>So this is first gen and is likely going to see a ton of improvement. I would:<p>1) drop the crown, just like on the Watch it will likely lead to accidental changes of volume and is kinda gimicky\n2) replace metal with light solid plastic<p>Next gen should tought “Half of the weight of previous generated for unprecendeted comfort”')
