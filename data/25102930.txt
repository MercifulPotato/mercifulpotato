The way we design our social platforms has a gigantic impact on how people see each other, and talk to each other, and the impact that has on us.<p>Perhaps the problem isn&#x27;t the self-reinforcement, but rather the platforms being designed more on instantaneous engagement and addiction rather than talking and human-level discussion.<p>We&#x27;ve devolved internet discourse into very simplistic, unintelligent, instant gratification that&#x27;s friendly to advertising and monetization.<p>That makes a lot more sense, and why I think it&#x27;s so important to think of this problem as a much bigger systemic ecosystem.
