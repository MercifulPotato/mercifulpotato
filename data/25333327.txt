So there is lots of &quot;optionality&quot; in an otherwise good set of rules<p>As an American, this is wild to me. I’m not sure how it works for our public houses, but as a private citizen I actually have to pay the local city to bring a government inspector out and double check any electrical, plumbing, etc. work that I do. The people that built my home decades ago likewise had to pay a percentage of the home’s value to the city for inspection.<p>The idea that a developer anywhere can decide who gets to inspect their building seems like an obviously bad idea.')
