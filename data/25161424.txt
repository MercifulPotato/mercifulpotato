Or, given that Covid will probably exist in some form for many years to come (even with a vaccine), when will you stop wearing one?<p>Because you could make a case for mandatory mask wearing at all times, forever, using the same logic that&#x27;s currently being employed: &quot;it&#x27;s only a minor inconvenience and if it saves even one life, it&#x27;s worth it&quot;.<p>Presumably you won&#x27;t wear a mask forever: you&#x27;ll make a personal decision, based on data or gut feeling, that the &quot;effect size&quot; of mask wearing is no longer worth the inconvenience. You were already making that calculation, implicitly, when you chose not to wear a mask during flu season last year.<p>That calculation will be different for every individual. Which is why I don&#x27;t think any of us is really in a position to judge another person when the parameters of the calculation are different for them. Ultimately, the differing parameters of that calculation are what we call &quot;ideology&quot;.<p>To return to my original point, it&#x27;s also why we vitally need an open discussion on the &quot;effect size&quot; of wearing a mask. If it&#x27;s large (I suspect it is not), then it gives more weight to the idea that all the Karens should just shut up and wear one. If it&#x27;s small, there&#x27;s a lot more room for personal choice.')
