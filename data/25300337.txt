Presumably it wasn&#x27;t to lay out a case so that the email could be leaked and twitter could understand their rationale. It was just telling her the reason they are not letting her take her last 2 weeks. She still gets paid, she just can&#x27;t come into the office. I don&#x27;t understand why you think that email should be convincing evidence to you, an outsider who has absolutely zero to do with the employment contract between Timnit and Google. Surely, Timnit and relevant parties at Google have more context than you or I do.<p>&gt; The vague justification is not borne out by any evidence.<p>...that&#x27;s been leaked onto twitter.')
