As a non Mac person who has occasionally used a Mac, it makes perfect sense.<p>&gt; The only thing I expect to act as an Explorer window is … an Explorer window.<p>One thing I wanted to add from my perspective (software engineer, use Linux and Windows): if I observed that the “save” button had created a literal Explorer window, then I think I would expect it to function as a Explorer window. I’m not surprised by that because I can recognize that Microsoft has taken the approach of implementing everything they can using Explorer. This gets back to what was discussed in the article actually!<p>Overall I think I prefer the approach Apple takes on this problem.')
