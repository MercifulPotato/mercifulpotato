It&#x27;s become a stereotype that Roma are all about emotions, sadness and hapiness at the same time, but the photos show it remarkably well. I agree with him -- it&#x27;s simple, nobody should live like that. But in reality it&#x27;s complicated because a lot of people in that part of the world have it hard. It&#x27;s difficult to accept that somebody may have it even harder, and simply cannot change much on their own. Even if they try, they are struck down by systemic racism. And if they don&#x27;t try, they confirm the stereotypes. And on the other hand the empathy is mostly academic and limited to watching photos like these. Once you&#x27;re directly exposed to something like this, it&#x27;s easy to look the other way because individuals are also products of their environment, and the environment is tough.<p>The situation of Roma is always a good counter example to the statement &quot;no racism in Europe&quot;. Perhaps there was never official segregation, but there is almost always implicit segregation. They can ride the bus, but more intimate relationships between the Roma and non-Roma population are rare. True friendships, marriages etc. So it&#x27;s not Mississippi of the 50&#x27;s, but there&#x27;s also been little progress in the last decades. Which is a pity because IMHO there is no quick fix, only slowly changing what is considered to be normal.')
