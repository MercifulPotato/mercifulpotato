Each new generation there&#x27;s more people. Everyone wants to live in the same house, but they can&#x27;t all fit. They try to build the house larger, but it will only work so high with brick. So they start shoving tin and iron and steel into each new floor to reinforce it. Eventually you have a skyscraper where the top floors are built out of titanium, and the bottom floor is several-hundred-years-old brick. But hey, we have a taller building!<p>You could say this is a perfect example of evolution, like big bright red baboon butts. But if the evolution were conscious, we&#x27;d want things to improve over time, not just make the same crap scale larger.')
