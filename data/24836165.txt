A friend of mine has it pretty bad; trying to adhere to a nominal 24hr has utterly failed him. If I recall, his body runs on about a 26hr schedule in a 13 day cycle. He fought it for a long time but ended up just being a zombie all day long until he found work that let him roll with it (which means for some portion of the cycle he&#x27;s working midnight to 8am)<p>It&#x27;s super inconvenient; if anyone knows of any potential resources I would happily pass them along to him. He&#x27;s found something that works, but it&#x27;s pretty inconvenient for... you know... integrating with the rest of the world.')
