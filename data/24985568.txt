Give me a book about stuff we have some real confidence about.  Maybe I&#x27;m not the intended audience for this book any more?  I feel like when I was younger I felt like I had all the time and energy in the world, and I devoured this stuff, but now I&#x27;m tired and stretched and for me this kind of writing falls into a no-man&#x27;s land between &quot;zero-effort entertainment&quot; and &quot;applicable to&#x2F;stretching me for life.&quot;')
