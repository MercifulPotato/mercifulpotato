(<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;1311.3200" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;1311.3200</a>) show that assuming we have a kinder, non-malicious scheduler, the situation looks even better: lock-free (some process can make progress) algorithms have a stronger progress property of being <i>wait-free</i> (every process can make progress).<p>As omazurov mentioned as a top-level comment, threads can also die, which is rather like never being scheduled. In practice, I suspect that you&#x27;re right that it&#x27;s often too extreme of a modelâ€”many programs use locks and don&#x27;t worry too much about this issue.')
