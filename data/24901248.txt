The commenter is correct that IT admins take a conservative stance (&quot;no&quot; by default) but that doesn&#x27;t mean your startup can&#x27;t break into big enterprise using a bottoms-up motion. Unless the business is in a highly regulated industry, employees <i>will</i> sign up to try the product and, in most cases, won&#x27;t ask IT for approval.<p>This is indicative of a broader trend in how software is distributed in the enterprise. Whereas software was traditionally purchased tops-down (i.e. CIO purchasing decision), today&#x27;s software products are increasingly product-led &amp; bottoms-up (i.e. end user purchasing). Classic examples include Dropbox, Slack and now Notion, Airtable, etc.')
