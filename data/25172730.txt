Item(by='O1111OOO', descendants=None, kids=[25172936], score=None, time=1605992527, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25171508, text='&gt; What a bizarrely great site.<p>I was organizing a ton of old saved files (including saved webpages) from many years back (some over a decade old). One of the pages I had saved was &quot;X-Ray Solves Secret of Life (Jun, 1939)&quot; : <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.modernmechanix.com&#x2F;x-ray-solves-secret-of-life&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.modernmechanix.com&#x2F;x-ray-solves-secret-of-life&#x2F;</a> (interesting read on what can happen with emerging tech).<p>I checked to see if the site still existed (lots of my old saved files point to dead domains or interestingly, domains that have been repurposed for completely different businesses unrelated to their original content). As I crawled around the site, my impressions were exactly like yours. Treasure trove of interesting historical info!<p>I came across the ASCII article and decided to post. I love ASCII art but also wanted to point HN users to the site.<p>&gt; luck of the draw that they chose a free maintenance-less platform<p>I was curious about this too. Just checked and it&#x27;s running Wordpress 5.2 (released 07may2019). Some of the other backend tech is a little dated...<p>side note: Years ago, I was always curious if I should have been saving webpages as MHT or MAFF files. Now that both of these containers are dead, it turned out that Mozilla&#x27;s MAFF was the better solution. It&#x27;s just a compressed format, easy to unzip and all the pages were as viewable as the originals. For MHT files, I needed Pale Moon running with an MHT extension (used this to resave pages as &quot;html complete&quot;).')
