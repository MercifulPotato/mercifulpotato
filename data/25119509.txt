Until I read the last sentence, I was going to suggest using a walking stick as a visual way of signalling to others that you have some sort of disability and can’t just quickly move out of their way. As a (mostly) healthy and regular pedestrian, I come across the groups you mention – and those who walk with their eyes glued to their phone, expecting others to move out of their way. I really would’ve thought that they’d show more consideration to older people or others, such as your uncle, who are obviously less sprightly. :(<p>I love going for walks and every now and again, I have to remind myself that I’m lucky to be able to do so and shouldn’t take it for granted. Best wishes to you and others who don’t have the same luxury.')
