It is just versioned file storage at the end of the day.<p>I&#x27;ve only dabbled in their CI platforms, and as far as I recall, no one has ever made comments on any of my projects. I would be surprised if most people actually think that if they put something on GitHub that a task force of hundreds of dedicated open source volunteers will suddenly descend on the project and start contributing.')
