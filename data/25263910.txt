In fact, over time I have searched my texts at least a dozen times for stuff that happened <i>years ago</i>. It might be links&#x2F;references that I&#x27;m looking for or answers to questions like &quot;When did Paul and I go to X?&quot; and &quot;When exactly did I meet Sara?&quot; in which case Paul and Sara often don&#x27;t remember the answer, either. Also, I have a dozen or so friends &amp; acquaintances that I only get in touch with about once a year (mostly because they&#x27;re living on the other end of the world) and, in this case, knowing what we last chatted about is a tremendous help in picking up the conversation where we left off. (Suddenly I magically &quot;remember&quot; that they told me they had started a new job.)')
