The Congress cannot do anything not in Article 1, Section 8 (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.senate.gov&#x2F;civics&#x2F;constitution_item&#x2F;constitution" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.senate.gov&#x2F;civics&#x2F;constitution_item&#x2F;constitution</a>...).</i><p>&gt; <i>The CDC is in fact unconstitutional and should be terminated.</i><p>I do not disagree with where you&#x27;re coming from in principle (as I alluded to at the end of my comment). But if that&#x27;s the change we want, <i>how</i> we go about it is important. Right now the US is highly dependent on the federal CDC - equivalent local institutions generally do not exist to a significant extent, due to much lower tax rates and inability to print money. If we wish to move towards more local control, then we need to make sure our local institutions are functional before getting rid of the federal ones, lest we be left out in the cold as we have been for this pandemic.<p>Furthermore, to the extent that the federal bloat is unconstitutional in general, there are more pressing federal agencies that need to be reigned in first. It&#x27;s foolish to want to sabotage agencies that provide us actual services (CDC, NPS, SSA) while overtly hostile agencies (NSA, CIA, FBI) continue on just fine.')
