I&#x27;ve noticed it with my 2020 MBP, which gets too hot to type with while playing a relatively simple game, and which seems to be hotter than my 2013 Air playing the same game. My friend&#x27;s iPhone X seems to get hotter than my iPhone 6, which in turn seems to get hotter than my older phones.   There are a lot of comments on how most of the volume of the PS5 is there to account for heat dissipation.<p>As devices improve, is it just expected that they&#x27;ll create more heat?')
