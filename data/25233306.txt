Overall it only took like 30 seconds to assemble each slide once I knew the content I wanted to have, since it&#x27;s just HTML in the end.<p>It also has a nice a presenter layout to see slide notes. Perfect for live streaming a remote presentation while having notes off to the side that no one can see on the stream.<p>The best part about it is the standalone version doesn&#x27;t require running a Node server. It&#x27;s just basic HTML, CSS and JS that you can open straight in a browser.<p>I&#x27;ll be using it for future presentations.')
