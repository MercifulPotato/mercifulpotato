We don&#x27;t disagree there.<p>However, I don&#x27;t see how if a person has no first&#x2F;last name, and expects to be referred so, can be construed as disrespect to the English-speaking culture. There is no need to learn another language; all it takes is to &quot;know&quot; that the person has one string as a name.<p>You said it helps with sorting, and that is exactly why I said cutting a foot to fit a shoe. It&#x27;s asking people to change their name for the sake of paper work.<p>I don&#x27;t expect to show up and make a country change, for the sake of me. My name is already in first&#x2F;last form.<p>I wish countries, and systems (frankly many of which are expanding to be used worldwide) to change, because I believe it to be the right direction, and in the end will save everyone&#x27;s time.')
