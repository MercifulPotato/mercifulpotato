More importantly, the whole government is structured to prevent someone making themself king.<p>Let&#x27;s say that the worst case scenario had happened, and the terrorists had taken members of congress hostage and used the situation to demand that Trump be retained in power indefinitely.<p>They wouldn&#x27;t have any leverage beyond the ordinary because in the US, our political officials are easily replaced.  In fact, the problem we usually have is that they aren&#x27;t replaced often enough.<p>Holding the capital building and the entire congress hostage doesn&#x27;t mean they have control of the US... it only means they control a building and some hostages.<p>That&#x27;s the thing that so many anarchist&#x2F;white supremacist&#x2F;revolutionary plots in the US fail to consider... that you can&#x27;t decapitate the US government and then just take the place of the people you killed, because the rest of the country will just refuse to follow you.<p>The only way a Germany-style takeover of the government is really possible is with years of slow changes... that has been happening, but hopefully now that it&#x27;s out in the open we can do something about it.')
