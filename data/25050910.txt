This includes content related to LGBTQ+ people and sexual health.<p>Parler is not a &quot;free speech&quot; website.  Parler is a safe space for right wing extremists who got tired of getting banned from traditional social media sites for posting hate, and who prefer an environment that is as hostile to minority groups as they are.')
