I am not one of those (if I do say so myself).  I don&#x27;t like to step on other peoples&#x27; toes or piss people off.  I value the happiness of certain other people over my own, mostly.  I am unwilling to sacrifice certain things (family) for other goals that I might have.<p>These traits (some might say virtues) are limitations on what I can accomplish.  People without these limitations are often perceived as assholes, but with the right combination of other traits&#x2F;virtues, they can really do great things.<p>That&#x27;s how I see it anyway.  I&#x27;m not making excuses for myself, and I still intend to do something great, but I don&#x27;t have expectations of changing the world or being the greatest.')
