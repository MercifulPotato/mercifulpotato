Economic literacy is similar. I am using the English language in a very straightforward manner.<p>&gt; the notion that high taxes will somehow benefit the state is a very ill thought out plan.<p>Who said anything about increasing total state revenue? After Prop 13 passed, a big chunk of the state revenue was tied up in propping up local governments. By undoing the damage of this highly regressive policy, the state will have the ability to reduce regressive taxes and even income taxes. It will also encourage development (new property developers will no longer be disadvantaged vs. existing landowners), bringing in more money (and reducing blight) and reducing the need to tax individual earners even more.')
