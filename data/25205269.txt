To be sure, the Air and 13&quot; Pro are ultrabooks, and this seems to be a great fit for the great performance being extracted while sipping battery life.<p>On the other hand, it&#x27;s not a foregone conclusion that higher performance systems will dominate the competition. For most Apple-focused users, this is a comparison between overheating Intel chips shoved into Macs, and these slick new M1 chips, and it&#x27;s a no-brainer. And yes, the M1 does compete very well in several benchmarks on a per core&#x2F;instruction per clock basis. But the higher end &quot;many&quot; core CPUs (especially outside the Intel universe <i>cough</i> AMD) with much higher TDP are still achieving much higher overall performance. Apple still has to catch up to them in those markets.<p>And for many people, right now Apple systems just are not an option. Not until all software and games run without issue. Software is a near certainty - games remain to be seen, but Apple has not prioritized them in the past. (And while the M1 integrated graphics are great, they are not at all competitive with existing dedicated graphics, and will not be suitable for replacing gaming systems.)')
