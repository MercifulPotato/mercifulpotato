Writing a compiler in a low-level language won&#x27;t necessarily result in better performance. It <i>can</i>, if you put in enough performance work, of course.<p>But if you want to keep the code simpler, a higher-level language could potentially give better performance, simply because it&#x27;s easier to share data structures, avoid copying, etc. Additionally, things like immutable persistent maps are a great fit for environments in a compiler, and they are much easier to implement in a language with garbage collection.<p>That said, obviously some high-level languages are still going to be too slow without also putting in a lot of work. I think there&#x27;s a sweet spot with languages that compile to reasonably fast machine code but are also garbage collected. Languages like OCaml, Go, Haskell. Though I personally wouldn&#x27;t use Go, but that&#x27;s for reasons other than performance.')
