Even on PC hardware there are cards right now that will not render VGA modes correctly, or on all monitors. And what if you have two VGA cards? It&#x27;s more common these days to have two VGA cards rather than one, and you simply have no way to use two cards simultaneously with standard PC VGA.<p>&gt; Not all of that complication is necessary, however.<p>Sure, but it is there, and the dream of going back to a platform where everything is standarized at the IO register level is just wishful thinking.')
