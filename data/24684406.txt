You don&#x27;t think people should be able to own property that they don&#x27;t live in.  You don&#x27;t think banks should be able to foreclose.  And when push comes to shove, you want property owners and banks to lose money first.<p>And you falsely believe that owning property puts you into the top 1%.<p>I think that about sums it up?<p>-------------<p>Nearly half of landlords are what is called &quot;mom and pop&quot; landlords.  Just normal people who happen to own rental property, a duplex, or a small apartment complex.  These aren&#x27;t rich people.  They aren&#x27;t 1%ers.  I genuinely think you need to venture out into the world more and meet some different people.  Meet some of these evil people that need to pay.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.huduser.gov&#x2F;portal&#x2F;pdredge&#x2F;pdr-edge-frm-asst-sec-061118.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.huduser.gov&#x2F;portal&#x2F;pdredge&#x2F;pdr-edge-frm-asst-sec...</a>')
