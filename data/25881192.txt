Leaving money tied up on the service indefinitely is not really an option when you start talking about the kind of money that would actually motivate someone to do a lot of work.<p>This creates a problem where it&#x27;s really risky for a developer to take on any hard problems. If funds can be pulled at any time, you might not get paid. Also, of course,  there&#x27;s duplication of effort- someone might beat you to closing the issue, meaning you get nothing and have wasted your time.<p>This, in turn, means that pricing on the service must be very high to account for the risks of non-payment, or be so low as to be insignificant.<p>There are some mitigation strategies available. Funding could have an end date, after which the funds are returned to the funder. This still leaves the issue of parallel effort, which seems harder to solve. Preregistering to close an issue by some deadline might work, but likely would result in a lot of issues going unsolved, and now you need some kind of ranking system for developers on the service...')
