It probably isn&#x27;t bringing in customers that Gitlab would want, and it is taking up space where an effective starter plan should be. Why not replace it with a slightly beefed up &quot;basic&quot; plan at about $120&#x2F;year? They could throw in a 3 month trial at the start to ease the barrier of initial sign-up.')
