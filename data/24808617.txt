Canvas and WebGL. To &quot;prevent clearing cookies to bypass paywall&quot; fraud and ban scrapers.<p>Even taking these statements at face value, considering that javascript is single-threaded by default it still sounds  like a perceptual performance problem (not real performance problem) resulting from a poor software architecture. Expensive tasks are expected to be offloaded out of the main thread to avoid getting it blocked.')
