This pushes competition towards cheaper and cheaper sources of energy. First it&#x27;s finding jurisdictions that subsidize it, then it&#x27;s creating your own cheaper energy sources. Proof-of-work incentivizes cheap &amp; renewable energy investment.<p>The penultimate phase is custom off-grid mining farms that power themselves via their own renewables. The endgame is that all energy companies will primarily be Bitcoin mining companies, feeding their excess renewable energy into the grid to power homes, etc.')
