Item(by='totalZero', descendants=None, kids=[25884027], score=None, time=1611418040, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25876488, text='This is hilarious for two reasons.<p>One, Delaware existed prior to the founding of the United States of America, so your general point about small states is not carried by this WY-specific comment about the process whereby territories become states. And besides, there were people in WY before it formally became a state. Do you also believe that doctors don&#x27;t exist before they graduate from medical school? lol<p>Two, during that debate about Delaware in 1787, Elbridge Gerry made the same exact argument that you are making here. It wasn&#x27;t a convincing argument then, and in fact he is now best known for the term &quot;gerrymandering&quot; that was named for him.<p>The Tenth Amendment limits the rights of the federal government and requires the federal government to respect and protect the rights of the states, something that the Supreme Court has repeatedly done. So even if WY did not and could not exist independently, the fact that it is a state makes it CA&#x27;s equal in some respects, including upper-house representation. This design was not an accident, but rather a thoughtful and intentional check upon the tyranny of the majority.')
