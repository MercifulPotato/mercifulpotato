The dispute there is whether hiQ could scrape public LinkedIn pages.<p>The crux of the issue is that if instructions on how to use data that someone has access to without &quot;breaking and entering&quot; don&#x27;t count as revoking &quot;authorization&quot;, this law doesn&#x27;t cover this officer&#x27;s actions (though other laws &#x2F; job requirements may). If just breaking verbal or written terms of use is enough to criminalize it, that covers a whole bunch of things we&#x27;d think of as not federal crimes, like lying about your age to set up a facebook account.')
