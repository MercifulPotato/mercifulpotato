I&#x27;m continuously surprised at how much hate Brave gets from HN. It&#x27;s a decent browser with a unique and novel way to try to deal with the current adpocalypse. If anything, they should be celebrated for actually trying out a new business model. Come to think of it though, the comment sums up HN perfectly, ending with `deeply involved the incredibly shade business of cryptocurrencies`.<p>I&#x27;ve been using Brave for about a year now and am really happy with it. I love paying creators directly and just wish more creators would sign up for the rewards.')
