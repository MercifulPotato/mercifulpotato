Section 230(c)(1) protects a company only when content is &quot;provided by &#x2F;another&#x2F; information content provider&quot;. Nowhere does this provision protect a company that is itself the information content provider.<p>And an information content provider is not just the primary author or creator, it is anyone &quot;responsible, &#x2F;in whole or in part&#x2F;, for the creation of development&quot; of the content.
