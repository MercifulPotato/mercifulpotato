This year for the first time in about four years I actually read something other than technical non-fiction, including science fiction and an autobiography.<p>Anyway here is my list.<p><i>Bullshit Jobs</i> - This is a controversial book (and paper) for obvious reasons.  However, it really resonated with me at the time I read it.  I think it was the thing that pushed me to find a different job.<p><i>Sid Meier&#x27;s Memoir!</i> - I&#x27;ve had a passing interest in developing games for a long time and having the opportunity to peek into the life and mind of someone who created one of the most iconic games of all time was really valuable to me.  Inspirational read.<p><i>Starting Forth</i> - Ok, maybe not exactly life changing.  I was in search of <i>something else</i> for programming microcontrollers and I found Forth.  It breathed new life into my interest in this domain.<p><i>The Little Book of Big Change: The No-Willpower Approach to Breaking Any Habit</i> - It remains to be seen if this book was really life changing, but I found it insightful either way.  Overall I think the content is valuable but I had to make a conscious effort to look past some of the pseudoscientific aspects like such as the numerous mentions of the &quot;Universal Mind&quot;.')
