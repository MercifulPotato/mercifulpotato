This is a country where minimum wage is 2300₺ ($290) and around half the country is being paid that amount. iPhone 12 Pro? Base model rumored to be $1900.<p>Oh, and cars cost around 4 times more expensive, so a second hand 2007 Ford Fiesta costs around 15 times the minimum wage.<p>But hey, voters were happy and they&#x27;ve been happily voting for the same guy for 20 years. There must be some &#x27;folk wisdom&#x27; there but I certainly missed what it is.')
