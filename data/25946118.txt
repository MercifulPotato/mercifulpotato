I don&#x27;t think it was missed by mistake, though. People rallying to make profit from their mistake is nothing wrong, just new - this is the first time the small boys (instead of other big boys - but you can just ping them on Bloomberg terminal and make a deal with them) were able to catch them and coordinate their capital (the same thing the Wall Street guys are doing together, just bigger scale). It won&#x27;t happen again as long as the big boys play according to the rules.')
