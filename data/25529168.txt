Right now the common term type is xterm (or variants thereof like xterm-256color). 20 years ago it was vt100. Will it still be xterm in 10 years from now? Considering Xorg itself is claimed obsolete by its own maintainer makes me wonder if it will be.<p>Good thing we already have a mechanism to support smooth alternatives for terminal types.')
