Item(by='02020202', descendants=0, kids=None, score=1, time=1602415438, title='Ask HN: Is YouTube Finally Done For?', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='The countless and famous youtube purges of creators and &quot;hateful&quot;, &quot;inappropriate&quot;, &quot;non pc&quot;... content &quot;unsuitable for advertisers&quot; was a clear sign that youtube got out of touch with its origins and will slowly die whilst becoming an online version of mainstream news media, whose channels are always at the top of most search results and recommendations.<p>I have observed this a long time ago but mostly since last year when I realized that I am not getting that much content from the hundreds of channels I am subscribed to, compared to the past. My subscriptions are all over the place, from movie&#x2F;cinema&#x2F;games related channels, through programming, traveling, cars, repairs,...to mgtow or alternative-news channels. So it is not just one topic that is behaving like this.<p>Very recently I have noticed that I am getting a ton of really old videos in my recommendations. Spanning from just a few years ago back to even 10 or more years. This tells me that the algorithm simply has no new content it can recommend with the way it is configured.<p>And I am not alone. I have seen tens or hundreds of comments on these videos by people that experience the same thing.<p>Which brings me to my question - do you think this is the breaking ponit for youtube that solidifies its irrelevance, for example like myspace once was? Personally I think that yes, it does. I saw it coming for years now and I think this is finally it. But it will take few more years until we will see a new platform #1 for online video. I would love for it to be bitchute but they just don&#x27;t have the money to do it(video is the most expensive thing you can run on the internet). So I expect facebook, amazon or netflix to take a shot at this in no longer than 5 years from now. Though, they have the same thinking as google&#x2F;youtube so I don&#x27;t think it would work out.<p>What do you think?')
