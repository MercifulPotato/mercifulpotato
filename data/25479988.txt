And that&#x27;s a real titan to go up against.<p>Its clearly obvious this game needed a bare minimum of 6 more months of development, if to do nothing more than fix just the bugs. But it really needs about 12-18 months of development <i>just to add the features they claimed the game would have at launch</i>.')
