Some may be, such as proud boys and dailystormer may be afoul of some (vague) hate speech clauses. Others may not be.<p>paypal and CC companies also shut down donations to wikileaks long ago (long before Trump was a thing). And even shut down donations to other foundations, such as the Wau Holland Stiftung of the Chaos Computer Club[0], that collected donations in part for wikileaks.<p>My first real memory of paypal was paypal shutting down the account we used to collect donations to cover server costs for a forum we ran back in the day[1], without any appeals process and freezing all assets, effectively stealing the money[2].<p>I also find it fascinating e.g. that cloudflare still protects botters (aka outright declared criminals) and people selling child porn[3] (aka the worst of common criminals), but dailystormer, as vile as they are, are somehow too much.<p>[0] German, <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;netzpolitik.org&#x2F;2010&#x2F;wau-holland-stiftung-geht-gegen-paypal-vor&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;netzpolitik.org&#x2F;2010&#x2F;wau-holland-stiftung-geht-gegen...</a><p>[1] the forums was a rather benign thing, just for chitchat, nobody sold anything, and it wasn&#x27;t about anything illegal either. We never got an explanation from paypal, but the account shutdown coincided with a DMCA request for a single red carpet picture some user posted in a thread about the Emmy&#x27;s. We removed that picture, by the way.<p>[2] Paypal wrote that they would refund the money, but some of our members reported they never did get a refund.<p>[3] I and some other people repeatedly reported a website selling child pornography for crypto (or for users submitting &quot;original content&quot;), mostly of the blackmailed-into-performing-lewd-acts variety targeting young teens and even pre-teens. While we had some success in getting domain registrars to nuke the domains in the past, this only lead to domain hopping, and finally the operator found a registrar that doesn&#x27;t care (currently a Ukrainian company and .su&#x2F;.pk domains). Every time the websites were behind cloudflare and every time cloudflare responded to our requests with &quot;we&#x27;re just a reverse proxy and forwarded it to the hoster&quot; and didn&#x27;t do anything. The current incarnations of those websites are still online a month later.')
