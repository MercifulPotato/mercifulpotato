It&#x27;s entirely possible the designers chose not to spend the resources to encrypt a downlink that isn&#x27;t sending anything that needs to be kept secret. In contrast, it&#x27;s reasonable to assume that the uplink is at least protected by a HMAC, because the consequences of an adversary exploiting the uplink are so great.<p>The Chinese are well aware that the US security establishment is petty enough to interfere with a scientific probe purely for its own amusement. They will have taken precautions to deter this.')
