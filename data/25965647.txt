Item(by='gojomo', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611976257, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25963423, text='Your video specifically mentions triggering a &#x27;cytotoxic T-cell&#x27; - that&#x27;s a cell that kills virus-infected cells. What&#x27;s more, it doesn&#x27;t explicitly state that all the bodily cells that receive the foreign mRNA survive.<p>I&#x27;m pretty sure they&#x27;re attacked &amp; destroyed by the immune system for their emission of foreign proteins - that is, they &quot;appear infected&quot;. And, some time after the mRNA was introduced – days? weeks? – it&#x27;s all used up, because unlike a full viral vector, it doesn&#x27;t code for more invasive genetic material, only proteins. And, the cells it hijacked are in some combination, destroyed by the immune system or revert back to normal, non-threatening operation.<p>If you have a more specific reference that denies the mRNA-altered cells are attacked-as-if-infected, I&#x27;d appreciate seeing it. But that video doesn&#x27;t make that claim, and in fat the reference to &#x27;cytotoxic T-cells&#x27; implies the opposite.<p>(Also, as the sibling response elaborates, the problems with Adenovirus-vectors are not limited to PEG reactions.)')
