If you put people in caves with no light at all, they&#x27;ll still naturally fall into a sleep&#x2F;wake cycle around 24 hours (it tends to be slightly longer).<p>Specifically it comes from your SCN <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Suprachiasmatic_nucleus" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Suprachiasmatic_nucleus</a><p>The answer is it&#x27;s evolved and some kind of complex cellular feedback mechanism, but Wikipedia is a bit light on details.  Apparently this clock is also fanned out in some way to other parts of the brain&#x2F;body which also follow a daily cycle.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedirect.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;article&#x2F;pii&#x2F;B9780444594273000290" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedirect.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;article&#x2F;pii&#x2F;B978044459...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC2735866&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC2735866&#x2F;</a><p>Light isn&#x27;t mandatory, but the SCN will synchronise to daily light patterns (eg when you travel). The SCN is also physically located close to the optic nerve. I think this is why the underlying rhythm is a slightly longer than a day, because it allows the body to reset it to 24 hours. If the period was shorter, even slightly less than 24 hours, maybe you&#x27;d have problems when the clock restarted before the day finished and the error would propagate over time (you&#x27;d keep shifting the cycle).')
