That&#x27;s plenty to make large investments, and move fast.<p>I would bet that Tesla will manage to start delivering a $25k, 250 miles range &quot;cheap&quot; sedan (model 2?) by mid 2022.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnet.com&#x2F;roadshow&#x2F;news&#x2F;tesla-battery-day-model-s-plaid-cybertruck-elon-musk&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnet.com&#x2F;roadshow&#x2F;news&#x2F;tesla-battery-day-model-s...</a>')
