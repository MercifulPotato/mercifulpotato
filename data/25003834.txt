I think the answer to that is the same reason that I&#x27;d rather keep a record of how the server is customised than a raw disk backup.<p>I do think containerisation and VMs are more overhead than they&#x27;re worth in this case, but there&#x27;s definitely a lot of value in having a step-by-step logical recipe for the server&#x27;s current state rather than just a snapshot of what&#x27;s currently on the disk. (I&#x27;d favour puppet or something similar).')
