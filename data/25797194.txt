I thought it would be of interest here.<p>The big idea here is that enough brute force will lead to better compute-use techniques which will in turn make it possible to do more with less compute. But the current reality is that these systems don’t tend to justify their existence when compared to greener, more useful technologies. It’s hard to pitch an AI system that can only be operated by trillion-dollar tech companies willing to ignore the massive carbon footprint a system this big creates.')
