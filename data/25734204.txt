I&#x27;d be eager to see people that disapprove AWS&#x27;s actions what they would say in the following situation:<p>1) Parler banning some of its own users for trolling.<p>2) Their own employer&#x2F;company banning people that use it to distribute child porn.<p>3) A utility company disconnecting users that continuously disrupt its electrical grid.<p>Of course you&#x27;d be fine with 1, 2 because neither your company nor Parler are common carriers, as defined by law, and have no obligation to provide their service to anyone. Guess what - AWS is not a common carrier either. But even a common carrier such as the electric company can terminate users that purposefully violate its terms of service.<p>At the end of the day, we all know this. We know that private services have no First Amendment obligation. And yet, thread after thread, its all the same fake outrage that&#x27;s masking a much simple emotion - &quot;I hate it when my guys lose&quot;.')
