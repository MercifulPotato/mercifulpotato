The will reject democracy.&quot;<p>This is true on both sides of the political divide.<p>The narrative from the Right is something like, &quot;The Democrats are trying to steal the election with voter fraud, rioting to intimidate conservative voters, and last-minute changes to voting laws. We need to fight this by pushing Voter ID, for keeping the voting system as-is (either in-person or absentee, but no mail-in voting[1]), and seating our supreme court justice. They can only win by cheating.&quot;<p>The narrative from the Left is something like, &quot;The Republicans are trying to win by suppressing the popular vote. We need to fight this by expanding voting to as many people as possible, abolishing the Electoral College, and preventing the Republicans from seating their supreme court pick. They can only win by cheating.&quot;<p>Both of those viewpoints have large elements of truth to them. This is not politics as usual -- this is a dirty fight to the death, between two mutually incompatible visions for the future of the United States.<p>Neither side is going to &quot;play fair&quot;.<p>&gt; &quot;Reformed conservative thinker&quot;<p>Reversing polarity, would you call a former Democrat that now supports Trump a &quot;reformed liberal&quot;? Something tells me the answer is &quot;no&quot;.<p>People learn and change their views. Or the Overton Window shifts, and they find that their views puts them in a different camp.<p>[1] Absentee and Mail-In Voting are different.
