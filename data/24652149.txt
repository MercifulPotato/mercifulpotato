If you ever dealt with some power cables, you&#x27;d know that 1 meter of the highest quality copper power cable for continuous delivery of say 15 amps (3 x 1.5 mm^2) shouldn&#x27;t cost more than $0.6. And that&#x27;s enough for 300 watts of power given 20 volts. But you probably will never see that much copper in a USB-C cable, at best you&#x27;ll see third of that and with a flimsy insulation, which costs two orders of magnitude less than $10.')
