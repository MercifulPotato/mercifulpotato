One of them is the Riviera express that goes west from London to Penzance in Cornwall. I’ve traveled on it, it was an expensive but convenient experience.<p>The second is the Caledonian Sleeper that goes from London to Inverness in the Scottish highlands. This one is ridiculously expensive. I’ve never seen tickets that cost less than £300 for a lie down seat, which is 8-10x a typical airfare 3-4x a typical seated train fare. Probably will never travel on it but I’ve always wondered why it’s so expensive. If demand is so high, the why not increase supply by adding an extra train?')
