Speaking as an engineer, in absolute terms the competence of someone (or lack thereof) is clearly signalled with a setup like this. Perhaps it may have been better phrased in these terms.<p>Similarly, the second comment regarding what I believe many would agree are obvious social implications arising from a device like this could also have been better phrased. Isn&#x27;t it also a rule on HN to treat all comments as being made in good faith where multiple interpretations exist? In any case I apologise for the phrasing, it was rather blunt and certainly somewhat off the point, but I also believe it captured important sentiments that would have been difficult to conjure with alternative phrasing.')
