And built it at scale. France has over 70% of its electricity coming from nuclear, Belgium over 50%. The US is at ~10%. We&#x27;ve encountered the emergent issues, and fixed them. Cost estimates on nuclear are historical estimates. They&#x27;re not projections.<p>We haven&#x27;t built energy storage at anywhere close to the required levels of scale. We have 4 minutes worth of energy storage. Most of that is from hydro electric storage. 1% and 3% are from battery and thermal storage, respectively [1].<p>What will be the cost of scaling this up to the hours or days required to make intermittent sources viable? We can only offer cost projections: what we <i>think</i> massive grid-scale projects will cost. But cost projections do not include the costs of unknown engineering challenges. Remember, early nuclear proponents claimed it would be an order of magnitude cheaper than fossil fuels and had the studies to prove it. But real-world experience demonstrated otherwise. What makes us think that increasing our amount of energy storage by 2 or 3 orders of magnitude won&#x27;t encounter similar unforeseen costs?<p>We <i>have</i> built nuclear at scale, and yes we have discovered engineering challenges that increase cost. But we <i>haven&#x27;t</i> built energy storage at scale, and we <i>haven&#x27;t</i> encountered it&#x27;s unforeseen engineering challenges.<p>This post offers an excellent analogy on this topic [2]. With nuclear, we&#x27;ve walked this path, and know firsthand the difficulties it takes. With new technologies we&#x27;re looking at the map. Those are two fundamentally different measurements of cost.<p>1. <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;css.umich.edu&#x2F;factsheets&#x2F;us-grid-energy-storage-factsheet#:~:text=In%202020%2C%20the%20U.S.%20had,of%20total%20installed%20generation%20capacity.&amp;text=Globally%2C%20installed%20energy%20storage%20capacity%20totaled%20173.6%20GW.&amp;text=California%20leads%20the%20U.S.%20in,%2C%20New%20York%2C%20and%20Texas" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;css.umich.edu&#x2F;factsheets&#x2F;us-grid-energy-storage-facts...</a>.<p>2. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.quora.com&#x2F;Why-are-software-development-task-estimations-regularly-off-by-a-factor-of-2-3&#x2F;answer&#x2F;Michael-Wolfe" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.quora.com&#x2F;Why-are-software-development-task-esti...</a>')
