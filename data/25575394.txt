Thus Apple Maps.<p>Intel let Apple down by failing to predict where the market was moving since about 2012 or so, with the Core processors not gaining much in terms of performance and somehow managing to guzzle more energy. Thus Apple Silicon.<p>Plenty of other examples where Apple realised they can&#x27;t offer the whole package until they own all the components. The formula is &quot;&lt;Company&gt; didn&#x27;t do &lt;Thing&gt; and it impacted Apple&#x27;s offerings. Thus &lt;Apple Thing&gt;&quot;.')
