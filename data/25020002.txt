If I run an ad campaign and see an uptick of 20% visitors, that&#x27;s useful.  The 36% is consistent on both side, so deltas are still very meaningful.<p>If I do need absolute metric -- e.g. distinct people -- I have to decide how to handle adblocking.  I can model it, or I can accept the undercount.  Honestly, this is largely going to be based on what the advertisers are welling to accept.<p>&gt; The black boxes inside Facebook and other ad exchanges give you flat out wrong data about how your ads are performing<p>When you can tie it back to sales, you have pretty hard data.  Also, there&#x27;s third parties out there if you don&#x27;t trust companies grading their own homework.<p>&gt; The audiences you&#x27;re targeting on Google, Bing, etc are fraudulent and don&#x27;t even exist<p>Again, fraudulent is a bit of a stretch.  Audiences do have waste.  That&#x27;s true in TV, magazines, and digital.  It&#x27;s not a question of perfect or fraudulent.')
