Notably, integration of WhatsApp&#x27;s and Facebook&#x27;s networks would require matching WhatsApp users&#x27; profiles with their profiles on Facebook (or vice versa). This would be complicated without the users&#x27; involvement since Facebook and WhatsApp use different unique user identifiers: Facebook ID and mobile phone number, respectively. Consequently, Facebook would be unable to automatically and reliably associate a Facebook ID with a valid phone number used by a user on WhatsApp. Matching of WhatsApp profiles with Facebook profiles would most likely have to be done manually by users, which in the Notifying Party&#x27;s view is likely to result in a significant backlash from both users of Facebook and WhatsApp who do not want to match their accounts. Finally, the Notifying Party stated that, beyond the difficulties in matching user IDs, significant engineering hurdles would have to be overcome to enable cross-platform communications, reflecting the fundamentally different architecture of Facebook and WhatsApp (including the former being cloud-based, the latter not).&quot;<p>It seems the EU commission interpreted the statement as &#x27;not possible&#x27;.
