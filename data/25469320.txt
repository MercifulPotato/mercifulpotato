Item(by='Mc91', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608311794, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25467188, text='&gt; This seems to be a more common modern phenomenon where people need to pump out something to look good&#x2F;productive and then coast away before the challenging effort of making things work together occurs. I would say this issue is exacerbated by the mass adoption of &quot;agile&quot; where integration is always an afterthought since business leaders are often the dictators.<p>For me it is the latter over the former.  I would love to do a 3 point business feature every sprint and spend the rest of the time cleaning up code.  Between the POs pushing work onto my plate, as well as everything else I have to do (releases, code reviews, fixing regressions etc.), cleaning up old code is a luxury at the moment.')
