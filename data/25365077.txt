Purely democratic states can fall well within rule of law. The issue here is that there is some law that democracies cannot pass because it violates a higher law.<p>Piketty writes about this issue in regard to slavery. To free slaves (in the USA) without compensation was regarded as not following within the higher law which is ~ the law of property.<p>The same issue would be faced with trying to free the &quot;ill gotten gains&quot; of &quot;bankers&quot; from their holdings.\nThe childish subtext of our propertarian legal system is &quot;new rules dont count&quot;.')
