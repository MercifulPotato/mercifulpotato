I have never had a computer (desktop or laptop) last long to have a fan fail. Is fan failure really that common? In just two years?<p>I get why people hate fans. I have a hand me down switch behind my desktop computer and the fans on that thing is louder than the fans on all three of the computer towers that it powers. However, the switch is not made for desktop use and in a 1U chassis, something has to give if we want airflow. However given that space is not an issue, you can get the classic noctua fan and cooler like the NH-D15 and a full ATX case if you&#x27;re building new and that the fans will probably last over ten years with no servicing.<p>I get that this is probably tremendously overkill but just thinking out loud...')
