And even a couple &quot;net negative&quot; employees.<p>To the best of my knowledge all of them played the game diligently and got their green cards, and many of them got their citizenship.  Good for them, and in many cases good for us.<p>But I absolutely did not see any greater level of talent among the H1B&#x27;s than any other cohort in SF&#x2F;SV.<p>While I&#x27;m very happy to work with people from all over the world, I do think that H1B has been used to get a lot of people in who aren&#x27;t any better than your local City College grads.  In addition to that being radically against the national interest, it&#x27;s also really unfair to the &quot;brilliant visa holders&quot; you have had the good fortune to work with.')
