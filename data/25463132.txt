Our changes would both pass tests independently, but would break when we merge them.  No file-level diff algorithm would detect a “conflict” here.<p>Diff algorithms only help with saying “are two branches trying to edit the same lines of code”, but the answer to that question is never enough to tell you whether two changes logically will apply cleanly to one another.')
