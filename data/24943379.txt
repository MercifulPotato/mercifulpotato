They have found a correlation between some neurons firing in sequence and a list of words being spoken from memory. We don&#x27;t have any concrete understanding of how memories are really encoded, stored, and recalled. Indeed, we don&#x27;t even know if &quot;encoded&quot;, &quot;stored&quot;, and &quot;recalled&quot; are useful approximations for what&#x27;s really going on in there. So suggesting that we have found some specific time keeping module seems awfully hand-wavy (at best) to me.')
