I don&#x27;t think it is. They are pushing a point of view, just as every other media source is.<p><i>&gt; indispensable for all news outlets</i><p>I know the news outlets claim this, but I find the claim to be either very stupid (highly unlikely) or very disingenuous (much more likely). If I want to know what the NYT published today, I can go to their website. If I want to know what CNN is saying today, I can just watch them (or go to their website). Everyone knows these news sources exist and where to find them; it&#x27;s not like they&#x27;re new startups trying to acquire users. So the idea that the news outlets need to be visible in Google searches or Facebook feeds for people to know what they are saying is ludicrous.')
