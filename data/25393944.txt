They are so much smarter than me and obviously better than me at figuring out what is true and what isn&#x27;t!  And isn&#x27;t it great that they always act selflessly in favor of the truth and never in the narrow interest of Google?  I don&#x27;t know what I would do if I didn&#x27;t have them there to protect me from the dangerous misinformation.  I am so helpless on my own.')
