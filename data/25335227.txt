Also, I&#x27;m just laying down a template, I dont claim to have any insider info. We can even argue if their sidearms were Jerichos or P320s. I&#x27;m not too concerned on weapon specifics. It does look pretty clean shooting wise from that pic. Now that I think about it, I&#x27;d actually argue it would have been semi rifle fire instead of full auto. They&#x27;re claiming full auto, but I just dont see it from the front. Dont know if there are other images that prove me wrong... but theres also a funny joke here that they might have used mp5s instead of mp7s since Israel is being blamed...')
