I&#x27;m a happy Apple customer and have been for most of 30 years.<p>The same code that keeps malware from running on a mac (or iphone) keeps non-app-store apps from running on an iphone, or prompts you to move non-notarized apps to the trash on a mac.<p>It&#x27;s not some separate thing: the exact same code path that protects the consumer store revenue and developer notarization service revenue also protects users against malware.<p>EDIT, for clarity: I am speaking of Apple-developed, Apple-owned platform security code, where root keys are not held by anyone other than Apple, not generic crypto primitives or the concept of code signing in general (where we have a P-as-in-public PKI).')
