Many people are going to lose money. Bitcoin has value. It is only Btc people that took a very nice technology and crippled it. The put a cap in it&#x27;s block size, and they removed instructions of the Bitcoin Script language.<p>Bitcoin&#x27;s usage lies in it&#x27;s use as an immutable ledger, that no one can change the past. We can put other information inside it,alongside with the money transactions, and we can be absolutely sure that no one messed with that information. An infinite number of use cases.<p>For example say a cop makes an arrest. How can we be sure that the arrest was legitimate? A random person with a video camera may record the arrest, go to his home, edit it however he likes, upload it to the internet, and boom huge civil unrest! The solution lies with the cop recording the arrest by himself, uploading the information right away to the blockchain, and no person on the planet, no state, no goverment, can mess up with that information. The timestamp of the arrest is important too!')
