There is no inherent sexism in any language, ancient historical origin of the words isn&#x27;t carried over to modern meaning, semantics of the words and doesn&#x27;t create any bias against women or men. Meaning is created by mass media, people, world around you through propagandistic rhetorics. If you hang out with someone expressing &quot;sexist&quot; attitude or exposed to them through media, it really doesn&#x27;t matter what words they use to call things they want to be for men or for women, you will still develop &quot;sexist&quot; associations, for example, you still won&#x27;t consider babysitting a manly task, no matter how politically correct gender-neutral it is called.')
