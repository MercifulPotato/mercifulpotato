I trigger that effect involuntarily and this disturbing thing can&#x27;t be disabled. Where this idea come from ? Google is more and more cluttered everywhere. I miss the Google search page from 2005. I don&#x27;t have statistics but I always remember Google pages and UI being fast, simple and straightforward.
