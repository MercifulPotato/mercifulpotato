I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a coincidence. I think there&#x27;s a certain kind of ethos behind behind any &quot;Code of Conduct&quot; process, and that ethos is not present on HN. And I&#x27;m really happy about that. I think HN moderation is amazing and it allows for conversations that you couldn&#x27;t have anywhere else on the web.')
