I don&#x27;t think it could be made in this case for the reasons you highlight, but in general as long as the offending tests are a small part of the whole they should be considered separately to the actual code. Like if all my test cases are cracking some DRM then a takedown is probably fair enough, but if I&#x27;m using 3 out of 70 plus tests to make sure I handle some YouTube specific algorithm in my tool to download YouTube content then the actual videos I use don&#x27;t seem relevant. But I get why legally its going to be a huge issue. I just wonder if there might be some case in future where test vs library code is a factor.<p>Edit: for example in the situation where one of their other tests just downloading a normal video used a copyrighted example instead of a CC example that shouldn&#x27;t be any different, the content is irrelevant due to it being a test case, it could be any licence, it&#x27;s just a test, the intent of a test should count.')
