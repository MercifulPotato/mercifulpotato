To scare and make squeal the fat hedge funds shorts. Kind of fun. It wouldn&#x27;t last for long, though the shorts will probably be looking over their shoulders for years to come. The movement&#x27;s rank-and-file  will probably get hurt while the leaders will probably do fine.  &quot;Investing&quot; is just not an applicable term here - i mean you aren&#x27;t investing buying a ticket for rollercoaster ride, you&#x27;re buying fun and amusement. Or a chance to make your voice and discontent heard. At least that is what seems to be sold to the rank-and-file.<p>Old school view here would probably see classic &quot;pump-and-dump&quot; by the few &quot;leaders&quot; who incited that frenzy. SEC though seems to lag far behind in understanding and dealing with the power of social media.<p>(Anyway, thanks for the surprisingly nice AMC ride, i happened to have a bit in a gamble that they would survive the lockdown. )')
