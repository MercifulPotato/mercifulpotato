Item(by='dangus', descendants=None, kids=[25187161], score=None, time=1606142137, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25185656, text='This article has decent points but is definitely just sort of coming from the perspective of being completely unfamiliar with the Mac platform.<p>Worrying about the App Store taking over on the Mac is misguided. The Mac has never forced the App Store on anyone and the Mac App Store doesn’t even seem to be particularly popular.<p>“Emulation” (it’s not emulation) is apparently this big problem, except that early M1 Macs show <i>faster</i> Rosetta performance with still-better battery life in many cases.<p>And yes, Rosetta won’t be around forever, but we have been here before. It wasn’t a problem going from PowerPC to Intel either. If the authors at Android authority ever used a Mac they’d already know this. Anecdotal, but I can’t think of a single pre-Intel program that was lost to the Intel transition that I was using at the time. All the developers checked the box and recompiled, and the dinosaurs like Adobe eventually trudged along.<p>For those of us who actually used Macs back in the PowerPC days and earlier, there <i>was no such thing as Hackintosh or Boot Camp</i>. The fact that those are going away is essentially inconsequential, especially now that the Mac platform is vastly more popular than it was in 2006.<p>Why would I want to run Windows on my Mac? It’s been a shitty experience anyway, because even in Intel-land the hardware has been heavily macOS optimized including things like fan and power control. The trackpad driver on Windows was always worse, for example. And again why would you want to run Windows when you spent all this money to not run Windows? It doesn’t make sense especially since so many programs (e.g. 1Password) have their best versions on Mac.')
