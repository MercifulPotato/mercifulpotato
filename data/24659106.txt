CodeWithHarry, in fact, is actually subliminally asking the users to create very low quality PRs. Or at least very heavily implying it.<p>In one part of the video he mentions that last year DO was not able to distribute all the t-shirts as they didn&#x27;t have enough PRs. He goes on to mention that &quot;this year, we don&#x27;t want any T-shirts to remain&quot;.<p>If I get time, I&#x27;ll point out more lines from the video where he is promoting PR for the sake of PR.<p>I do agree that it may not be totally his fault in the whole larger context of things.')
