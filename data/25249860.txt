Put a glass on your head, Joan.&quot;<p>So there is reason to think that there was no &quot;routine&quot;. Burroughs came up with the idea there and then. It&#x27;s also worth noting that Burroughs changed his story a number of times over the years.<p>People might be interested in reading James Grauerholz&#x27; &quot;The Death of Joan Vollmer Burroughs: What Really Happened?&quot; (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.yumpu.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;document&#x2F;read&#x2F;6810449&#x2F;the-death-of-joan-vollmer-burroughs-what-really-lawrencecom" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.yumpu.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;document&#x2F;read&#x2F;6810449&#x2F;the-death-of-...</a>). Grauerholz was was friends with Burroughs and his text ends up trying to exonerate Burroughs - however, it is fairly evenhanded and also mentions a good deal of information that paints Burroughs in a negative light.<p>Personally, I lean towards the theory that Burroughs did shoot Vollmer accidentally. However, I think that evidence pertaining to the incident is much more ambiguous than how it is usually presented in articles that deal mainly with Burroughs himself as their theme.')
