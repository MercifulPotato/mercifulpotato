It involved a bombardment of microwave rays that was detected. How would a similar attack evade detection now?<p>Sounds like something they could have worked on in the past half-century. Detection of a narrowly focused burst of radiation would be fairly challenging if you&#x27;re outside of whatever volumetric detection zone is generated by the attack device.<p>How would you differentiate it from other RF interference?<p>&gt;  if you think a microwave weapon caused this event you should be able to explain how it would function.<p>I don&#x27;t see what exists to be gained by explaining the function of a weapon that jeopardizes and frightens your diplomats. If the claims are true, then there is nobody to convince here; the US is going to act internally on its own information, and the alleged foreign actors involved are going to spread their own disinformation accordingly.')
