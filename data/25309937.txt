Or that we would not have reusable rockets and electric cars?<p>That seems unlikely, considering the USSR produced the space launches, and electric cars existed before Tesla. Without billionaires, you&#x27;d also lose the Koch&#x27;s making it hard to move away from fossil fuels, which I think would make electric cars significantly easier, rather than harder<p>If you just mean that we won&#x27;t have those brand names, should I care? It&#x27;s just a name')
