I feel like they really shafted me on that one.<p>As someone also charged but not convicted, I learned hypothetically you also don&#x27;t get to account for expenses if you lose. Meaning you could run a $10 billion gross revenue drug empire, it costs $9.9 billion to run so you walk away with $100m and you still have to pay $10 billion in forfeiture.')
