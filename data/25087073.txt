At first I was thinking &quot;yes, this is what Trump is doing, albeit incompetently. I feel like this guy, that I&#x27;m an alarmist but I can&#x27;t prove anything.&quot; And then when it started talking about opposing opinions being shouted down, I realized that the &quot;Progressives&quot; might actually be doing the same thing, just more competently. It&#x27;s not okay to disagree about the merits of homosexuality. It&#x27;s not okay to disagree about racism. It&#x27;s not okay to disagree that whites, especially males, are privileged and therefore aggressors. &quot;Cancel culture&quot; and all that. This is something that&#x27;s crept up in the past 10 or 15 years.<p>What worries me is that both sides are doing similar things.')
