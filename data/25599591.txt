Item(by='LukeShu', descendants=None, kids=[25599727], score=None, time=1609463531, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25599085, text='To borrow a sentence from Wikipedia (as it&#x27;s just <i>slightly</i> more direct than the Conservancy homepage): &quot;Software Freedom Conservancy is an organization that provides a non-profit home and infrastructure support, including legal services, for free&#x2F;open source software projects.&quot;  So, to grossly over-simplify: The purpose of Conservancy is to provide for other Free-software projects what the FSF provides for GNU.  Most famously, Conservancy has enforced the GPL for BusyBox (a member project of Conservancy), and the Linux kernel (not a member project, but is special in that many contributors have assigned their copyright to Conservancy, and other contributors have authorized Conservancy to represent their copyright).<p>(It&#x27;s more accurate to say that SF Conservancy is an offshoot of the Software Freedom Law Center than it is of the FSF.)<p>As for disagreement with the FSF and &quot;principles of software freedom&quot;: Conservancy&#x27;s principles are Stallman&#x27;s four freedoms.  They aren&#x27;t &quot;pushing&quot; &quot;ethical licensing&quot;; they hosted a conference that had several talks about it; just as LibrePlanet, the FSF-hosted conference, has also had talks exploring formulations of software ethics that differ from the four freedoms.  Indeed, the linked page calls out that so-called &quot;ethical licensing&quot; is non-Free, and advocates for &quot;ethical employment contracts&quot; instead.  Any substantive disagreement between Conservancy and the FSF must be fairly recent: Until late-2019 the president of the SF Conservancy was also a member of the FSF&#x27;s board of directors.')
