Item(by='geofft', descendants=None, kids=[24946207], score=None, time=1604086975, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24946052, text='Er, how is saying that someone is &quot;_dramatically_ privileged&quot; an attack? It&#x27;s a judgment-neutral observation. When I say that sshd runs a privileged process, I don&#x27;t mean to say that sshd is morally bad (or whatever), just that it needs to be more careful than less-privileged code and that it can do things more easily than less-privileged code can. It&#x27;s the same meaning of &quot;privileged&quot; here.<p>(And yes, you could bring up to the moderators that this is an attack, but you could do that in the absence of any written rules, too, and if the moderators are the sort of people who would agree with that argument, then neither having nor not having written rules would save this forum.)')
