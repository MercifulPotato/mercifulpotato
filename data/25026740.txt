It&#x27;s certainly possible but it&#x27;s time consuming and expensive. With a shoestring engineering budget and a product that needs to be on the shelves in a month? Not really.<p>I&#x27;m sure many devices on the market are not compliant. I follow lists of products removed from market for non-compliance and there are plenty each week. But the fact is that, if you&#x27;re not in one of the categories that are under special scrutiny (aerospace, automobile, medical, etc.) or do something grossly incompetent (e.g. interfere with a mobile operator or someone else with a similar power to put you into the regulatory spotlight) you&#x27;re unlikely to get into trouble for shipping a non-compliant device.<p>Make someone&#x27;s Wi-Fi a bit slower and a bit more packet-lossy? Chances are nobody will care. It&#x27;s a sad state of affairs really because pervasive radio interference is just making things worse for everyone.')
