But the bridges leave a lot to be desired. Mind you, most of them are only in alpha or beta status.<p>But it requires a lot of fiddling around to keep them running. Some bridges just stop working without telling you and this makes it hard too rely on them. Always second guessing whether it&#x27;s just quiet or the bridge went down again. The signal one in particular is bad for this.<p>I try it every year and it gets better but progress is slow.<p>Also, be aware that your fully bridged matrix server is a prime hacker target, it captures all you private Comms and can impersonate you. Much harder to do with all individual apps. This is another thing I worry about.<p>So for these reasons I just test it every year but never found it production ready.')
