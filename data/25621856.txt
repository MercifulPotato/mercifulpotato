As long as people still treat Mac products as something that they want to be apart of they give a free pass to the behavior.</i><p>That sounds like &quot;if you don&#x27;t like how this country is run, immigrate elsewhere&quot; - used usually by right wingers.<p>How about people liking other aspects of the country (or, in this case, liking the OS, the hardware, the ecosystem, and so on) and considering them worth staying over the alternatives? Should they move to what they consider a sub-par platform to &quot;make a point&quot; about some App Store policies or some other such thing?<p>And if most people are fine even with those things (e.g. could not give less fucks how the country is run as long as they&#x27;re doing ok or don&#x27;t care about some App Store faults) how is small scale immigration&#x2F;skipping platform wont get lost in the noise?<p>Boycotting companies is only a real tool when there are very heavy issues at stake, and millions of people agree on it, and also they thing there are perfectly fine alternatives for their use cases. Easy to boycott Nike when there&#x27;s 100 sneaker brands that will do.<p>How about improving the country&#x2F;platform in other ways? Including publishing opinions, pressure groups, shaming when necessary, and so on.')
