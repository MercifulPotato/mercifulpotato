Printing (still have some remaining needs for it).<p>The other thing, is that it has ceased to matter. I was a Linux fan for a number of years. I learned a lot from it, and I still maintain a number of Raspberry Pi builds in my house.<p>But today, virtually everything that I care about is platform independent, most notably the &quot;scientific&quot; Python toolchain. My programs run without modification on any platform.
