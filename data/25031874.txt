State run voter rolls often didn&#x27;t require DOB in past or continue to leave it optional in certain circumstances, causing the DOB to be represented as 0 AD, or 1970 AD, or some other spurious result. Even the Steve Bannon funded GAI study on voter fraud[1], which has been discredited, made this claim and refuted this data from the study. This is disinformation.<p>[1] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.g-a-i.org&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2017&#x2F;07&#x2F;Voter-Fraud-Final-with-Appendix-1.pdf" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.g-a-i.org&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2017&#x2F;07&#x2F;Voter-Fraud-...</a>')
