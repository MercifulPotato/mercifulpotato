I&#x27;m a skeptic because of the technology being a bad idea pushed originally by oil companies. Hydrogen is only green if you produce it yourself by green electricity by electrolysis which is quite inefficient and then convert that energy back into electricity with another quite inefficient process.<p>Now as to the reason why Japan has been investing, it&#x27;s because the actual way Hydrogen is produced is from fossil fuels. It&#x27;s done by taking methane and other hydrocarbons and pulling the hydrogen off and expelling the CO2 (ideally capturing it). This process is called steam reforming. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Steam_reforming" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Steam_reforming</a> This is the sweet lie people aren&#x27;t told when hydrogen is brought up. Japan happens to have extensive offshore methane clathrate deposits on the sea floor and if they can make a hydrogen economy happen then those clathrates may become economical to mine.')
