Sure, they&#x27;re rudimentarily both about mathematics. But the former is about building software that can do interesting computations with algebraic expressions. The latter is about building graphical representations expressly for humans.<p>That&#x27;s the difference between sheet music and MIDI. MIDI is extremely powerful, but it&#x27;s not really about setting not just instructions but guidelines for human performers who will ultimately use their judgment on how to interpret it and perform it -- often in large groups. Compared to that, MIDI is not just way more low level, but simply for a difference purpose.')
