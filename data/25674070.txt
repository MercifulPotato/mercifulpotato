Even in core console gaming, they&#x27;re notorious for not actually owning many studios, including some you would assume they do given how long they&#x27;re worked together.<p>Notoriously, Nintendo didn&#x27;t own Rare (who was a big studio for Nintendo bound games), didn&#x27;t want to buy when they wanted to sold, and they ended up at Microsoft which is an acquisition that&#x27;s very hard to spin as a success.')
