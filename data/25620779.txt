A book is judged by its cover. Your covers look really cheap, and so everyone will judge the quality of your book in that fraction of time.<p>It&#x27;s like a funnel, and a lot of people will already drop off by looking at your covers. Bad graphics, bad fonts, bad colors.<p>Hire a really good designer and let them make the cover. It doesn&#x27;t have to be expensive. I&#x27;m 99% sure it will make a ton of difference for your sales.<p>Maybe try it with your best book first and see what it does to your conversion rate.')
