If Discord used it to enable full text search, does they need to release their management layers too? Why or why not? How excited to defend your rationalization&#x2F;decision to the court are you, if some disagreement arises?<p>The ask, that companies open source their management layer, concerns me because it&#x27;s unclear in many circumstances what does &amp; doesn&#x27;t need to go into that box. A management layer is often a rather sprawling piece of software. Trying to disentangle &amp; release the Elastic Search or Kibana management layer from the other management &#x2F;deployment&#x2F;control systems could be quite onerous.<p>I do think the intent is not &quot;bad&quot;, but it&#x27;s so hard &amp; murky, there&#x27;s so much peering into the crystal ball to guess whether, some day in the future, a once &quot;open source&quot; company that may, a decade down the road become aggressive&#x2F;ligitious (not presently the case!) continues to find your particular use does or not does qualify as offering the product as a service, and does or does not expose you to a long complex obligation.')
