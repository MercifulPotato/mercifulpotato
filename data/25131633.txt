However, Adobe does not officially support the 64-bit edition and you may run into problems.&quot;<p>So they are still supporting it on Windows XP on their official channels.<p>Most of the problems with old applications in Windows come from installers using ancient techniques to detect the OS version<p>Most of recent Adobe software theoretically could also run on older windows versions (8 or 7 for example), but are not supporting old platforms anymore with the new subscription versions and recebtly dropped support for the LTSC versions of Windows 10, so probably keeping the old versions around is a smart move if they work well enough for you<p>People who bought licenses for old versions should be in their right to use them as long as they can<p>Which simply is for longer on Windows than on MacOS')
