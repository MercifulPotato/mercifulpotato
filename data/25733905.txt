They are controlling the narrative. They are promoting some topics and pushing down other. Facebook deleted WalkAway, a group that had full moderation, did not allow any posts which called for violence, and which was pure political speech. Reddit is deleting each and every sub that goes against what their management believes; over 2000 have been banned last year only.<p>They are not paying lip service. They are directing narrative. They are banning things they don&#x27;t like. They are deciding which scientific exports are orthodox and which are banned. They are controlling language. They are controlling thought. If you don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s happening, then they are controlling your thoughts as well.<p>This is the most dangerous time for us to be in and this will not end well. Censorship is the tool of cowards. Censorship is the tool of authoritarians. We are literally watching Big Tech and Big Media openly rewrite history. We are in 1984 + Fahrenheit 451 and half of us have bought so far into this narrative of protectionism we do not see it at all.')
