Keeps the gravy train going; if they solved our problems with hard facts in blogs, we wouldn&#x27;t need them.<p>That said, the advice itself is still pretty good if you have the chops to follow through, but I honestly don&#x27;t think you can build the chops by hiring in the consultancy to tell you.  In fact, it&#x27;s actually a bad sign that you leadership both need obvious advice, and think they can enact change by hiring the consultancy.<p>The reality is, you&#x27;d probably have better results changing the leadership.')
