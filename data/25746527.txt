They seem such natural source material.<p>Are there IP ownership complications?<p>Are the games themselves too derivative of movies (e.g. Monkey Island being inspired by the Pirates of the Caribbean ride, and thus reverse-retrospectively derivative of the Pirates of the Caribbean movies)?<p>Would it be too hard to adapt them as comedies, or would they be too boring as non-comedies?<p>Is the built-in audience actually not as large as I imagine it would be?<p>Are there some gaming-ignorant egos involved? i.e. what lead to the 4th Indiana Jones using the lame Crystal Skull story instead of the great Fate of Atlantis story?<p>Is the world simply not ready for Day of the Tentacle on Disney+?')
