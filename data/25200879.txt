Stallone, in which Timothy Anderson sued Stallone&#x2F;MGM for allegedly ripping off his fan script for Rocky 4. Courts ruled that his fan script, as a derivative work of Rocky, had no copyright protection, and so MGM was free to rip it off if they wanted to.<p>I happen to disagree, in that I think the law <i>should</i> say that derivative works are co-owned by the owners of the original work and the creator of the derivative; but that does not seem to be what the law currently says.')
