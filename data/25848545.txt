They are clearly not an upstanding citizen - otherwise they wouldn&#x27;t require a presidential pardon. Being father to children is not an achievement and any two consenting healthy adult man and woman can produce them irrespective of their standing in society. And beauty of children is a criteria for pardon now? What if the children were ugly - &quot;clearly he doesn&#x27;t deserve a pardon, look at his children!&quot; ?! What utter bullshit.')
