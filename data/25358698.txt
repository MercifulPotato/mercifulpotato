If you degrade the quality of the signal enough (using a composite video signal, for example) the output will become blurry enough that the dithering blends together, and you can achieve certain special effects, such as the waterfall transparency.<p>However, there is a big trade-off in the form of the entire game being blurry. That&#x27;s why many enthusiasts back in the day (and today) preferred RGB output, even though the higher quality would ruin the blending of the dithered pattern. The Genesis&#x2F;Mega Drive therefore supported RGB (Sega released an official adapter in Japan, and there was a SCART output in Europe).<p>And, of course, if you were playing a game on a PC with a CRT monitor, dithering remained visible since PC monitors coupled with VGA signals were of much higher quality than composite signals on consumer TVs.<p>It&#x27;s definitely not the case that pixels could not be seen on a CRT - it just depends on the signal and the CRT type.')
