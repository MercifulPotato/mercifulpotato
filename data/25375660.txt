You end up having to maintain multiple multi-methods in multiple locations that all need to cover all the same cases. If anything else, multi-methods are marginally worse than conds, because the actual implementation can be spread out and harder to visually check.<p>If you can get away with <i>one</i> multi-method, that&#x27;s fine. The moment you start needing multiple multi-methods in different points in your pipeline then things begin to suck.<p>&gt; sounds like home-grown pattern matching<p>Yup! And if you find yourself constantly writing pattern matches in Clojure, then you probably actually want classes, since that&#x27;s a much better way to bind both data and behavior together.')
