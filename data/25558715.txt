True commitment and expertise invariably results in truths indistinguishable from opinion to the outsider, they can offer considerable insight to those who will listen.<p>&gt; When weighing people&#x27;s opinions, expertise should be rewarded but commitment should be penalized.<p>&quot;Penalized&quot; is too dismissive, and borderline bulverism.
