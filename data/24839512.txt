In Ye Olden days before the Internet and social media meant literally the world&#x27;s best examples of every single thing were right at your fingertips, the &quot;best&quot; often meant &quot;the best in your town&quot; and the level of difference between your novice skill and that was not so great as to be disheartening.<p>But now, the first day you ever decide to fry an egg, you can watch Gordon Ramsey and Jacques PÃ©pin do it and watch your soul die with the realization that you&#x27;ll never reach that level. Or you pick up a guitar, then go to YouTube and see some kid who&#x27;s been practicing twelve hours a day since infancy and lose all hope.<p>A somewhat perverse trick to combat that is what I think of as <i>low ceilings.</i> If the thing you get into has some limit to how <i>good</i> you can be at it, then the difference between you and the world&#x27;s best isn&#x27;t so great that it kills your motivation. I&#x27;m an ex-game developer, and I&#x27;ve seen how many people really love PICO-8 and other deliberately constrained game making environments. I think a big part of that is because when you&#x27;re making a PICO-8 game, you aren&#x27;t comparing yourself to the world&#x27;s best games, but just to the best PICO-8 games. Those can be surprisingly impressive too, but they don&#x27;t feel so <i>unattainably</i> distant from your own first steps.<p>If you don&#x27;t want to choose a medium that is instrinsically limited, another approach is to find a <i>scene</i>. Find a group of like-minded individuals at roughly the same skill level as you. Enough better than you to inspire you, but not so far that you don&#x27;t feel you could ever reach their level. Immerse yourself in that group, an you&#x27;ll naturally compare yourself to them and not the world at large.<p>Back when I used to be in a band, we played shows in small venues with other local bands. I knew we were never going to be the next Oasis or Tom Petty, but &quot;Orlando&#x27;s third-best rock band&quot; was close enough within reach to be worth striving for, and it really helped keep me going.')
