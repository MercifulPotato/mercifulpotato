Two VERY VERY IMPORTANT THINGS:<p>1) A good first step is to see your GP, if you have one, and if you don&#x27;t look up some reviews and find a decent one. If you&#x27;re at the point where you lack the motivation to even do that, ask a friend or loved one to do it for you. If you don&#x27;t have a resource like that around you, just click this link &amp; put in your own zip code: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.healthgrades.com&#x2F;usearch?what=General%20Medical%20Practice&amp;where=Beverly%20Hills%2C%20CA%2090210&amp;pt=34.103131%2C-118.416253&amp;pageNum=1&amp;sort.provider=bestmatch&amp;state=CA&amp;zip=90210" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.healthgrades.com&#x2F;usearch?what=General%20Medical%...</a><p>You see a GP first because they should run something like a complete metabolic panel along with tests for things like vitamin D levels. It&#x27;s entirely possible to get mis-diagnosed with (psychological) depression when there is a more concrete metabolic cause.<p>Other readers, please please don&#x27;t downvote this next part for language, use of caps, etc., this is <i>seriously</i> important<p>2) About it never going away. Oh hell that&#x27;s the feeling all right. But here&#x27;s the thing about a depressed brain telling you things: IT IS A FUCKING LIAR. Your mind tells you that, so you feel worse, and it feels even harder to over come, and the spiral continues. You CAN feel better. It might honestly be the hardest thing you ever do, but you have to claw back up inch by inch. Shit, inches can be hard at times. Go for millimeters when you need to. When you get pushed back down at times, IT&#x27;S TEMPORARY. Just keep taking that tiny step in front of you. One. Tiny. Step. Motivation is hard. Doing things you liked before is hard. Focus on doing small things. Focus on finding 5 minutes, or one minute, of distraction from your headspace at a time. A good simple technique is to overload your physical senses: 1) Light a candle&#x2F;spray some scent 2) Put on some background noise-- music, anything 3) Fill a glass (real glass to conduct the cold) to the top with ice, and ANYTHING carbonated. If you don&#x27;t do soda, go for seltzer or something. Wrap your hands around the cold glass. Keep it near your lips &amp; take sips. You&#x27;ve got all 5 senses covered: Smell, sound, touching the cold, hearing the fizz of the bubbles, the taste as you sip &amp; sensation of the carbonation. You&#x27;re brain does have a bandwidth limit, and hitting all 5 senses saturates a lot of it. An ice-cold shower is also good. These things aren&#x27;t silver bullets, aren&#x27;t a cure: You&#x27;re looking to get incremental periods of time where you don&#x27;t feel like crap. Over time, they can build, and get easier. Look for other small 5 minute distractions that take you out of your head, whatever works. Getting out of this is a game of inches.<p>Finally: NONE of #2 replaces treatment. It&#x27;s a single coping mechanism that can work to take the slightest edge off things. Therapy, medication if needed, those should be on your list for consideration.

Talk or not, or just take it in. Sometimes knowing it&#x27;s not just you can help, but you&#x27;ll also hear how other people cope with this. A good inventory of coping mechanisms to take the edge off is very important.<p>IT WON&#x27;T LAST FOREVER. YOU CAN FEEL BETTER.')
