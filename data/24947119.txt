The gas is shocked, and then we adiabatically expand it back to its original density.<p>Because entropy was added, the gas is now hotter than initially.  But it is not compressed.   The heating wasn&#x27;t due to compression, it was due to dissipation at the shock.  That dissipative process is separate from compression, and you are confusing the two.<p>The incoherence of your position should have been clear to you.   You seem to think that compression, as a cause of heating, doesn&#x27;t even have a well defined amount of heating.   Your explanation isn&#x27;t even wrong, it&#x27;s undefined.')
