When they were over 90% I pulled the trigger.<p>Now I realize I purchased a game that was reviewed on what it will eventually become a la No Man&#x27;s Sky, not what it was on the day of review.<p>Sure, the crashing didn&#x27;t affect me, my configuration was more or less normal I guess. Instead what I got was a hollow game that has a lot of hooks ready for eventual expansion sometime in future patches. That didn&#x27;t deserve the 91% it had when I first bought the game.<p>I don&#x27;t blame fellow gamers. I blame the reviewers.')
