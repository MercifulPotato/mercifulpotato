I can go to twitter if I want to see what&#x27;s on the mind of the world&#x27;s top influencers. I can go to facebook if I want to see people mass-sharing news articles with 10,000 toxic comments about the latest political events. Where&#x27;s the social network built around connecting you to your network and <i>only your network</i>?<p>This would likely alleviate the moderation issue too. You aren&#x27;t going to see filth and extremism unless it&#x27;s posted by your social network, which decreases the incentive for bad actors to post it in the first place.')
