If someone else listens to 1 song of artist A once a month and you play artist B more than once a month, a larger chunk of the total will be going to artist B. And in aggregate things will work out, since an average listener will listen to a random song an average number of times. Broken down to an individual level you can claim that a smaller artist gets less but if that artist&#x27;s listeners actually play more than the average number of songs an average subscriber plays, then they get a larger percentage instead. That seems like random variation to me.<p>I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s unfair. If you think artist B is more deserving of your money than artist A despite B being listened to fewer times, then yeah this would be unfair. I&#x27;m just not sure why you would say that they deserve your money more than an artist that people listened to more often.')
