Not really. The argument is that these companies are removing entirely legal content they just don’t like. Their TOS pages are interpretive depending how much they dislike the poster of the content. They do this intentionally and target specific views. They curate their bubble and that is publishing. The issue isn’t moderating content, it’s the selective enforcement.<p>He starts with a complete strawman.<p>&gt;It protects all websites and all users of websites when there is content posted on the sites by someone else.<p>That is the exact crux. I created the content, but EVERY one of these sites is clear they own it. Once I wrote it and hit send, I gave it to them and assumed ownership, they are clear about this. So they ARE publishing THEIR content.')
