Item(by='kickingvegas', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605334869, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25088815, text='Okay, here&#x27;s a typical day with org-mode for me. Start out the day entering a daily journal, listing out all the TODO items and scheduling them so I can see them in org-agenda. A subset of those TODOs are meetings, of which I&#x27;ll use the folding outline editor to write an agenda and notes. Given that I work remotely now near 100% of the time, I typically share my screen to go over the agenda. Frequently, I&#x27;ll need to diagram something to share with the team. For that I use org-babel to write plantuml or graphviz and render the output (like a sequence or class diagram or flow chart) and use that to drive design discussion with the team. Note that all of this is still within GUI emacs in single buffer (text and images). At my work we use Confluence and Jira, so I use org-export to publish the above work to Jira markup (tables, headings, lists, typeface styles). Other TODO items are the tasks I do during the day; there I use org-mode to capture my notes&#x2F;thoughts. Most times, I&#x27;ll use org tables to help organize tabular data (which happens a lot) and org-babel to run both python and bash commands. In addition I&#x27;ll use source blocks to capture code snippets (typically Swift nowawdays) and random commands. I&#x27;ll also store links that I run across through the course of day. Note again, I&#x27;m still working out of that same buffer. With emacs-client, I remote from my iPad into that same buffer and edit away. End of the day, I commit my org-mode file into my notes repo using magit. Occasionally, I&#x27;ll use org-mode to write a presentation using reveal.js or typeset documentatation to push through LaTeX. Nearly all my documentation starts out as an org file. YMMV, but org-mode has completely transformed how I work now.')
