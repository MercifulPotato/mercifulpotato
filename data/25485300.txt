This is just as overblown a reaction.<p>First of all there&#x27;s no reason to ever run chkdsk&#x2F;f in the first place if there are no problems with your SSD.<p>Secondly, just never use chkdsk &#x2F;f - chkdsk &#x2F;scan is faster, requires no restart and no further action is needed if no problems were found.
