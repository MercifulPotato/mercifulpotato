Developers can write apps that make use of a stable database instead of rolling their own INI file read&#x2F;write routines. This makes more apps stable, which is great for users. This is something programmers really don&#x27;t understand (considering every programmer I talk to uses the registry as an example of Microsoft&#x27;s stupidity and heavy-handedness), which is unfortunate. We should spend more time thinking about our programs as wholistic experiences for the user, not just &quot;is INI file or registry more elegant in my idealized world&quot;.')
