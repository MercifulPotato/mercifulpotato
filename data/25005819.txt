Singapore is a very dense, packed, hot city -  you get a bit of island fever and are not so close to nature. Helsinki is literally the opposite. Singapore and Helsinki are both very, very safe, but I find Singapore has more extreme ends of wealth distribution (very badly paid migrant workers).<p>Both are super functional though, with good universities, and both great options for running a company&#x2F;working in tech. I would happily live in either city.')
