While physical violence is much less of a fear now, people have long memories, and people still report being subject to abuse (hate speech, being pushed, etc.).<p>Further, there are still people living in the closet here, afraid to come out for fear of being disowned by their family or ostracized by their community.  Grindr plays a double-edged sword here, because on the one hand it gives people a chance to meet others, but it also creates a risk of them being outed.  --That makes people vulnerable to blackmail.')
