(In the South, they were tightly related to patrolling for slaves, in the north they were predominantly helping wealthy merchants protect warehouses and other stores of wealth.)<p>In the decades since, the police (and their unions) have had a long, long history of right wing action.<p>The Portland Police Bureau (PPB) is known for their &#x27;Red Squad&#x27;, which was used in the 1900s to bust up unions, leftists, and people suspected of being communists. They regularly welcomed literal Nazis into their ranks in the 30s and 40s.<p>The stories aren&#x27;t unique to Portland either. A common piece of police iconography is a Punisher skull. Police with SS tattoos are not uncommon.')
