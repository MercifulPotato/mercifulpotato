We basically have no clue if it&#x27;s better off or not.<p>&gt; Unions are intended for industries where a worker doesn&#x27;t have a marketplace of options as there is a single or just a few employers (e.g. Hollywood, teachers, coal mining towns, hospital staff, etc.).<p>Unions are for all workers in all industries and sectors. Unions protect workers rights through collective action and ensure the work force isn&#x27;t marginalized, mismanaged or abused.<p>A worker has a right to a voice. Unions are the body of that voice.')
