You can turn the lights on in a very non-uniform manner. Extrapolating that to all the pixels on a screen, and you can&#x27;t get quite the image fidelity because some pixels need to be partially activated for ideal images. Best case scenario you do exactly half (one fourth the total pixels) for images that align with your pixels, but at dramatically decreased image quality.')
