Item(by='chki', descendants=None, kids=[25297770], score=None, time=1607030213, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25293920, text='That&#x27;s a good point, also described in the book Sapiens by Harari: In a way Religion, currency and contract law (and many other things) are all &quot;made up&quot;. They have institutions (priests, central banks, lawyers) with magic words (amen, price stability, due diligence) and a certain combination of magic words creates a new reality out of thin air. Think about how weird it is to &quot;sign&quot; an important contract and thereby changing you own future or the future of your company irrevocably.<p>While I&#x27;m definitely not a fan of crypto currency and wouldn&#x27;t seriously consider investing a single Euro into this mess, it&#x27;s certainly misguided to simply laugh at it being &quot;not real&quot;, because a lot of important things are. Obviously the gp makes some other important points.')
