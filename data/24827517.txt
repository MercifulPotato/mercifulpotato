Period. As I said in the initial comment, the NY Post is not a reputable paper and the story itself seems strange and fake, but guess what? That doesn&#x27;t matter. The evidence for the story, at this point, seems at least plausible, plausible enough to investigate it. If it&#x27;s fake, Murdoch and the NY Post will have a massive libel suit to pay for. That&#x27;s how the legal system works.')
