It is not useful for stopping road&#x2F;wind noise, but does help to dampen vibrations and resonance in the metal body of a vehicle. It is a dampener, and will not cut down much on the type of noise we have left in our vehicle.<p>MLV has a problem when used for automotive uses. To be maximally effect, it requires an air gap on both sides and must not be rigidly mounted. Apply MLV to the surface of a vehicle body will do approximately zero for noise. MLV is widely used for sound reduction in buildings, where it is much easier to mount it in ways that allow it to significantly dampen sound transmission.<p>High end cars use thinsulate as well as dampeners. Most Mercedes and Lexus&#x27; (at least) are lined to the gills with automative thinsulate, along with dampeners applied in critical locations.')
