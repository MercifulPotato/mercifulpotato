I&#x27;m considering building a whole house from bricks which will cost $30-$40k. I probably won&#x27;t spend $15k for electricity for all of my life. I don&#x27;t understand western economy. You&#x27;ve got extremely costly electricity and you&#x27;re claiming that solar power is good. It might be true for you, but it won&#x27;t ever come to me at those prices. I&#x27;m paying $0.03 for kW⋅h. I&#x27;m spending around 200 kW⋅h per month, so that&#x27;s $6 per month. I would need to live 208 years to save $15k.<p>Solar panels might be fine in some distant places where you&#x27;re forced to use diesel generators. Diesel is not cheap. But where electrical grid is already in place, I just don&#x27;t see it working.')
