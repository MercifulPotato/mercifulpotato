I bought a Cadillac in 2012. Its build quality was lower than anything I&#x27;ve seen from BMW, Audi or Volvo. I&#x27;m talking about really inconsistent panel (internal and exterior) gaps and misc vehicle rattles. It&#x27;s also worth mentioning the Cadillac was the most expensive vehicle of the group and very much a line that GM cared about. I have no idea how Ford is doing, but GM is still not comparable to German&#x2F;Swedish&#x2F;Korean manufacturers.')
