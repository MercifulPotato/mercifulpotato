With React, you can nip a little bit of <i>creativity</i> out of each individual team member for sanity’s sake. You would be shocked just how different people’s mental models actually are without a framework.<p>I already go nuts at how some people structure some components, and to keep this post at peak hyperbole, I’d give up on life if I had to see their vanilla js components.<p>It would be unmanageable emotionally. I’ve seen some people write components that are straight up php-like includes (e.g import ‘.&#x2F;FilterCategories’. Doesn’t take any args. Just for sanity’s sake, the fact that React is helping teams write composable&#x2F;reusable modules (or that a module is a function that takes params, so don’t be a dick and make a shrink wrapped component with vars baked in), with brain-dead ways of wiring up component logic is probably one of the most stress-reducing advents in frontend.<p>Lots of finger pointing by me here, but I’m doing it to vent to strangers, instead of taking it out at work.')
