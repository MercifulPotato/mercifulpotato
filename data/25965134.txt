Was just pointing out that this statement is false or dangerously half-true: “as of now, he has not sold his shares”. This, however, would be true: “as of now, he has not sold <i>all</i> of his shares”.<p>The danger in “he has not sold his shares” is that a retail investor who did not do their research might misinterpret it and imagine a guy who never sold and will never sell; since that guy has background in finance and knows what he’s doing, common sense would suggest it must be safe to invest into this stock right now; meanwhile, in reality that guy has already cashed in big time.')
