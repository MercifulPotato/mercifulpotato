My current passion is to make taking notes quicker and simpler. Therefore, introducing RoughBook. RoughBook is an online note-taking chrome extension. It is a productivity tool that helps in quickly capturing important information and set reminders.<p>The Exact Problem - \nThere are zillion notes taking apps which help us in beautifully organising our notes. But what about notes which we just want to write-down (type-down) and organise later (if at all we wish to).  In such cases, we end up using pen-paper (if at all they present) or just rely on our memory-power to remember things. Thus, the problem in focus is not being able to quickly add notes and the difficulties in searching for them later.<p>The Solution - \nNeed of a product which can help us to quickly take down notes&#x2F;reminders and tag them if required. I started it as a chrome extension (as most of my online time spent on chrome) but surely expand it later on multiple platforms. Pin RoughBook at your Chrome browser and just keep adding whatever coming to your mind and if you want them to be organised, just use simple hashtags. Yes, same hashtags which you use for LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagramâ€¦')
