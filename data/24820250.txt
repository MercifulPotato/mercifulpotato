There were fistfights in parlament and screaming. But violence definitely was not just Soviet export. Communists were minority compared to right wing extremists - who started to operate right after WWI.<p>&gt; But Hitler and his ideology were a product of First World War and not a product of unstable Germany or unstable Europe.<p>What does this mean?
