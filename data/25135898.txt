It&#x27;s in the Mac App Store already -- but NOT the latest version, because Apple suddenly decided that they wanted written proof that accessing the Powerwall APIs was allowed (from whom?! It&#x27;s MY hardware!).  Apple will not allow the dev to update his Mac App in the MAS; yet they approved &amp; continue to leave the original older version [with known bugs] up, available for purchase.<p>So now the developer is <i>stuck</i> -- he can&#x27;t update his app on the Mac App Store, and what recourse does he have as a 1-man-shop vs Apple?!  =|<p>As a developer I find it absurd, as a consumer [who bought the app on MAS and wondered why I had the non-latest version], I find it absolutely baffling &amp; anti-consumer.')
