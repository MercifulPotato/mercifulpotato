Those wars are justified typically by generating a shared sense of fear and&#x2F;or hate for the other side.  If people&#x27;s ties or shared identity to that group were weaker, it would be harder for people to buy into that propaganda.<p>I find this interesting, because without some unifying forces I don&#x27;t think our modern society would be able to function well.  I&#x27;m just not sure Geography and national identity&#x2F;culture are the best way to unify people.  Can&#x27;t say that I have any better alternatives though, other than thinking that if our personal identities were less tied to our national identity, the world might be a little friendlier place.')
