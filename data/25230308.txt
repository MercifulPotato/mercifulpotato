I do not like the automatic gear shifting in Vanmoof one bit. The Cowboy is single-speed gear and the motor intelligently adjust the level of support so you don&#x27;t feel the lack of gears. This gives a super smooth experience, and I honestly expect all electric bikes to transition to this setup over time.')
