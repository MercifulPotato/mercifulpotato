Item(by='dmix', descendants=None, kids=[25195939], score=None, time=1606191477, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25184294, text='Two rather insignificant observations:<p>- the video scaffold redirected to localhost:8000&#x2F;Posts why in the world are the controller paths capitalized? So rare to see that but somehow I&#x27;m less surprised in haskell<p>- the name sounds a lot like i-Hop and I can&#x27;t get it out of my head now and it will forever be that. First impressions have a way of sticking around<p>Otherwise I like the opinionated direction they chose. Especially being a dev-shop we&#x27;re using it for ourselves so we don&#x27;t really care about taking a community-census type approach to things. They only care about what works for creating real things.<p>Having gone down the Haskell road, letting someone make the hundreds of early choices for you seems to be the best way to go for early adoption. Typically the under-layers remain abstract enough for the true hackers, which also seems to be the case here (from reading about the blaze-html integration).<p>Which I always believe is a solid foundation for any useful framework. The demanded customizations can always be supported later. Modularization tends to come later as a project matures, but the early days it&#x27;s best to take a singular path that works for the founding team until maturity is reached and wait&#x2F;see if it does indeed become popular first to justify the more modular&#x2F;customizable approach.<p>I haven&#x27;t tried it myself though but I seem to be close to the target market being both a past Rails dev and a Haskell fan. So I&#x27;ll keep it on the back burner for until I have time.')
