I would argue that small projects are a misalignment of resources for FAANG companies. For example, niche music streaming services are better left to smaller startups who can easily solve those problems.<p>FAANGs should allocate their resources on big problems that others would not have the resources to tackle. Because if the FAANGs don&#x27;t, no one else would be able to feasibly attack those problems.<p>The upside is the big problems get solved and there&#x27;s smaller problems left on the table for startups to flourish on.')
