My main point is that everybody is talking about how eBikes can get the older folks back out on the bike but when you start talking about tubes and tires you are right back at that ultra-competitive space where people are shaving grams etc. That is part of the bike culture that I do not like, I wish it was more like the Netherlands here in the US. I imagine lots of utilitarian bikes and decent shops all over the place. Here in the US the shops tend to focus exclusively on the high end. It reminds of high school athletics where the varsity football team gets 90% of the budget all to help out 5% of the students, just one more lopsided aspect of the US and our approach to physical fitness.')
