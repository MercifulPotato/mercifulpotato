I&#x27;m not a gamer, don&#x27;t read gaming news and don&#x27;t get hyped. I just knew that this was an RPG made by CD Projekt Red.<p>And I think largely thanks to not expecting anything, I was quite pleasantly surprised. It was my first game with RTX which was cool to see and as you said, it&#x27;s basically a new Deux Ex game, a series which I love.<p>The main storyline was a bit short and unfulfilling but the gameplay itself has been quite satisfying.')
