Now, from the experience we do have, ~30% inflation like in the 70s is the best we can hope for. A zombie economy like japan&#x27;s would frankly be fantastic given the conditions.<p>&gt;How does this harm a working class American that derives all of their income from working wages as opposed to assets?<p>Their wage-dollars will now buy less stuff.<p>&gt; Lastly, address how any of the above prevents an increase in manufacturing jobs, which was the intent of the measures originally listed.<p>Don&#x27;t worry, americans will have plenty of $1&#x2F;hour manufacturing jobs like asians do now (or the nominal equivalente to $1 in a hyper-inflationary world). The US doesn&#x27;t have the technical capacity or workforce to compete in high paying manufacturing any more and will take decades of pain to build.')
