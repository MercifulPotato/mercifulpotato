I&#x27;ve seen every plot, every type of character.<p>I have a friend who was working with movie scripts, and he described it like a factory. Generally every movie is a 5 act play, you get an intro to some typical character then something happens to them that&#x27;s either funny or serious depending on genre, then there&#x27;s a solution, etc.<p>But perhaps the thing to do is not to expect surprise in the general construction, but excellence in the execution. That&#x27;s why I can still watch stuff that&#x27;s highly rated eg Breaking Bad. Shakespeare is another one of those where you can how it&#x27;s made, but it&#x27;s made well.<p>Food is the same. It&#x27;s gonna be a mixture of fat and sugar, with some water and flavourings. But some things are better done than others.')
