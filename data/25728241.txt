You spend at least a fraction of a second anyway to verify that you&#x27;re writing the right thing, to reconsider if you should use an object or constant or refactor the function to work with a Boolean instead of a naked string; why is writing out the type such a big deal everytime this topic comes up?<p>I remember my first attempts at programming and being annoyed that I can&#x27;t add a string and an int; ever since that little bit of housekeeping of using types made sense to me and I can clearly see how it eliminates entire classes of errors.')
