Item(by='1vuio0pswjnm7', descendants=None, kids=[25329023], score=None, time=1607310310, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25326657, text='&quot;You can&#x27;t expect every person to be skilled enough (and witht the time and desire) to be their own network administrator, so someone will have to run the network for those people...&quot;<p>Why would this new internetwork have to be made available to &quot;those people&quot;.  This comment seems to reframe the article&#x27;s implicit &quot;call to action&quot; to a new set of constraints.  It presupposes that an internetwork can only be created when it exists for commercial exploitation of its users, despite the author&#x27;s example of a popular peer-to-peer network that generally has never been used as such, not to mention the &quot;Internet&quot; we are now using was not created for that purpose. (commercial exploitation)<p>It is curious this fascination with the definition of an internetwork as one that must mirror the present one and include amongst its users unskilled persons with no time or desire to learn how to use it but with money and a willingness (maybe even a forced necessity) to pay others to help them.<p>I wonder if there has ever existed a internetwork used only by skilled persons with time and desire to learn to use it, and not seeking to be compensated for the time they spent learning and the skills they developed as a result.  If not, perhaps there will be.')
