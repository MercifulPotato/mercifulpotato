This seems to fit with your &#x2F;institutional memory&#x2F; model.<p><pre><code>    &gt; But it is not clear whether going further\n    &gt; and entirely removing it is going to be better.\n</code></pre>\nThere is room to distinguish strategic leadership and middle-management. Strategic leadership sets coherent direction for an institution, and continues to be relevant. Middle management is a vestige of the industrial era, where manpower and scale were interchangeable concepts.<p>The orchestras show that there is an alternative to middle-management. We don&#x27;t really have a word for this, but we could call it Elders.<p>A key difference between Elders and Middle Managers is the role of skills. Elders must be at least competent at domain-relevant skills to be relevant, and their respect grows with skill mastery. Whereas, in a MM culture, having skills excludes you from influence. You are either a career manager (entirely without domain skills), or you convert. In the process of conversion, you will have social pressure applied not to get your hands dirty.')
