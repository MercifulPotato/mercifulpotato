By which I mean, when I&#x27;m coding something and it <i>could</i> be universally quantified on the type, then it&#x27;s better to do so. That way, it&#x27;s impossible to phrase certain errors. For example, a function `Set&lt;a&gt; -&gt; Set&lt;a&gt;` must produce a subset of the input set; that&#x27;s guaranteed by the types. I can&#x27;t accidentally include the value 0 in my set, because 0 isn&#x27;t of that generic type. The generic forces you to think in terms of the structure you&#x27;re manipulating, rather than in terms of its contents.')
