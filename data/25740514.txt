They were carrying flexicuffs. They made a beeline for the Speaker and Majority Whip&#x27;s unmarked offices. They broke windows, barricades, and one of them got shot trying to enter a hallway not a minute before was filled with Congresspeople.<p>What in the hell do you <i>think</i> would have happened if they had caught up to any member of Congress? Seriously. Even if you foolishly assume the most charitable and peaceful of intentions, the <i>size</i> of the mob and physical violence on display going through the halls of the Capitol should make it painfully <i>obvious</i> that any Democratic member of Congress they happened upon would have ended up seriously injured. The mob beat a cop to <i>death</i>.<p>There&#x27;s simply no way a rational person could come to the conclusion that the mob wouldn&#x27;t have injured or killed Congresspeople. If you can&#x27;t see the mob&#x27;s intent you&#x27;re either being willfully obtuse or disastrously ignorant. There&#x27;s not a charitable middle ground as these people documented themselves during the riot and months leading up to it.')
