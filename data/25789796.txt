Item(by='dragonwriter', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610711540, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25789437, text='&gt; By storming an important government building, you can do some damage (esp. reputational one), kill certain people, but overthrow of a political system in a huge country is much harder to pull off. In modern history, such primitive actions usually fell flat on their face after mere hours. Which is precisely what happened here.<p>I don&#x27;t think that <i>occupation</i> as the route to success was ever intended. The intent was that a combination of intimidation a d violence by the mob would combine with the actions by ideologically allied legislators to result in a key governing action (the electoral vote count) being resolved in a way which would leave the figure promoted by the mob in power. The timing was critical.<p>&gt; I would be more worried about a potential &quot;rebellion in the provinces&quot;, which is basically what Francesco Franco did. That would have a potential to spin into a full fledged civil war or violent secession. This is something that was effective in certain cases.<p>That&#x27;s pretty much what the propaganda framework has been being laid for with the narrative about Trump voters being “silenced” by adherence to legal process, and the combat-orriented narrative (whether deliberately or incidental to efforts to build support for sharp events like the 1&#x2F;6 insurrection and the violent actions planned for next week.) If it&#x27;s deliberate, that bodes ill, but even if it&#x27;s not short of a direct and strong repudiation by sufficient figures influential to the factions that have been radicalized, there&#x27;s still an enormous danger of it spinning out of control. While I think the insurrection-focussed impeachment trial is an opportunity for that, I&#x27;m not convinced that even of Republicans in the Senate seize that opportunity that are collectively influential enough with the radicalized for that to significantly mitigate the radicalization rather than being widely seen as a stab in the back.')
