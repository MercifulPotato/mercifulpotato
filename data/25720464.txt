Particularly tips of foods that are easy to preprep and remix and reheat easily, for people who have little cooking experience.<p>One tip: get a sound vide cooker. It’s so foolproof and you have a lot more leeway, sometimes even hours, when you actually eat. Great if you get locked into something and don’t want to be interrupted until you’re done.')
