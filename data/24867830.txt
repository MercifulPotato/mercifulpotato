Bedrooms and bathroom are downstairs and upstairs is open plan with high ceilings. My workspace is upstairs and it works out great. Kids going to school and my wife to work neatly bookends the day and I just switch on my own machine and off the companies to keep separation. I&#x27;m right in the heart of downtown Reykjavik so heading out to do stuff or take a break is straightforward.')
