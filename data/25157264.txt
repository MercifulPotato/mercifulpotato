The burden of proof is on the accuser.  You cited this guy to say that the election was fraudulent.  I proved he doesn&#x27;t agree.  Now you&#x27;re saying he can&#x27;t know that it WASN&#x27;T fraudulent... so therefore... it is?  Surely you see that this logic doesn&#x27;t work.<p>&gt; I&#x27;ve never seen Jeffrey dahmer eat human flesh, that doesn&#x27;t really speak to his innocence.<p>By that logic you&#x27;re accusing literally the whole world of being cannibals!<p>This isn&#x27;t good faith. You don&#x27;t believe any of this.')
