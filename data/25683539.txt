Of course, if you&#x27;re serious about using React, doing the transpilation before pushing your code to the CDN probably makes the most sense, rather than doing the transpilation client-side or using vanilla JS. But just because it&#x27;s common, doesn&#x27;t mean you need to follow that way of doing things.')
