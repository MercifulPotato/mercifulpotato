It&#x27;s a reasonably effective way of handling a subsidy where there isn&#x27;t a strong bureaucracy and banking system to distribute payments. Removing them can trigger protests (remember the gilet jaunes complaining about fuel prices? and this was an issue in many of the Arab Spring riots.)<p>However, bitcoin provides a way to arbitrage that subsidy to world-market prices. It also provides a way for Iranians to evade the sanctions targeting their country.<p>(Iran would be a middle-income or even wealthy country if it wasn&#x27;t embargoed almost entirely)_')
