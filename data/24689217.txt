I found a decent condition one on craigslist for $100. I bought it, and it&#x27;s been stuck in my garage for 2 years now. \nI must have gone through $200 of parts just trying to get the bill collector to work, and it still doesn&#x27;t. It would be at least a few hundred more to bring it to a place that can fix it.\nIf you&#x27;re thinking about doing this, you need to make sure that every part of the machine works, because if you&#x27;re just starting out I can guarantee that you won&#x27;t be able to do the maintenance yourself.')
