What&#x27;s the purpose of artificially limiting performance when one doesn&#x27;t need the upgradability?<p>I&#x27;ve, personally, never upgraded the RAM on any system I&#x27;ve built or carried it to a new motherboard with a new socket. I&#x27;m absolutely the target audience for this. I would love this increased performance, as long as it wasn&#x27;t some surprise. Having the extra plastic on the motherboard is literally e-waste for me. Don&#x27;t touch my PCI-e slots though.')
