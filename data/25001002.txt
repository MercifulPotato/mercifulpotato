[..snip..] I never thought I&#x27;d say this before, but I would have been happier stepping into C++.<p>Actually, I find Nim language [1] to be a great alternative to C++ as far as compiled, statically typed, high performance modern languages are concerned. Moreover, Nim&#x27;s meta-programming capabilities (generics, templates, macros) are second to none for creating elegant DSLs. And its syntax makes Python developers feel at home. Preempting questions about garbage collection -- Nim allows to switch off GC and manually manage memory if a programmer so desires. Or you can manually manage memory in some critical parts of your program while letting the rest be garbage collected.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nim-lang.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nim-lang.org&#x2F;</a>')
