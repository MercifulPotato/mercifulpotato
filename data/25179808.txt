Notwithstanding the American dream of rising from rags to riches, upward mobility is less common in the United States than in many European countries, and there is no evidence of improvement in recent decades.<p>This I believe is the crux of the problem in how the &quot;upward mobility&quot; is measured. If it is strictly by income&#x2F;wealth quintiles, then it is strictly zero-sum. But is the world really a zero-sum game? I&#x27;d content that 80-90% people in USA &#x2F; Western Europe have a far superior quality of life than the top-1% of the past on many metrics like health, nutrition or peace. So one can say that their entire societies were upwardly mobile from 1946 onward.')
