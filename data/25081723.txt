When the reigns change hands, the new party <i>could</i> take the time to tighten election security, but to what benefit? They are now in control. Making things more fair to the other team would only hurt their chances.<p>Election fraud is deeply ingrained in the long democratic political history of the US, from the very beginning. Direct democracy was an untried, unknown concept when the country started. No one but a few ivory tower eggheads who read dense philosophy books really understood what it was all about: &quot;You mean if our guy gets more pieces of paper into that box than the other guy, we can award ourselves all of the government contracts?&quot; It didn&#x27;t even necessarily start out as nefarious or unethical, just clueless.')
