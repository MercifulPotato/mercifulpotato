The accident described in the article was one of several that created Sandia&#x27;s engineering culture.<p>If you somehow got your hands on a modern nuclear weapon and you had a team of PhD engineers, a year of time, and the best tools in the world, you <i>might</i> be able to get the radioactive material out, but  you absolutely would not make it explode.')
