I&#x27;m a trail runner and long ago I ditched &quot;more stability&quot; shoes due to knee, hip and foot pain.  For a while I ran in the Vibram Five-fingers and yes it does take some training to get your calves into shape!.  They are super cool in that you are able to feel what you&#x27;re standing on, rocks, mud, leaves or snow! You even find your toes curling to grip on the surface to help provide traction!  but I kept kicking rocks and hurting my toes.<p>So I then switched to New Balance Minimus which are sort of like the five-fingers but with a toe box and thus a bit more protection.  These are great and I still have a pair that I sometimes run in.  However, I&#x27;d periodically bruise the bottom of my foot landing on a sharp rock (looking at you, the Radical Road in Holyrood Park, Edinburgh early one summer morning!).<p>For the last 5-8 years I have been running in Altra Superiors: a low stack height, zero-drop (between heel and toes) and mostly because they have a rock guard that protects the bottom of your feet.  Excellent shoes, I go through about 2 pairs a year and I love them!<p>Overall, I can highly recommend the &quot;minimal&quot; shoe approach (although maybe not the five-fingers).  Go with Altra or Topo something that has zero-drop so you&#x27;re not heel striking.  You don&#x27;t need&#x2F;want arch support;  the arches are supposed to be strong, support themselves and most importantly (for your knees) act as a primary shock absorber.<p>BTW: If you&#x27;re interested in this and &quot;humans as endurance runners&quot;, Born to Run by Christopher McDougall is a great read!')
