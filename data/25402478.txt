Item(by='anonu', descendants=None, kids=[25403558, 25403159, 25402811, 25402497, 25402796], score=None, time=1607812837, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25401294, text='$7500 seems low for this bug. If I were Facebook i would raise it. Why?<p>Cost&#x2F;benefit analysis tells me I could probably get a lot more for this bug going to some more nefarious actors.<p>$7500 is a drop in the ocean for a company like FB who has a reputation to keep intact.')
