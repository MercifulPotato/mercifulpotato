But not from WFH - I thoroughly prefer it. But the lockdown in general makes everything tougher. Being in one room&#x2F;house all day inevitably collapses your world somewhat to just that space, I’m finding, and magnifies the smaller irritants to be much larger than they could or should be. So while I’m happy to continue to WFH forever now, it would be nice to be able to socialise in my leisure time. But it will end, and we’ll have that chance again. There’s always some light at the end of the tunnel, and I prefer not to think of it as the headlights of a train this time.')
