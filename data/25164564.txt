RISC instructions are fixed width and how low complexity from a decoding and pipelining point of view.<p>Pentium Pro was not RISC, that is just Intel marketing speak. Micro-ops can be produced in a RISC CPU as well, it is separate from having a RISC ISA. The RISC ISA is about what the compiler sees and can do. The compiler cannot see the Pentium Pro micro-ops. Those are hidden from the compiler. The compiler cannot rearrange them and optimize them they way it can with instructions in the ISA.')
