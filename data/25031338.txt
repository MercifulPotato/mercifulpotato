This design grew out of the NBS&#x27;s SEAC and DYSEAC computers which had 45 bit words, so it&#x27;s unclear where 53 came from. SEAC only had fixed-point operations so I think it&#x27;s coincidental that 53 bits matches a double. The interesting thing about DYSEAC is that it was &quot;portable&quot;, weighing 20 tons and housed in a truck for the Army.')
