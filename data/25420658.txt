Not hosting the content itself, but indexing it.<p>(I&#x27;ve never developed anything with blockchain or torrents, so my apologies if there&#x27;s a technical reason why this sucks.)<p>If I understand Pirate Bay and other torrent sites correctly, they don&#x27;t host any content. They just index what&#x27;s available P2P.<p>I&#x27;m not sure how large that index would become, but I could imagine chunking the index itself out so that it doesn&#x27;t take much room on any one user&#x27;s machine.<p>The chunking of the index could theoretically be done in such a way that no individual chunk would have any useable information, so no individual user could be accused of linking to illegal content. (I <i>think</i> that&#x27;s conceivable? Again, not sure.)<p>(Please note: This is pure hypotheticals. I have zero interest in seeing such a system come about.)')
