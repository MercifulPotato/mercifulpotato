Comcast was paying me $9 to $12.50 for that work while Verizon paid more then double of my highest wage at Comcast.  Overall I got fed up with being yelled at on the phone by customers&#x27; of monopoly companies and taught myself web development and design.  I&#x27;m glad I did so, yet am pro-union per my experience at Verizon vs. Comcast.')
