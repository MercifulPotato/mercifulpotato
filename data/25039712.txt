No sane person is advocating for ex post facto laws but it&#x27;s wrong even if it&#x27;s not illegal. He&#x27;s been given every opportunity in life, accrued a net worth equal to the sum of 140,000 median Americans, then gives barely any of it back and apparently may flee to dodge being taxed on it.<p>&gt; If we want to change the law, we should be forced to consider the effects on the future<p>Of course. This is why it&#x27;s taken so long to come up with laws that prevent the kind of exploitation that creates a couple dozen billionaires while stagnating the majority of America&#x27;s incomes. It&#x27;s morality that drives the lawmaking -- since everyone has different morals and we all live under the same laws -- and at least if everyone hates the guy for this then hopefully we see some laws that prevent more behavior like this in the future.')
