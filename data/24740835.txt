Yes!<p>I kept looking for &quot;popcount&quot; and &quot;population count&quot;, not &quot;Number of ones in the binary representation of x.&quot; A Julia person should update the Rosetta Code implementation to use that function.<p>That function maps to ctpop_int  which is implemented as uu_iintrinsic_slow(LLVMCountPopulation, ctpop_int, u). I ... don&#x27;t know what the &quot;slow&quot; means.<p>There are follow-on problems, like my AVX2 implementation for 128 bytes stores one of the byte strings in AVX registers, and I get extra performance by prefetching. Once I get to the AVX-512 implementation, the same will happen. I don&#x27;t know how well the optimizer can handle those details. (&quot;My&quot; = implemented by HN user nkurz.)<p>But this is enough of a clue for a first decently-high-performance implementation - thanks again! I talked with the person from the conference who promoted Julia. He&#x27;s going to work on this&#x2F;we&#x27;ll work on it. I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing how the timings work out.')
