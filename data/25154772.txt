My family was in PR for a family trip, and as I&#x27;m not interested in pools or the beach (which is why my mom and sister went), my dad and I drove up into the hills to see it.<p>It was before there was any visitor center or tours. There was a little control room with some instruments and a large window you could look in, and a catwalk over to about the edge of the telescope. There was not really much to see, and they weren&#x27;t set up for people who wanted to visit.<p>I bought a poster at local giftshop from a dusty bin of Arecibo telescope prints (I was probably the only one who bought one), and the proceeded to go off and get my advanced degree in deep space communications (coding theory and DSP). I would say seeing Arecibo was part of why. I wanted to play with toy like that.<p>Sorry to see you, Arecibo. At least it had an effect on me.')
