That seems like a huge security hole, and one I&#x27;m sure they would like to have reported.<p>&gt; Also no, with Authy, as long as I have my master password somewhere, I can still login and get my 2FA codes.<p>Keep in mind that while Authy is great, it does weaken 2FA a bit. Now a hacker can hack Authy and then gain access. In a maximum secure 2FA setup (with a hardware token or Google Authenticator that is tied to the device), if you lose the second factor it&#x27;s <i>supposed</i> to be hard to get access. Some companies even tell you up front, that if you don&#x27;t have the codes shown when setting up 2FA, and you lose the 2FA you lose your account.')
