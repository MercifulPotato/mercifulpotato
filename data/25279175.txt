It&#x27;s so awfully wrong about my tastes.<p>Just dislike these songs&#x2F;videos. At first all I did was play playlists I already had in YT since the &#x27;my mix&#x27; (now &quot;my supermix&quot;) playlist had random songs I listened to 5 years ago, but after about a week of using the &#x27;my mix&#x27; and disliking songs, I started getting a bunch of great songs from artists that I otherwise had no idea about.')
