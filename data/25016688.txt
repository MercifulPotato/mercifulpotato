Otherwise you leave open the possibility of fraud as has been alleged in PA with multiple USPS workers coming forward and testifying that they witnessed backdating of mail in ballots.</i><p>No, there are allegations of USPS workers coming forward from conspiracy boards. In truth, there <i>were no such USPS workers</i> testifying, or even claiming, any of that. <i>Even FOX News</i> and One America couldn&#x27;t find any evidence supporting the existence of these supposed USPS workers.<p>And on another note: military votes have been allowed to arrive after election day since at least WWII. Are you saying that most of the military votes cast in the past 6 decades are fraudulent?<p>And on a final note: it hasn&#x27;t been possible to backdate postdates for at least a decade, as the USPS records when mail is received separately and in addition to the postdate, and it isn&#x27;t possible to backdate that data unless you have access to the USPS database. Considering that the USPS is run by a Trump appointee, it is very unlikely that <i>Democrats</i> have that sort of access.')
