But going through the same moving away thought exercise personally, one consideration (esp as one gets older in the US), is the degree to which your personal wealth is at risk from medical financial exposure over some major medical issue. The odds increase as your age does. It&#x27;s possible to be somewhat protected from this in the US, but it takes a lot of very careful reading of health insurance documents, some considerations as to losing that insurance if you&#x27;re getting it from an employer, as well as maybe putting into place added layers of insurance.<p>In addition, some studies point to not only worse care in the US if you aren&#x27;t in upper incomes, and living in the right regions, but also that even with the higher levels healthcare in the US that come with wealth, the outcomes can be lower than what median care quality in leading EU nations provides. I&#x27;m not sure the studies are fully conclusive, but that&#x27;s two healthcare factors that you haven&#x27;t mentioned, that I thought over when looking at moving away.')
