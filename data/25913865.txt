The shipping label on the package had my name on it, but the invoice inside was for someone in another state. Probably a packaging issue.<p>Spoke to customer service, they said since it (the hair-oil) is a non-returnable item, I could keep it, and they would initiate a replacement for the correct item so I could receive one soon.<p>It seems like it would cost them more to go out of their way and retrieve this package, re-pack it and send it to the intended recipient, then do the same for my package than just letting me keep it and processing both orders again. The economics of Amazon at this scale are quite bizarre.')
