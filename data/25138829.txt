Moreover, having the right version of the Python interpreter installed is frequently a problem--lots of systems still have Python 2 installed by default and even having Python 3 isn&#x27;t a guarantee since many programs depend on relatively recent versions of the interpreter which are rarely installed by default on the target system. Note also that while the Python interpreter runs on plenty of uncommon platforms, relatively few packages in the ecosystem do because the ecosystem depends so heavily on C-extensions and `pip install`s of these packages often need to build from source which often assumes you have various headers and libraries installed on your system at certain locations--which is to say the assumption is that you&#x27;re pip installing onto a &quot;common platform&quot;.<p>In my opinion (and extensive experience), I&#x27;d rather have something like Go where I can trivially cross compile for whatever `(arch, os)` tuple I want to target and send the resultant binary without concerning myself with runtime dependencies (including the runtime itself).')
