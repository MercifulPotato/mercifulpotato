Item(by='zaarn', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602751584, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24786226, text='Last time I checked, the printer dialog will first ask you what protocol to use to talk to the printer.<p>It lists a few common options, such as JetDirect, PCL, TCP&#x2F;IP, etc. Whatever. Doesn&#x27;t really matter, it&#x27;s just poor UX. Most end users have no idea what any of this means and don&#x27;t know what to pick. You&#x27;d possibly find out in the printer manual, though mine didn&#x27;t specify what protocols it understood very clearly, it was written in Appendix B or something and not in the index at the back.<p>In most cases, you now enter the hostname or IP of the printer to add. While sometimes necessary on Windows, autodiscover on linux is still a shitshow and doesn&#x27;t work except for HP printers. (Laser HP in Color is expensive).<p>On Windows, the very same printer that took me 30 minutes to setup after I wrangled it through the initial setup dialogue, took all of 20 seconds to setup; &quot;Settings&quot; -&gt; &quot;Devices&quot; -&gt; &quot;Add Device&quot; -&gt; &quot;Lexmark Printer&quot;. Done. It printed perfectly fine.<p>On the other hand, my printer to this day cannot print directly from firefox through CUPS. Only from other PDF viewers.<p>edit: from what I can see in a sibling comment, the add printer dialog in gnome is the same it has always been atleast up to Ubuntu 18.04, unless they made radical changes to Ubuntu 20.04 to the add printer dialog, which I don&#x27;t think is the case since I haven&#x27;t heard about any larger printer-related changes in 20.04')
