I imagined I would live life as an artist in a cheap flat. It was safe, beautiful, fun, and cheap.<p>Then Portlandia aired and the worst of the worst came to the city flooding out the local residents.<p>Growing up, I never understood why being poor was considered a problem. People in our city were poor, but we were decent people. I was one of them.<p>At some point, I realized that the new poor coming to our city on a dream fucking sucked. They shared none of my ideals and seemed to want everything for nothing.<p>edit: not to mention the gentrification.. holy smokes, it was a mix of these terrible people with no impulse control, and extremely rich playboys that would overpay for everything. Caused rents, restaurants, and everything else to glamorize. Even after a tech employer gave me a chance, I struggled to afford much here. I&#x27;m now happily living away.')
