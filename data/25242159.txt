I just made a custom static site generator last week because I was tired of hosting my WordPress and having to deal with multiple resolving site names, backup plugin spam, and constant updates which 9&#x2F;10 times have me restarting to get it back up....so far I have made 6 websites and transfered all my WordPress content to my generator and I feel so much freer. it doesn&#x27;t take PHP, it doesn&#x27;t take a database and I can theme it and I am building a couple plugins. I have 120+ posts and I plan on expediting now that it&#x27;s easy to publish this to multiple sites with a single publishing event.')
