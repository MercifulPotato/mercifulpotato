Bitcoin, fundamentally, is predicated on a belief about the relationship between government, money, and freedom. It&#x27;s not a belief I happen to share, which is why I have never and will never invest in it, regardless of price or utility.<p>I thought I would never invest in <i>any</i> cryptocurrency. But, as it turns out, there actually is one cryptocurrency which does reflect my beliefs: Dogecoin, whose overriding philosophy is &quot;I don&#x27;t know the details of how any of this works and it all seems rather silly.&quot; Last time I checked my holdings were about twelve cents, which as a purely-symbolic position seems more or less reasonable.<p>I am entirely unsurprised that Dogecoin would be associated with WSB. There is no market or financial relationship between the two. But they are both, in their own way, an example of shitposting that became serious enough to matter. A joke taken too far, until it stopped being <i>just</i> a joke (but never stopped being a joke).')
