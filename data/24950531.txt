Item(by='alan-kay', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604143297, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24945763, text='&quot;Back then&quot; was the 60s (whose decade really ran from about 1963 to 1973).<p>A good quote from Dave Evans (to faculty members who complained about a genius faculty member who could be abrasive): &quot;We don&#x27;t care if they&#x27;re prima donnas as long as they can sing&quot;.<p>As I&#x27;ve mentioned in a few other places, including this forum, most people found Edsger to be funny. He obviously enjoyed wielding English for comments, biting, snide, and otherwise. He loved to project snide arrogance in his particular highly developed style.<p>A good friend of his was Bob Barton -- I think even more of a genius -- and perhaps even more idiosyncratic, pointed and neurotic. Barton was kind of on-stage most of the time, and had truly eloquent extemporaneous opinions.<p>But so what? Listen to Dave Evans, and then listen to what great and interesting people have to say.<p>One of the definitions for these people is that whether they are right or wrong, or whether you agree with them or not, what they say is so interesting that it absolutely demands to be thought about.<p>You can&#x27;t beat that kind of help for your own thinking processes.')
