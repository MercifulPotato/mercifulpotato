The major US political parties don&#x27;t have any consistent ideology.&quot;<p>Yes they do.<p>You are missing the point with Milton Friedman. This is not about &#x27;what works and what doesn&#x27;t work. This isn&#x27;t about ideas or their validity.<p>This is about populism and opinions.<p>The &#x27;Right&#x27; consistently, ideologically wants &#x27;Restrained spending, balanced budgets, possibly military spending and supply-side economics, Constitutional Originalism, fairly free markets, limited social spending.<p>The &#x27;Left&#x27; wants deficit spending, demand side economics (i.e. stimulus cheques) etc. etc..<p>This is very, very consistent throughout the last many decades.<p>Donald Trump flipped the narrative by pushing for &#x27;free money&#x27; for people, which is something &#x27;the Left&#x27; has been pushing for hard since the start of the pandemic, and which was consistently rebuffed by the GOP - both sides consistent with their ideology.<p>Because Trump followers support him and don&#x27;t even understand their own ideology, they think anything he says is &#x27;Conservative&#x27; even when it&#x27;s not.<p>So commenters in Fox News are all huff and puff about &#x27;hard working people need that money&#x27; the day Trump made the claim, even though for months, &#x27;the Left&#x27; had been pushing that only to rebuked by Fox News readers as being &#x27;socialism&#x27;.<p>The plebes are often dumb, and believe whatever their populist leaders tell them, even if it&#x27;s directly against their own supposed ideologies. This basically the nature of the article.')
