It&#x27;s a nightmare and I would recommend just not purchasing Ubisoft games at all. Even if you get it to work, their games seemingly have more problems with wine&#x2F;proton than most, and multiplayer has never worked at all (again, due to Uplay).<p>Nearly every other game I&#x27;ve tried has worked great with proton though! Even multiplayer games (through steam) tend to work very well.')
