To me, this is the philosophy of Christ that taught me the most. Do you have faith in humanity? Do you have hope that people will choose goodness over wickedness? I do. History has taught me that humans move forward. I have faith in humanity that progress will continue. I believe that righteousness and justice can be the fuel to drive us forward. If I didn&#x27;t have any faith what would I have? If everyone was a cynic, where would we be? Certainly much worse off than we see ourselves today.')
