I&#x27;d have to guess BEVs have perhaps even an order of magnitude more chips. Certainly, they have chips that are far more advanced, looking at the Tesla FSD computer[0].<p>The chip industry, and the chip equipment industry are still capacity limited due to demands of remote work and school. That may level off and revert somewhat towards the end of the year. BEV sales may take up the slack, but also may demand a somewhat different chip supply chain and drive demand for different segments in the industry. We may well see the typical crash in equipment sales in 2022 as those two market drivers transpire.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnet.com&#x2F;roadshow&#x2F;news&#x2F;tesla-fsd-computer-retrofit-model-s-owner&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnet.com&#x2F;roadshow&#x2F;news&#x2F;tesla-fsd-computer-retrof...</a>')
