Item(by='Cogito', descendants=None, kids=[25451468], score=None, time=1608162595, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25450010, text='&gt; I think this is a poor characterization because you need to consider the source of both gross and net revenue.<p>I agree with this wholeheartedly.<p>From earlier upthread (<i>forrestthewoods-0</i>):<p>&gt; Apple makes about 60 billion a year in the profit. The 10 billion they get from Google constitutes 16% of their annual profit. Thatâ€™s significant!<p>This is the contentious part.<p>Some of the $10B from Google <i>needs</i> to be allocated against the cost centres that enable the sale, in order to account for it correctly. To put it another way, the marginal cost of this revenue is insignificant but the capital costs are significant.<p>It is worthwhile to consider marginal and capital costs separately, but it&#x27;s not reasonable to ignore those upfront costs when making an argument - it comes across as &quot;playing funny buggers with figures&quot; (<i>wyattpeak-1</i>).<p>So I generally agree with your points, but also agree with people who say you need to factor in the non-marginal costs required to generate the Google revenue.<p>As a meta point, your comments on goal post moving (while potentially correct - I&#x27;m not making a comment on correctness here) don&#x27;t add to your argument, your argument makes sense without them (and in my opinion would come across better if you left them out).<p>forrestthewoods-0: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25432024" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25432024</a><p>wyattpeak-1: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25438323" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25438323</a>')
