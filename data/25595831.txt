There will be significant technical and legal challenges in this.  Overhauling or upgrading the existing switches is non trivial.  This is just my opinion, but I predict this will result in legal battles and legal stalling on the part of the telcos.  Even if all the telcos agreed to do this, there would be a period of time that nothing is enforced and even then, this has no impact on anyone outside of U.S. jurisdiction unless laws with teeth require amended agreements between the U.S. and non-U.S. telcos.   I am not a lawyer, but I don&#x27;t need to be one to see some of the ways this will play out and how this can turn into political posturing, deflection of responsibility and saber rattling between the U.S. and other countries.<p>[1] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;transnexus.com&#x2F;whitepapers&#x2F;stir-and-shaken-overview&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;transnexus.com&#x2F;whitepapers&#x2F;stir-and-shaken-overview&#x2F;</a>')
