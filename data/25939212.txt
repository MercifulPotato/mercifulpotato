It&#x27;s an angry, violent mob, and what I see looks very much like other violent, angry mobs I&#x27;ve seen recently, including the portrayal of victimhood in the post, used as a justification for the behavior.<p>Mobs don&#x27;t end well for the community and especially for the mob.

Inviting and encouraging riots in your city is not a way to solve problems. Sometimes mobs do end well for people behind the scenes that use and manipulate the mob.<p>What good are the participants doing society?
