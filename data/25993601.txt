I own a european domain, which I manually renewed, and the registrar wanted to ding me a $250 REINSTATE fee.  Why?  Apparently the time difference.  As I&#x27;m quite detail oriented, I checked and my renewal was confirmed 1 hour prior to the deadline european time.  UST to the rescue.  The registar did eventually own up, but it left me quite amazed at games some people will play for a few dollars.')
