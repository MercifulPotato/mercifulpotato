I have a very small circle of friends I love and who I trust implicitly. With their permission I ask them if it&#x27;s okay to share some important things with them, in case the worst happens. Spare keys, contacts, etc. etc.<p>Those friendships might outlive any romantic partnership I do have in future. So I don&#x27;t think it has to be a partner specifically. Of course, there are still some things that you might not share as openly even with that trust in place, but that doesn&#x27;t stop you from having a backup plan.')
