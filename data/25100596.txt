It mentions nowhere that most of the work is actually done in C and he literally states that &quot;The aim of this exercise is to prove that interpreted languages can be just as fast as C&quot; which is just incredibly misleading.<p>Or look at the start of the readme, he claims that he wants to disprove &quot;some of the falsehoods about performance and optimisation regarding software and interpreted languages in particular&quot;. What falsehood exactly? To me it seems he intended it to be &quot;interpreted languages are slow&quot;, but he doesn&#x27;t disprove that at all.')
