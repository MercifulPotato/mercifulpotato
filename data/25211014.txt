I guess it&#x27;s a little more visually appealing to the public, but it literally changes nothing. The same number of chickens are still culled, they still get turned into animal feed.<p>Honestly, what difference does it really make if male chickens are shredded and ground up into feed pre or post hatching? It&#x27;s the same result in the end.')
