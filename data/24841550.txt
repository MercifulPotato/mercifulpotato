I mentioned that would be highly unlikely for several reasons and was quickly ushered away from their pet project.<p>Suffice to say they eventually had to negotiate the final project scope down <i>just a bit</i> to offline binary image classification (broken vs. not broken).<p>So even a company filled with so called data scientists can fall into the trap of believing the snake oil.<p>Addendum: not necessarily believing their own snake oil I suppose, totally possible that they were just naive about the capabilities after reading too many wired&#x2F;ars articles.')
