But it doesn&#x27;t stop them either, and often a decent textbook is the best way to learn about a subject.<p>As someone who chose to learn some subjects outside of school (usually years before they would have been taught), I tended to read textbooks my older siblings had used—did this for algebra, physics, and calculus—although I didn&#x27;t do that many problems from the textbooks.  (I also read lots of what might be called popular science books.)  The article does say &quot;[The McQueen] parents spurn curriculums, textbooks, tests and grades&quot;, but I know some unschoolers, and I suspect if I asked them, I would find that they read several textbooks.<p>One unschooling mom&#x27;s website quotes (seemingly with approval) another unschooling mom&#x27;s email on the subject.  Ultimately it seems to be saying that, while textbooks shouldn&#x27;t be the <i>primary</i> tool, they are <i>a</i> tool that is sometimes appropriate.  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sandradodd.com&#x2F;school&#x2F;textbooks" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sandradodd.com&#x2F;school&#x2F;textbooks</a>')
