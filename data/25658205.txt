Item(by='lmm', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609944612, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25657748, text='&gt; The aliens are only observing a black box system that spits out &quot;white wins&quot; or &quot;black wins,&quot; they are trying to determine if there&#x27;s any reason to develop the means of probing the contents of the black box. Regardless of whether you start by modelling the players or the board, you are still assuming the winner is determined by some complicated model with numerous hidden variables which you would have no reason to believe unless you start with the assumption that this is not a random number generator - an assumption for which you have no evidence.<p>If you actually did that, you&#x27;d start creating complicated hidden variable theories to explain every random coin flip you could see, despite the overwhelming majority of them actually being random coin flips.<p>&gt; The author&#x27;s thesis is that assuming a complex explanation for a black box&#x27;s behavior is reasonable because that&#x27;s the only way that leads to experiments to probe the contents of the box.<p>The thesis only holds if it&#x27;s actually common to have a complex hidden detail inside a black box that is nevertheless somehow completely impossible to infer from the outside. And what I&#x27;m saying is that that&#x27;s actually absurd; in cases where there are meaningful details to be found out, it will be apparent from the outside that there is detail in there, at least the overwhelming majority of the time.')
