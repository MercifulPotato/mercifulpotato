It&#x27;s of a non-violent crime and a comparatively compartmentalized one that doesn&#x27;t impact the nation as a whole.  Incentivising industrial espionage isn&#x27;t &quot;not bad&quot;, but it&#x27;s not <i>that</i> bad.<p>This is routine Washington stuff, really.  The genuinely corrupt pardons, of his family and associates (and potentially himself) for crimes committed during the administration don&#x27;t seem to have materialized[1].  The list from yesterday is very long, but really pretty unsurprising.<p>[1] But there is still an hour and a half left.  A pardon can be scrawled on a napkin in 30 seconds and then shown to the media to deliver it.  There&#x27;s no formality requirement in the constitution.  If he does it before noon then it counts.')
