I suppose all those labels make sense. But anyway — yeah, power bricks are common and Apple doesn&#x27;t ship them by default anymore; Watch pucks are niche and it would be pretty dumb for Apple to ship Watches without them.<p>advice: put your extra puck in your suitcase; if you accidentally travel without one you&#x27;ll have a bad time')
