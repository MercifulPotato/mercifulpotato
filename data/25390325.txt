They said this by looking at the more recent past of less developed places (like rural Russia, pre-1917) and assuming that the far past of England looked the same, and thus that nuclear families became common only recently. And they were wrong.<p>Of course, there are many places even further away than Russia. Lots of other cultures did have multi-generational families as the pattern, and many still do.')
