It&#x27;s not like this guy was going to sell the cheese as Grana Padano, so I really don&#x27;t see the point the Consortium is trying to make, especially since the final product is just approximately similar to Grana Padano, and clearly not 100% exact. It&#x27;s like as if Coca Cola went after all those cheap generic Colas only because they are clearly piggybacking on the big brand popularity of Coke to sell their product. I think that if someone buys cheap pre-grated knockoff Parmesan in a bottle, it&#x27;s because they wouldn&#x27;t have bought the real deal even if they had known it&#x27;s better, and not because the knockoff exists. For instance, I know that certain brands of canned mackerel taste a bit better then the brands I usually buy, but I just don&#x27;t care enough to spend extra cash on it. In the same way, I don&#x27;t buy generic knockoff cheese because I care about it tasting worse then the real deal, and I consider it being worth the extra money.')
