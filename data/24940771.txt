I don’t think he reads HN or any other forum regularly.<p>Quote back to him his own statements in interviews where he has emphasized that Apple supports human rights. Also quote other areas where Apple has spoken <i>for</i> the people (like “Dreamers”, for example). Ask why Apple is being so hypocritical.<p>Well written correspondence can get through, and can make a difference down the line.')
