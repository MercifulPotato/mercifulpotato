I suppose it would have been better than nothing though, and another one could have been passed after the election. You&#x27;re probably right that Pelosi calculated that a compromise wasn&#x27;t in her interest, but I&#x27;m also not sure if it was in the Republican&#x27;s interest: I think both sides would claim victory and it would have come down to whoever was able to spin it the most to their benefit.<p>Unfortunately, now that the election is over I also don&#x27;t think it will be easy to get anything done. The GOP is not going to want to give Democrats an early &quot;win&quot;, and will likely pivot to their &quot;but the deficit!&quot; talking points now that they&#x27;re out of office. I think things will need to get much much worse before a compromise is possible.')
