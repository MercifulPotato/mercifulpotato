If the vaccine was completely ineffective you&#x27;d expect roughly the same number in the vaccinated group. The actual number was 9.<p>What you&#x27;re saying is the 9 is pretty close to 34 (60% effectiveness). No, it isn&#x27;t. You&#x27;d need to <i>quadruple</i> the number of vaccinated cases to get there. Even if you double them, you&#x27;re still at 80% so I&#x27;d take that as the realistic worst case.<p>Edit: Also, this is BioNTech&#x27;s vaccine, not Pfizer&#x27;s. They partnered with Pfizer as they have the facilities and scale for a massive rollout, but it was developed by BioNTech. I wish they were getting more credit in the US &amp; UK coverage.')
