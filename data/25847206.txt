A huge number of people on this site have trouble understanding that there&#x27;s a world outside of the Bay Area where rent isn&#x27;t $3000+ a month, and that its possible run a company without involving venture capital and ballooning to multi-million dollar revenues in less than five years. Even the tech discussion here revolves around this stuff -- almost every thread has some mention of &quot;scaling&quot; even if what&#x27;s being discussed is a niche product that will have a customer base of a few thousand people over its entire life.<p>I like this site a lot, but I have a lot of patience when it comes to deciphering what is being affected by the Software Hub City Reality Distortion Bubble. Some people don&#x27;t, hence the eggcup testicle, and people that think something like that undermines the technical argument aren&#x27;t thinking clearly enough to even debate the technical point with anyway.')
