Item(by='pontus', descendants=None, kids=[25408564], score=None, time=1607877275, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25407664, text='I guess it&#x27;s dangerous to use words like &quot;nobody&quot; or &quot;everyone&quot; or &quot;always&quot; or &quot;never&quot; on the overly pedantic Hacker News. I would hope that the sentiment of my point came across either way. If not, let me clarify: it&#x27;s generally preferred to spend engineering effort on building new features and optimizing code to improve performance etc. over e.g. rewriting code from scratch to simplify it&#x27;s maintenance. I would venture to guess that an overwhelming amount of engineering effort is spent on effectively adding complexity to code.')
