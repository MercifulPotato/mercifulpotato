Nobody is forcing you to go to google or twitter for news, I don&#x27;t and would encourage you not to either.  Nobody is stopping you from going to and subscribing directly to news sources.  I do and would encourage you to as well.<p>This idea that you need social media to get news is exactly what&#x27;s wrong with the world today.
