South East is overpopulated (although even there, there are plenty of quiet places if you can access footpaths or rivers). Outside of that there are particular &quot;cool&quot; places to go on holiday such as Snowdonia (but people congregate around Snowdon and many other hills are empty), the Lake District (same deal) and parts of Devon or Cornwall. My nearest National Park is the Peak District and if you get up early there is no one there, if you stay into the evening there is over there. There are numerous places within walking distance of my house (outskirts of Nottingham) where I could walk&#x2F;cycle&#x2F;kayak&#x2F;open boat and even bivi out overnight undisturbed. I&#x27;m pretty sure most places are the same, even when I was living in central london I&#x27;d get into the countryside at least once a month.<p>One issue is lots of people that wouldn&#x27;t normally go out, were looking for places to go and because they had no experience of the outdoors they went to the honeypot locations, which were then busier than ever.')
