EVE Online did this back in the early 2000s and let you copy virtually anything in  UI. This led to awesome third party tools that could work with the game with a minimal learning curve from the user (everything was &quot;paste what you copied from the game&quot;). It did use a custom serialization format... But a plain text one nonetheless.<p>IO via copy paste between a wide variety of apps in a known, and very simple, structured format would be awesome in my books.')
