They do in fact lead in many areas of improving corporate behavior, but I have actually <i>never heard of them leading in this area</i>, and everyone I know who has worked there makes it sound little different other than the scale of what you work on and the pay, from any other corporation.<p>It’s one of the reasons I have never seriously thought of working for Apple myself.<p>I hope Tim Cook reads this and takes it seriously.')
