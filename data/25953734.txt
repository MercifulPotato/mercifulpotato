Item(by='nobody9999', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611893021, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25952035, text='&gt;&quot;Coup D&#x27;etat: a sudden decisive exercise of force in politics&quot;<p>&gt;That doesn&#x27;t fit the captiol protest very well. Sudden? Decisive? Exercise of force?<p>Tell that to Brian Sicknick&#x27;s[0] family.<p>Or did you miss the part where five people died and dozens were injured?<p>Or the smashed windows to force entry into the Capitol building, with some <i>explicitly</i> saying they were there to overturn the results of the election.<p>Let&#x27;s see.  A mob overpowers the assembled security without warning.  That&#x27;s sudden.  Check.<p>An armed group stormed the Capitol, assaulted police and other folks, and by their own claims, wished to injure, take hostage and&#x2F;or kill elected officials.  Exercise of force.  Check.<p>That same group did so, again based on their own claims, to overturn legally certified election results.  Political motive.  Check.<p>So please tell me, what doesn&#x27;t fit the term &quot;coup d&#x27;etat&quot;?  Or in this case, <i>attempted</i> coup d&#x27;etat?<p>Note that just because it didn&#x27;t succeed doesn&#x27;t change the facts or the intent.<p>If I walk into a bank and demand money, I&#x27;m still a bank robber even if I don&#x27;t actually get any money.  The analogy is fairly exact.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ktla.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;nationworld&#x2F;what-we-know-about-the-5-people-who-died-during-riot-at-u-s-capitol&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ktla.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;nationworld&#x2F;what-we-know-about-the-5-p...</a>')
