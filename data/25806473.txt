My potentially wrong understanding is they experienced a ~10x growth in a ~2 week period.<p>Technology does not exist absent its context. One might use MySQL, but is it sharded? are reads critical? Lets say you go from 1 database to 8 databases and then from 8 databases to 128? How much tooling do you think is involved in those changes (machine configuration, service discovery, shading behavior, machine replacement behavior, how machines are monitored). At what point do assumptions made under a small system completely fail in large systems? I can manually configure 8 machines by hand no problem. I can add 2 more no problem. But 100 machines? That territory starts to require automation. You can potentially look at 100 individual graphs for 100 different machines, but what about 1000 graphs? All of a sudden aggregation and drill down become necessary.<p>None of us (I think) have enough first hand information to understand why scaling up 10x was complicated for them. What I can almost promise is that if you have 10 servers and you go to 100, you are going to run into all types of problems you did not have at 10. Coordinated behavior across 100 machines is going to be a lot less forgiving than coordinated behavior across 10. Imagine a relationship where you have a every frontend talking to every data store. With 5 data stores, random failure isn&#x27;t all that likely, but with 1000, it&#x27;s much more likely. If every frontend talks to every data store, a single data store slowing down could result in ALL frontend stuck failing to make requests to it. Machine connection limits can be reached, interrupts from the NIC can bottleneck, service discovery can fail.<p>Does technology have an effect? Yes. Is lack of exponential backoff somewhat embarrassing? Yeah. Is failing spectacularly to keep up with exponential growth over a short period unexpected? No. I would expect any website or service already at scale to spectacularly fail to service 10x growth in a 2 week period.')
