And when people do buy the car, they don&#x27;t want you driving off the lot with can-I-even-get-home range anxiety as your first experience with electric.<p>So the chargers-at-dealerships requirements are there to make sure dealers can first just sell the cars. Second usage is maintenance -- yeah, EV&#x27;s don&#x27;t need oil changes, but they still get their mirrors broken off at the same rate as any other car. Think getting a range top-up after you drop off the car for whatever repair as part of your premium service package upsell.<p>It&#x27;s not about building out a destination charging network, it&#x27;s about making sure their EV retail outlets can effectively retail EV&#x27;s.')
