From our perspective the issue is whether the discussion here gets snagged on something controversial (sensational, etc.) that is less interesting than the main topic. If there&#x27;s any such snag in the title, the thread will tend to fill up with shallow comments that are reacting just to that. We&#x27;ve learned that when such title objections start appearing, it&#x27;s best to sand away the snag.')
