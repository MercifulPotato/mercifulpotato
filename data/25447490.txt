And I don&#x27;t need a VirtualBox VM running on my Mac to launch containers?  This would be huge for me, and is always a big in my mind why I would consider switching back to Linux.<p>Edit: Docker on Mac has never felt as snappy as on Linux, because of the VM, though I have no hard numbers.  Networking is a PITA, but it&#x27;s not hard to figure out.  The other main thing I hate is I have to give up a bunch of RAM to the VM that my containers may or may not use, instead of sharing with the host like on Linux.')
