Same idea with simulated annealing. It did end up finding some really strange bugs, but they were bugs that were present regardless, we just hadn&#x27;t found the right test case for it. We did end up getting some performance out of it, but not nearly as much as you&#x27;d expect. It mostly boiled down to running a few extra constant folding passes.')
