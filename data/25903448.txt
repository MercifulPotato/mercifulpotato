It was therefore classified as insufficiently critical to necessitate redundancy. Later, the scope of MCAS was extended, but the assumptions weren&#x27;t revisited.<p>Furthermore, pilots were assumed to quickly identify and fix a &quot;runaway horizontal stabiliser trim condition&quot;, providing the necessary backstop in case of system failure.<p>It&#x27;s absurd to say that they made this on purpose to save some money. The aircraft already has two AoA sensors, but only one was used for MCAS. How is that saving money?<p>Rather, it was a convoluted concatenation of circumstances, pressure, occasional lapse in competence that gave rise to the problem.')
