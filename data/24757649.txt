CodeWeavers&#x27;s Wiki page says &quot;The CrossOver version of Wine is regularly refreshed with the latest free Wine patches; likewise, patches from the company are sent back to the Wine project almost immediately. CodeWeavers is a major contributor to the Wine project ... hosts the project&#x27;s website, and employs the project&#x27;s maintainer, Alexandre Julliard, as their CTO.&quot;<p>Alexandre Julliard has his own Wikipedia page, also saying &quot;He now works full-time on Wine for CodeWeavers.&quot;[2]  If you look at Wine&#x27;s changelogs like in <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.winehq.org&#x2F;announce&#x2F;5.19" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.winehq.org&#x2F;announce&#x2F;5.19</a> , you see his name on a bunch of commits.  Piotr and Jacek Caban are names I also recognize as having been prominent contributors for years, and googling quickly shows they are CodeWeavers employees as well.  So it seems true.  I&#x27;m tempted to go buy CrossOver just to support their effort.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;CodeWeavers" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;CodeWeavers</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Alexandre_Julliard" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Alexandre_Julliard</a>')
