If Widget A goes through 10 intermediaries and each skims 5%, that’s still  5% margin for every link of the chain. I seriously doubt any intermediary or food distributor in Italy enjoys a 600% margin - if you know of one let me know and I’ll go buy shares in it tomorrow, the dividends must be succulent. You can argue that the chain is too long or this or that link is squeezed, but that is another matter.')
