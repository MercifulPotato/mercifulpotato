It also makes no difference to the customer since alternatives exist.<p>The fact that pretty much all other products in the smartphone and tablet market are inferior in terms of hardware, quality and software doesn&#x27;t matter.<p>&gt; You also start running into problems where more software and content may require such hardware.<p>So? If anything, this opens a market for software and hardware that doesn&#x27;t require it, don&#x27;t you think? For every Steam and Epic Game Store there&#x27;s a Good Old Games [1] is what I&#x27;m saying. Just another great reason to support and use FOSS, no?<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gog.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gog.com</a>')
