Glad you found your way back out, eventually.  That southern end is very much <i>not</i> a road.  Also, it&#x27;s a good thing you were in a truck, as bison can be very dangerous.  I used to hike there almost weekly, but significantly cut back once my brother was attacked by a bison and had to be flown out to a hospital.')
