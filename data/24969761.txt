I cannot tell their ad networks to stop tracking all the devices I own.<p>(They have a page for stopping tracking of things I use my Google account for.  That doesn’t count: They track me even when I am not logged into Google, and even on devices that cannot log into Google.)<p>Also, I can’t delete my gmail accounts.  They were issued by third parties that decided to outsource email to Google.<p>There is nothing consensual about my use of Google services.  I shouldn’t be bound by their EULA.  I’m sure the courts would disagree.')
