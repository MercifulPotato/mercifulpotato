Was on both macOS (10.12 I think) and Linux (some Ubuntu version) at that time.<p>Seems to be an interesting problem: if it works fine with no connection and fine with a complete connection but not &#x27;in between&#x27; (which is the best way I can describe it so far) you&#x27;d think it must be some common library or component in a network stack that causes this. macOS has some reachability system that might be in play here, perhaps if it flags the network as &#x27;reachable&#x27; but then gets REJECT&#x27;ed it goes bad? Or the other way around: marks network as &#x27;unreachable&#x27; but traffic flows anyway?')
