It doesn&#x27;t have to be proof of something to be useful information in creating a more whole image. Even if that weren&#x27;t the case, another point the parent made was that, in their opinion, the quality and tone of the article degrades conversation rather than contributing to it, which is another form of non-proof that is perfectly reasonable to express as an opinion. The parent may have spoken with a disrespectful tone, but &quot;You haven&#x27;t addressed a single point&quot;, is equally flippant and antagonistic. In fact, it&#x27;s worse, since you&#x27;re addressing it directly to a participant in the conversation.')
