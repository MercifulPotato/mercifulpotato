I&#x27;ve seen lots of people on the right <i>attributing it vaguely to the MSM</i> to lead into arguments against it, but that&#x27;s the <i>only</i> place I&#x27;ve seen that explanation of the deplatforming, rather than the failure to moderate when unacceptable content was identified.<p>&gt; in fact you would get the impression that the planning only occurred there.<p>Again, no, I&#x27;ve seen plenty of references to planning elsewhere, social media and otherwise, in the MSM. Again, this is a frequent thing I&#x27;ve seen people with a right-wing media preference attribute without detail to the MSM, but not actually seen in the MSM.')
