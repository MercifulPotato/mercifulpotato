The config file has 93,000 characters in it, which i joked is worse than IRCd. I&#x27;m running it on gentoo, pretty bare system, probably equivalent to double an rpi4. I did notice that the database file grows quickly. Currently the entire machine is using 272MB RAM, 0.8% CPU peaks, 0.01 15 minute load average.<p>Every part of setting up a server that will federate&#x2F;host repeats again and again that you need a TURN server (and they recommend coturn) - which is another 26,000 character config file - in order to do VOIP. If you&#x27;ve ever run or used a pbx before, STUN is needed 100% of the time for nat traversal between clients. Coturn even says it won&#x27;t run if it&#x27;s NAT&#x27;d (it will, but that&#x27;s irrelevant to most people.)<p>This is the fourth concurrent tech trial of chat daemons, with rocket.chat and mattermost being a couple of the other ones that we&#x27;re testing. synapse&#x2F;element&#x2F;matrix has the benefit of forced e2ee by my configuration. I don&#x27;t know of any other matrix federated servers, so i haven&#x27;t tried that yet, but an associate says it works on my configuration - which means it&#x27;s not as big of a pig as i thought it was based on the outlandishly, comically large config file - where whitespace matters!')
