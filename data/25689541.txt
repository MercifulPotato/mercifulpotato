A 37% margin is crazy high and truly exceptional; there are only a handful of businesses that profitable at scale. When you hear a 30%+ margin, think of businesses like Mastercard, that collect a percentage of most transactions that its 1B+ members conduct. Apple also has notoriously high margins for what they do, and theirs are at 18%. Most of the businesses people interact with in their daily life have low or even negative profit margins: Walmart 3%, restaurants ~2%, Uber -35%. All the storefronts are owned by commercial real estate groups (margins usually ~4%), gas stations are ~2%, travel, car dealerships, airlines etc are all very low margin.<p>My personal gut feeling, when I see those very high margins, is that&#x27;s it&#x27;s a clear cut case of capitalism not working right. Occasionally margins are high because of innovation and the position is deserved, but not in most cases. Visa and Mastercard have long been in the top handful of most profitable businesses in the world, making basically all their money on interchange. As a result, if you want to accept payments in America, you&#x27;re eating around 2.5% of the transaction cost right off the bat. You might think okay, but they provide something in return, right? Fraud protection and security and support and all these important things - what would we do without them, without paying that 2.5% tax? Turns out we&#x27;d do fine. The EU capped interchange for debit cards at 0.2% in 2015 and things have worked perfectly fine ever since. Other high margin businesses are clearly not benefitting the world (e.x. Philip Morris.) Patent trolls and Verisign are both fabulously profitable, and they add zero value. And even if you like those businesses, there&#x27;s an even more compelling case for regulating away Elsevier in its entirety.')
