I&#x27;ve never found people care enough to provide negativity or positivity regarding where you&#x27;ve chosen to specialise your education in most cases.<p>&gt;In terms of brexit, any sort of gains for a startup will be possible only if the British government allows them to be<p>Agreed. Lack of access to capital and the lack of tax planning for anyone but the rich holds the UK back compared to the states.\nI don&#x27;t agree with much the current government did, but one sentiment that Cummings expressed that was correct was that when novel tech gets bought over by US giants (eg Deepmind), is a failure on the UK&#x27;s part. They&#x27;re essentially allowing all the future upside to be exported.<p>Not that I blame anyone that accepts a buyout offer, if they didn&#x27;t, then there&#x27;d probably be no upside to capture at all due to lack of risk-taking private funding.')
