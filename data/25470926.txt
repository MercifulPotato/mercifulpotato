It&#x27;s the smoothest-feeling phone I&#x27;ve ever used -- the 90Hz screen makes a huge difference. Tip: go to the developer options and change the animation durations to .5x to make the phone feel blazing fast.<p>Plus a Pixel integrates a lot better with non-Apple operating systems, both MS Windows and GNU&#x2F;Linux. MS&#x27;s &quot;Your Phone&quot; and KDE Connect are both great.')
