Also, suggesting that YC is out to silence you and that nobody actually has a counter argument isn&#x27;t very good for traction, either.<p>Until my website can&#x27;t get taken off by  a $5 rental of an internet-of-shit botnet, Cloudflare gives me and my users recourse against the bad actors of the world. (I also enjoy its host cloaking for my privacy)<p>You simply gloss over bad actors and attack one of the only solutions that works. The biggest threat to the open internet was its naive &quot;there are no bad actors&quot; design, not the people giving us one of the only bulwarks against bad design.<p>I agree with your last sentence that it would be nice to have a better middle ground, but notice that&#x27;s not the &quot;cloudflare bad&quot; thesis of your comment.<p>The internet needs to be improved so that Cloudflare is redundant. It&#x27;s not Cloudflare&#x27;s fault that fundamental design oversights (like optional ISP egress filtering) have created a lucrative niche. And things like faster, unlimited data plans accessible by smart toasters and smart doorbells on top of the internet&#x27;s naive architecture only entrenches Cloudflare further.')
