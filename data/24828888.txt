But there&#x27;s been huge amounts of research both academically and industrially into, for example, how to structure functional programs, how to manage side effects, and working within concurrent&#x2F;distributed&#x2F;asynchronous environments. Saying that nothing new has happened in programming languages since the 1960s because the major paradigms had all been discovered already is like saying nothing new has happened in automotive design since the 1960s because private vehicles still usually have 2 or 4 wheels.')
