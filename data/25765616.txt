Everything revolves around work, and they pretty much become their work. Work is the place where they live. Co-workers, clients, associates, and what not are the majority of people they interact with. Work is what occupies their mind.<p>When they then lose that - either through retirement, unemployment, or what not, it turns ugly. Especially if they&#x27;re also the sole provider (in their household.).<p>My only tips are to create rules for yourself, and try to follow them - as well as finding one or more hobbies. The more passionate you become with some hobbies, the less you only think about work.')
