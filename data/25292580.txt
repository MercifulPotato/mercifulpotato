The big cloud providers are all functionally REALLY similar, if you&#x27;re mostly using the big components:<p>- Object storage is basically identical, often even down to common API wrappers<p>- VMs are VMs<p>- Kubernetes is Kubernetes.  Containers are containers.<p>- EMR is Dataproc is whatever Azure has<p>- BigQuery is Redshift is whatever Azure provides.  It&#x27;s big SQL.  Whatever.<p>Like, I&#x27;m not saying there isn&#x27;t a cost, or it&#x27;s pain-free... but you&#x27;re not re-engineering everything when you migrate.  You&#x27;re finding fiddly difference between platforms, and if you&#x27;re an enterprise, your new cloud provider would LOVE to help you with that migration.')
