We store images in GitLab registry. Also, just because we use apt-get to install python3 doesn&#x27;t mean build isn&#x27;t reproducible. The actual toolchain and sysroot are highly version controlled and python is just used to kick off the build script so it almost doesn&#x27;t really matter which version python is as long as it&#x27;s backwards compatible with the build script.')
