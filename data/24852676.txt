Item(by='ajford', descendants=None, kids=[24852861], score=None, time=1603317418, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24852117, text='Playing devil&#x27;s advocate here, but the service fee (at least to my mind) is more for the maintenance &amp; upkeep of the infra.<p>I&#x27;d gladly move to self-hosting if it was only me. But after a few months, I was able to convince my wife to use it for convenience and security. So if there&#x27;s an issue with the self-hosted version, it wouldn&#x27;t just be me impacted, but my wife. And that&#x27;s an SLA you don&#x27;t wanna break. :D<p>Also, while I know I could probably do a decent job securing the hosting server, I would rather not have that on my mind. That&#x27;s not my day-job, so I&#x27;ll leave it to a team of people who are paid to do that.<p>Lastly, the service fee is $60&#x2F;yr, but for sake of argument, lets call it $100. That&#x27;s 2hrs of my time at my hourly pay. If setting up a self-hosted version takes me more than 2hrs to get it running, it&#x27;s not worth my time.')
