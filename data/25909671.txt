For most sites I use by very far I don&#x27;t see how 72 hours without access would be that problematic. Not logged in to StackOverflow for 3 days? Not a problem. Not logged in to HN for 3 days? Not a problem. Not logged in to Twitter for 3 days? I can live with that. Etc.<p>The question is: how much convenience are you willing to trade for security?')
