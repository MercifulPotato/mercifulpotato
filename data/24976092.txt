I&#x27;m actually really surprised to hear that. NC, and the southeast in general has traditionally been a pretty hard sell for Californians, from a cultural perspective at least. New Yorkers and Floridians have been colonizing the area for ages though, so figures that Californians would catch on eventually. I made the move back to NC after 5 years in Seattle, and don&#x27;t regret it one bit.<p>Anyhow, welcome to the area! The techie &#x2F; startup scene here is pretty small, but it&#x27;s good folk and a tight community.')
