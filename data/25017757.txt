If the polls suggest there is a 2&#x2F;3 probability you are going to win an election, but you lose, does that mean the polls were wrong? What if the probability was 9&#x2F;10?<p>I think the problem is trying to make sense of outliers and uncertainty, and that, in an election with 150M+ variables, you will end up with a result that isn&#x27;t quite what anyone predicted. In other words: it&#x27;s not numeracy, it&#x27;s epistemology.')
