But in that case, should there be a some sort of best-practice approach to authenticating that J. Random Hacker who emailed a question to you, is actually a white-hat—e.g. by validating that they’re registered with the bug-bounty program of your client? Or does it not even matter, and you should just answer even a black-hat hacker’s questions about your APIs, since “vulnerability research is vulnerability research and has a long-term result of hardening the ecosystem either way”, and then let the cards fall where they may?')
