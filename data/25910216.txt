The indoor housing could be unhealthy and vermin filled. It could be an unhealthy environment and den of drug use that the person is trying to avoid.<p>In Vancouver reporting on the homeless that have chosen to live in Strathcona Park (some 200+) a park resident noted that they were offered a spot at a Single Room Occupancy hotel, but he left because there were &quot;crazy people with machetes&quot; running around.<p>It&#x27;s incredible but many of these options for the homeless are so substandard that sleeping outside is a better, healthier and safer option.')
