When I build an application and I choose SPA, I want a framework, not a loose collection of libs.<p>It’s a little like Django vs Flask. Sure Flask has less overhead but if I know what I am doing I can do 4 times as much with a framework like django in the same time, given that I know what it can do for me. Because I don’t spend time (more or less consciously) reinventing the wheel')
