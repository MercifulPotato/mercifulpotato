I believe the Rust docs do use localStorage. The &quot;cookies&quot; settings in Chrome&#x2F;Firefox control all the browser&#x27;s various forms of storage: FF calls it &quot;Cookies and site data&quot;. If you disable it, the site can&#x27;t set cookies <i>or</i> localStorage. (As being able to set localStorage would defeat the point of what the setting is really attempting to control.)<p>&gt; <i>but I don’t know that that’s possible on a per-site basis so it’s an unlikely configuration</i><p>Yeah, if you were using the &quot;Block&quot; settings in &quot;Cookies and site data&quot;, for example, that would disable LS on a per-site basis. (I essentially block-by-default, and have an exception of allowed sites in that FF setting.)<p>(I also have an extension that I wrote to produce a fake, good-for-this-page-load-only localStorage, with two settings: hold the values in RAM, or just &#x2F;dev&#x2F;null them. Most sites do not handle localStorage denying access, and essentially crash, so it&#x27;s handy there, as that works around the poor programming on those sites.)')
