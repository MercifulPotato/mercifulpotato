So, I was entirely wrong and made money anyway. Once I realized I couldn&#x27;t account for what was happening, was totally wrong on the direction, and being offered a token gain to get out, I got out.<p>Someone was <i>bidding up</i> $50 puts expiring in 3.5 weeks and buying contracts today, while the shares were in the mid-300s. That&#x27;s insane implied volatility.')
