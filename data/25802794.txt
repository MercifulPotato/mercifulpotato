Why should we tacitly accept the constraints they deem as appropriate and modify the way we build the web?<p>In other words, those are our domains, our apps, our systems and we&#x27;ll do as we please; that includes worrying about content moderation, or not.<p>When and why did we accept google as the Internet&#x27;s babysitter?<p>Apologies if this sounds aggressive, but your takeaway reflects an appalling and quite fatalistic mindset; one which I sadly believe is increasingly common: big corporations knows best, big corporations say and we do, big corporations lead the way.<p>On the other hand, probably I&#x27;m just biased and tired considering how tiresome it&#x27;s been to explain to my friends and family why Signal is the better alternative after the WhatsApp&#x2F;Facebook fiasco.<p>&#x2F;EndRant')
