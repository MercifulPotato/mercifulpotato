Item(by='throwaway47732', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604777954, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25013193, text='&gt;People who start with &quot;honest question&quot; usually are not being honest.<p>I thought I was in fact very honest about my low opinion of evopsych and evopsych people, and didn&#x27;t try to hide my sentiment behind pretenses of &quot;objectivity&quot;.<p>&gt;All of them as far as I know.<p>I mean, even if you didn&#x27;t bother to google a counterexample (where at least both genders participate in hunting), what do you make of the present article?<p>&gt;It&#x27;s human physiology. Men are built to fight&#x2F;hunt&#x2F;etc. We can swing swords harder, throw spears further, pull bow strings further, run faster, etc.<p>Yep that&#x27;s evopsych &quot;evidence&quot; alright. It sounds reasonable so it must have been this way for millions of years. Genes? Mechanisms? Evidence of genetic selection on behavior (as opposed to plain old drift)? Accounting for the variation that must have existed across all of mankind during these millions of years? Who needs that, it&#x27;s just highly likely. And then evopsych people wonder why they&#x27;re not being taken seriously by actual biologists.<p>&gt;Why create a throwaway for this question? That&#x27;s what I find the most bizarre.<p>I try to abstain from maintaining a persistent online presence so as to retain a modicum of sanity and attention and this reply is a perfect reminder of why I chose to do it in the first place. Have a nice day and enjoy your new president-elect I guess.')
