Yet that&#x27;s not seen as a barrier to provide money.</i><p>Absolutely not. That is ludicrous.<p>There are measurable effects to the pandemic: changes in income, medical expenses, etc. There is certainly an emotional toll for even the best-off people, but no one is proposing paying people for emotional pain. It&#x27;s all about getting them through this exceptional (and temporary) time.<p>Reparations for slavery are about things that can&#x27;t be measured (<i>generations</i> of lost opportunities, not <i>months</i>), immense&#x2F;immeasurable pain, and a long tail of policies (like racist zoning laws) that outlived slavery by 100+ years.<p>Your analogy to the pandemic actually makes it even more stark how difficult it is to calculate something so large, complex, and obscured by the fog of history.<p>&gt; <i>As a collective? Yes.</i><p>OK, let&#x27;s say you do this. Let&#x27;s say you decide the amount that a particular official&#x2F;organized tribe should get is $1T. You don&#x27;t have to decide who gets the money because the tribe has already done all that legwork for you and has an official roll.<p>Now how do you decide who pays? Do you try to trace the heritage of every American and determine when&#x2F;how they took tribal land?<p>Maybe not. So do you just take it out of social programs? The same social programs that are intended to fix some of the cycles of poverty that people descended from slaves are relying on to get them some equity?<p>Well, you can&#x27;t do that either. So how do you decide who pays, and who decides who pays?<p>Eventually you get into the business of punishing or rewarding people for their ancestors&#x27; crimes, which is not at all different from forcing a murderer&#x27;s child to give money to his victim&#x27;s family. If you look at it in a microcosm, it seems completely insane <i>because it is</i>.<p>Your ancestry definitely has a big effect on your life, but that&#x27;s not the same as being culpable for their crimes, and it&#x27;s not deterministic. My family was fantastically wealthy until my dad&#x27;s generation, and then they were poor. Should my dad, as a completely broke 25-year-old, have had to pay reparations to someone for his ancestors&#x27; wealth (which I&#x27;m sure was gained unfairly)?')
