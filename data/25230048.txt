I am not saving anything to Pocket. I do not open more than 10-15 tabs (by all means, I do not _persist_ tabs; the browser should start with a single empty window). For me, this is the only way to keep my sanity. I always want to read less, not more. For me, as an ADHD person, reading something even remotely interesting is a full scale addiction. I don&#x27;t need to enable it more.')
