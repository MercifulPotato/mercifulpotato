However since zlib&#x27;s license is GPL-compatible it&#x27;s just fine to e.g. vendor zlib inside gzip.<p><i>That does not make it gzip code</i>, the zlib code is not relicensed and it keeps its original license.<p>Furthermore, both gzip and DrMario64 having merged in zlib&#x27;s code does not give gzip any claim upon DrMario64.')
