It simply isn&#x27;t a line item itself.  It also needs to be weighed with other health considerations.  For example, the essential worker approach reduces the number of infections and we should all know by now that COVID shouldn&#x27;t be judged in a purely binary way with deaths versus recoveries.<p>Also I am not putting a value judgement on these approaches.  I am explaining the way I interpret the judging criteria.')
