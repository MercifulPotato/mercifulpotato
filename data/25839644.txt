I rarely hear car alarms in Helsinki, the capital of Finland. I have never noticed that any slight bumps or vibrations would set car alarms off. I have even scratched a few cars in the parking lot with my own car back in the days when I had just gotten my license, and still no alarms.<p>Car theft is relatively rare here too.')
