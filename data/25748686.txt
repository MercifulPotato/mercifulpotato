Also I create notes where I keep track what I do, so I can present that in the daily meetings.<p>But usually, especially if it&#x27;s complex, I enjoy the clean state. If it&#x27;s too difficult to pick up later, then I ask myself: did I really automatize the things that should be automatized e.g. with a script or makefile? Is my project&#x2F;code navigatable?')
