Given that the Discord &quot;app&quot; is just Electron, it&#x27;ll get in a fight with the poor thermal design of my laptop in exactly the same way on the website does.<p>This being said, it&#x27;s very difficult for me to argue loudly against the position they&#x27;re, because it&#x27;s complicated.<p>Discord has scaled to the point where &quot;13 year old skiddies who like pulling legs off spiders will use any alternate clients they find [which don&#x27;t include anti-spam protection] to send a {server,reputation}-destroying level of spam&quot; is having a more measurable impact than &quot;we need to maintain equality of access&quot;. I suspect that extremely strong management vision+competence would be necessary to prioritize this - as things stand right now, it&#x27;s incredibly easy to deprioritize because the vast majority of people using Discord either have minimally-viably decent machines appropriate for playing games or completing actual day jobs.')
