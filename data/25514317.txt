He can this tell his cofounder to pound sand and his cofounder will have to  realize that his options are 40% or 0%. If he believes the company has a bright future, he’ll take the deal. There’s a very real chance OP gets much more than 3% or 6%.<p>Or there’s something better that I can’t think of because I’m not a lawyer who deals in this and don’t know the specifics.<p>It’s just bad to give really any advice here, which is part OP’s fault really because he should not be asking a lawyer rather than Internet randos.')
