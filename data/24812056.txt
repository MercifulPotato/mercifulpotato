Using tech as an example, often I&#x27;ve found that the only difference is currency conversion and sales tax. Take the PS5 for example, it&#x27;s advertised at $499 or £449. £449 is ~$580, but in the post-brexit years, it could be anywhere between $540 and $630. That number is also the actual price you pay, including sales taxes. If you&#x27;re in the US, you would pay anywhere between 4% and 13.5% on top, so somewhere between $518 and $566.')
