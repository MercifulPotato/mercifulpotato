You probably took one of the Raven&#x27;s matrices, which are a culture-blind test of g (the presumed construct underlying IQ).<p>Essentially, each new test is normed against the previous tests, so the Stanford-Binet test would have been the first, and then when a new measure is developed, we&#x27;d administer both tests to a sample (hopefully many samples) and use the correlation between the tests to determine whether or not or new test worked.<p>It&#x27;s not really a great method, but it&#x27;s the best we&#x27;ve got for most individual difference variables.')
