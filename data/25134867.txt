At none of those could I have charged from the house with a cable, as they either had off-street parking, or I was in an upper storey flat, or there was no parking available at all, etc.<p>I think that kind of dismissive comment is entirely the problem here. You do realise that the entire electrical substation infrastructure needs substantial upgrading for it to even be possible? And that&#x27;s not an easy problem? And that every single residential street in all of the UK needs to be dug up and have chargers installed? In 9 years&#x27; time (or maybe 19 if we say 10 years lifetime of 2nd hand cars)?<p>The whole issue is the govt acts as if all they need to do is ban petrol cars + our CO2 issues are solved, and do not address these serious practical issues.<p>Also on a personal note - this comment came across as somewhat snide and ridiculing, I respectfully refer you to the HN guidelines:<p>&quot;Be kind. Don&#x27;t be snarky. Have curious conversation; don&#x27;t cross-examine. Please don&#x27;t fulminate. Please don&#x27;t sneer, including at the rest of the community.&quot;<p>By all means, disagree with me but you could have made this comment less unkindly.')
