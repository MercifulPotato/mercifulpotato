Item(by='ehmmmmmmmm', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605131385, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25063016, text='Yes.\nA while ago when I was single I tried using online dating apps for a while but ultimately I met someone in real life and it&#x27;s going well. Previous relationships were also people I met in real life. Don&#x27;t get discouraged if online dating doesn&#x27;t work for you either. It didn&#x27;t work for me. I know it&#x27;s hard during COVID, but work on yourself in the meantime, and COVID will be over sooner or later.<p>Online dating just never worked for me, for the same reasons you describe. I think part of it is a combination of paradox of choice and part of it is people just not having faith in technology finding them something human. I went on dates where the other person sooner or later doubted the possibility of marrying someone they met online, and it usually degenerated from there into either friendship or nothing.<p>There&#x27;s also the weird social expectation on many apps that males should message first, which results in females getting spammed, which then further results in females not messaging first, and the cycle perpetuates.<p>As a technology lover I really want online dating to work in bringing more compatible people together and increase overall societal happiness by increasing the average quality of marriage, but time and time again it seems to me that the best way to bring compatible people together is with offline events. Compatible people tend to want to go to similar places and do similar things, and any successful online dating app really should exploit that fact.<p>In fact, the most successful organizations I have seen at bringing together singles into stable marriages were not even explicitly about dating. I&#x27;ve seen far more stable couples form at mixed-gender sports teams, hiking groups, volunteer organizations, conference organizing teams, and other professional organizations where participants largely cared about the same causes.')
