When TSMC was founded, their business model was nuts from a Western perspective: why would a company produce chips for someone else, the money is in the <i>design</i> and the <i>brand</i>, not the manufacturing.  The market for this started when companies like Intel and TI wanted to derive some profits from unused manufacturing capacity.<p>The zeitgeist of American business over the past 40 or so years has been that brand is what people buy.  Manufacturing is expensive, low-margin, and is best outsourced.  Thus, there&#x27;s been a slow, steady march towards design here, build somewhere else.  Not just in the silicon space, but in everything from food processing to plastic tchotchkes.<p>That is a perfectly valid model, if there is a lot of competition in the manufacturing space.  But now TSMC is so far ahead of the competition, and nobody expected that.  Sometimes being the contrarian is where the profits are.')
