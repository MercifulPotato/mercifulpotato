Item(by='Hippasus', descendants=None, kids=[25040916], score=None, time=1604961478, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25039730, text='&gt; I&#x27;ve been trying to find a &quot;proper&quot; connection between audible sound and visible shape, a connection that would not only preserve all the information, but would also properly visualize the &quot;symmetry&quot; in sound, so that messy sound would turn into messy images and harmonic sound would turn into visually appealing images.<p>It is very exciting to come across others who are also interested in this topic. I am also very interested in the shape of sound but I have spent less time on empirical observations and more on imagining an abstract logic of numbers which can be visualized and heard. Real sound visualizations are also interesting to me but I decided to focus on abstract ideals because I thought it would be appropriate for a video game.<p>Hope you don&#x27;t mind me sending some emails.')
