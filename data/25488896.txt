I&#x27;m living in Germany, but not in one of the larger cities where employers tend to pay more (Hamburg, Berlin, Munich, Frankfurt). So I also checked out remote opportunities. I noticed also that for Ruby&#x2F;Rails developers there were some high-paying jobs available. Since that&#x27;s not my specialty I didn&#x27;t pursue them though.<p>Living in a major city will offer you more opportunities though and also allows job hopping which is the best way to upgrade your salary anyway.')
