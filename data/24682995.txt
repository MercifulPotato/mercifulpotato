Item(by='overton', descendants=None, kids=[24683835], score=None, time=1601853122, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24670966, text='As someone who is also on the border between &quot;good mentally ill&quot; and &quot;bad mentally ill,&quot; this is a really accurate portrayal of what it&#x27;s like.  The feeling that you&#x27;re holding it together now, just barely doing the right things and making yourself seem normal enough, but that in the past you couldn&#x27;t and the fear that in the future you won&#x27;t be able to.  I can&#x27;t understate how much economic worry there is.  Even for a software developer who is now doing pretty well financially, I can&#x27;t help but wonder if I&#x27;ll slip into another crushing depression where my brain works at 1&#x2F;3 the speed and clarity and I can barely make it through a work day before collapsing on the couch.  To anybody who sincerely wants to help, you can help by supporting strong social safety nets so that people don&#x27;t have to shoulder the anxiety of being out on the street in addition to whatever else they&#x27;re going through, and can also access affordable therapy.  You can also support flexible or shorter work weeks.<p>Edit:<p>I would estimate that at least for me personally, at least half of the disease burden has been from second-order effects -- from economic anxiety, anxiety about stigma, and working through illness at an unsustainable pace.')
