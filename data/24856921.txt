Our system now reaches 5.0%.<p>I’m surprised that the human error rate is that high; is this the error rate from native to second language, or from second language to native? And what is the average second language skill level of the translators?<p>(My translation accuracy feels like it would be about 50-75% of words in freeform outdoors conversation at normal speed, but because of this I wouldn’t even consider a course taught in German at this time).')
