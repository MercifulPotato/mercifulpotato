Item(by='ncallaway', descendants=None, kids=[25751597], score=None, time=1610466357, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25742578, text='&gt; Do you realize that anyone can claim “incitement” of violence since it’s completely subjective and therefore probably very dangerous thing to be using as a way to determine “guilt”.<p>That&#x27;s false. The standards for incitement according to the SCOTUS are defined in the Brandenburg Test and are _famously_ narrow. They include a subjective test of the speaker&#x27;s intent, and an objective test.<p>- Subjective: Speech is &quot;directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action&quot; (this means, was the speaker intending to produce imminent lawless action).<p>- Objective: Speech is &quot;likely to incite or produce such action&quot;<p>In an incitement case here, the objective test is absolutely easy. The crowd broken into the halls of the Capitol, violently disrupted a session of Congress, and killed a police officer. Any lawyer would have no problem arguing in court that the speech that morning was &quot;likely&quot; to incite imminent lawless action.<p>The harder test is the subjective test of the speaker&#x27;s intent. Here, we need to show that Donald Trump intended to incite imminent lawless action. That&#x27;s typically a very hard test, because we can&#x27;t read minds. But we can use circumstantial† evidence to piece together enough of a picture to allow a jury to convict.<p>† circumstantial evidence is used <i>all</i> the time to determine intent for crimes in courtrooms all over the United States, and is completely valid evidence. Don&#x27;t raise &quot;but that&#x27;s circumstantial!&quot; as a defense, because circumstantial evidence is completely valid.')
