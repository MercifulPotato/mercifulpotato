There are several versions now, the one I have is titled &quot;Style: The Basics of Clarity and Grace&quot;.<p>I chose it over White&#x27;s book because of this passage from <i>Clear and Simple as the Truth</i>:<p>&gt; <i>The best-known teachers of practical style are Strunk and White, in their ubiquitous Elements of Style. The best teachers of practical style are Joseph Williams and Gregory Colomb, in Williams’s Style: Toward Clarity and Grace and a series of academic articles and technical reports.</i>\n<i>Williams and Colomb present an incomparably deeper and more orderly treatment of practical style. The style they present is consistent and mature; it makes decisions about all the major questions that define a style, and is fully developed.</i><p>I almost can’t overstate how much it’s changed how I read and write. Before that book, some writing just felt “clear” and other writing didn’t, but I couldn’t explain why. Now it’s much easier to see how that sense of clarity is created. Even though I don&#x27;t write for a living and  mainly do technical write ups, it was easily worth the time investment.<p>This video is also good. It has a ton of interesting points, but the part about creating instability in your writing I found particularly useful.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=vtIzMaLkCaM&amp;ab_channel=UChicagoSocialSciences" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=vtIzMaLkCaM&amp;ab_channel=UChic...</a>')
