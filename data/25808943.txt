He isn&#x27;t a software engineer.<p>It&#x27;s astounding to me that anyone considers Musk&#x27;s opinion about software as having any value.<p>To help stave off the inevitable downvotes you idiots are sure to give me, I&#x27;ll also address the point itself.<p>Most mobile devices do not gain a routable public IP address, so some third party server is required to establish a connection between users of a mobile service.<p>I agree that allowing anyone to run such servers provides more redundancy, but then they would not have control of their own service. Most creators of software want to remain in control of their baby so to speak.<p>The main reason services go down is not because of lack of computation power but lack of ability to have so many simultaneous network connections.<p>I think Musk is wrong that the problem is &quot;the servers are doing too much&quot;.')
