Lo and behold, 00000 shows up once. So does 11111. What are the odds of each of those happening? It&#x27;s 1:100,000!<p>Absolutely astonishing.<p>As an aside, the inevitability of weird flukes in large sample sizes really sinks in if you&#x27;ve ever wasted part of a year multi-tabling online poker. You&#x27;ll see some hands play out in totally WTF fashion, as 1:100 and 1:1,000 probabilities come good.<p>The lesson, of course, is that when you play thousands of hands, encountering such oddities with your money at stake is no longer nearly impossible. It&#x27;s moved into the zone of nearly certain.')
