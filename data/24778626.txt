They would watch it, and so on. Someone made a decision to pull the plug.<p>Similarly, I have never seen anything other than gushing reviews and can’t-wait expectations of the Cadillac Ciel since the 2011 pebble beach show, but then the company never produced it, instead creating some sort of coupe. The Ciel was only ever seen in that Entourage movie.<p>The phenomenon of not listening to the fan base is real. But here is my question...<p>WE ARE IN THE AGE OF DECENTRALIZATION AND DEMOCRATIC GOVERNANCE. Why not have a platform where people raise money for shows, and whatever budget that is, the show makes episodes for it? Like Patreon meets kickstarter, or Patreon with a loan component for future shows.<p>That way, the only way a show would get canceled is if it went bankrupt and was unable to pay its loans from its Patreon-like revenues.<p>More generally, some company has the infrastructure (which is centralized for now, like Netflix) and we have to rely on it being magnanimous enough to let the public have a say. Teams to create shows come together as gigs anyway. We explored using such business models for software back in 2016:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;qbix.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2016&#x2F;11&#x2F;17&#x2F;properly-valuing-contributions&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;qbix.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2016&#x2F;11&#x2F;17&#x2F;properly-valuing-contributi...</a><p>But today, can’t you just use the Web multicasting for publishing&#x2F;streaming the end result, or hosting it on some networks as a commodity hosting, and then production of the show would be funded using cryptocurrency?<p>How expensive would it be to acquire rights to a Netflix show that was canceled? Why would they not simply give it away for some equity in the new crowdfunded show? It would be like IPOing a show after piloting the first couple seasons. It would become a business model.<p>Why would this not work to bring back fan favorite shows, and create communities around them too? Why do we NEED centralized stuff like Netflix AT ALL?')
