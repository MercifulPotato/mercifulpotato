(Go panics are extremely close to exceptions: the only difference is they can only be caught at function boundaries instead of scope boundaries.)<p>The main difference is cultural: you&#x27;re encouraged to use return codes for expected error conditions and only panic for program bugs. But there&#x27;s the temptation to not do that because panic(&#x2F;exceptions) are more ergonomic.<p>I think exceptions tend to be OK in areas where you don&#x27;t really care about handling errors: eg command-line tools, GUIs. But for long-lived proccesses, like servers, where it&#x27;s important to handle errors in a precise way, they are painful, in my experience.')
