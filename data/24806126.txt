So I&#x27;ll do the same: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tinyurl.com&#x2F;y4d7rx6f" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tinyurl.com&#x2F;y4d7rx6f</a><p>Typically I clone that into my home directory. Then I link everything to it with:<p>ln -s ~&#x2F;vim&#x2F;.vimrc  ~&#x2F;.vimrc &amp;&amp; ln -s ~&#x2F;vim ~&#x2F;.vim<p>The .vimrc is kind of documented, but a quick version is:<p>tt: select a file name to open into a new buffer<p>fr and fR: go forward or backward through buffers (open files)<p>fd: close buffer<p>f2: if the needed commands are installed, reformat code<p>There&#x27;s a few other remappings, but those are the most frequent ones I use, hence making it easier.<p>&lt;tab&gt; completion works everywhere as well. There&#x27;s a bunch of other stuff for navigating windows and tabs, but once I realized that &quot;buffers&quot; are actually the &quot;vim way&quot; of file navigation, I stopped using those short cuts.<p>Edit: Yes I realize this is probably what the article is complaining about, but oh well.')
