Most prominent symptoms were severe brain fog and lack of attention (to the point where I could not perform basic tasks like reading multiple sentences), problems with balance, and loss of appetite. Secondary problems included irregular heartbeat, wildly varying sensations of body temperature (without necessarily having a fever), sensitivity to light and sound, and several others. Onset was very fast (a couple days) and recovery was very slow (gradual improvement for 6+ weeks). I can’t say for certain if I ever bounced back 100% mentally, but I think I’m probably pretty close. It was definitely one of the worst things I’ve been through.')
