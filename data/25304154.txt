Done.<p>I run a website. First party analytics are useful because they let me know what people are clicking on, which lets me know what features people find useful. But no one else needs to see my analytics. I don&#x27;t want some third party to figure out that people are clicking on X or Y and build up some kind of profile of my users. More to the point, even if I could get paid for selling that kind of data, it should be illegal for me to do so, because it harms my users without their knowing.')
