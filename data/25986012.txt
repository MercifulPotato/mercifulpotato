They could easily trigger it by a crowdsourced agreement to liquidate 401k&#x27;s and all stock holdings.<p>If we see any govt agency step in, I&#x27;d imagine them trying to pity sell us on lost teacher pensions, etc being managed by the hedge funds...but they&#x27;ll leave out the part that says those teacher pensions have been financially weaponized against average investors for years.')
