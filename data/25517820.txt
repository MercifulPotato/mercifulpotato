I disagree. The Chinese government during the Cultural Revolution destroyed nearly the entirety of Chinese historical objects. What was saved by unofficial groups or individuals became Chinese history. I&#x27;m just glad the Jacobins are not totally in charge in France, as they would think it better to just melt the finds into useful metal.')
