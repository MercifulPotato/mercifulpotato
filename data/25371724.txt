People didn&#x27;t have access to clean water for basic hygiene, cleaning and drinking.<p>You might think &quot;what&#x27;s so bad about that? They can just buy bottled water, or install a storage tank?&quot;<p>Well, this is a public health concern.<p>The big reason why diseases raged so easily in the past in the Western world - and still is in the rest of the world - was&#x2F;is the lack of public access to clean water. Diseases such as Cholera are directly attributed to poor sanitation and lack of clean water.<p>Privatizing water sounds good in theory, but if the price of drinking water increases to prohibitive levels for less fortunate groups in society, you will also see an uptick in public health crises. The associated costs are - once again - deferred to the public (e.g. healthcare costs)')
