How much in-fighting is there at google that they couldn&#x27;t just port over the data?<p>Right now I&#x27;m pissed that Google tv doesn&#x27;t have a working account switcher.  If my wife watches music videos it retrains my YouTube music.<p>Also, youtube music sucks when it comes to spotty connections and file management.  I have fiber at work and home, unmetered 4g, and 100gig free space on my phone.  Why doesn&#x27;t it just download everything?  I loose service for hours on end and I come to find that it has either not saved any songs or it has deleted everything it can.  Today I started an album and then hit a dead spot, and it had deleted all the songs before the track I was on, and not qeued up the rest of the album.  Google music had a setting where you could tell it to allocate gigs of space and keep it full.
