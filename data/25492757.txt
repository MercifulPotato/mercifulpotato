So you would have a lot of people believing that they&#x27;re allergic to the gluten in pasta, when almost none of them really are, and also ignoring that plenty of British food contains gluten as well.<p>It would be pretty hard to argue that as racism unless you&#x27;re using a definition of racism not characteristically used in America, but you can still imagine the same thing happening in the same way. So what does that tell you?')
