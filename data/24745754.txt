That the resulting venison goes to homeless shelters seems not to move these weepers over Bambi; presumably, in their coldly rational utilitarian calculus, the life of a deer exceeds in value that of a human, at least once the human&#x27;s circumstances have been far enough reduced.<p>Yes, I&#x27;m making fun, a little. I think that&#x27;s fair in this instance. Someone who has taken the time and thought to identify utilitarianism as a philosophy on which to base consequential decisions has I think no excuse for not having likewise studied ecology, and the modern history of the human role in ecosystems, to at least the minimal extent required to recognize that ecology is <i>really complicated</i> and humans don&#x27;t understand it nearly so well as we like to think we do. When we behave as if we did, we break things that very often can&#x27;t be fixed.')
