Item(by='blisterpeanuts', descendants=None, kids=[25101197], score=None, time=1605447497, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25097145, text='There&#x27;s a lot of mistaken assumptions and misinformation here about Parler; it looks like most of the commenters haven&#x27;t actually used it, or have only given it a cursory glance. To wit:<p>1. Parler is actively recruiting liberals and moderates, to build a &quot;big tent&quot; of diverse opinions and perspectives.<p>2. The moderation guidelines are quite explicit: don&#x27;t censor anyone for expressing a political opinion of any sort. Don&#x27;t censor people you disagree with.  Do moderate extremely toxic content -- but it has to be pretty clear, like &quot;I&#x27;m going to kill you&quot; or a stream of expletives with zero redeeming content. Or spam, or nonsensical posts.<p>3. The parleys (their version of tweets) are largely sociopolitical commentary of the type that&#x27;s being downvoted or censored on the major platforms like Twitter and Facebook. For example, you can post freely about hydroxychloroquine as an effective treatment for covid19. You can say &quot;The 2020 Election was stoken&quot;. Pretty much all of the &quot;3rd rail&quot; topics that have been restricted elsewhere. You can link to an article by Alex Jones or Q. Their attitude seems to be, read and decide for yourself.<p>4. Competition is a good thing. A lot of people here have a reflexive notion that &quot;fringe&quot; sites like Parler and Gab will just create more echo chambers to keep &quot;those people&quot; ignorant.  Nothing could be farther from the truth. Giving people a free speech platform is a breath of fresh air, a return to a broader and more civil discourse. Censorship does not encourage civility; it does not foster broadminded attitudes. On the contrary, it causes more extremism.')
