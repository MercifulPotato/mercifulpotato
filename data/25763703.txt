Item(by='kitsunesoba', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610553626, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25762332, text='&gt; Developers can switch to a different platform, but the problem is that their customers won&#x27;t switch. The customers for boutique indie apps simply do not exist on Linux. And they don&#x27;t exist on Windows to the extent that they exist on the Mac. The Mac has always been by far the best platform to find customers for boutique indie apps, long before Mac code signing existed, and that equation hasn&#x27;t changed even though Apple is now getting worse and locking down the Mac.<p>I would also argue that even despite restrictions, spotty docs, and bugs, macOS is still one of the strongest platforms for creating polished boutique apps. The toolkits available elsewhere have technical advantages (like being cross platform), but getting the little details right is so much more difficult with them that meeting the same bar of quality is a much taller order. I think a dev wanting to accomplish something similar in a cross-platform manner is going to have to do something similar to what the Sublime guys have done with developing their own in-house toolkit.')
