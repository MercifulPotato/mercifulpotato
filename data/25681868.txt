Until they fix their serious housing issues with homeless &#x2F; mentally-ill people camping on sidewalks and creating a hostile environment around the downtown core, it will never attract people to walk or bike.<p>I lived around SoMa for a decade and I HATE cars with a passion but slowly found myself walking and biking less and less as the years passed. I hated having to constantly scan my surroundings so I don&#x27;t get mugged &#x2F; attacked, random ill people screaming or spitting at me and having my locked bike stolen.<p>The best part about living in European cities was how safe it was to walk or bike to critical places.')
