Not sure about specificity. But home tests will likely only be sensitive enough to catch most but not all of those who are actively shedding enough virus to be contagious. If we can get the tests deployed widely enough and have everyone tested on a daily basis then even if the tests aren&#x27;t very good we can get the virus under control quite quickly.')
