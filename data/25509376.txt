You&#x27;ll never stop piracy. But laws can reduce it. And some probably-impossible-to-know portion of that reduction will pay for the legal option. 99% of people will never download qBitTorrent. It&#x27;s a small portion that will even get PopcornTime. It&#x27;s easy to get disconnected as more technically-inclined people, but you have to remember that most people that pirate things just Google &quot;stream avengers endgame free&quot; and click through the links until they find a site that works. If that gets too hard, plenty will just give up and buy the DVD or whatever.')
