If we accept that aliens are capable of travelling vast distances to be able to visit the planet then they&#x27;re capable of technology significantly advanced from where Humanity currently is. With &#x27;magic&#x27; levels of technology, the ability to disrupt a CCD sensor doesn&#x27;t seem beyond the pale.<p>(I don&#x27;t think I actually believe aliens are here and walking amongst us, but I&#x27;m not sure I can see a lack of evidence as being evidence of them not being here either).')
