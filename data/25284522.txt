They&#x27;re the worst of the lot.<p>Apple is destroying the notion of computing freedom by locking up all their computing devices. You shouldn&#x27;t be able to sell a computer or phone and prohibit what runs on it. These aren&#x27;t game consoles sold at a loss with tons of competition - these are the gateways to digital lives and international business.<p>And what the hell business do any of these three companies have doing movie&#x2F;tv production? (Four companies, if you count Amazon.) They wouldn&#x27;t even allow studios to own theaters, and yet we allow these four monopolies to own <i>payments infrastructure</i>, <i>communication</i>, <i>entertainment</i>, <i>devices</i>.<p><i>What the fuck?</i> Are we just going to let them soak up the entire economy?<p>It&#x27;s absurd and it has to stop.<p>Break up all four. Microsoft is doing better than ever post-DOJ, and the intervention led to Apple, Google, and Facebook ascendency. (Microsoft had to pay Apple!) The intervention created wealth and opportunity. It required Microsoft to innovate more - and look where they are now!<p>Make Apple pay Epic and all the companies it hurts on the App Store. Don&#x27;t let them have a say what you can and can&#x27;t run on your device, how you install software, or how you make repairs or upgrades. And don&#x27;t let them limit which browsers you can install, either!<p>Tell Google they can&#x27;t do Chrome and AMP anymore, and threaten to pull AdSense into a separate company.<p>Make Facebook open up its chat protocol and provide rich data export and interoperability tools.<p>Split Amazon and AWS. Make them stop bundling services and selling their own products. Fine them for fakes.<p>My absolute dream would be for the DOJ to make Google and Apple <i>collaborate</i> on a cross-platform native app API and treat it as a first class citizen. Doubly so if web&#x2F;WASM can make those API calls. Visiting Netflix.com should give me first-class native streaming, casting, and screen sharing.<p><i>Technology belongs to us, not the giants.</i><p>Edit: Apple enablers downvoting. Y&#x27;all need to rethink what&#x27;s going on and have a serious change of heart. I&#x27;m not a heretic calling for more freedom and you&#x27;re not in a puritanical sect defending a blameless entity. This company has trillions of dollars and they don&#x27;t need you to defend them. You don&#x27;t need this company to protect you and everyone else - don&#x27;t blindly trust them while they erode the world around us.')
