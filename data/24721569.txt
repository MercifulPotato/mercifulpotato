I see gaming media go nuts over CPU and GPU releases. There&#x27;s excitement and detailed analysis of motherboards. I&#x27;ve seen in depth content on storage, and there&#x27;s been a lot of hype over the PS5&#x27;s new storage architecture. RAM gets attention.

There are endless buying guides for peripherals such as mice, keyboards, and headsets.<p>I don&#x27;t tend to see much content on networking, nor anything approaching the excitement I&#x27;ve seen for any of the categories above.<p>These observations do not diminish the importance of the network in online gaming.
