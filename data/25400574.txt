If you don&#x27;t believe weaponized misinformation is dangerous, look at the regimes it&#x27;s toppled. And if you think the &quot;American spirit,&quot; or somesuch nonsense, makes us immune, I hope we won&#x27;t have to find out.<p>I don&#x27;t see anyone here arguing those points, so I think this is a bit of a strawman.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s not about banning disagreement. It&#x27;s not even about opinions. It&#x27;s about combating weaponized misinformation.<p>The argument, as I see it, is that &quot;weaponized misinformation&quot; and &quot;disagreement&quot; are not cleanly separable categories, and than anyone with the power to ban the former will almost certainly use it to ban the latter.')
