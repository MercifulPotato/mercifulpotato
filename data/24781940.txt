It&#x27;s also useful for keeping certain kinds of important information, which is then easily accessible anywhere via webmail.<p>By keeping the items in draft form, and not actually sending them to myself, I can edit them as much as I want, replacing their content and attachments, without any clumsy re-send workflow.<p>I&#x27;m already logging into e-mail, so using <i>that</i> is simpler than using e-mail, plus some other, separate, online service. On-line storage services have complicated UI, that support sharing workflows and whatnot that are completely irrelevant to this use case.<p>I run the mail server myself, so the data &quot;stays at home&quot;. It&#x27;s on RAID and backed up more regularly than some of my other storage locations, which is a good reason to park certain information there.')
