Item(by='scottlamb', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604263386, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24960326, text='Typically cameras just output the H.264&#x2F;H.265 stream(s) via rtsp, and optionally a video analytics metadata stream. The part that records video from one or more cameras can be separate and is called a network video recorder (NVR). This split allows you to store several cameras&#x27; stuff in one place that is better physically protected and in a better form factor for having a hard drive, access a bunch of cameras&#x27; data easily under one UI even if they&#x27;re made by different manufacturers, etc.<p>I&#x27;m working on an open-source NVR: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;scottlamb&#x2F;moonfire-nvr" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;scottlamb&#x2F;moonfire-nvr</a> that is secure, will run on a Raspberry Pi 4, and has a good recording schema. I wouldn&#x27;t describe the UI as nice yet, but I&#x27;d welcome help in making it so!<p>There are some other open source NVRs (I see someone mentioned Shinobi). Probably a couple reasonably-priced commercial software options (people like Blue Iris, but it&#x27;s Windows-only). Some commercial NAS devices have NVR support (eg Synology). Dedicated NVRs from manufacturers like Dahua&#x2F;Hikvision (but my experience is they&#x27;re awful). YMMV.')
