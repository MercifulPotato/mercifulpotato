What used to be two years will be lengthen closer to three.<p>&gt;I&#x27;m curious how it compares when you look at 7nm introduction price per transistor vs todays price per transistor. And if you get the same ramp with the 5nm node what that would mean.<p>First Gen N7 being ~10K+ per wafer while N5 being around ~13K with <i>higher</i> yield compare to N7 in the same stage. So N5 should still be cheaper.')
