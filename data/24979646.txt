At typical self-employed scale, fiddling around with avoiding taxes is a waste of time (and money)<p>To the nearest percentage approximation, 100% of self-employed and small businesses do exactly this at a basic level, and it&#x27;s low effort.  There&#x27;s an entire support industry to keep it simple.<p>Tax efficiency, which is the polite name for avoiding taxes, which is perfectly legal and encouraged, is literally taught as one of the first things in small business courses, somewhere after book-keeping and giving the books to your accountant.<p>It means you ask your accountant what expenses to write down, they tell you, then later they look at your books and say &quot;did you know if you do these other little things like this, altogether you can save another thousand?&quot; and you go, wow, I didn&#x27;t think of those, I guess you are worth the fee after all.<p>Roughly 100% of self-employed and small businesses do this, in any place where it&#x27;s common to use an accountant.')
