In France for instance, we have this notion of &quot;copie priv√©e&quot; (private copy), that says we are allowed to copy anything as long as we don&#x27;t distribute it back. We even pay taxes on persistent memory for the privilege.<p>Up thread there&#x27;s also a citation of the Betamax case, which says that it&#x27;s okay for people to record shows so they can watch them later, and it&#x27;s okay to sell video recording devices.<p>This is different from Bittorent, which automatically distribute any content you download. With this too, when you are downloading, you are also distributing, which is a much clearer case of infringement in most jurisdictions.')
