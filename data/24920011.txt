Switching isn&#x27;t free, but the knowledge gained on the &quot;wrong&quot; path will be valuable on its own, so it&#x27;s not that big a deal.<p>Similarly, if you decide to go with C++ now, it&#x27;s not a commitment if you later read about an awesome Rust DSP library or something.<p>It only becomes a commitment once you start writing real, production code in it.<p>It is also perfectly sensible to just set aside a week&#x27;s spare time for each language and give them a try. You&#x27;ll learn more real stuff from that than any amount of questions asked online about which is better.')
