At subrecreational, subanesthetic doses, it can make you feel really fucking weird. It&#x27;s not bad, and it&#x27;s certainly survivable given that you&#x27;re dissociated from it â€” but it makes me feel really weird.<p>As to monoideism&#x27;s question: I&#x27;m not a doctor, but ketamine is more benign than many other anesthetics especially at the lower doses used in treating depression. Do your homework, but don&#x27;t rule it out based upon prior experiences with other anesthetics.')
