Item(by='umvi', descendants=None, kids=[25146046], score=None, time=1605743514, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25143643, text='&gt; I think where we disagree is in characterizing making inclusive language changes as &quot;political&quot; and keeping the status quo as &quot;non-political&quot;, when the status quo is demonstrably not working for a lot of people<p>Sure, your perspective is valid too, I just tend to lean the other way. I tend to believe that it is impossible to please everyone and that we should not strive to unless it has clear, demonstrable value.<p>&gt; we can&#x27;t even get low-effort token gestures like that to happen without a lot of outcry I&#x27;m not optimistic about any kind of substantive change.<p>Well, I think part of the reason for outcry in this particular case is that it is (again, IMHO) <i>not</i> a &quot;low-effort token gesture&quot;. I mean, if you look at the patch being submitted in the email linked at the top of the thread to make main the new default:<p>&gt; 351 files changed, 3903 insertions(+), 3890 deletions(-)<p>and for me personally it means that all my future git repos are going to have a different default branch than my past repos which breaks some of my utility scripts. And if I configure the default branch of my future repos to remain &quot;master&quot; to avoid this then some people might take offense and see it as a dogwhistle.<p>So to me this whole thing seems like a big charade, but maybe the silver lining is that Git really should have been designed from the start to easily take arbitrary default branch names, and this patch will enable that.')
