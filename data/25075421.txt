About 15% of their population is over 65. I&#x27;m not sure what the population base rate is for underlying conditions, though.<p>&gt; Also, what about the high risk people? Do we just throw them under the bus?<p>No. We quarantine just them to keep them safe, and give them all free grocery delivery, etc. too.<p>&gt; Also, what about spreading a new virus to billions of hosts and praying for no mutations?<p>I agree that&#x27;s bad.
