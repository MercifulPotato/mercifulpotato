You are correct that I would disagree with you on that, and place both as necessities.  Sick days are necessary for short-term physical and mental health.  Vacation days are necessary for long-term mental health.<p>If you missed weeks of work from an illness, those weeks aren&#x27;t time where you could see family, see the world, relax, and be human.
