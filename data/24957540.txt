And these “ligatures” aren’t really true ligatures in the sense of, say, the “fi” ligature in some fonts; they are glyphs that are close to being fully fledged letters, as, say, ö, which is an accented (umlautened) letter in Germany is a fully-fledged letter in Swedish, or how W became a freestanding letter in English.')
