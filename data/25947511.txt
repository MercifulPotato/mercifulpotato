In previous years, the brokerage dealing directly to the clients was fraught with problems: conflict of interest between the brokerage and their clients because the brokerage holds offsetting client positions, and the market risk held by the brokerage.<p>Auditing &quot;best execution&quot; is pretty straight-forward for a brokerage and regulators (really anyone with the data).   If Brokerages are &quot;cheating&quot; and dealing against their clients best interests, then that&#x27;s exactly the role of regulators.')
