All of it.<p>It encourages micro-management. It encourages more and more process. It is the enemy of getting better at the DORA metrics, which requires streamlining process.<p>tickets in JIRA are not the work itself, never was and never will be, it is a LARP of the work, but it gets taken for the central thing. This is an illusion.  Fixing a bug without filing a JIRA ticket is in itself progress. Moving a JIRA card without any other change is not. Yet the second is what&#x27;s visible and therefor what&#x27;s rewarded.<p>Any problem gets solved with &quot;more JIRA &quot; which stops working when the remaining problems are caused by too much JIRA. And yet they keep trying, because it gives &quot;control&quot;. JIRA is a like metastatic tumour that will grow until it kills the host.<p>In case the cancer metaphor didn&#x27;t make it very clear, I don&#x27;t like JIRA much. Yet if JIRA were to die today, the middle management who live by JIRA would replace it with something else equally bad, if not worse.<p>Filling in missing features won&#x27;t and can&#x27;t fix that.')
