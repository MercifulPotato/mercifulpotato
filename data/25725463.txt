Would I risk that they close them?<p>One thing that annoys me about the lack of a test environment is also that they allow only one webhook URL per account. I have three environments for my SaaS, dev&#x2F;staging&#x2F;prod. So with Chargebee I have the &quot;live site&quot; (as they call it) linked to the prod environment with its own webhook URL. Then I have the &quot;test site&quot; shared between dev and staging. But with Chargebee I can add multiple webhook URLs, so all events get sent to both dev and staging and each environment only cares about its own events.<p>With Paddle, unless I create three accounts for the different environments, I would have to somehow share a webhook URL between at least dev and staging if I create one account for dev&#x2F;staging and another for production. I guess I could create a simple app that proxies requests to the environments by looking at some string that tells which environment the event is for (I know that Paddle allows you to add a passthrough setting with some custom data - do you know if this persists across all future events for a subscription?)')
