I absolutely love learning new systems, and music is a fascinating system with such interesting tangible results, it reminds me of my first experiences with web dev where I got to see this thing I myself created come to life. I agree that music practice is such a transferable skill. There are no shortcuts, but there are tricks of the trade that make absolutely no sense at first but you keep and it and pieces start clicking. I’m glad I started a side project around the same time, because I find I am applying similar discipline to both and it’s a really fun cycle to be living through at the moment :)')
