I&#x27;ve definitely considered using services like Cognito but always returned to &quot;DIY&quot; for the data ownership. A couple questions:<p>1. How will you keep bigger engineering teams on your platform if access to the data (and therefore migration) is easy?<p>2. I mainly work with Python. Typically I use Django&#x27;s user system with my own user model and I copy and paste the client company&#x27;s &quot;general email template&quot; into the verification &#x2F; signup &#x2F; reset emails and I&#x27;m done with it. If I need it on multiple services I install a JWT plugin. It takes maybe 10 minutes at the start of a project, and the developer experience is similar from what I have heard in Rails with Devise. Does this service have anything to offer to these &quot;mature&quot; stacks, or are you generally targeting newer ecosystems like Node &#x2F; &quot;frontend first&quot; projects?<p>Also, your landing page looks great!! :)')
