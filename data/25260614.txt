I believe the immediate goal of PA Semi purchase was that.<p>&gt; The answer seems to be obvious now... but probably it wasn’t obvious when Apple acquired PA Semi in 2008.<p>PA Semi was clearly a diamond in the rough. It took a great insight to single out PA Semi, because on the surface it was a very barebones SoC sweatshop, but in reality PA were the last of Mohicans of US chip design.<p>PA was a place where all non-Intel IC engineers left to after the severe carnage of microchip businesses of US tech giants like Sun, IBM, HP, DEC, SGI..., and etc.<p>It was a star team which back then was toiling at router box SoCs.')
