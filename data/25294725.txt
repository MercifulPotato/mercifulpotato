These are two entirely different substances.<p>PTFE is a polymer, often referred to by its most well-known brand name Teflon.  Over decades of use, there is zero evidence of any health effects whatsoever from PTFE, the only exception being when it&#x27;s heated to around 500 deg F.  In everyday use it is completely inert and harmless.<p>PFAS is a generic term describing a family of fluorinated chemicals.  Evidence is piling up that many of these have serious and long-lasting health effects.  Some PFAS chemicals are used as the monomers for making PTFE, but once the PTFE is made, the constituent monomers cannot be released except by extreme heat.<p>All that to say, your coated guitar strings are completely safe.  Certainly safer than the teflon-coated pans I cook on every day.')
