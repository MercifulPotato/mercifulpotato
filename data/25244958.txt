I knowingly pay a premium for that.<p>IMO your argument is NULL, if there were alternatives like an Open source store, a Google, Microsoft and Amazon store on iOS you would not be forced to use them. Check the Android model, most people are using the Google store and the GIANT benefits is that if Google decides or is forced to not allow an application you are not screwed, you can go around that.<p>Again, if you want to consume ONLY Apple approved content then nobody would force you to not do it, see Android.')
