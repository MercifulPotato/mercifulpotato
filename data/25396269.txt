It was only a desktop B2B site and later on when mobile support was inevitable we tried to use preact for mobile site since it was lightweight. We actually found that our desktop site which renders large tables with hundreds of rows and multiple chart components performed better in Preact without any optimizations. I&#x27;d say maybe a 20 - 30% improvement since we were seeing a gain FPS of around 10 frames.\nI think it would have been a bit more faster if we had used MobX instead of redux but that was too late.')
