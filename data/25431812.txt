It greatly helped my move to a Linux-only desktop.<p>&gt; With KDE 4, Kate became &quot;literally unusable&quot; for me<p>It&#x27;s been a long time since the release of KDE 4, but that was what did it for me too (it&#x27;s been so long I don&#x27;t remember the specifics). I was able to keep using the 3.x version for a while. Once that started to become an issue, I moved basically everything to Geany. I just checked and I don&#x27;t even have it installed - hard to believe, given how much I used to use it.')
