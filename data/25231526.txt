I&#x27;ve read those articles, I mentioned one point (actually I mentioned at least 2) but I&#x27;ve surely considered the others and many of the articles you mention are in fact cherry picked to cast Amazon in a bad light. Which is why I mentioned they don&#x27;t make up systematic abuse.<p>That fact that you&#x27;re trying to position this as you showing me the error of my ways when, no, in actuality I&#x27;ve considered the angles and still very much disagree with those positions says a lot more about you than it does me. I&#x27;m against unions, pro corporate in many cases and think Amazon goes above what they even have to.<p>I find this interaction pretty representative of the problems in online discourse. Namely that because I hold a widely different position to you, you assume I must not have considered multiple sources or am letting my biases talk for me. I assure you I&#x27;m pretty well considered in everything I write.<p>Please take your &quot;virtue&quot; elsewhere.<p>Edit: In fact thinking more about it I think your assumption even violates one of the guidelines here on HN which is to hold your opponent&#x27;s thoughts in the most charitable light. That is it&#x27;s on you to assume that I have put the thought in and considered multiple narratives instead of me being intellectually lazy.')
