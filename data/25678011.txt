It is just the economies of scale. People who needed 5&#x27;25 inch floppy drives, either had one somehow or they converted their old media already. If there are handful of people who still are using or dependent on these devices, well, sorry, but you will either have to develop one using an Arduino&#x2F;RasPi combo one way or another, or seek it from an obscure hardware supplier.')
