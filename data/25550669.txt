Reading this article is like an phone book of name drops and references. I know ppl with master&#x27;s degrees who do not even know nearly as much. I should have stayed in school longer and done more reading  so I would know more. I guess that answers the question of what I would do I if had to do it allover again. Sure beats what I am doing now. I think being a success writer is one of the best jobs in the world even if the pay is not that great because it is high status and you have an impact, whereas many tech jobs may pay better but it feels like you are sometimes working in a vacuum and not getting recognized for your contributions.')
