I&#x27;m really interested to learn more.<p>Your comment was very insightful. I used to think somewhat along those lines when it came to designing an API. My thought was that and endpoint was to represent an <i>action</i> the user could perform, and it was none of their business how that was implemented. But I&#x27;ve recently been enlisted in a project to rewrite a whole API (admittedly not a good one at all) where it was decided to use GraphQL. The rationale was &quot;some of our endpoints return enormous objects. Not all of the data is needed every time the client calls that endpoint. Let&#x27;s implement a way to let the client only ask for the data it needs&quot;. It sounded great, but I&#x27;m thinking now it might not be all gold as it was presented to me.')
