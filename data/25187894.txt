I have used them in the past, and it was a very nice experience overall.<p>For many projects this is more than enough. However, in my case I would be paying 2-3x more if I was using Heroku.<p>With Kubernetes, in case I wanted to deploy new projects or even spin up a &quot;testing&quot; env, I can use the same stack&#x2F;cluster, and not have my costs increase.<p>I do realize that this is not for everyone. But for me it just made sense, and enabled me to work on new features faster than before.')
