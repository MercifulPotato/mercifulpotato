Women&#x27;s access to the job market competes with men, and takes away men&#x27;s ability to earn an income that can support a family because it offers the market a surplus of labor.<p>2. Widespread promiscuity prevents marriage from happening.<p>3. Things are very good for rich and successful men, but terrible for the rest.<p>4. Lifestyle changes, beliefs, and attitudes are leading to a soft reduction in fertility rates. Kidfree, MGTOW, celibacy, etc.<p>5. More women becoming highly-educated and then expecting men to have even more education.<p>6. Tinder and such apps where women get used by an Ivy Leaguer for a sport fuck, and she automatically assumes she&#x27;s a 10 princess and everyone else is unworthy.<p>7. The atomization of society into anonymous, self-obsessed  groups of 1 without a community focal-point like a church.<p>8. The extended infantilization of men and women such they don&#x27;t or can&#x27;t interact with each other successfully during their prime reproductive years. This is partially due to two-working parent households not teaching their kids how to act.<p>9. The attitudes of shunning single men as worthless.')
