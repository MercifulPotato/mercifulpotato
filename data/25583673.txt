Or about weird, but potentially fatal side effects of incorporating rules put up by regulators into the software that cannot be tested with today&#x27;s alpha testing fleets because these rules might not even exist yet? Or about how good all these different AI vehicles of different vendors in very different software and hardware revision states interact with each other (think of situations like HFT trading algorithms that run each other into a doomsday spiral, just with vehicles at an intersection twitching around quickly in weird ways, trying to interpret each others actions)? Or about the hackability of future robotic cars (think for example of those slightly modified fake traffic signs)?<p>Nothing. That&#x27;s why regardless of how impressively big these test fleets are, there will be a lot more of these unknowns.')
