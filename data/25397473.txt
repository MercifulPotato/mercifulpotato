Item(by='svara', descendants=None, kids=[25397584], score=None, time=1607770992, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25397329, text='&gt; My pet theory is that it isn&#x27;t a decline of brain ability but rather a psychological shift: Adults expect results, get frustrated more quickly, can&#x27;t tolerate speaking &quot;silly&quot; for long etc.<p>Totally agree. An adult working full time on acquiring a language can learn to use a foreign language at an adult level within maybe a year or so. It&#x27;s just that nobody does that, because there are other things to do...<p>Children literally need decades to reach an adult level of competence in their native language, despite 24&#x2F;7 immersion.<p>Language learning techniques for adults (studying abstract grammar, cramming vocabulary) are very effective and kids don&#x27;t learn the way.<p>There is one major disadvantage that adults have though, and that&#x27;s at acquiring correct pronunciation. I think I&#x27;ve never met a person in my life who didn&#x27;t learn a language from a very young age and who didn&#x27;t sound slightly off to a native speaker.<p>There might be the rare exceptional talent who can do that, but to a first approximation it&#x27;s not possible as an adult anymore.')
