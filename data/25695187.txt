No it doesn&#x27;t give you the adrenaline rush of enforcing your desires on the world, but that&#x27;s not a good thing to be enabling in the first place.<p>If they had no control over the stores used to get apps on devices, the whole question would be moot. Their duopoly leads to this issue. Frankly, that control should be taken away.')
