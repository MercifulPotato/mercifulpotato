I see some add-ons do something to simulate this.<p>&gt; Opening a recently closed tab opens a new tab in Chrome instead of replacing the existing one.<p>This opens a new tab for me, no settings I&#x27;ve changed that I could find.<p>&gt; There were probably 5-10 more annoyances in Firefox for me that I don&#x27;t recall right now. Maybe it was my familiarity with Chrome but overall I still think Chrome has better UX defaults.<p>There will probably always be differences, that&#x27;s why different browsers exist after all, and it&#x27;ll be different annoyances for different people. Personally I think generally the UX of Chrome (that Firefox has tried to copy) is the worst thing about all current browsers. The new add-on API made me start using custom UX CSS to make it tolerable instead of a &quot;fix add-on&quot;, but the only serious alternative (Chrome) always felt worse to me. Has many nifty features though.')
