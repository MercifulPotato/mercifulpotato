A single machine can have over a hundred cores and terabytes of memory. Moreover, a physical machine can be amortized over ten years provided you have a load that doesn&#x27;t vary significantly over time. And because it&#x27;s such a small number of physical machines, you no longer need exotic local power and cooling solutions.<p>Cloud providers are already more expensive than this in many cases. They need every cost advantage they can get just to be in the game.')
