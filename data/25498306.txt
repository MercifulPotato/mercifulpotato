Also, with mirrorless, there are cameras that can AF down to F&#x2F;22 - something unimaginable (and impossible) with DSLRs.<p>While the demand for 600mm F&#x2F;4 is there from a professional standpoint, there is an even larger demand for cheaper options - and.. this point is important, you can produce award-worthy images using those cheaper potions. In fact if you look at any nature competition a lot of the awards go to images made with cheap&#x2F;budget gear.')
