At one extreme, you include every single commit ever made on the branch, and at the other extreme, you squash the entire branch down to a single commit. Using merge commits, you can go for any option inbetween.<p>&gt; It also defaults to causing the main to have a ton of commits with &quot;Merged from XXXX branch&quot; as the summary lines when that&#x27;s not nearly descriptive enough to quickly find what type of commit I may be looking for.<p>Do you often read the log linearly? 99% of the time when I investigate history in Git, it&#x27;s either through &quot;git blame&quot; or through &quot;git log -S somestring&quot; (search for commits that introduced or removed &quot;somestring&quot;). I rarely, if ever, just read the log as-is.')
