Ferrets are the best (and common) animal model for viral infection of the human upper respiratory pathway due to similar expresion and distribution of sugars on the external (epithelial) cells lining it. Mink are pretty close but not the same. sars-cov-2 adapted for mink upper respiratory epithelial cells is probably different enough that different codings of the spike protein will be more effective, but close enough to humans&#x2F;ferrets to re-infect humans. That the Denmark cases show current sars-cov-2 antibodies don&#x27;t help is disturbing. It might imply a coding change in some external protein. I am surprised there&#x27;s no spike protein sequences for this already available online.<p>It&#x27;s worth noting that Wisconsin USA mink farms have sars-cov-2 infection problems as well. And farms in Norway and the Netherlands. It&#x27;s good that Denmark is taking this seriously since there&#x27;s so much cross infection but it could happen everywhere else on earth where Mustela are farmed in quantity.<p>It makes me wonder if the entire stage 1&#x2F;2 compressed trials for each vaccine type would have to be re-run or if they&#x27;d just change the coding on approved vaccines and do only phase 3 trials.')
