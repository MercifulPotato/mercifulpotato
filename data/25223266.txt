But kernel polling mode has it&#x27;s own cost. If the system call overhead is no where close to being a bottle neck, i.e. you don&#x27;t do system calls &quot;that&quot; much, e.g. because your endpoints take longer to complete then using kernel polling mode can degrade the <i>overall system</i> performance. And potential increase power consumption and as such heat generation.<p>Besides that user mode tcp stacks can be more tailored for your use case which can increase performance.<p>So all in all I would say that it depends on your use case. For some it will make user mode tcp useless or at least not worth it but for others it doesn&#x27;t.')
