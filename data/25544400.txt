When you’re integrating with a 3rd-party API, you have two differences:<p>1. relatively high confidence the API won’t change much, which makes implementing typed code lower risk and higher ROI<p>2. a slower feedback loop over the “reload the page” of rolling your own, so types catching issues earlier than heavy integration tests is much more valuable<p>I use untyped Ruby&#x2F;Rails code for all of the CRUD, and golang AWS lambdas for anything integrating with SDKs&#x2F;APIs. Best of both worlds, in my experience.')
