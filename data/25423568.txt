Whether it was gay rights or pro-racist laws.<p>As Americans, the confidentiality of your vote is considered sacred. But, it’s not really a complete secret. Since your ballot has a serial number, to ensure authenticity, and that serial number can be tied to you.<p>And given all the new electronic voting devices being used, I’m certain it’s now easier to make this correlation.<p>Anyways, certain civil behaviors still apply here. Do unto others, as you’d like it done to you.')
