You look at the 20-100k and beyond returns these crazy people get and you rationalize you can do it too.<p>Soon you find yourself in a community that helps you (in their own way) deal with your losses while promoting the next play. It also doesn&#x27;t help that being in a bubble, the adage &quot;stonks only go up&quot; has been true since the March crash and meme stocks outperform and achieve extreme valuations against all conventional wisdom.<p>Robinhood is the shovel-seller that has undercut the other players with lower prices and lower barrier to entry and better UI.
