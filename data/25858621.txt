I liked this one: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tr0lly.com&#x2F;bitcoin&#x2F;bitcoin-is-not-a-literal-ponzi-scheme&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tr0lly.com&#x2F;bitcoin&#x2F;bitcoin-is-not-a-literal-ponzi...</a><p>I&#x27;m curious why the revelations around Tether hasn&#x27;t led to Bitcoin crashing yet. I would definitely have sold if I had any (well I did, I mined a bit in the very beginning, but that&#x27;s lost). Is it that others haven&#x27;t heard about it, or is it that they don&#x27;t believe that Tether will take down Bitcoin with it?<p>It seems like it may have stalled the growth of BTC for now though.')
