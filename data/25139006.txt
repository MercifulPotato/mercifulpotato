I&#x27;d love to see homework eliminated, more time in school devoted to play, more tracking &amp; opportunities for everyone to develop their strengths (be they calculus or auto mechanics), and the elimination of compulsory secondary schooling (let the kids come who want to come &amp; make it rewarding enough that they do, rather than threatening to jail their parents to bring them to heel).<p>I am ignoring the aspects of your comment directed towards me personally.')
