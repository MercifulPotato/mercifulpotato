It is not even clear who wanted these laws in the first place. This is mostly the effect of a system in which politicians have been scared into endorsing harsher and harsher measures because if they oppose them they can be represented as racists or misogynists.<p>And the net effect of these laws is not that of appeasing or diminishing hatred or negative views, probably quite the opposite. But they do make very clear that any speech about some categories, even legitimate and factual criticism, can put you in big trouble. This, I guess, is their real purpose: silencing critical voices with the threat of a damning accusation, police intervention and criminal charges.')
