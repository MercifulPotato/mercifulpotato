If I can&#x27;t understand what&#x27;s going on under the hood then I&#x27;ll be happy to pass. This is a limitation, of course. But at least it keeps me on a path where I don&#x27;t bite off more than I can chew. Experience has led me to believe that <i>any</i> dependency you have is sooner or later going to turn into a either a liability or an obligation, this makes it much easier for me to see dependencies as costs rather than just as advantages.<p>The number of dependencies for my current project is four, and each of those (vexflow, tone.js, lovefield, jquery) I&#x27;m in principle prepared to maintain myself. Even so, all of them have already proven to be here for the longer term. Ditto for tooling.')
