I suspect doing the same in many US towns or cities might result in assault - contrast “liberties” with “effective freedoms”.<p>Also, political free speech is pretty much absolute in the UK - it’s citizens putting the boot in to each other in public that tends to attract Police interest in keeping the peace.')
