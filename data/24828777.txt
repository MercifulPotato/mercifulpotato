With conversion losses, you can&#x27;t realistically pull more than a horsepower out of a typical 120V&#x2F;10A circuit without risking a breaker trip, even if there&#x27;s nothing else connected to the circuit. That makes a corded tool potentially much more of a pain to use than a battery-powered one, so even if the corded version would otherwise be much more cost-efficient, it still may be a tougher sell in the US.<p>I wonder if that&#x27;s also why I&#x27;ve seen almost no electric&#x2F;induction cooktops in American media even though from my Central European POV induction tops are safer, easier to regulate etc. than gas cooktops.')
