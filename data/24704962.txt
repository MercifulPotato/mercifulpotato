A large portion of the country resents them, there&#x27;s large demographic&#x2F;cultural changes, another portion of country&#x2F;political class wants to provide citizenship&#x2F;welfare(voiding the GP&#x27;s calculus), racial&#x2F;cultural tensions are still issue.<p>Well heeled thinktanks can continue to try and bamboozle people but after watching every contracting crew in my area become 99% low paid latino immigrant I have no reason to want the same thing to happen to software development when it&#x27;s one of the few remaining paths to a nice middle class life.
