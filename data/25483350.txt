The advertisers in AdSense ads are chosen automatically by YouTube, not by the video creator. These ads interrupt the normal flow of the video. The advertising content from the brand deal is integrated directly into the main body of the video, usually by the video creator herself talking about the products. These have to be disclosed to the viewer (U.S. FTC regulations).<p>A single video can have both a brand deal and AdSense ads.')
