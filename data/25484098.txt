This thing took off without me realizing it.<p>Flurly doesn&#x27;t add extra charges, it does basically the same charging scheme as gumroad but cheaper.<p>So if you sell a $10 item:<p>1%, or 10c goes to Flurly<p>2.9% + 30c or 59c goes to Stripe<p>$10 - 10c - 59c = $9.31 goes to the seller<p>There is no additional charge to the customer above $10.')
