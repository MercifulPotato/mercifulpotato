I was a fan of things like Bladerunner&#x2F;Judge Dread&#x2F;5 Element since the 90s, and read my first Cyberpunk book in the late early 2000s (Cryptonomicon) in HS but even then I could see the parallels. When I launched my fintech startup I spent a summer (2015) in Sunnyvale and felt we are already there, but people were far too distracted to see it.<p>As a Californian I soon made my exit out SV and CA a priority for my own mental health and sanity and left for Boulder. Which which was always the plan but then it soon had the same issues after a few years.')
