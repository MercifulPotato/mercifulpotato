It&#x27;s possible that there are other technological civilizations out there, but all stuck under a few hundred km of ice or on a 2-earth-mass monster where it&#x27;s impractical to reach orbit.<p>Earth may only be special in being in a sweet spot between Mars (too small to hold an atmosphere or protect from cosmic radiation, hence no life) and Gliese 832c (with its low-orbit velocity of something like 15km&#x2F;s, hence much less practical to put stuff in space).')
