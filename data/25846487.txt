Thank you very much for trying out Crawlcrawler.<p>I lauched the site yesterday and had anticipated that problems might arise in the crawl process because of a naive HTML parser that cannot run JS and indeed my crawler is unable to extract anything meaningful from many sites out there, imdb.com and twitter to name a couple. I don&#x27;t plan on ever running JS because I think client-side JS is a mistake all together. Must-have UI-related javascript should become HTML elements&lt;&#x2F;rant&gt;. Anyway, I&#x27;m working on fall-back parsing methods that I think will help extract text even from heavily JS-driven sites. That&#x27;s coming soon.<p>A for me entirely new problem has arisen, though, thanks to those of you who submit urls such as these:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;&#x2F;from?site=famouswebsite.com&#x2F;user" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;&#x2F;from?site=famouswebsite.com&#x2F;us...</a><p>First of all, because of the double slashes, server returns 404. But how in the lords name am I supposed to know to discard some query params but keep others? It seems an unsolvable problem to me. Please advise.')
