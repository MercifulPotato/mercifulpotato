What if Apple added custom ISA extensions to their chips to support efficient x86 emulation? Current evidence seems to suggest that much of the translation is happening statically; a few additional instructions might greatly increase x86 emulation performance if most of the code can be translated instruction-by-instruction.<p>Also curious to see how Rosetta will work with x86 code whose instruction alignments can&#x27;t be determined statically.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;50966676&#x2F;why-do-arm-chips-have-an-instruction-with-javascript-in-the-name-fjcvtzs" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;50966676&#x2F;why-do-arm-chip...</a>')
