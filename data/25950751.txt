If you have a New York Times subscription you can only cancel it by calling them on the phone during working hours or using their support chat which is only available during working hours (for everyone except Californians, kinda odd how they won&#x27;t make that available to the whole country, huh?). Why not just have a simple cancel subscription button on your account page?')
