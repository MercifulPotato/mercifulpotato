Well, i see social media corporations are censoring in favor of their view of things. Because those in our society are divided, we can not be be a &#x27;neutral \n arbiter&#x27; of truth in this world. For example, @LiveAction and other pro life accounts are not permitted to advertise on twitter, etc...<p>If anything we can have the ability to turn off specific advertisements. I thought it would be nice to have a list of curators, who could digitally sign page content. Then have like a GPG trust chain where people can say the people they value curating. We can choose anyone who we align with their values, and we can view and search the web with information that is weighed according to our local web of trust. It could also be used to help young children as well to have some kind of firewall against bad information. And for adults  I would rather be exposed to all ideas of the spectrum, which gives me the ability to fact check things for myself. I have had this idea for some time now. The idea is we get to choose our own analyzers and work together to establish the truthfulness of the web. And if i can help someone with it thanks be to God in Jesus name')
