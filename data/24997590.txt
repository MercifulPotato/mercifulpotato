Speccing a client to interact with such services (feeding data from .list back into .link and collecting keys from .init to build transactions for .fini) is left as a excersize for the reader.<p>The key point is that you have disposable pseudonyms that will mix their coins with anyone who offers a valid mixing transaction. Assuming there is demand for mixing from anyone other than you (if there&#x27;s not, you can&#x27;t really do anything anyway), this captures that demand <i>in order to satisfy your own mixing needs</i>, while also allowing others to bootstrap the exact same trick by adding their own backends via .link.<p>There&#x27;s QOS and anti-DOS issues to be solved, but it&#x27;s definitely something that in principle <i>can</i> work.')
