Is evidence that the mail man should be disciplined or fired, not of a mountain of fraud.<p>2. You&#x27;ve literally proved my point about ignoring any kind of context with this one. The title intentionally misrepresents what is happening from the outset by misqualifying the containers ballots are regularly stored in as suitcases. It&#x27;s not attempting to raise a concern about the election process, it&#x27;s attempting to incense people with a particular ideology. This is further reinforced when you entirely ignore the testimony of anyone with any knowledge of how the ballot counting process is carried out, including ignoring the fact that any of the independent observers that the officials alleged to have left of their own volition  could easily challenge that claim at any point.<p>3&#x2F;4. All you&#x27;ve done here is prove that the methods already in place are effective at catching people who try to cast a dead person&#x27;s vote.<p>Throughout this you&#x27;ve entirely ignored the fact that these discrepancies have been brought to people&#x27;s attention and that they are either pure conjecture or on the level of individual misconduct. Any actions required to have &#x2F;any&#x2F; effect whatsoever would be much more obvious and would have been put.<p>&gt; I&#x27;ll have presented evidence, and you won&#x27;t have.<p>You&#x27;ve provided absolutely no evidence of the kind of mass fraud you&#x27;re asserting has happened, once again isolated incidents will happen and in general they will be caught. Fraud mountain is a fiction of Trump&#x27;s fucked up ego, and is evidenced by the fact that the absolutely overwhelming majority of votes have been agreed as legitimate by both independent and partisan observers.')
