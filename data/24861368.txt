Though I think it would take someone with a much more rigorous math background than myself to make the case formal enough to get it accepted.<p>(If it helps, and it may be a red herring, the dualism between PEGs and Parser Combinators has me thinking it&#x27;s a Category Theory related &quot;step&quot; in the hierarchy. &quot;Deterministic Monadic Compositions&quot; in a reflection of DFA&#x2F;NFA duals to Regular Languages might imply &quot;Monadic Languages&quot; as a possible name? Again, my math background is definitely not formal enough here to make actual suggestions, but maybe it sparks an idea for someone else.)')
