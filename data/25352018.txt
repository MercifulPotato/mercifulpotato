Never built it. It would share privately using encryption, as this one does, but <i>also</i>, people could easily see a log of who looked up their location and precisely when.<p>The benefit of this would be that you could ask your family members to install it on their phone, for emergencies. And if you have a teenage kid who is concerned about you &quot;stalking&quot; them or &quot;invading their privacy&quot;, you will be able to say, &quot;you will be able to see in the app whenever I look up where you are, so you will know that I&#x27;m not checking up on you constantly&quot;<p>It would also be a deterrant against you abusing your powers. You wouldn&#x27;t want to look up where they are unless absolutely necessary, as you wouldn&#x27;t want to create that log entry on their phone, as you&#x27;d have to explain it.<p>Free idea, for anyone who wants it.')
