The foundation of most code written is built by those people.<p>The point of the article is to point out that languages, frameworks, or apis that expect a level of discipline to write well are inferior to ones that don&#x27;t expect discipline out of its coders.<p>The takeaway shouldn&#x27;t be - I as a programmer shouldn&#x27;t learn how the machine works.<p>The takeaway should be - if I&#x27;m designing an API&#x2F;Language&#x2F;framework, I should figure out how much I&#x27;m relying on an engineer&#x27;s discipline to make the code great (performant, robust, secure, etc). If I can reduce that reliance, the API&#x2F;Language&#x2F;Framework becomes better.')
