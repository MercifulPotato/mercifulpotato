I could use something like GChat, although idk if that works with my school&#x27;s GSuite setup. That being said, I&#x27;ve tried spinning up chat apps like Slack&#x2F;Rocket&#x2F;etc. and faced serious issues.<p>A. Nobody checks Slack. In the beginning everything&#x27;s great and people are engaging on slack, but after a few weeks engagement drops off.<p>B. The number of people without Facebook has been precisely 1. If there were more people without FB accounts, I&#x27;d 100% consider another option.<p>C. Begrudging use is better than no use. It&#x27;s not that students are boycotting my program because they have some hatred of Slack. It&#x27;s more that they&#x27;re confronted with a form, which they put off and then forget to do.')
