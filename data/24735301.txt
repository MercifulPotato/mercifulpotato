I pay no fees on my account with no minimum balance or usage restrictions and still have free unlimited ATM use worldwide (i.e. my bank doesn&#x27;t charge a fee for the use or currency conversion <i>and</i> they actually refund me the foreign ATM&#x27;s fees) and fee-free overdrafting on my account (paying a very nominal margin trading interest rate). I actually still use it even though I don&#x27;t live in the US because it&#x27;s cheaper to use here than my domestic bank account...')
