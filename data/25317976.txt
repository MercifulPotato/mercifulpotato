Temperature is an example of a spectrum. Something and Nothing are two examples of a binary concept. Binary thinking is not flawed... it is only flawed if you think everything is binary just as it is flawed if you think everything is a spectrum. Both concepts exist at a conceptual level.<p>So what triggered you here? The OOP thing? Perhaps you can share with us the logical scaffold you constructed around yourself to justify all your years of using Object Oriented programming. I would bet that the scaffold you constructed is just as complicated as the scaffold I created that is against the concept of OOP altogether.<p>Either way I triggered you, your brain reacted in a biased and emotional way. That is in itself the &quot;flaw&quot; that I am talking about in my post. I used bait to deliberately help illustrate my point, to show that these flaws are not just things you observe in other people, but that they are things within you yourself.')
