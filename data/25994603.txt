On top of this, a lot of their approach was focused on controlled, reproducible results.  So anything probabilistic or even worse, continually learning, becomes difficult to frame.<p>The FDA guidance doc&#x2F; action plan (link is broken in article and on FDA site: it&#x27;s here <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fda.gov&#x2F;medical-devices&#x2F;software-medical-device-samd&#x2F;artificial-intelligence-and-machine-learning-software-medical-device" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fda.gov&#x2F;medical-devices&#x2F;software-medical-device-...</a>) is actually pretty encouraging, because they took community feedback from the original request for feedback (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fda.gov&#x2F;media&#x2F;122535&#x2F;download" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fda.gov&#x2F;media&#x2F;122535&#x2F;download</a>) and seem to have handle that process reasonably.<p>Many people I&#x27;ve talked to without direct experience seem to assume the 13485 process as a whole is needlessly bureaucratic,  but in my experience it&#x27;s mostly holding yourself to a higher engineering standard that some other industries, and works out ok.  This willingness to engage with technologies can be frustratingly slow, but it&#x27;s mostly reasonable.')
