So not in a narrow sense at all.<p>Wayland is one thing, not an X replacement. There is, unfortunately, not a great story&#x2F;push to standardize all the <i>other</i> parts of X outside of Wayland&#x27;s scope.<p>But it&#x27;s important to recognize those other parts are also very much not handled by the Wayland-equivalent on other OS&#x27;s, either. Window&#x27;s DWM doesn&#x27;t do clipboard management. Android&#x27;s SurfaceFlinger doesn&#x27;t do input. MacOS&#x27;s QuartZ Composer doesn&#x27;t do global keyboard shortcuts. And from an app perspective, none of those other OS&#x27;s conflate those random unrelated things in the way X did, either. They aren&#x27;t part of the same library or technology group. As in, you&#x27;ll never find clipboard references in CoreGraphics. You use NSPasteboard which talks to the pastboard server, instead. Entirely unrelated &amp; orthogonal to the compositor, as it should be.<p>Only on Linux is a full desktop environment stack shoehorned into what&#x27;s supposedly a display manager.')
