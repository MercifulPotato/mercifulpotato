Also we have seen a rapid improvement in the accuracy&#x2F;speed curve, most notably with NAS. It hasn’t just been increased computational power.<p>AFAIK the use of learned embedding in the biomedical space has improved our understanding of the science&#x2F;our ability to find high value experiments to run.<p>I think the coherency of GPT-3 and the RL learned tool use work both raise extremely interesting questions about the nature of language and high-level intelligence. Questions that we couldn’t meaningfully ask before that evidence.<p>I also think you’re being shortsighted about the possibilities that are opened up as we enable computers to understand and interact with the real world in more way. Increased visual and audio understanding will lead to more passive computing and that has all sorts of fascinating implications.<p>I don’t know what insights you’re looking for. We’re seeing AI reveal fascinating phenomena in language, vision and general purpose learning. Scientific advancement is often about asking the right questions and unexplainable phenomena is the driver of those questions. Much like some phenomena (I want to say something to do spectral) were unanswered questions that developed into the field of quantum mechanics, what we’re seeing in AI is currently unexplainable phenomena.<p>Are you in the field? You’ve focused on the things that made global headlines, but I feel like there’s so much more.')
