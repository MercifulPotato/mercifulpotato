But then I also know several onm the left whose take on things is &quot;rather inconsistent&quot; with a serious reading of the primary sources, and some reasonable, unemotional compilation.  I imagine they are <i>less</i> crazy, and they are certainly better spoken (better vocabularies, etc), but I&#x27;d be interested to see an omniscient being&#x27;s tally of the true distributed craziness out there.<p>Also, one shouldn&#x27;t overlook things like confirmation bias - for every highly visible crazy you or I see, on either side, how many non-vocal people with reasonable ideas are there that the mind doesn&#x27;t see, and therefore perceives to not exist (depending on the mode of thinking?<p>And then for those that do appear batshit insane - are they <i>really</i> as deluded as their words suggest?  Your experiences seem to suggest so, but my question is: how do we go from the brutal discourse we&#x27;ve got going on now, to somewhere more reasonable?  What actions do we have to take as a society, and as individuals (whether we &quot;like to&quot; or &quot;should have to&quot;, or not), and what changes do we need to our social media platforms and media?<p>&gt; But I just can&#x27;t envision what a &quot;serious effort&quot; to break through would even look like.<p>I think both the way we report the news, and the way we discuss it, need a serious overhaul.  The current approach of &quot;news event&#x2F;article --&gt; social media argument --&gt; go to bed -- &gt; wake up --&gt; (slightly updated) news event&#x2F;article --&gt; social media argument&quot; is just an endless loop of outrage.  I believe if we instead had some sort of a persistent model of each issue, showing all of the important attributes (with citations) and <i>various and conflicting perspectives</i> that we could refer to during debate rather than the latest news article, I think the conversation would be very different.<p>Compare how we discuss and analyze the complex matters and news of the world (which typically involve <i>systems</i> of some kind), versus how we do the same for complex systems at work - do the two approaches resemble each other?')
