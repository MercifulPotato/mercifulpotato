My hot take is that if you need to run this device continuously it will be a substantial (&amp; custom?) build. The biggest factor is how portable it needs to be.<p>Overview: Most solar outputs 12 or 24v, so what often happens is solar -&gt; controller -&gt; battery (or bus) -&gt; inverter -&gt; your device.<p>Batteries: Many batteries are rated for 100ah at 12 volts (so 1.2 kw hours). You would need 2+ of them to run the system purely off them for about an hour. You can buy much beefier batteries designed for residential homes (e.g. 3&#x27; x 2&#x27; x 1&#x27; in size, 10kwh, $5,000+ for lithium, etc..).<p>Solar: The panels you might see on top of a camper often generate 100 watts each, so you would need 20+ of them to continuously sustain your device. Can be 250 watts or a bit more, so 8+ panels.<p>I&#x27;ve only worked on electrical for a camper, so could be missing other options! AFAIK your requirements aren&#x27;t crazy for residential solar setups.')
