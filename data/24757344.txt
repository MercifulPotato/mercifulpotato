Multiunit and combinatorial mechanisms are core to ad markets and sponsored search, smart power grids, logistics, commerce, manufacturing, telecommunication - the list goes on. The economic gains that they drive every year are in the hundreds of billions. It&#x27;s worth noting that Preston McAfee, Paul Milgrom, and Robert Wilson shared the 2014 Golden Goose Award [1] for one of the earliest and most impactful commercial applications of applied auction theory: wireless spectrum licensing.<p>Milgrom&#x27;s Putting Auction Theory to Work [2] is an excellent introduction to this world.<p>PS: OneChronos (YC 16) [3] is working on bringing these mechanisms to capital markets. It&#x27;s an incredibly challenging but rewarding problem that spans deeply theoretical and applied problems. We&#x27;re always hiring top academic and engineering talent regardless of your background.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.goldengooseaward.org&#x2F;01awardees&#x2F;auction-design" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.goldengooseaward.org&#x2F;01awardees&#x2F;auction-design</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;books&#x2F;edition&#x2F;Putting_Auction_Theory_to_Work&#x2F;AkeHTU7XW4kC?hl=en" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;books&#x2F;edition&#x2F;Putting_Auction_Theory_...</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.onechronos.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.onechronos.com</a>')
