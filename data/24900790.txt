A regular point-and-shoot[0] which costs $100, fits in your pocket and has an electronic retractable lens (and many times optical zoom) is going to blow away anything recent phone cameras can do (photography wise), bar handheld night photos where the additional processing does help even out blurriness. If you can remember to bring your phone, you can remember to bring a point-and-shoot, and they both fit in your pocket.<p>The insane quality upgrade you get from a point-and-shoot is because they have a much bigger sensor and a real lens and focus light brilliantly well, and if you want bokeh you don&#x27;t need any of that crap fake blur processing to achieve the same effect.<p>I often feel like people have forgotten or never even knew how good images can be with an actual camera, and it doesn&#x27;t have to be a DSLR at all.<p>If you want a camera, buy a camera, not a phone.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bhphotovideo.com&#x2F;c&#x2F;product&#x2F;1210607-REG&#x2F;canon_1096c001_powershot_elph_180_digital.html&#x2F;overview" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bhphotovideo.com&#x2F;c&#x2F;product&#x2F;1210607-REG&#x2F;canon_109...</a>')
