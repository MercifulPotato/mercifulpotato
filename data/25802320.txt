That&#x27;s not easy and you don&#x27;t get far the first few years.<p>If you wait until you&#x27;ve got the resources of a gentleman scientist before you get underway you may be waiting a while.  I don&#x27;t think that success model comes back in style every generation anyway or we&#x27;d have more of that legendary type of success.<p>Remember in the not-too-distant past, computers had been essential for years but no individual had yet owned one personally.<p>Almost all technology beyond pure math could not be well pursued without a specialized facility.<p>You saved up your other creative abilities until you had access to what it took to carry them out, then made the most of it while you were equipped.<p>Today it&#x27;s thought if you are going to make the most of a gifted researcher&#x27;s time they are going to need to hit the ground running in a facility that is established and has momentum.  There will be some kind of expectation to contribute to the momentum of the facility, and there will need to be an open slot.  The only things like that are called institutions for a reason, because they&#x27;re staying right where they are.<p>I&#x27;m still not so sure if I&#x27;m ready for an institution.<p>It might be worthwhile to ask the bench workers what kind of facility they would be able to invent more things in, then go ahead and let them take the time to build it while the PhD&#x27;s are still going at their full rate in their preferred way.<p>I say it&#x27;s possible for the bench workers to come from behind and get some wins.<p>Focus on getting the most out of the equipment while the PhDs are busy at their desks and conferences, then spin the collateral progress out into companies faster than the PhDs have normally been on the path to have that happen.<p>Plus the PhDs have to be satisfied once their papers are well-cited and have reached their hard-won goal of clawing their way to the rare top position against all odds, so they should be entitled to relax a bit more each decade as this process itself has become more challenging, and not do any lowly bench work.<p>It might just take a gentleman&#x27;s agreement to get promising scientists to aspire to a hierarchy-free class of operation you don&#x27;t always get every generation.<p>Statistics tell me there is at least one person without a PhD who would proceed directly to a 100 percent effective Covid vaccine or treatment single handedly in only a few months using no more than 1 percent of the resources relative to proven successes like Pfizer or Moderna.<p>Basically having much better aptitude than almost all humans, lacking mainly only equipment and support of an effort.  Statistics also say this person will remain unheard of and there is almost no chance there will be any widespread benefit from this persons life&#x27;s work, no matter if even more unlikely challenges of any kind are more thoroughly overcome.<p>It&#x27;s just too tall an order and for best results it might take someone who could carefully select the right 1 percent to work with from all the resources both of these companies have that might be helpful, plus lots of other companies and institutions.<p>But the person who might be found in that well-resourced kind of position never seems to be able to be the right kind of person.<p>I predict that scientists will one day discover your theory of government can be leveraged for more widespread benefit to humanity than probably all of your professors&#x27; accomplishments combined, if they were the kind not fully respecting your focused effort.<p>EDIT: added hierarchy-free')
