I&#x27;m not pro-bad-enforcement, and I&#x27;m sure the phenomenon you point out does exist to some extent, just as we see in law enforcement.<p>The &quot;the evil mediocrities that enforce COCs&quot; comment that I replied to is low-effort and worse than useless. The &quot;all cops are bastards&quot; phrase has a similar level of subtlety and utility. Describing all conference organisers and community moderators as &quot;<i>evil</i>&quot; is nigh on absurd, and yet that comment has been upvoted, and my reply is on -3. That&#x27;s evidence enough that my reply was needed - as Jeremy mentioned in his blog post, there&#x27;s an irrational destroy-all-COCs meme going around lately.')
