I remember getting the impression that a Pi 4 working under that kind of load, and throttling pretty constantly, would probably suffer roughly a 15% performance degradation but I didn&#x27;t test that assumption much.<p>I had a funny moment during testing of comparing an 8GB and 4GB Pi 4, each with different revisions of the firmware, and wondering how the hell the temperatures could be so different.')
