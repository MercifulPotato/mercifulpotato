The first thing that should always be done is answer the question as asked.  Do what ever you want after that but anyone who doesn&#x27;t should have their post removed.<p>The issue is this: it is completely irrelevant <i>why</i> the person asking wants to do X or A.  Stackoverflow and others are public websites and anyone who <i>ever will</i> want to do X&#x2F;A will probably only find that page as an answer.  It is beyond arrogant to assume anyone who could ever ask the question is just missing your guidance on what they <i>really</i> want to do.<p>To be concrete, I find myself in these situations due to company restrictions that I simply cannot lift.  So I need to do something I know very well shouldn&#x27;t be done or fail (and someone else will do that or worse anyway).  So I search all over the web and find a Stackoverflow page... that tells me why I shouldn&#x27;t be doing it.  And since it&#x27;s been &quot;answered&quot; no one else will ever bother, and if I ask anywhere I get linked to that page.')
