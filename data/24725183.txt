I do both at work where we have about 15 ML engineers and only 2-3 of them are capable of doing something novel. Maybe you mean something different by “research” but it is very hard to teach someone how to come up with an idea or a novel method publishable in a top conference. Teaching engineering on the other hand usually goes like this: “Here’s how this works. Here are your options, tradeoffs, pitfalls.” After you’ve done it a few times you mastered it.<p>I forgot who said it: “In engineering, if you don’t know what you’re doing you shouldn’t be doing it. In science, if you know what you’re doing you shouldn’t be doing it.“')
