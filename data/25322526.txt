Any advice?<p>In my experience, this has stopped working so well in the last few years with companies tending to call customers&#x27; bluffs.<p>In most cases the best solution is: stop giving them money and go to the competitor.<p>Don&#x27;t threaten legal action unless you already plan to follow it through: companies know this is unlikely to be followed up and will stonewall you.<p>If the industry has an ineffective regulator&#x2F;ombudsman then going to a competitor might not help. In that case, I&#x27;d write a polite letter to your national member of parliament. (They are more likely to make this go away by fixing your personal problem, not instigating industry changes, so write with that in mind)')
