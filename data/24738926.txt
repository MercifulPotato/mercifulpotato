Iâ€™d like to see a better data-centric analysis; dolphin safe campaigns have sufficient history to draw from.<p>Saving river dolphins in highly urbanized areas might be beyond any reasonable effort. Saving every traditional habitat, such as the St. Lawrence River for belugas, might also distract from ensuring sustainable habitats exist for each species with a broad range.')
