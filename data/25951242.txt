Suitable words to continue the sequence are highlighted in teal.  An internal state machine keeps track of what is allowed, according to rules of Japanese grammar.  An attempted translation is provided at the base of the page when a sentence is submitted so you can get a feel for what a potential meaning of the sentence created is.  A more socially-rich version of this is planned, with teacher oversight to ensure translation quality and intended meanings.')
