There probably are docs that say when to use Arc and when not to, but there&#x27;s still a cacophony of voices saying &quot;just use Arc and deal with performance issues later&quot; and it&#x27;s hard for a newbie to understand whom to listen to. Note that this isn&#x27;t a criticism of Rust, but rather a rough edge that I&#x27;m confident will eventually be polished off.')
