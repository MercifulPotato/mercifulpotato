(A couple years, by now?) That changed, without any indication as to why, and even the text ‘the app doesn&#x27;t use the net permission’ remained on the store page.<p>Edit: it seems the permission is again dropped—see user reviews for indication that it was indeed once used. For such a personal and important piece of software I for one will prefer an app that doesn&#x27;t flip-flop on this decision—who&#x27;s to say that it won&#x27;t flip again tomorrow? The app is great; it being closed, not so much.')
