It was age discrimination, but it wasn&#x27;t the company discriminating.<p>The rules have changed.  Similar grants are available for anyone 16 or older now, so the opportunity should be available at any employable age.<p>There&#x27;s still an age bias, but it&#x27;s in the amount of money now.  The total grant amount is higher for younger people than older people, with several steps.  But on the other hand, the minimum wage is lower for younger people, and other things like housing benefit are also lower for younger people.')
