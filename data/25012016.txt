Intel seems to be plagued by various mismanagement and doesn&#x27;t have a strong record as a contract fab for the other companies that may need a competitor to TSMC. If you&#x27;re going to save somebody it may make as much sense to try to get one of the other players back into the state of the art game, like GlobalFoundries, which also operates several good (but not as good as TSMC) contract fabs in the US.')
