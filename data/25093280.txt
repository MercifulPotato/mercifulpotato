Search engines are terrible solution for trying to find a specific thing with broad categorical terms. All you will get are referral and affiliate websites that most definitely don&#x27;t contain the most accurate, trustworthy, or up-to-date information.<p>I think at the moment, best information is discovered through recommendations of other people via twitter, slack, whatsapp groups, etc. But resurfacing that info later on is hard, so you need to act immediately.<p>My point is, when people find obscure things that will&#x2F;might come handy soon or later, they tend to keep them open in the browser as a way of temporary storing them. First, because native bookmarks are a terrible solution where you quickly run out of space and keeping them organised is too much work. Second, because keeping them open serves as a visual reminder to get back to it (once bookmarked they are out of sight, out of mind).<p>This is precisely the reason why we developed Tablerone. It&#x27;s an Chrome extension that serves as a bookmarking system (saving and organising entire sessions) and as a tab manager (easier navigation). \n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tabler.one&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tabler.one&#x2F;</a><p>By having an easily accessible and private space to store information you are still processing or intend to return later liberates you of the need to keep them open. As a result you get a concise timeline overview of your browsing history, that makes it much easier to later search through with broad categorical terms.<p>I&#x27;m very eager to hear what you think about this.')
