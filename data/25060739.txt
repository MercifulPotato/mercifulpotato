I can see what you&#x27;re saying, but on the other hand I look at the sheer panic some communities experienced at the fear of running out of toilet paper and the anxiety people have over what might come next, and I just can&#x27;t relate because I haven&#x27;t missed the slightest beat in 2020. From simply going camping regularly, being involved in community emergency plans, and always buying in bulk to ensure I have a buffer, I think things could get several orders of magnitude worse before I&#x27;m even slightly inconvenienced.<p>Local 911 stops responding to calls because they&#x27;re overwhelmed during riots? Not to worry - that wilderness EMT course and the kit I built after it should cover most things life threatening things reasonably well. Grocery store is cleaned out or shut down for weeks? I&#x27;ll just go check the basement shelves. Local school can&#x27;t open without enough PPE? Oh I can supply a bunch of teachers with N95 masks for weeks and still have plenty for myself. All the utilities could shut down, and I could keep my family and several neighbors comfortable and safe for quite some time.<p>I was a little less carefree than most people before this, but boy I&#x27;m relatively carefree now. There&#x27;s been some real hardship for people in this pandemic that few could prepare for, but I was surprised how few people were prepared to have to stay in their home for a couple of weeks in areas that are routinely hit by natural disasters that might place a similar burden on them at any time. Now&#x27;s a good time to evaluate if you can deal with other things that might happen: an ounce of preparation.')
