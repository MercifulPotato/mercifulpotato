I model Japanese workers as being pretty meticulous, but it strains credulity to believe they are carefully authenticating such stamps. (How would you even?) I suspect that system is vulnerable to a similar attack to this one, it&#x27;s just that the risks outweigh the benefits.<p>Which also goes for the situation we&#x27;re discussing.
