There will be far more interest in being able to run Linux on that hardware, and in being able to keep it up to date (since it&#x27;ll be a daily driver).<p>2. Apple are probably less likely to regularly make drastic changes between hardware revisions because they will need to support multiple hardware revisions themselves (Apple are typically pretty good with supporting old hardware). Their only strong motivator would be to actively prevent people running other OSes but I don&#x27;t think Apple care that much about screwing over that niche demographic - especially when they&#x27;re already paying for the hardware.')
