Some examples just from browsing this site:<p>Kitchenaid Refrigerator - Unless it&#x27;s a lemon, any refrigerator should last at least 10 years. Although all are at risk for the coolant leaking, but all can be repaired. I don&#x27;t really see what would set a &quot;BIFL&quot; fridge apart.<p>Nalgene - I had a few Nalgenes that I thought would last forever, then the harm of BPA was discovered. I&#x27;m now wary of any water bottle made of plastic. I&#x27;ve got a stainless canteen, but I still don&#x27;t consider this &quot;for life&quot; as they can get dented, you might need to buy more for trips etc.<p>Socks - No matter how sturdy they look when new, eventually they&#x27;re going to end up worn through. Buy yourself nice socks, especially for hiking. But they&#x27;re a wear item, not capital equipment.')
