Also, I think what interviewers are attempting is called &quot;assessment&quot;, and I can say these tests are the absolute laziest version of it.<p>Genuine assessment is very hard. I worked at a leading bootcamp you would know the name of and was asked by $BIGCO to create a one dimensional assessment for all (guessing) 10000 of their programmers, so they would know who to fire. I refused. It isn&#x27;t that simple.<p>I think a company like hackerank likely got that contract.')
