Sometimes from random place in the US, sometimes from random places in the world. I also work remotely, and have worked remotely, for big corps. I don&#x27;t see this as a career limiter at all, it&#x27;s much less stressful to do presentations&#x2F;meetings remotely, it&#x27;s also much easier to control your own time. You also save more, if you don&#x27;t live in a big city. Now, if you like living in a big city, then of course it sucks, but the other side is that you spend most of your time at home so it&#x27;s nice to have a bigger home with an office.')
