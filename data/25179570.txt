Item(by='pdonis', descendants=None, kids=[25179755], score=None, time=1606069045, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25179403, text='<i>&gt; Your statement that &quot;scientific worldview, which is diametrically opposed to religious culture&quot; is itself a dogma</i><p>No, it isn&#x27;t, it&#x27;s a description. I <i>described</i> what I mean by &quot;scientific worldview&quot; and by &quot;religious culture&quot;. It should be evident from my descriptions that the two things I described are diametrically opposed. I think my descriptions have fairly captured the two world views in question. If you disagree, by all means make an argument; but just calling my descriptions &quot;dogma&quot; is not an argument.<p><i>&gt; which is exactly the feature of religion you claim to have surpassed as a scientific person</i><p>I have made no such claim. I explicitly contrasted the scientific <i>worldview</i> with the behavior of individual persons. I also said nothing about &quot;surpassing&quot; anything.<p><i>&gt; My point isn&#x27;t to take sides but to point out that what you are calling religion is some kind of oppositional faction defined by rejecting scientific fact.</i><p>Again, if you disagree with my description of &quot;religious culture&quot;, by all means make an argument for a different description. My description certainly does not describe all aspects of religion; but I think I have focused in on a key aspect that makes religious culture different from the scientific worldview.<p><i>&gt; Religious reality was originally and for thousands of years the only reality</i><p>The level of historical ignorance in this statement is staggering. A true statement would be that humans have had religions for as far back as we have historical evidence. But that is a much, much weaker statement than your claim here.<p><i>&gt; just at you proclaim that scientific realism is reality and reject any other</i><p>I have said no such thing. I have no idea what you are responding to, but it isn&#x27;t anything I said.<p><i>&gt; scientific culture resemblance to religious culture isn&#x27;t coincidence</i><p>Before you start making claims about why such a resemblance exists, you first have to establish <i>that</i> it exists. You have not done that.')
