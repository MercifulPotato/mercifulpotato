And sometimes I have exchanges with ahmetb on Twitter.<p>I cannot dispute the fact that Google has more developers working on k8s than AWS does. And that AWS developers have been focused more on making sure that k8s works great on AWS, rather than the core code. I&#x27;ve heard folks say that they think that k8s works better on Google because of all the Google developers using it. And that might have been true at some point.
