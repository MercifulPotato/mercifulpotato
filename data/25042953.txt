Getting a bank account is not the chore you are making it out to be. A securities broker for trading stocks -- that I have never tried -- but when it comes to opening a regular bank account, there are no major hurdles whatsoever. Your expat friends, assuming they are living legally in another country, got bank accounts because it is easy to do, not because they were lucky.<p>The one exception to this would be those living in another country without any formal residence permit, then in that case, it would be problematic in any country since you are technically not allowed to actually live there and many countries do not allow that for citizens of other countries (not just the U.S.).<p>I&#x27;ve lived all over the world and I have never known a single person in the American expat community who was denied opening a regular bank account anywhere -- again, assuming they were legally living in the foreign country.')
