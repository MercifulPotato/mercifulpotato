We write code for it to be changed. We know to a certain extend how the specifications, design and code are likely to change over time. We anticipate the kind of abstractions needed to accommodate that change.<p>This in turn influences the choice of programming language, unit testing, naming, modularization, infrastructure...<p>Just as a simple counter example: I write my code so I minimize the amount of state and provide good type information. The advantage is that future (re-)composition in other abstractions of the code will continue to work.')
