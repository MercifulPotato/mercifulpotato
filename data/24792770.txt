Do I have to record and transmit everything that happened an hour ago?  Or how do I figure out which part needs to be transferred, aside from a clear screen which obviously resets it.<p>So that outline is exactly what I am seeing is being patented.  They do mention they are using &quot;hierarchies&quot; to figure out what needs to be synced.  But a hierarchy is one of the most fundamental categories of data structure so that really doesn&#x27;t narrow it down.<p>So now if you&#x27;re going to hook into a graphics library and use any kind of hierarchy and then transmit it to be updated somewhere else, you have to be worried about the details of this patent? Because what I am seeing is the basic logic that stems directly from the starting point of trying to transmit the graphics at that rendering level.<p>Like if I go fork Skia and hack into a renderer saving the commands into some queue to be compressed and streamed, and keep track of when a new window is opened or shown (a hierarchy), it seems like I will be putting myself at risk of this patent because it is so generic.')
