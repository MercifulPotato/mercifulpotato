You can&#x27;t use children as an excuse to put the lives of others at risk. Realize what you&#x27;re saying here.<p>People driving cars they can&#x27;t afford to upkeep are also risking themselves and others.<p>Yes, it sucks. I empathize. I shouldn&#x27;t be throwing stones. But if I&#x27;m a juror on a vehicular homicide case I&#x27;m not going to think less of deaths that were caused because the defendant had children to take to school. It would be more compelling than a DUI case, but it doesn&#x27;t bring people back to life.')
