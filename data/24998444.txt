There&#x27;s obviously some good tips you can get about your site performance from here, but Google&#x27;s Page Speed Insights are about making a site a good search result which isn&#x27;t the same as a good website overall.<p>If you only target the PageSpeed score you&#x27;ll optimise for loading a page quickly when linked from Google.  This then allows users to easily click back and forth between Google search results and different sites. This may not be the users you should be primarily optimising for.  For example, if you have larger JavaScript bundles you will get penalised in PageSpeed, even if for most of your users this will overall be a benefit.<p>If you care about your page ranking you do have to care about this score as it is an input to that, but it is not an unbiased view of overall site performance.')
