Item(by='ksec', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607973542, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25412249, text='That is the problem I have with Apple Services as a whole, that is Apple Music, Apple TV+, Apple News+ and Apple Arcade.<p>None of these were started because Apple thinks they could do better and contribute something, a word Steve Jobs likes to use. They are doing it simply because they needed those Services Revenue. Something to dilute down their near 100% App Store Margin and Google Search Placement.<p>Apple Music was something they wanted to save iTunes &#x2F; Music as a Business. And they bought in Jimmy Iovine for that god damn &quot;Next Song&quot; idea.<p>Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade were part of the grand plan for Apple One. Unlike iCloud, Apple Music and Apple News+, Apple TV and Arcade does not have any per unit cost. iCloud are cost &#x2F; GB, Music are cost per song played, and News are cost per article read. TV shows and Arcade Games are paid as a whole at a fixed cost regardless of users. This give opportunity for Apple to bundle them at a discount.<p>One could argue Apple Fitness+ is more like iTunes where it is used to sell more Apple Watch &#x2F; iPod. And it isn&#x27;t out yet so I am giving it some benefits of doubt.')
