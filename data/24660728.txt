I think pretty much everyone I&#x27;ve introduced to it has found the same.<p>As others have alluded to, I feel like often solutions people propose in the world of JS dev (and I&#x27;m sure elsewhere) can be overly fussy and complicated, just to achieve some notion of &quot;purity&quot; or whatever. MobX is a pragmatic solution and that aligns with the pragmatic way I generally like to work, so I&#x27;m happy to trade off some &quot;magic&quot; for a great developer experience, and I&#x27;d really recommend everyone try it at least once!')
