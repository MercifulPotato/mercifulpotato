A person violates whatever smart contract they have agreed to and they&#x27;re automatically penalized, with courts or anyone else being unable to undo this - even if the contract was for, say, illegal activity. If the entire economy of any area runs on whatever crypto tokens, a person could have no choice but to agree to one of these contracts.<p>It&#x27;s fairly unlikely to happen, admittedly, but the point is the entire exercise is a blue print for a Libertarian Party Utopia&#x2F;Dystopia, depending on one&#x27;s interpretation of the situation. My interpretation is extreme dystopia.')
