Item(by='baryphonic', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607617076, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25370142, text='&gt; Funny thing is Democratic party and Biden themselves are center-right by most reasonable international definitions. The fact that republicans try to paint Biden and Democratic parties as radical left is laughable to most people with an international view.<p>We just had a summer in which armed gangs of self-identified Leftists roamed the streets of our major cities, set fire to buildings, harassed random passers-by and assaulted (and in a few cases, murdered) anyone they unilaterally labeled a &quot;fascist&quot; (i.e. anyone to the right of Mao). These Democrats you speak of were for three months ignoring the violence; when they occasionally admitted that violence had taken place, they claimed it was all perpetrated by right-wing agitators; when that didn&#x27;t work (because who actually believes that right-wingers are spray-painting anarchy symbols, &quot;BLM,&quot; &quot;ACAB,&quot; and other slogans?), their propaganda mouthpieces calling it &quot;mostly peaceful protest.&quot;<p>Do I think Biden is some hard leftist? No. But certainly his party feels extremely constrained in criticizing the hard left, and also feel that they must kowtow down to them.<p>&gt; This also gives insight into the Republican style of pushing out falsities just for the sake of being in power.<p>This is a complete non-sequitur. The fact that US definitions of left and right (as mentioned in a sibling comment) differ from international ones &quot;gives insight&quot; into one particular political party lying? What?<p>Isn&#x27;t the objective of every political party to obtain power, or at least influence? Don&#x27;t all political parties &quot;push[] out falsities&quot; in order to obtain or retain power?<p>The one wrinkle here is that the Republicans (nor anyone on the Right - US definition) absolutely lack real political power, since they have no control over the bureaucracy, the media or the academe. Trump himself figured this out much too late, and wasted years appointing people who had no interest in carrying out his agenda. But in some ways, this is the exception that proves the rule.')
