Yes, the algorithms have had some horrifying effects, and yes, they have intentionally engineered their products to be addictive, and they deserve to be criticized and punished for those behaviors, but we also need to take a hard look at ourselves and admit that some of this is a consequence of the darker corners of the human heart. It&#x27;s not like we didn&#x27;t have holy wars and genocide before Facebook. To some degree we are all complicit in this problem. I&#x27;m not trying to be a defeatist and say that we shouldn&#x27;t try to improve things, but if we adopt this attitude of &quot;let&#x27;s just abolish the tech giants and everything will be great,&quot; we&#x27;re letting ourselves off the hook and I believe that our unwillingness to face the deeper problem will prevent it from being solved.')
