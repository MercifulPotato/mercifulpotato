So when things like the service they used to host the content clear up old content, things don&#x27;t get reuploaded.<p>I really hope that these tweets are not only stored, but stored in a way that makes it difficult to prevent manipulation. I think many of Trump&#x27;s tweets (and his family) are historic. Hopefully they&#x27;re archived in a way that they last decades&#x2F;centuries.')
