In the Civil War, people who lived in the south were already surrounded by other people who lived in the south, so no amplication was needed to fan the flames.  But with social media you have these individuals  who would <i>normally</i> be surrounded by reasonable people in their social circles, instead being herded together by engagement-optimizing algorithms.<p>Yes, the determined will always find a way to socialize with only like-minded people, but tech companies don&#x27;t have to <i>optimize</i> for it.  They could sacrifice some ad-revenue by optimizing for diverse thought, not echo chambers.  And that would be a hell of a lot more aminable to free speech than picking and choosing what opinions belong on their platforms.')
