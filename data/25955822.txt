You have enough savings for 1-10 years (yes, that&#x27;s a big range).<p>But yeah, it&#x27;s a fair point. For some people, it&#x27;s not living hand-to-mouth. For others, it&#x27;s being able to have a mortgage rather than rent. [insert-my-definition]. For others, it&#x27;s being able to live without working indefinitely. For others, it&#x27;s being able to launch businesses from a personal bank account. I was vague.<p>In my area: The rent &#x2F; mortgage eats the lion&#x27;s share of your runway. If you&#x27;re paying rent &#x2F; mortgage, your savings don&#x27;t go very far. If you&#x27;ve paid off your home, it&#x27;s easy to stash enough away to live like a graduate student for a few years. If you own your home, you can also always scrunch together, and rent out a room.<p>The generational flip side is:<p>- Your kids inherit your house and your savings some day. That should be enough to cover much debt, or if you have many kids, at least down payments.<p>- Your kids can move in with you anytime, if they&#x27;re laid off, launching a startup, going through a tough time, or just want to save some money. It&#x27;s a safety net.')
