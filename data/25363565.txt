The cases are being dismissed for procedural reasons, which (depending on the specific case) can amount to &quot;you should have brought your suit sooner&quot; or &quot;your evidence is inadmissible in the court of law&quot; or &quot;even if everything you say is true, you have not demonstrated that you have been harmed.&quot; The lawyers aren&#x27;t being allowed to present evidence because they haven&#x27;t even managed to demonstrate that they have a reason to present evidence--which is a pretty low bar to clear.')
