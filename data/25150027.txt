The amount of commercials was shocking since I&#x27;m so used to streaming. I kept thinking &quot;why do we still have to watch commercials if we&#x27;re paying for the service?&quot;.<p>Then I realized it&#x27;s only a matter of time before Netflix, Hulu, etc. start doing the same thing. Hopefully I&#x27;m wrong.')
