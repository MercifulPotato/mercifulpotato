Globally there are estimated to be about 15 million &quot;double orphans&quot;, and 90% of them live with extended family. Of those that don&#x27;t, frequently there is extended family or at least known families of their own culture&#x2F;ethnicity&#x2F;country who could take them in if given financial support - which is not only cheaper than adopting them from the US, but doesn&#x27;t cut their ties to home. \nAside from that, more than 90% are over the age of 5. Almost none are actually babies, and of course children orphaned at birth may have inherited AIDS or have other health issues due to whatever killed their parents. Adopting a healthy foreign baby from the US is more likely than not to involve some form of human rights violation just to make them available to you.\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.soschildrensvillages.ca&#x2F;orphan-crisis-sub-saharan-africa2" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.soschildrensvillages.ca&#x2F;orphan-crisis-sub-sahara...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.unicef.org&#x2F;media&#x2F;orphans" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.unicef.org&#x2F;media&#x2F;orphans</a>')
