Take DNS: your edge servers listen for UDP packets, slap PROXY headers on them, relay the packets to worker servers, unwrap them, and deliver them to containers. You can intercept all of UDP with AF_PACKET sockets, and write the last hop packet that way too to fake addresses out. And at first, that&#x27;s how I implemented this for Fly.&quot;<p>This is really interesting. I looked at the linked blog post and was hoping there was more implementation details. Does your Fly pi-hole use HAProxy and the PROXY headers then? Is the config for that available anywhere i could see?')
