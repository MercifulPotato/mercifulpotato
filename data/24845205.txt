I recall reading somewhere that the cost of jumping between JS and C++ land was a source of slowdowns with the DOM API, so there&#x27;s that too.<p>But overall, I agree with the idea of incorporating the ideas that are working into the platform. There have been various discussion over the years about how virtual dom could work as a native browser API, but unfortunately, the needle hasn&#x27;t moved there at all.')
