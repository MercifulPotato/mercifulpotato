Trump tried to delegitimize the former president, like he&#x27;s trying to delegitimize the incoming president. He&#x27;s always been anti-American insofar as he is exclusively pro-Trump.<p>Abraham Lincoln said that all controversies are about minorities and majorities, and that one of them must submit, or the government ceases. There is no alternative. And that if the losing states of the 1860 election were permitted to secede, it would be the end of self-rule, the end of democracy. And he decided that could not be permitted.<p>In the 2016 election, a majority of voters elected Clinton. They submitted to the minority because that is what the Constitution required. And they did it peacefully. Clinton conceded the day after the election.<p>Fast forward to 2020, Trump has gotten 2&#x2F;3rds of the Republicans in the House to debase themselves. They are now a sedition caucus, selling these lies too. As well as several Republicans in the Senate. The lie that they are not the minority. And the lie that they do not have to submit. They can fight instead.<p>This is a non-insurable proposition, because the majority was never going to submit this time.<p>The message being broadcast for two months is: cease the government. That is why violence broke out in 1861, that&#x27;s why it broke out last week, in the first violent transfer of power since then.<p>BLM riots vs capitol attack? Not at all the same thing. Not at all the same risk. And the whataboutism? Sounds like white nationalist nonsense to me.')
