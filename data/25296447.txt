Geekbench gives a score of ~7400 for the M1s. Assuming the firestorms represent some 80% of the CPU power and multiplying by 6 (6x4=24), we would get a Geekbench score around 35000.<p>That would place it between a 32- and 64-core threadripper.<p>I know, that&#x27;s a lot of handwaving!<p>I must admit, while I have a lot of doubts that Apple can simply scale up to 24+ core M1s while having acceptable yield, what they have going for them is low amount of heat with current core count and clock speed. So I think, they might also be able to increase the clock speed significantly from here.<p>But, I have been wondering if their plan is instead to create an m1x (4+8 core), and then combine up-to 3-4 m1xs in the Mac Pro and iMac Pro machines to get up-to 24-32 total cores. That way they might still have high yield and only a few lines of chips (keeping the supply chain tight, which seems like Apple &#x2F; Tim Cook&#x27;s MO).')
