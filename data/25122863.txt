It&#x27;s an API to interact with a torsor.<p>We have files, which are inert objects and form a &quot;file space&quot;. We have diffs. Diffs can &quot;act&quot; on a file to produce a new file or a conflict --- we call this as &quot;applying a patch&quot;. Mathematicians would call it a &quot;group(oid) action&quot;. Diffs are a groupoid because (1) there&#x27;s an identity diff that does nothing, (2) diffs can be smashed together, (3) if the smashing of diffs succeeds, the operation of concatenation is associative, (4) all diffs are invertible. If we were to delete added lines and add the deleted lines, this inverts the diff.<p>Finally, we have a rooted DAG where each node is a diff, and the root is the empty diff. Git queries enable to manipulate paths in the DAG, which corresponds to smashing together diffs along a path to produce a file.<p>If one groks this, the rest of git is a pretty poor interface on top of this nice mathematical structure.<p>For more physics-y applications of torsors, check out the baez article: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;math.ucr.edu&#x2F;home&#x2F;baez&#x2F;torsors.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;math.ucr.edu&#x2F;home&#x2F;baez&#x2F;torsors.html</a>')
