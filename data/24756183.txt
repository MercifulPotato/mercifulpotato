There are just so many mysteries that remain within our current understanding of science, we can’t say for sure that it’s not easy (for example) to bend space time or some other possibility that makes faster than light travel possible. Quantum entanglement, for example, breaks many of our assumptions about the impossibility of FTL travel.<p>&gt; When aliens visit, everyone will know.<p>Maybe, but perhaps a civilisation that has survived the great filter would look differently at civilisations they stumble upon. Maybe, like we do when searching for microbes on Mars, they would try not to disturb the life they discover.<p>This is all just speculation of course, but I think when looking at this topic it’s all too easy to apply a human centric view on what’s possible and what’s not, and the truth is we just know so very little. Or, we know a lot, but there are so many more mysteries than solved problems.')
