PCs can run even very very old software because at least the architecture is the same. There is no good way to emulate the CELL cpu of the PS3 on modern x86 architecture, and even emulating PS2 architecture is very very difficult and full of caveats. That&#x27;s not forced obscolescence, like you said - it&#x27;s just obsolescence.')
