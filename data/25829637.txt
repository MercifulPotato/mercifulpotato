So it may not be AT&amp;T that is wholly responsible for it, but Bell Labs did kickstart most of these. Well, except the phone booths :)<p>(Also, the alternate interpretation is that AT&amp;T is providing the interconnection necessary to power these innovations, for one the iPhone was introduced by AT&amp;T (mainly because they were the only willing ones to allow Apple to update them independently) so in a more pragmatic sense AT&amp;T <i>did</i> deliver the future. But on the flipside, some might consider it to be cheating.)')
