This makes <i>no sense</i> for GME, but, it also makes no sense for MSFT, whose value has more than doubled in price since three years ago with no increase in dividends. It doesn&#x27;t make sense for TLSA, which doesn&#x27;t even have dividends and doesn&#x27;t do buybacks (and even has outstanding ATMs!). It doesn&#x27;t make sense for GOOG, it doesn&#x27;t make sense for AMD, it doesn&#x27;t make sense for NVDA.<p>Let&#x27;s assume that you&#x27;re right, and that nearly every tech stock, automotive stock, and stock for any company the average person has heard of, or is in an index, is drastically overvalued. Is there any event that would cause the value to &quot;correct&quot;? Some shift causing people to sell their TLSA and buy F, whose value is &quot;more correct&quot;? And if not: what makes the value based on this more correct than the value you can access through trades?')
