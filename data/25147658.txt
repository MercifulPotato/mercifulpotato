The claim was that it would reduce the cost.<p>But you agree that it would increase the developer split.  Thats good enough for me.  Glad you agree that it would increase the developer revenue split.<p>&gt; At the moment they do.<p>Ok, and it is still a good thing, that in the moment, for a certain period of time, that developers would get a better revenue split.  Thats still good.<p>&gt;  it won&#x27;t benefit anyone except for EPIC.<p>I would still rather that a game developer get more of the money that their game makes.  Thats still good.<p>&gt; Also EPIC are buying their way in.<p>Ok.  Even so.  That means that in the mean time, developers could benefit from Epic buying their way in.  Thats still good.<p>&gt; That was the agreement between them and the app publisher.<p>But the agreement could be illegally anti-competitive.  Therefore your argument would not be valid in that case.<p>&gt; They are owed that money<p>You have no basis for claiming this to be the case, because the lawsuit could still find the arrangement to be illegal, and also the law could be changed later.<p>&gt; . EPIC want a sea of launchers<p>If a game company wants to have their own launcher, that should be their right to do so.  I would be happy that they get a larger cut, from having their own launcher.<p>&gt; It is about one large company EPIC trying to force another large company&#x27;s hand<p>The precendent that is set would allow other app stores to be on the IPhone as well.  Even if you think Epic is doing it for its own benefits, the precent set would allow other game developers or app stores, to be on the IPhone.  That helps those groups.<p>&gt; There will be two dominate app stores.<p>I still prefer 2 app stores to 1 app store.  Also, it would allow a 3rd and 4th or 4th app store to be in the Iphone, if anyone wanted to do that.<p>&gt;  it won&#x27;t be the indie dev hacker<p>Well, it would help any indie dev hacker that is now allowed to be on the IPhone, without being forced to go through apple.  Those people would benefit.')
