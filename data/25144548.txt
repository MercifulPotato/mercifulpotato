Evolution is about the population, and pretty much disregards the individual unless that &quot;beneficial&quot; individual makes sweeping positive changes in the next generation. I don&#x27;t think 80 year olds are reproducing all that often these days, so at least my understanding of how evolution works doesn&#x27;t apply to this. Aging out of individuals is a way of keeping that balance.<p>More technically:<p>In evolutionary computation, there is a specific area focused on scaling. The quick gist is that the warmer and larger an organism is, the more energy is required to keep its population alive. Populations of different organisms tend to use the same amount of energy. This is why you have dense populations of bacteria and ants, but not of elephants and hippos. When that goes awry, parts of one or the other population dies off to keep that balance.<p>So the more predators there are, the more prey is needed to support the predator population. The models present that the sum of all biological activities in any given population scales with the individual&#x27;s mass by a power of 3&#x2F;4. This rule shows up everywhere in nature, except for one.<p>Humans are the only life form known that violates this principle, and our population is already hyper-dense by a factor of 58,000 times over all other life forms. Domestication of plants and animals (farming) and industrial advances have propelled us beyond that limit.<p>Living so far beyond reproduction and family-building age is an exercise in the law of diminishing returns.')
