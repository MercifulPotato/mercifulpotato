The UK NHS provides universal coverage.<p>Part of the problem is that Medicare is actively prevented from being cost-effective. E.g. there are restrictions on its ability to negotiate prices in many instances, whereas the NHS will actively use all the leverage it has by coordinating purchases across the board. I&#x27;m sure that alone would not solve the issue, but it&#x27;s unnecessary hard to get support for universal healthcare as long as Medicare is as expensive as it is.<p>Fixing that would make it harder to argue against Medicare expansion. To start with you could expand coverage substantially simply by allowing any savings to go towards expanding coverage.<p>&gt; Eventually, it would only be the wealthy who were still on the private insurance only system. Then employers can gradually replace health coverage with other benefits.<p>It&#x27;s worth noting that this is pretty much how it is in the UK. We do have private cover, but only about 10% of the population uses it. Notably it&#x27;s generally &quot;add on&quot; coverage in that almost all policies expect you to rely on the NHS for basics, but lets you pretty much use the policy to queue jump to private hospitals if the NHS is &quot;too slow&quot; or for services above and beyond what the NHS offers. As such that&#x27;s 10% despite UK policies being generally far cheaper, since they don&#x27;t need to cover things like ambulances and ER&#x2F;A&amp;E (whenever anyone complains about the NHS this is a pretty essential point: the NHS is good enough that there <i>isn&#x27;t a sustainable market</i> sufficient to compete with it; it&#x27;s not perfect, but as long as private cover is as limited both in takeup and what it provides as it is, that&#x27;s a pretty good indicator)')
