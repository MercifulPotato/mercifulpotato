On a Mac, you can do this with the option-escape keyboard shortcut.<p>- Read it out loud yourself, slowly.<p>- Leave at least 24 hours between drafting and proofreading, longer if possible.<p>- Print the text in a different font and proofread on paper, marking errors with a pen.<p>- Use a &quot;focus mode&quot; that dims everything but the sentence you&#x27;re proofreading. Read through each sentence slowly and deliberately. iA Writer can do this, as can a few other text editors.<p>- Use tools like Grammarly, but consider what they say guidance rather than hard-and-fast rules. They are often wrong or have an overly narrow definition of correctness, but they will help you to catch typos and and errors such as repeated words.<p>However, depending on time and money constraints, it&#x27;s often more efficient to pay someone to do it for you.')
