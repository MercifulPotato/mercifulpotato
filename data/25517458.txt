And banks can currently get loans from the US government and other funds for around 0.03%. So if you were a banker and you got a loan for 50T from the US government as long as interest rates remained low for the next 21 years you would have a company making 20B in profit and a cost of 15B servicing the debt. And the next year it would be 40B in profit and 15B costs.<p>So the question you are asking is what are rates going to be for servicing debt over the next 20 years? If rates go up to 8% 50T is probably too high for the stock.<p>The reason TSLA&#x27;s stock is so low currently is because there is no guarantee that it will continue to grow at the same rate over the next 15 years.')
