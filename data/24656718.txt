Most people will probably save money.<p>I was offered this &quot;choice&quot; back in 2013.  Despite the fact that I (and my co-workers) were almost completely remote already, we were told that if we didn&#x27;t relocate to Tallahassee, FL from NYC and accept a 20% pay cut, we would need to find new employment.<p>Even worse, should we accept this &quot;generous offer&quot; we would be guaranteed employment for 12 months (presumably long enough for them to find and hire locals who are compensated less, then have us train them).<p>I did the math and while I could certainly save on rent, the costs of an automobile, its fuel and maintenance, including insurance made the transition close to a wash for me.<p>I&#x27;d also point out that NYC is a wonderful, urban place to live.  While Tallahassee is a typical sprawling, suburban place with limited (although more so than some other parts of Florida due to UofFL and it being the state capital) culturally diverse stuff.<p>I chose not to do so (as did all but one of my colleagues -- who did so at great personal sacrifice to make sure she could continue to support her family) and haven&#x27;t looked back.<p>My experience is that such plans tend to be a salary dump by the company, made worse by the ability to slowly replace those who relocate with much cheaper local resources.<p>Why would you want to uproot your life (and that of your family, if you have one) just so you can be replaced by someone cheaper in the not-so-distant future?<p>That&#x27;s not to say such a plan isn&#x27;t a good thing for some people, but I found it to be not worth it.')
