Teenagers also use them when paying with their own money because you can&#x27;t have a credit card until you&#x27;re 18 unless it&#x27;s an authorized user card on your parents&#x27; account. Costco used to make you pay with a debit card, if I remember correctly.<p>But those are pretty much edge cases. Credit builder and secured credit cards exist for people with poor or no credit.')
