Do they experience in most interactions negative prejudice, or are they only experiencing it in isolated cases, or even not at all?<p>The way I see it, the learning we should take from the US is, that as a member of the majority, one should avoid having a prejudice of how that experience will be. Because our n of those experiences will indeed be too small to tell. And if those people are telling us that their experience is bad, not to reject it as the exception (a few bad apples).')
