To me, that sounds like saying we can go colder than 0 kelvin.<p>Maybe better store of value isn&#x27;t the wrong choice of words, but better in terms of having the same store of value properties + more resistant to attack, better privacy, easier to secure, easier to use, scalable etc.<p>There are projects trying to be better than bitcoin on technical fronts, but it needs to be an order of magnitude better to offset the current moment and network effects at this point, unless a real attack on the bitcoin network threatens its security.')
