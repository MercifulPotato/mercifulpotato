That&#x27;s why you&#x27;re confused. According to Google Rockstar Canada made Grand Theft Auto: London 1969 and Grand Theft Auto: London 1961 which are expansions.<p>Rockstar North are the main developer of the mainline GTA games, and they get subsidised because of that, because it&#x27;s made in Britain and is recognised as &quot;culturally British&quot;. Which, it sort of is, everyone knows GTA is made in Scotland.')
