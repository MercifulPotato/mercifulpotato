As far as I understand their reasoning (although I don&#x27;t agree with it), is that some people buy drugs when they are easily accessible over the internet, but wouldn&#x27;t do so if they have to meet risky people in person AFK. Of course, people who want drugs will get drugs, somehow, and if it&#x27;s safer, that&#x27;d be better. But they want people to move into the riskier meat-space as it&#x27;s easier to keep track on people and eventually arrest them then.')
