Item(by='Arnt', descendants=None, kids=[25684034], score=None, time=1610107717, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25682981, text='When my wife was an editor at a linux-related magazine, she used to complain about how some article authors would send in drafts that described in detail how to &#x27;configure; make; make install&#x27; and left out all of the substantive issues. If the subject software had a concept of priority, these articles would explain how to set priority using &#x27;configure&#x27; but not whether priority=2 was higher or lower than priority=1.<p>This article reminds me of that â€” &quot;we need x&quot; and then a big void instead of discussion about why we don&#x27;t have x or what we might do to get x.<p>We don&#x27;t know why only one of the big providers started interoperating with XMPP. But we do know why that one stopped again: A terrible wave of spammy contact requests. They were able to fight intra-gtalk spam much more effectively than spam that originated via XMPP.<p>Someone who wants app authors (and IM providers) to support an XMPP-like protocol could investigate and write about how an XMPP-like protocol could be made unfriendly to spam. That would be interesting and IMO useful, completely unlike this article.')
