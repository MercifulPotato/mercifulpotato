Everybody gets the same low price for every drug we make.<p>While this sounds good in practice, will it work in reality? I remember a pharma sales guy explaining that one of the ways his company got away with being more expensive than the competition was to practically give the medicine away to hospitals, so that the hospital would be more likely to prescribe it than the cheap generics, after which point the patients would just keep refilling the same meds (with the higher price then picked up by insurance)<p>In any case, I wish this company good luck! The US really could use more &quot;maverick competitors&quot; in the medical space')
