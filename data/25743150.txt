I needed two types of batteries but these webshops are more like marketplaces. They don&#x27;t have a feature to search for items from a particular vendor. But I was able to simply browse and order the two types of batteries from a single vendor.<p>Next day: two packages. From the same vendor.<p>(Now that I think about it, the original sin was buying a product that is not rechargeable.)')
