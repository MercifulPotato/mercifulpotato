They accidentally over-complicate everything, in the most unhelpful way possible. If you have a senior developer that does that, I would consider them a mid-level developer at best.<p>I&#x27;ve seen this play out in 2 large companies I&#x27;ve contracted for so far.<p>At the start of a new project, recruitment look for developers with the lowest daily rate they can find and end up with a team of recent grads &#x2F; people switching careers within the company etc. That&#x27;s all fine as long as you add a good measure of developers with &gt;5 yrs relevant experience to the mix. But as these people are twice as expensive, they often start without them.<p>A few years later the product &quot;almost&quot; works. But it&#x27;s full of bugs, it takes months instead of days to make minor changes, and it still requires an enormous team of people who are all irreplaceable (they possess the &quot;secret&quot; knowledge about the product that usually would be embodied in clear code intentions, past jira tickets, commit history, basic documentation etc.)<p>Meanwhile a new competitor in the market has developed a much better product.<p>This situation can last for years (because some companies are a bottomless money pit, despite being tight with it)<p>Eventually some expensive people get hired to put the &quot;finishing touches&quot; on the product and they start the long slog to fix it up (or just quit in horror after a few weeks)<p>So far:\n1) retired the entire project after years of development\n2) company got bought out and the product scrapped after several years of investing money on it\n3) is in progress (company has enough money to fund the situation for years, but time will tell if we manage to untangle the mess before it kills the project)')
