There’s still Map.prototype.forEach, which is entirely sufficient.<p>Also, iteration is not the only purpose of Map; its real value is that you can use keys of any type, and I’ve used Map and WeakMap a number of times without having needed any form of iteration—e.g. avoiding polluting every element I need to track data on (MY_DATA: Symbol; Element[MY_DATA]: MyData), maintaining a WeakMap&lt;Element, MyData&gt; instead.')
