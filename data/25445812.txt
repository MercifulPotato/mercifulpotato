In order to outweigh all the cons of working in academia, you really have to have a deep passion or obsession with the particular problem you are researching. In my opinion, being _just_ interested is not enough, and that&#x27;s where I found myself. I drove myself down the academic career path because I thought I would find meaning and purpose there, but when I didn&#x27;t find it all of the pressures and toxicity of academia just didn&#x27;t seem worth it. It&#x27;s only been two years since I left, and sure there are some things that I miss, but I definitely do not regret leaving.')
