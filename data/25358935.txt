You would lose your array if the wrong two drives fail!&quot;<p>But drive failure is much more likely during an operation like a resilver&#x2F;resync, and I wonder if the majority of people espousing more risky RAID a setups (especially single parity) are those who just want hundreds of TB for a growing media collection.<p>I know for my critical data, I don&#x27;t trust parity. Plus I can&#x27;t afford the days or weeks long resilver operation, I need a working storage array that doesn&#x27;t suffer drastically in performance if one drive goes bad.')
