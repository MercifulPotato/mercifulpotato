Where did you come up with that?<p>OPâ€™s comment, which you seem to be arguing in favor of. Apologies if I misinterpreted.<p>&gt; Either the corporation or the government has the power.<p>Obviously. So long as there are anti-monopolistic practices in place, you can choose the corporation you want to interface with easily. Nothing is stopping OP from buying an Android phone, PinePhone, or Purism Librem 5.<p>Governments are not something you can choose, not really, and giving them wholesale control of how corporations can create tech products is granting them an absurd level of power, especially when viable alternatives <i>already exist</i> on the free market.')
