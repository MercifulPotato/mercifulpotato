Item(by='kbenson', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601956725, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24694434, text='&gt; It is not normal to go from being a little tired to being so tired that you can actually fall asleep at the wheel just like that.<p>The point is that it isn&#x27;t &quot;just like that&quot;, but not everyone has experience with passing out from being tired while trying to continue doing something they were actively trying trying to concentrate on.<p>&gt; If you&#x27;re going to do something like that, you need to plan the journey sensibly, take plenty of breaks, make sure you got extra rest before you leave. Don&#x27;t they teach this sort of stuff in basic driver training where you are?<p>Obviously not well enough, or I had forgotten some of it in the almost decade between taking the classes and actually experiencing it for the first time.  And to be clear, I thought I was being cautious, it was definitely not my first time making that trip, and I didn&#x27;t think I was so tired I would lose consciousness, and yet one second I was fine, and the next second (to my consciousness) I noticed I was halfway across the center divider.  I didn&#x27;t feel any more tired than I had on a a prior trip, yet, the conclusion is obvious, that level of tiredness feeling <i>might</i> lead to that outcome, therefore it was no longer acceptable.<p>So, here&#x27;s the thing, prior to that situation I thought I was being responsible, and had years of experience to go by that indicated I could drive in that state.  All it takes is once occurrence to let you know that what you thought as fine was not.<p>What exactly was a I supposed to obviously know from that beforehand?  It&#x27;s nice if you&#x27;ve always been able to know the correct level to stop at, or perhaps you stop far earlier than strictly needed, which is fine.  You would never know if you stopped with plenty of attentive time left you could drive, but better safe than sorry.<p>All I see this meaning is that different people have different thresholds for this, and all I was saying originally is that I wish there was a way for us to impart this experience better during driver training, so people knew what the warning signs are better, in case their internal calibration was too far on the dangerous side initially, like mine was.')
