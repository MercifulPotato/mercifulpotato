Item(by='BoiledCabbage', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601692713, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24664154, text='&gt; Also, here&#x27;s the thing about &quot;liberty&quot;: If you&#x27;re not a hypocrite, you don&#x27;t attempt to control other people or decide what decisions they&#x27;re allowed to make (barring things that would directly harm others) whether you agree with them or not.<p>And this here is I believe the crux of the issue. As you say absolute liberty requires absolute capitalism. And absolute capitalism by design incentives a number of negative societal behaviors. And companies forced to compete with those that perform those negative behaviors have to chose to either adopt them as well or go out of business - pushing them to adopt those behaviors.<p>So the conclusion is absolute liberty causes negative behavior. The idealistic view is absolute liberty is the primary virtue of society. Or in my opinion the more accurate view, is that liberty like many other essential virtues must be balanced with other factors in society.<p>My interpretation of you perspective is that absolute liberty is essential, anything less is hypocrisy - and the way you manage those views is by downplaying the negative impacts of what capitalism incentivises.<p>And note, I&#x27;m not saying capitalism is wrong (I absolutely believe is the best approach for economic efficiency) simply that it, just like liberty cannot be absolute. It must be balanced with negative impacts on society.')
