So you have to go much further back to find a point when someone&#x27;s genes would be present in all modern-day humans.<p>In particular, if you have a male ancestor at the Identical Ancestor Point but the lineage from them to you passes through a woman at any point in the family tree, you would not get that male ancestor&#x27;s Y-chromosome via that line of descent.<p>Or put yet another way, if you are male, you have 2^N (possibly overlapping) ancestors N generations back, but only _1_ ancestor N generations back that contributed your Y-chromosome.  Comparing to a different male, the chance that you share Y-chromosomes is naively something like 1&#x2F;P where P is the size of the male population at the time, while the chance that you share your ancestor sets is a much more complicated calculation, and the article claims it&#x27;s ~1.')
