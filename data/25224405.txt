I just don&#x27;t see the point in adding another, severely limited syscall batching thingy, certainly not now, even moreso  with talk about ebpf logic joining the party.<p>BTW as mentioned in a sibling comment, you might want to check out mingo&#x27;s syslets proposition, which has similar naive batching, but was also async.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lwn.net&#x2F;Articles&#x2F;221887&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lwn.net&#x2F;Articles&#x2F;221887&#x2F;</a>')
