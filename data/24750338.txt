Item(by='rotexo', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602462423, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24749430, text='David Byrne’s book “How Music Works” has an interesting bit about how the common contemporary way of recording recording (recording different tracks separately) can feel very unnatural for bands that are used to playing live, in an actual acoustic space. In addition to listeners having two audio channels in, the performers do also, which influences their perception of how the music sounds, which influences how they perform, and so on. As others discuss in this thread, there is an exacting art involved in applying effects to recreate a sense of acoustic space from the dry tracks of individual musical performances. Which is a long way of saying: it is unclear why the consumer would want those dry individual tracks, when the performers themselves want the effects applied.')
