The Street Fighter series has had any number of opportunities to &quot;fix&quot; behavior that some players consider &quot;cheap&quot; or an exploit. Developers have kept them in. If using those moves deprives another player of fun, that doesn&#x27;t mean it shod be removed. There is always a winner and a loser, and someone who loses repeatedly to the same technique isn&#x27;t any more entitled to the fun of winning. Winning is not meant to be a resource evenly divided among all players. Winning is predicated on skill, which is also not evenly divided among all players. Given effective counters, which always exist, calling other players cheap for having developed a novel play style amounts to a sense of winning as entitlement rather than earned.<p>Again, the above presupposes intentional design, or judgement that emergent behavior nonetheless keeps gameplay in balance..')
