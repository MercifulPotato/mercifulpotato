Taking this to the extreme, there would be no such concept as a grammatical error. Or even syntax, for that matter.<p>If a native speaker says &#x27;loose&#x27; instead of &#x27;lose&#x27; (or &#x27;rouge&#x27; vs &#x27;rogue&#x27;) did they just create a new dialect? Shouldn&#x27;t we consider these as being &#x27;mistakes&#x27; - until such a time these forms are the new accepted norm?<p>What about vocabulary? There are natives who never bothered reading a book, and thus are limited in their vocabulary. Are they &#x27;masters&#x27; of their language? Is the lack of knowledge about certain words also to be considered a dialect?<p>I am not sure one&#x27;s upbringing gives them any authority on language usage. Collectively, sure. Not on an individual basis.')
