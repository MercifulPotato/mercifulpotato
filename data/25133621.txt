If I&#x27;m too detailed, they will get lost. If I&#x27;m very concise (but still <i>complete</i>), they&#x27;ll misinterpret.<p>Getting people to reflect back to you what they understood is encouraged in most communications books. You can write the perfect email, and it will still get misunderstood.<p><i>Edit</i>:<p>It is amusing that people are responding giving me writing advice. Equally amusing is the implicit tone in some of the comments that I&#x27;m doing it wrong and implying I don&#x27;t follow what they are suggesting - especially when I didn&#x27;t even discuss how I write my emails!<p>As I said: You can write the perfect email, and there will always be someone who <i>will</i> misinterpret it. The problem is not merely in the content, but in the other (including their worldview, culture, social status, etc). The solution isn&#x27;t to try to become a more perfect writer, but to understand the dynamics involved in communication (written or verbal).<p>To paraphrase one of the books: People will interpret what you say based on their worldview - something that you often do not have access to. It&#x27;s their worldview that will often make them misinterpret something that is very clear and unambiguous in what you say. Accept that reality and work around it.')
