In most games I’ve played (and I’ve played many different ones on iPhone, computer, and consoles), I don’t think I’ve seen that. Usually once you’re stuck, they’ll let you know and you have to start a new game.<p>I have, however, often seen them allow you to replay the same setup to try and beat it again. Many also allow undo (sometimes limited, sometimes unlimited) to reverse your moves to get out of being stuck.')
