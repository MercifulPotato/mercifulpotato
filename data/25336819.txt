I think I&#x27;ll stay for a while longer bc:<p>- I enjoy not needing a car. Many neighborhoods are walkable.<p>- I appreciate the mild weather. E.g. I lived in NYC, and though I did not need a car, humid summers and snowy winters made it less pleasant to be outside.<p>- It&#x27;s dense but not _too_ dense. NYC felt legitimately claustrophobic sometimes.<p>- It&#x27;s still an LGBT mecca. Prior to the pandemic, I could be in queer spaces on a daily basis.<p>I don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;ll be in SF forever. But when I think of moving, I wonder where I would go, and what my life would look like when I get there. I grew up in suburbs and still associate those neighborhoods with isolation. Among US cities, it&#x27;s hard to meet all of these.')
