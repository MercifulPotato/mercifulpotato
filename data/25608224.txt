Disinformation is in the same category as phishing, social engineering, and online scams; they’re just targeted at more than one mark at a time.<p>We deal with phishing with both education <i>and</i> blocking. Because I could, right now, craft a phishing email targeting my own company that would get an 85%+ success rate of stealing their SSO passwords. No amount of education could realistically stop me because I know just what buttons to press. We would respond to this by yoinking the email out of everyone’s inbox.<p>The debate is what are the acceptable measures to deal with the it which spawns a secondary debate about how large the problem is which determines how aggressive is acceptable.')
