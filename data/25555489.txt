I would like it to sprout its fruit from a small unit, like a branch, thatâ€™s hooked up to the nutrient bath.<p>Then this small unit can be mechanically organized and sorted by the robotic farm operating system.<p>The whole system would work in orchestration, where seedlings are germinated into saplings. Then put into a grow box, to collect its nutrients. And then put into an assembly line for it to grow, and be harvested. Then when it is ripe, it gets harvested by a robotic arm picker.<p>All fully automated, organically grown, no pesticides or very limited usage. Then automatically washed and hermetically packaged for sale at your local grocery store. Or delivered to you by Amazon Grocery Services.')
