Because of the <i>risk</i> involved with an unproven candidate. That&#x27;s literally in the article.<p>It&#x27;s &#x27;financially crazy&#x27; for them to invest billions ramping up on an unproven vaccine. But only &#x27;crazy&#x27; for them, not for us. This speaks to the dysfunction of markets in crisis situations.<p>And why are we entrusting the manufacture of this essential IP to only one company? Pfizer? Because they paid for it? &#x27;We&#x27; can &#x27;pay for it&#x27; as well. And we can pay a <i>lot</i> more.<p>If the government established royalty rates for a vaccine, thereby ensuring Pfizer gets a cut if the vaccine is a winner, and allows any manufacturer meeting regs to manufacture it, you&#x27;d 10x production.<p>If the government basically &#x27;pre-paid&#x27; or provided guaranteed credit for any manufacturer (up to standard) for any &#x27;early candidate&#x27; vaccine, then not only would 10 manufacturers be involved - not just one - but they would have started 5 months ago.<p>It would have been &#x27;insanely&#x27; more expensive to do it this way, probably costing 10x as much.<p>... but it&#x27;s actually not &#x27;insane&#x27; is my point, it&#x27;s extremely rational for us to put $200B on the table to accelerate this by 5 months. It&#x27;s a bargain. It&#x27;s a win-win-win - Pfizer frankly makes just as much profit (royalties have no underlying unit cost), manufacturers make some, Americans are safer and the economy starts earlier.<p>We handled it &#x27;poorly&#x27; because we didn&#x27;t manage the situation, put in the right regs, or create the right incentives.')
