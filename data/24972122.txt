One, it wasn&#x27;t actually geared to go that fast. Or two, the driver lifted because the car was unstable or he was afraid the tires were gonna explode or something.<p>It seems unlikely that people capable of building a car like this would have released a claimed speed that their car was incapable of reaching due to gearing.
