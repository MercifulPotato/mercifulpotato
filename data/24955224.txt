PHP is eating the world!<p>Come on man, you&#x27;re well aware none of those &quot;web scale&quot; companies are running major portions of their sites on PHP anymore. Well, you <i>should</i> be aware of that.<p>You can keep fighting for PHP if you want. Don&#x27;t pretend that it&#x27;s worse is better nature fifteen years ago somehow made it a <i>good</i> language or that it didn&#x27;t have major failings.<p>I wrote a ton of PHP 3 through 5. It was easier to deploy on $10 shared hosting than Perl&#x2F;CGI and more capable than SSI. That was about it in terms of its advantages at the time. It wasn&#x27;t easier to write than Perl and in fact had more and less obvious footguns. It&#x27;s database access was shaky at best and downright dangerous at worst.<p>The question today is why bother with PHP for greenfield development? It doesn&#x27;t really offer anything unique or special. You can&#x27;t really leverage your PHP skills anywhere but web development and really only a subset of that field. So good luck with that.')
