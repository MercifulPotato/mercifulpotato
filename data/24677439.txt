But largely it&#x27;s the work of hundreds of people, morphing over time to try and find what will be right.<p>Critics can have this illusion, too: <i>Auteur</i> theory posits that films have an author, that author being the director, and you can see that director&#x27;s style manifest in the films they make. Sometimes, sure, this is obvious: Hitchcock, Kubrick, Tarantino... they all made or make films with a distinctive stamp on them.<p>Where this theory runs aground is where your comment comes in, filmmaking as a collaborative process. <i>Citizen Kane</i> was, for example, definitely a collaboration among at least three people: Welles, Mankiewicz, and Toland, the director, screenwriter, and cinematographer, respectively. They each contributed to the film as a finished product, a thing of words and images.<p>And then there&#x27;s the failure of the <i>auteur</i>: Ed Wood, Tommy Wiseau, people who had creative control through working outside the Hollywood system and, frankly, blew it. <i>Plan 9 From Outer Space</i> might be the <i>Citizen Kane</i> of laughably bad science fiction films, but it&#x27;s not the <i>Citizen Kane</i> of films. To make a baseball analogy, Wood tried hard, had plenty of heart, got up there, swung for the fences... and spun around like a top a few times before landing flat on his face, never even whiffing the ball. There&#x27;s a reason Burton made a sensitive film about him and his efforts.')
