Should it be Apple&#x27;s responsibility to tell their tenant to kick those people out? Or should the authorities be going straight to the tenant?<p>The worst part is that this isn&#x27;t even accurate. What this is really like is Apple sells a bunch of residences, the users are buying their homes, but for some reason all utilities&#x2F;cable&#x2F;internet&#x2F;etc. has to go through the real estate company that the house was purchased from as they dictate what you can and cannot do in that house. Even stranger, it is now somehow the real estate company&#x27;s place and responsibility to tell a telephone company that the real estate company allows to drop conference calls that mention the private information of some third party, whether the phone calls are coming from the houses purchased from them or not.')
