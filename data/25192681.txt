Also there was no cellular so the whole system depended on user interaction to get online.<p>When the main core wanted to talk to the Azure Sphere cloud service (from Linux user land), it would go through a remote attestation process that involved Pluton. Pluton can securely track what software was booted on the main core (called &quot;measure boot&quot;) and it basically sends a hash of that to the cloud to prove to the cloud what software is currently running.<p>So I imagine the chip-to-cloud thing they&#x27;re talking about is this remote attestation protocol.<p>Also, it&#x27;s possible the term &quot;Pluton&quot; has been expanded to refer to more than just the M4 chip we used in Azure Sphere.')
