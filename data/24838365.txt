The way we&#x27;ve built the core technology of our product is such that every component used in the builder is just a React component (and could be a Vue component or Svelte component), and even the controls in the sidebar, which we call panels, are also just React components. With this architecture, we plan to expose a public API where developers can just build their own Makeswift components and share them with the world. Someone could build a Stripe Checkout component, for example. Somebody else could build a table component that pulls the rows from Google Sheets, or Airtable, or from a Zoho API?<p>We&#x27;ve spent a lot of time thinking about the right architecture to pull this off. Today, we&#x27;re focusing on removing bottlenecks for marketers so that they can build beautiful websites with flexibility, fast. So because of that we are making all the components ourselves. In the future, though, we expect most components to be built by other people.')
