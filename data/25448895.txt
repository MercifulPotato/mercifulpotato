The former is what you need to know to do your job well (and much of that knowledge is at your disposal with a quick google search) but the latter is a useless skill that doesn&#x27;t help you with anything but passing a coding interview. If you want to be hired by FAANG, don&#x27;t waste your time learning intricate algorithms, but simply practice to solve coding puzzles in record time on whiteboards. It&#x27;s a totally different skill set.')
