I&#x27;m wondering if this has implications in physics ? Since &quot;the book of nature is written in mathematical language&quot;, does this mean that attempts to find a unified theory of everything are doomed ? I&#x27;m thinking not necessarily, since we wouldn&#x27;t need to prove all possible physical phenomena, only those that actually happen, but how do we know if they are among the one that can be proven ?')
