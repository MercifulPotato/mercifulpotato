IP doesn&#x27;t guarantee order; the kernel takes the segments of a TCP connection and then delivers them in order to the application as it reads from the socket.  It will hold segments that arrive early and block if a segment is missing.<p>If you don&#x27;t care about the order you are receiving things then you want UDP.<p>Is it better for userspace to do the sequencing?  Maybe given NUMA - a process might be &quot;closer&quot; to its memory than the kernel and therefore could eat its traffic in the correct order locally faster than being fed by the kernel.')
