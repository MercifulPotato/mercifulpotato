Arguing is presenting arguments that attempt to show (prove) why something is true or false. It&#x27;s the most important tool (convincing each other) in the progress of civilization. If you don&#x27;t try to convince each other, the only alternative, in the end, is just shoot whoever you disagree with.<p>And it also diminishes your value as a team member. If you can&#x27;t convince others, means the reasons you present are weak and nobody would be interested in listening to you and therefore there&#x27;s not much reason in having you around.')
