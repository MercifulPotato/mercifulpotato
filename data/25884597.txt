I will try to carve out time and prioritize his request, but I am in no way committed to his personal sense of urgency.<p>That&#x27;s fine, and that&#x27;s for you to decide. But Mike from Accounting may have a reason to withhold the details for a different channel or to mitigate against other potential risks.
