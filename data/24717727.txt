Just the fact that extensions exist?<p>From where I&#x27;m standing the only real problem with extensions in OpenGL is that they are all enabled by default so it&#x27;s easy to accidentally rely on one that happens to be supported by the hardware&#x2F;driver you are testing on. This is not the case with Vulkan where you explicitly need to ask for the extensions you want.')
