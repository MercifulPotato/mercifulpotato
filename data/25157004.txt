The average new build has 2000 ft of linear cracks that allow airflow. It&#x27;s like keeping your front and back door open all year around. Batt Insulation is rated to make batt insulation look good. It does not seal out airflow. If it were great wouldn&#x27;t we use it in our freezers and refrigerators?<p>If you want to use Insulation than I would suggest Spray Foam (closed cell or open cell).<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.demilec.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.demilec.com&#x2F;</a><p>It not only provides an air seal but can also act as a vapor barrier and is mold&#x2F;mildew proof and has no nutritional value for pests or bugs. Closed Cell Foam (2 lb -it;s called 2 lb because a cubic ft weighs 2 lb)will strengthen the racking strength of a framed wall 200%. The foam is basically free because after a few years it will pay itself off and it will last longer than your house. I&#x27;ve seen walls in schools sprayed 30 years ago that still look like they were done yesterday.<p>Unfortunately the mechanical of a house is hidden behind drywall. So it is out of sight and and of mind. People will not hesitate to spend 50k on a kitchen that can be replaced at some point without knocking down the house but they will look at you like you raped their sister and killed their mother when you give them a quote for 20k to spray their whole house. You get one chance to do it right and not to many people care.<p>Here is a shot of spraying the outside of a foundation wall. The entire inside was sprayed foamed also. This spray foamed foundation stops the cold from even getting to the outside walls. Many schools and commercial buildings are done like this.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;bZGyUJk" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;bZGyUJk</a><p>This house has geothermal HVAC and is entirely sprayed foamed. It has a fresh air recirc to keep it all healthy. HVAC bills are trivial, comfort is incredible in -40 or 100 +. I would be surprised if it cost more than $800 - $1000 a year to keep at a steady 78 in the winter and 72 in the summer. When the wood stove is going it heats the entire 2800 sq&#x2F;ft house. You can&#x27;t even hear thunder or heavy winds.<p>It was 24k to spray everything (2800 SQ&#x2F;FT house). A little cheaper than the kitchen if you count the appliances.')
