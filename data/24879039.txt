Lots of books have quite a few &quot;hapax legomenon&quot;, or... words that only appear once. If you&#x27;re trying to build long-tail vocab, Anki will make sure you get repeated exposure to words that occur infrequently in a particular text. One might argue that these words don&#x27;t matter as much since they&#x27;re less common, but once you&#x27;ve mastered all the common vocab in a language, building a broader vocabulary becomes more important.')
