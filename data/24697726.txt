I remember back in the day when I wanted to be a writer I used to retype short stories just to get out of writers block. After rewriting first few paragraphs I started to change things up and transform into my own story, meanwhile mimicking the rythm and the flow of the original author. It&#x27;s a good exercise just to get the right feeling.')
