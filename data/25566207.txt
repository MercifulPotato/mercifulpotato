Instead of standard packages your distro gives you, you have &quot;custom&quot; packages that also contain more specific installation instructions (write file with specific content, set environment variables, ...). I know that PKGBUILDs in Arch allow you to do such things if needed.<p>Bonus: now even configuration files can be linked to the software that needs it; when you remove a software you also remove all the files related to it and there are no leftovers.')
