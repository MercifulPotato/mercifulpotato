People who oppose discrimination on the basis of certain protected categories have the opportunity to explain why political views are not one of those categories.<p>So yes there&#x27;s a discussion to be had but its not easy to get off the ground floor on politically charged issues unless people have a well grounded and mutual understanding of the basics <i>and demonstrate that understanding.</i>')
