Visual interfaces are considered toys that &quot;real&quot; programmers don&#x27;t need.<p>You should at least consider the counter-hypothesis that C-style keyboard pounding is fundamentally more productive than visual interfaces.<p>This shouldn&#x27;t be that surprising. Text is much more informationally dense than audiovisual multimedia. There&#x27;s a reason why books are still the preferred medium for information transmission after thousands of years. Sci-fi style visual coding sure seems cool. But I highly doubt that it will ever be as productive as a skilled developer typing out variables, functions and classes.')
