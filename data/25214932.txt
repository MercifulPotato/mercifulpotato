I think you&#x27;re correct that if the increase in external pressure were uniform around the whole egg, it would not push fluid out of the pinhole.<p>Looking at this 2020 video[0], it seems like the procedure might be:<p>1) Laser burns pinhole through shell.<p>2) Robotic pipette applies the marker chemical onto pinhole.<p>3) Pneumatic grabber picks up egg by its pinhole end (so the atmospheric pressure, relatively higher than the pressure inside the grabber, is pushing a little fluid out).<p>4) Egg is stored so marker chemical can be read later after it has undergone its reaction.<p>I found a 2018 video as well[1], but the machine looks a lot different and it&#x27;s harder to tell how it works.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=OeAWcF1MxNo&amp;t=26s" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=OeAWcF1MxNo&amp;t=26s</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=dEtauP71oLU" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=dEtauP71oLU</a>')
