If it were per-user I would agree. Honestly, even knowing &quot;a private video was posted at such and such time&quot; for a website like Twitter isn&#x27;t a big deal (and this is good, because Twitter also uses an auto-increment key for all of their posts, or at least used to until not that long ago if somehow they recently stopped).<p>(FWIW, Facebook actually used auto-increment keys for a long long time for their users. I don&#x27;t remember when they stopped, but before they did they went through a long period of manual ID range allocation.)')
