Item(by='ben509', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602715078, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24781633, text='&gt; Do you think it&#x27;s acceptable for someone to circulate a manifesto that argues that conservatives are unlikely to make good engineers, because they are more authoritarian, and authoritarians are less creative, and are less likely to challenge the status quo?<p>Lefty shrinks churn out studies finding that conservatives are authoritarian, wet the bed, kick puppies, you name it, we&#x27;ve heard it all. So I doubt your premise since I&#x27;ve seen the reaction to this stuff being published, and it&#x27;s usually more bemusement than anything else.<p>But nothing Damore wrote was personally insulting to women like calling them &quot;authoritarian.&quot; His larger point was that women have, in aggregate, different interests than men.<p>Say, for the sake of argument, that there are some distinctly masculine priorities and distinctly feminine priorities. If so, our base assumption should be that they are equally morally valid.<p>And there&#x27;s plenty of evidence, e.g. college graduation rates, that professional women are somewhat more capable than men at identifying their interests and acting on them.<p>That means that if men and women pursue occupations to different degrees, our default assumption should be that they&#x27;re intelligent and capable and making decisions in their best interest, not that they&#x27;re victims.<p>That could all be true and it&#x27;s still possible that engineering is an unfriendly climate for women. The hard fact is there used to be a lot more women programming and it declined in the &#x27;80s.<p>But to whatever extent there&#x27;s a real feminine preference, we ought to respect women expressing such a preference and not try to save them from it.<p>&gt; And propose some policy changes that the company should take in its outreach to, and hiring of conservatives?<p>If, as Damore was, the manifesto is entirely supportive of the effort, it&#x27;s hard to see why it would be unacceptable. If the company has set out to do a thing, and someone wants to help them do it, you can&#x27;t fire them for that.<p>&gt; Even if it comes with citations to out-of-context, misunderstood, or under-reproduced political psychology studies<p>No, you can&#x27;t fire them for it even if they do poor work. Especially when, like Google, you still have trouble hiring as many women in engineering as you want.<p>Damore&#x27;s interpretation of the data may have been amateurish, but he&#x27;s presenting some analysis that could be improved upon to figure out a better strategy to achieve those goals.<p>You&#x27;re claiming a double standard, but if Google was serious about employing more women, they&#x27;d act on these ideas, even if the action was to dig into them and say &quot;nope, this stuff is wrong.&quot; Not fire the guy.<p>The picture the firing of Damore paints is that Google was more interested in showing that they cared about hiring more women than actually succeeding in hiring more women.<p>&gt; I&#x27;ll tell you what would happen if someone did that - the right wing media would have a field day with blasting both the author of such a manifesto, and the company that employs them.<p>The right-wing media is as garbage as any other media.<p>Even if the press were good, you&#x27;ve a cacophony of opinions, so you can&#x27;t make them all happy. You&#x27;re better off sticking up for your employees.')
