So it&#x27;s not exactly independent from whether end users are using margin.<p>It looks like RH let hordes of new users onto the platform and allowed them to put in GME orders before having those users&#x27; cash in the bank. Now the clearinghouse sees the volatility, throws up its hands and goes &quot;listen RH, no more of these crazy GME orders from you until you have the cash to pay for them&quot;. Understandable – but that should be RH&#x27;s problem, not that of its users.<p>What&#x27;s not OK is RH&#x27;s sledgehammer solution of disabling buying for <i>all</i> users, even those whose accounts are fully funded, not to mention force-selling people&#x27;s shares against their will. IMHO they deserve all of the anger and lawsuits currently directed at them. (Edit: unless, of course, they are only force-selling stocks that were bought on margin in the first place, and if their T&amp;C let them do that, in which case ¯\\_(ツ)_&#x2F;¯)')
