I used to really enjoy and appreciate Lua. I&#x27;ve even integrated it into some applications using the C libraries in the past. It&#x27;s always served me well.<p>But during the development of the game, things got so unruly that we ended up having to abandon it. The code itself was written as good as it could possibly be given the engine and for Lua, but we had a lot of really poor-performance hacks for the 1-based indexing, for example.<p>Further, the lack of proper operator overloading prevented us from using certain libraries to bind to it, e.g. Kiwi, for UI layouts.<p>Not sure I&#x27;ll ever use Lua as a scripting host in the future. There are a few alternatives I really think could suit the job better.')
