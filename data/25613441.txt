It’s a very brute force method of replacing lost parts. Teeth are the extension of our bodies and it’s connected to every aspect of life.<p>It’s similar to a living organ and is the sum total of our health. And what do we do with tooth loss? We replace it cosmetically and functionally.<p>We don’t see any other use for it. If we consider teeth regeneration like growing ourselves a kidney instead of a kidney transplant.(or heart), that would be the day anti ageing is in our sights.<p>But we have to first consider the problem and label it properly. It is known that plaque in teeth is indicative of heart plaque. Dental infections can get into the blood stream. Cavities point to other issues too. Dental health starts with gum health.<p>And yet..the remedy is not changing life style or eating habits or research into rejuvenation. But we knock them out and stick a ceramic one. Imagine if we stuck a silicone heart or a kidney like one would a breast implant. That’s the equivalent of fake teeth that is drilled and screwed to the jaw bone.<p>If we figure out how to regrow our teeth, half the battle is won.')
