They just use software for some end, and given their apparent lack of attention to detail, they will go out of business pretty soon<p>Most large companies in the world (e.g. banks) have appaling code and coding standards. As far as I know, none of them has yet gone bankrupt because of bad code.<p>I think we probably overestimate how important code is. The business world, esp. large companies, is very far from perfect (more of a big fat mess that somehow still works and produces money without its products killing people etc.) and it doesn&#x27;t need perfect code, the same way it doesn\nt need perfect accounting or perfect product design. In most cases, mediocrity will do, because the competition is just as mediocre.<p>If you want perfect (or even very good), become a hobbyist instead.')
