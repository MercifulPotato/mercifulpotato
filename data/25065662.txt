By allowing everything, you have to cycle through every possible solution to a problem to settle on the best one. With a more limited&#x2F;focused feature set, landing on the best solution -- even when it doesn&#x27;t quite match up to what you&#x27;d choose in the feature-rich environment -- is much easier. This difference can add up a lot over time, making a simpler tool easier to use because it takes less cognitive effort to find optimal solutions.')
