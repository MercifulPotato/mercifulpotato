But I&#x27;ve noticed no gender or geographic trend to this.  Some groups of men or women I&#x27;m able to converse with smoothly, as they seem to deliberately pause to let other&#x27;s speak.  In other groups, I&#x27;m hopeless.  Perhaps it&#x27;s an introvert&#x2F;extrovert divide (I&#x27;m skeptical of that dichotomy, but that&#x27;s another can of worms.)  I can talk comfortably one-on-one with my mother or any of her sisters, but put two or more of them in the same room and I&#x27;ll not get a word in edgewise.  For that matter, I also feel fine monologuing in front of an audience and always have, so I think it&#x27;s not simply a matter of shyness.')
