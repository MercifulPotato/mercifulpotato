Thick Bavarian accents are often considered intelligible in the rest of Germany. Even inside Bavaria dialects can range from &quot;easily understandable&quot; like a lot of Franconian, to something so thick that even other Bavarian&#x27;s might struggle with understanding, like some regional Upper Palatine dialects.<p>Often even small towns will have their very own accents.<p><i>&gt; Sure, but I guess that&#x27;s the price you pay for diversity, one I&#x27;m personally glad to pay.</i><p>I guess I&#x27;m just too utilitarian for that, my ideal version of humanity would speak one common language to improve cooperation and understanding among each other.<p>Dialects are cool and interesting, but there are already so many languages to learn, expecting people to learn a whole bunch of dialects for each of those, in addition to the language itself, is quite an impossible task for the vast majority of people who don&#x27;t learn languages for a living.')
