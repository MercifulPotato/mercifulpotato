I suppose the best historical corollary would be gold?  If so, I think we can agree that almost no one has adopted that practice.  Do you think Bitcoin is different enough than gold such that it would motivate different behavior?<p>Let&#x27;s consider the effects of owing tax in the national currency.  Retail businesses would owe sales tax in that currency, perhaps paid quarterly.  Rather than adding complexity to each sale, they&#x27;d probably price goods in the national currency, even if not a legal requirement (which it easily could be).  If goods are priced in national currency, it&#x27;s handy to keep your working capital in that same currency.  ...  The incentives start to align to keep the bulk of domestic economic activity using the domestic currency.<p>For comparison, we can look at behavior in countries which make significant use of some foreign currency.  For example, in some central American countries, banks make it easy to keep a USD-denomimated bank account.  Why do people want USD instead of gold?')
