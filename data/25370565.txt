I recall some low-estimate of how much a 25 minute episode costs that was around 80k$ for entry-level quality. It&#x27;s hard to know if that&#x27;s right, but if it is, that puts a season into the million-dollar investment range even for low quality stuff.\nThere aren&#x27;t that many potential buyers plus entertainment in Japan is expensive, so they price it high. So even fewer buy it.\nBut due to fans being ready to spend those amounts, I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if they found a maximum for profit at those price tags.')
