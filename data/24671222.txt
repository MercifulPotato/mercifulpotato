A supermarket &quot;user&quot; is free not just in theory but also in practice to use competing stores (and many people really do). Not just that: in most places, there <i>are</i> competing stores, quite a few of them, not to mention alternatives like online deliveries. If a goods producer can mass produce products for a supermarket, they&#x27;re likely also capable of paying for super-market independent marketing; i.e. they have independant channels of communication with the consumer, and can use tools like MSRP to suggest reasonable prices to avoid price-gouging by the supermarkets, and the difference in customer access to ads by the store or by the manufacturer isn&#x27;t huge. Additionally, a supermarket provides a valuable service to the producer beyond merely locked-in network effects: transporting tons of goods that last mile and distributing them to individuals requires quite a bit of work.<p>Compare that to app stores: users are in practice <i>not</i> free to pick another app store, even on android - network effects make using alternatives quite tricky and even risky, and the device&#x2F;OS maker don&#x27;t make it easy to pick reputable alternative stores.  App stores additionally leverage their monopoly on that user to hide their costs from them; e.g. in apples it&#x27;s not even allowed to <i>mention</i> the cut apple takes and where you might be able to buy more cheaply - and not just in the store, but even in the app itself, even indirectly!  There&#x27;s no MSRP by which to note that that 30% cut is extortionate. Finally whereas last-mile logistics are tricky for real-world goods, app store checkouts are not; almost the entire value provided is in network effects: i.e. the value is provided by the users of the app store, not the app store itself.<p>All of these disparate factors mean that app stores <i>clearly</i> are not a competitive market, whereas supermarkets aren&#x27;t quite as bad.  But let&#x27;s not forget: just because supermarkets are &quot;less bad&quot; than app stores doesn&#x27;t mean there&#x27;s no potential for market manipulation; we should be vigilant there too - just that the kind of manipulations supermarkets can pull off aren&#x27;t going to be quite as impactful.<p>TL;DR: not only are app stores much, much worse than supermarkets when it comes to harmful market manipulation, flaws in one market do not excuse flaws in another anyhow.')
