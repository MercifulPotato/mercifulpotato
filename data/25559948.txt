We maybe be mining, refining, and doing all our manufacturing in space.<p>All our industrial waste could just be jettisoned into the endless vacuum of space and the earth might just be for residential and commercial use.<p>Maybe I&#x27;m being fanciful, naive, or just dreaming too much, but it&#x27;s nice to imagine that kind of future where the earth is just a sanctuary to live and space is where the factories and the rubbish goes.')
