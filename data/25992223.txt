But...<p>ISIS has oil.<p>Germany wants oil.<p>ISIS wants to sell it.<p>Germany is willing to buy it.<p>All sounds rather simple and commercial to me. If thereâ€™s a concern about ISIS influence then the only real solution is to invest further in more diversified sources - eg via The Mediterranean so that multiple supplies exist in the event of geo-political strains.<p>That&#x27;s just silly. If you want ISIS to not wage wars then you do not buy oil from them.\nIf you want Russia to not kill Ukrainians and annex parts of countries in Europe then you do not buy oil or gas from them.')
