Can you guess which is which? I can&#x27;t. append is actually &quot;append with directory separator&quot;, which is weird, because I&#x27;d expect append to be a string-like append to match the append function on std::string. Instead concat is a string-like append despite the fact std::string doesn&#x27;t have a concat member.<p>OTOH &#x2F; is an instant mnemonic cue for &quot;append with separator&quot;, and + matches the + on std::string.')
