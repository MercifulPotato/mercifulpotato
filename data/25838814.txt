But the thing is that their labor, which is <i>extremely</i> essential to the operation of the country (and the country would fail without their labor), requires more land than hands (especially as we&#x27;ve drastically introduced automation into their labor). We need food and natural resources, arguably more than we need investment bankers and programmers (not that we don&#x27;t need these things, but one is essential to being able to breathe). The idea is to create a system that can <i>fairly</i> represent those laborers too.')
