This is because of the free market changes introduced by the Lansley reforms. We&#x27;re struggling to move away from those in a way that doesn&#x27;t destroy the NHS. All the work around ICSs and STPs should help a bit, especially if NHSE+I start to devolve some of the specialist commissioning budget to local services.')
