A little less cynicism and a lot more research would be a good thing.<p>Bitcoin (and the wider body of crypto assets) has created huge global ecosystems and economies, minted millionaires and perhaps billionaires, advanced cryptography and blockchain technology, fundamentally changed the way we think about economic theory of money, pulled people around the world out of poverty, saved others from economic ruin, and caused a seismic shift in global politics.
