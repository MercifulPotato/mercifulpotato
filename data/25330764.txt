This level of centralization alone should tell you how the regulations are enacted to protect the corporations, not the people.<p>If Germany (and more generally Brussels) was actually serious about environmental regulations, VW and all the German car makers would be <i>exterminated</i> after Dieselgate. Instead they got one or two scapegoats for VW (and no, the CEO being ousted and still receiving a generous retirement package does not count) and made it clear that the regulations are there just to give the people the illusion of control.<p>&quot;For my friends, everything; for my enemies, the law&quot; -- this is what your democratically elected government is giving you.')
