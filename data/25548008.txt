Why does it matter if someone&#x27;s browser has exploitable bugs if the only sites they visit are those that are not likely to use such exploits?<p>So, such planned device obsolescence is conditional on two explicit actions on site owner&#x27;s side, (1), prohibiting http traffic, (2), prohibiting TLSv1.0 traffic.  So, it&#x27;s 100% site owner&#x27;s actions that cause the device to become obsolete and make your own site inaccessible.  The manufacturer has zero control over the actions of the individual site owners.  On the other end of the spectrum, Google, Microsoft, Bing, Amazon, Mozilla, plenty of other businesses, don&#x27;t intentionally go out of their way to disable both of those things, so, their sites still work -- including through HTTP in case of the search engines.  Which manifests as a definitive proof that it&#x27;s the fault of those other specific sites (like Wikipedia) that take explicit actions to make the older devices obsolete.<p>P.S. Incidentally, this also proves the point about capitalism -- as a result of misleading propaganda campaigns promoting HTTPS everywhere, most smaller sites are automatically and inadvertently acting as precursors for planned device obsolescence, whereas the big players that need to make the last cent out of every person in the world regardless of how old their device is, or what actions their provider takes against the encrypted traffic, are fully capable of getting exceptions to the PCI compliance or whatnot, and continuing to serve their sites through TLSv1.0 as well as plain old HTTP.')
