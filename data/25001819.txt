RIAA is a 3rd party authorized to act on behalf of the copyright holder, so they are allowed to send a DMCA takedown. Also the takedown is claiming DMCA section 1201, which is for bypassing DRM, not distributing infringing material.<p>tl;dr there probably isn&#x27;t anything inherently wrong with the RIAA&#x27;s claim, and there&#x27;s definitely nothing wrong with github&#x27;s response.<p>As for DMCAing an oil producer&#x27;s repository for something unrelated to DMCA, github would still take it down, but it&#x27;s quite likely that you&#x27;d end up with a lawsuit from the oil company for damages. As long as GitHub is run by a US company, it doesn&#x27;t matter how advocating they are of open source, nothing would change...they&#x27;d still take down the repository after receiving a DMCA takedown request.<p>And the last point, my understanding is apple wasn&#x27;t actually required to assist the FBI, but american companies are required to follow DMCA.')
