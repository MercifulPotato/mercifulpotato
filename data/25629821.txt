This is simply not an option for the vast majority of the world.<p>So we see this &quot;pay me, but no-one else, for the value I create&quot; nonsense, as though programmers alone should be exempt from the dynamics of supply and demand.<p>If we&#x27;re going to go down this path, then let&#x27;s pay nurses and doctors for the value they create, which has been proven to be extraordinarily substantial this year. Let&#x27;s pay supermarket cashiers, truck drivers and shelf-stackers - the people who had to literally risk their lives so that the rest of us could have food available during this pandemic - for the value they created in the rest of us not starving. Let&#x27;s pay child care workers and teachers for the value they create, which I wager will often be far greater than what some programmers contribute.')
