For example, many of us have extensive experience running communities and&#x2F;or have seen how quickly bad actors will overrun even well-intentioned unmoderated communities.<p>Other folks here do not necessarily have this experience, don&#x27;t see the extensive &quot;gardening&quot; that happens in the background of healthy online communities (see: dang), and believe that all human problems can be solved by implementation details like protocols.<p>There&#x27;s the saying, &quot;When all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.&quot; Do HNers know of good resources for folks who only have a hammer, but want to develop a more holistic, humanistic understanding of online communities?')
