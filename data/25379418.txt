Item(by='ardy42', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607638005, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25378883, text='&gt;  Did you notice that article is in the opinion section? That implies it&#x27;s a work of fiction. No fact checking needed.<p>That is factually untrue (as I also pointed out in the other sub-thread where you made the same claim): they do fact check their opinion section:<p>The below quote is from a previous NYT Op-ed editor that describes their editorial process. Emphasis is mine.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2013&#x2F;10&#x2F;14&#x2F;opinion&#x2F;op-ed-and-you.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2013&#x2F;10&#x2F;14&#x2F;opinion&#x2F;op-ed-and-you.htm...</a>:<p>&gt; What happens when your article is accepted? First, you’ll get a contract giving us the right to publish it and laying out some of your responsibilities. <i>The most important ones have to do with originality and truthfulness.</i> You can’t plagiarize yourself, or someone else, and we won’t run something that has appeared in another publication, either print or digital. We request that you disclose anything that might be seen as a conflict of interest, financial or otherwise: Did you invest in a company that you praise in passing? Did you once work with a public official you mention in flattering or critical terms? Could you or an organization or company you represent benefit from the stance you take in an Op-Ed? We need to know. That doesn’t mean we’ll throw out your article on that basis — in most cases it just means disclosing the relationship to the reader. <i>We also need all of the material that supports the facts in your story. That’s the biggest surprise to some people. Yes, we do fact check.</i> Do we do it perfectly? Of course not. Everyone makes mistakes, and when we do we correct them. <i>But the facts in a piece must be supported and validated. You can have any opinion you would like, but you can’t say that a certain battle began on a certain day if it did not.</i>')
