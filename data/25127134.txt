How? By recreating their own vastly inferior and headache inducing implementations.<p>I believe that there&#x27;s an additional layer of skills between seniority and mastery. The former seems to be just about time and experience, whereas the latter adds a dimension of pragmatism and detachment. You become just a craftsman using tools with indifference to nimbly navigate complexity. You don&#x27;t blame your tools, you just understand them, strengths and weaknesses. You know when to leverage them and when to ditch them.')
