For example, say you have a system that manages bookings for a really popular musical act and frequently crashes with load when tickets go on sale. In that case it could be helpful to have the frontend service that deals with the booking requests isolated so it doesn&#x27;t bring down the rest of the system.<p>The problem is microservices for the sake of microservices, which seems to be the majority. When a design pattern is applied just because somebody is familiar with it and not because it&#x27;s the best fit to the problem at hand - that&#x27;s when things get messy.')
