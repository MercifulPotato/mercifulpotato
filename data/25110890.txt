The reality: It becomes impossible to recognize whether it&#x27;s a car or a truck or a bike or nothing above 200. I regularly drive 260 on the autobahn like many people do, but evening is the slow-down moment for most of us. The risk of wildlife is extreme at these speeds, too, fencing does not exist and&#x2F;or has holes. Trucks drive at night a lot, and you can&#x27;t see the properly at night; at these speeds, trucks that are side by side can appear like one being behind the another - very scary experience when you realize the reality (usually only ~30 meters behind).')
