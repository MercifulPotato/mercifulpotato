I suspect there&#x27;s a lot to be learned from &quot;those battle-tested lessons&quot;, but pretending everybody is learning them is a mistake.<p>Dependancies are inevitable.<p>I&#x27;m OK with depending on glibc and _almost_ as OK with depending on openssl. And of course I inevitable rely on gcc&#x2F;clang&#x2F;CPU microcode&#x2F;transistor photolithography...<p>But those examples are a world away from npm pulling in 12+ levels of random dependancies of unknown origin buried so deep it&#x27;s all but impossible to audit - and the segment of &quot;the software comm8unity&quot; who built that particular house-of-cards and then promotes it blindly to the segment of the software community who obliviously use it to generate code that runs on expensive production platforms in business critical applications just boggles my mind.<p>(And makes me alternately weep and drink heavily - having to support exactly that in production because &quot;velocity&quot; and &quot;moving fast and breaking things&quot; are considered more important that quality or security by both management and clients - both of who will happily point the finger of blame elsewhere when the inevitable happens, in spite of having been repeatedly warned... :sigh: )')
