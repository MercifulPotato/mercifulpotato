Probably Syria.<p>How did you come to that conclusion?  Though the question is far to ambiguous (what does &quot;killed by&quot; mean, <i>exactly?</i>),  I&#x27;d assume Germany would be ahead of Syria, given that any reasonable count would include those killed in the Holocaust plus allied casualties from WWI and WWII (where all cases where there&#x27;s clearly established intent to kill by the regime).  The Syrian civil was was bad, but not that bad.  I&#x27;m not aware of anything of similar magnitude there after 1900, and the numbers of anything before would be lessened by lower populations and less effective military technology.')
