That and reading a bunch of news&#x2F;comments like this thread helps me make a fairly quick decision to not purchase Chromecast.<p>I sincerely hope Google CEO or someone who really cares about their org&#x27;s reputation see people complaining about their product strategy. They should learn how to keep what&#x27;s working and most importantly, to not venture into anything unless they can commit to it for at least 10 years. Of course, they have their cash cow, which is the advertising&#x2F;search unit, so maybe they&#x27;ll never care.')
