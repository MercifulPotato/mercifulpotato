He&#x27;s being retconned as an idiot and a terrible person not by people in pursuit of 21st century social justice, but by the likes of Borges and Thomas Carlyle. Though the author has gone overboard by calling him &quot;the worst man in the world&quot;.<p>Personally, I like the Borges interpretation, that it needs to be thus for the narrative - the noble and brilliant Johnson contrasted with the base and feeble Boswell. Though I don&#x27;t get the Don Quixote comparison - isn&#x27;t Sancho Panza in some ways the smarter one in that relationship?')
