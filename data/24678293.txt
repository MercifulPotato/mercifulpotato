I think suppression of speech is something that must be pushed back against or it will be tacitly accepted.<p>Social media is the new public square, and Reddit tried to pretend it is a &quot;platform&quot;, while it makes large-scale editorial decisions. &#x2F;r&#x2F;chapotraphouse was an extremely far-left, anti-racist subreddit banned in this latest spree.
