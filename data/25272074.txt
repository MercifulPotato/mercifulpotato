What matters is doing the right thing. Even the history books don&#x27;t matter, even your long term &#x27;status&#x27; doesn&#x27;t matter, nor what people think, in principle. If you really did the right thing overall, and are seen as a monster... well, so be it.<p>In practice, however, things are more complicated. You have to be really certain of what you&#x27;re doing to go so much out there. If you&#x27;re misunderstood, things will become more difficult -- less funding chances perhaps, less people to talk with and exchange ideas, less people who understand and check your decisions -- it has to be sufficiently important and certain to overcome those problems.<p>The central issue however is learning. We want future (and current) generations to learn from our mistakes and non-mistakes. We want to share our insight with others. If we are misrepresented, this learning gets sacrificed, as well as your communication of ideas to peers, by definition. That&#x27;s a small tragedy.<p>You still have to do what you have to do, so to speak, if you must. The ultimate judge is not history, not the newspapers or peers, but your impact on the world, on the people (including yourself) -- not only now of course, but into the future as well.')
