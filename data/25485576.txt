If someone does some effort to answer a few questions first before asking themselves, they&#x27;re more likely to be serious. Otherwise it&#x27;s like those people on GitHub who open a ticket in your free repo and harrass you to fix it because they have a demo tomorrow!<p>BTW: writing detailed response from scratch should be an exception. In most cases the answer is already there in some existing question, but the person asking doesn&#x27;t know some keywords to find it. So you can use your knowledge of the subject and point them to existing answer. It&#x27;s faster this way and avoids duplicated content.')
