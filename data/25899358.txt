Are they worth the money? What type of tasks do you delegate?<p>So I have a couple of small projects (1-2 months of part-time work) that I&#x27;ve been wanting to build for some time (a small brochure&#x2F;booklet type thing), and I don&#x27;t really the time to work on the logistics.<p>I wanted to delegate all of the logistical work to a virtual assistant and all I&#x27;d do is review the process (&quot;no, yes, no, yes, that should be red&quot;, etc). Of course I&#x27;d be focused on the actual product and would be deeply working with the designer.<p>I need everything from researching freelancers on fiverr, upwork, etc to finding the right printing company, getting prototypes shipped to me, etc.<p>Has anyone got experience with working with VAs on this sort of thing? Would appreciate some input.<p>Thanks!')
