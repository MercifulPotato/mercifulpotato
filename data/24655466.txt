We&#x27;ve basically proven the need for our product and found our product market fit, but are now looking to expand and transform from what was effectively an MVP into something more robust and resilient, and are looking for a few motivated engineers to help us get there.<p>We&#x27;re looking for two backend engineers with some combination of experience or interest in the real estate market, data analysis, machine learning &#x2F; RNN &#x2F; etc. using Python &amp; Django (or maybe Flask) &#x2F; MySQL &#x2F; ElasticSearch. Depending on the candidates, this role may change, but we&#x27;re looking to refactor content ingestion from external data sources as well as the API and content platform serving the frontend from what is currently a PHP &amp; MySQL backend.<p>We&#x27;re also looking for a frontend engineer with an eye for final-level polish and precision. Someone who can at least lightly interact with a RESTful or GraphQL backend, translate Figma designs into fast-rendering React components, and do so while writing clean, readable code.<p>We&#x27;ve got no hard and fast requirements beyond the above (still developing the job postings) but we&#x27;re a small, lightly funded team with an aim to tackling big competitors, and are open to candidates of all levels. Interest, curiosity, and a willingness to own problems of all sorts are more important to us than strict experience.<p>If this sounds interesting to you, please contact barry@dwellsy.com, and use the subject line &quot;HN Posting&quot;')
