If you are just banging something out to prove a point or make a delivery then Python is often much easier.<p>Ofc this is like Excel and Notebooks - I start doing things in Excel because I can sort out an answer in like 30seconds. Doing it in a notebook requires 5 minutes, or maybe a little longer.
