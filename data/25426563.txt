This was actually one of the biggest selling points for me, I dug up lots of old articles and reddit threads and weighed the criticism against his responses. I thought it was endearing and refreshing and a really good sign to see the CEO have these discussions in public. It still gets to me too, reading his responses in this thread, I still want to believe they will do well by their students, but their track record doesn&#x27;t hold up. He is just a STELLAR marketer.<p>In Lambda slack, dissent is shut down immediately by &quot;student success&quot; staff directing you to DMs. Or an individual zoom chat, which is friendly and seemingly receptive to feedback, but ultimately pointless. A student-created poll with 90+ votes was posted after the changes went live, and it was taken down immediately, along with all feedback, to be replaced by their byzantine &quot;More Transparent&quot; survey system, conveniently delayed to be issued on a Friday evening, that could be twisted into yet another glowing report on the exciting new changes.<p>Lambda has plenty of real feedback and criticism (constructive and otherwise) and they have no interest in it. They make a very convincing show of listening and having meaningful discussions, but look at the form of the substantive changes. They&#x27;ve completely gutted their successful learning structure to replace it with something cheaper, and hide the damage in their reporting. But they&#x27;re still &quot;iterating&quot; so we&#x27;ll see, right?<p>My key criticisms: \n1. <i>Waves arms</i> This, all of this. The dishonesty.\n2. Removing TLs. The accountability and required meeting every day really made the difference between this and self-study. TLs were holding the program together.\n3. Instituting self grading with no human evaluation, even for end-of-module tests. You can join &quot;code review&quot; group calls but it&#x27;s voluntary, there&#x27;s no one checking your work at the end of the section.\n4. Cutting the curriculum (there is no python instruction) Opting into the &quot;extended curriculum&quot; just means you repeat the same thing twice.<p>If you&#x27;re considering joining, also be aware that he deletes comments and tweets, and is the moderator of the subreddit. From what I&#x27;ve seen, the style is to allow the dissent, maybe even engage, and then quietly delete it later after things have blown over. What you see online may be curated even if it seems like it&#x27;s outside the purview of Lambda official channels.')
