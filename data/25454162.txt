However, for non-fiction, when you are in a vicinity of the genre one typically read, you can practically pick up and glide along with the text. For instance, I read a lot about Entrepreneurship, Startups, Philosophy, etc. Quite a bit of the context overlap more than one can imagine. There are times when it goes in my head, &quot;yeah! now it will be that, this, but does this have anything different.&quot;<p>During my normal reading speed, if things don&#x27;t &quot;click&quot;, I go back and play back what I read. I don&#x27;t speed read all the time.<p>For flights, I like picking up much smaller physical books (200-ish page). You start reading while waiting to board, in the flight, and all the other commute before your destination. I usually give the books to random people, or leave it at places so people can pick it up. For the really good ones, I bring them home for my library. This means, I have also read quite a lot of cheesy, lousy books.<p>English is also not my mother tongue but is now a primary language. I come from a region in India where for every few square kilometer, one can find a different language and&#x2F;or dialect. So, we ended up being taught in English, speak in English for more complex words, etc.<p>I also realized, I used to sit for an hour two days a week just waiting for my daughter with her private tuition. That finishes off quite a lot of books. :-)')
