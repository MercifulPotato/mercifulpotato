Old people buy them, not knowing what they are getting into; and then we, HN-type people, end up forever being called to someone&#x27;s house (family, whom you cannot really deny) to fix stupid things that really aren&#x27;t the fault of the user.<p>Also, when it takes 3 minutes to &quot;boot up&quot; your TV, that just sucks.<p>I&#x27;m going to blame manufacturers for taking an essentially saturated market and adding useless crap (and marketing it) to justify someone needing to buy a new TV.  Indeed there are some visual improvements occasionally, but the benefits of those improvements are often diminished based on many factors (vision of viewer, room lighting&#x2F;light interference, etc.).<p>Choice is nice, and competition is nice.  But useless or likely-to-never-be-wanted-or-used features are just a waste of money, peoples&#x27; time, and environmental resources (the making of new TV, the discarding of old).')
