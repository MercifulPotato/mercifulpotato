When it comes to culture, playing offense (giving people a reason to be naturally interested) is the only method to ensure that your culture or language survives and thrives. Culture is a consequence of living life rather than the reverse and languages are communication methods. If your culture or language is not actually lived, it rots or becomes a novelty or meaningless perversion of the original, like a caged bird.<p>The ideal solution would obviously have been for the Brits to avoid genociding the Irish and their culture in the first place, but keeping a language on life support is counter-productive in my opinion. Obviously this is a sensitive topic and this is only my personal reflection on the matter from my own experiences.')
