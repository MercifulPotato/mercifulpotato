Some have reasonable electrical systems and no real motive to potentially lose that by tying into some larger grid.  As a whole Africa has a lot of sunlight and potential for solar power, it also has a huge amount of coastline with the potential for offshore wind and tidal energy.<p>I would think the issue would be how large it is, and how many tiny settlements there are that are detached from the cities. It would take a lot of effort to build out electrical lines to all of them. And the people who have the least access are the least likely to be able to afford to pay enough for it to be worth it to a company.')
