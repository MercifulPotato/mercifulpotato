Archaeological projects generally produce lots of material and call for work that can&#x27;t be easily automated. On top of that, archaeological projects tend to be poorly funded, and if carried out by an academic institution then field research tends to be limited to summer months. The variety of materials recovered must be examined by various specialists, and then re-integrated, analysed and synthesized into summary reports. This takes time.<p>Moreover, most archaeological sites are not secured. There is no room in the budget for that, unless the state sets aside funds for that kind of thing (very rare, though Norway might be a notable exception)')
