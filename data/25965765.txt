From reading several articles on the issue, the EU seems to demand that the slow-down in production be shared equally across orders. This puts AZ in a pickle: it would then mean they are not only breach of contract with the EU but also UK. Hence, they publicly reiterate the &quot;first come first serve&quot; argument which resonates well in the UK media and rallies support (I think AZ is pitting EU against UK in all of this). I do not believe the &quot;first come first serve&quot; principle is how supply chains like this usually work though.
