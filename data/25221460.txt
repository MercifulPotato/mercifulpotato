It&#x27;s precise, highly reliable, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to have the same &quot;personhood&quot; as the conscious, linguistic mind. (Although I think it would be wrong to consider it an &quot;it&quot;, without any personhood.  You don&#x27;t want to go around offending your unconscious mind, eh?)<p>One of the fascinating and useful ideas I was exposed to early on was the concept of self-programming the mind, using hypnosis and various techniques.<p>In a sense, reading an article like the OP is priming the brain for higher-order functioning, by self-reference.')
