Cyberpunk feels quite mainstreamy in that regard (meaning its writing is not up to par to less mainstreamy RPGs). Well, if we&#x27;re on the topic: The writing actually is pretty bad. There&#x27;s a lot of talking without saying shit. I mean how difficult must it be to put some real character into the characters? Meaning some semblance of real backstories and not just blips about how bad everything is without really saying anything. argh.')
