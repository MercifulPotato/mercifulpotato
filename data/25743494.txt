My father stopped working in 2002, at 52. He was essentially force retired, as the glass plant he was a technician at moved to India, but he had no retirement planning that accounted for starting retirement at 52. And, for the record, they&#x27;re okay today, but it was in no small part to my own sacrifice, in my 20s, to help them keep their home and get back on their feet. The fact remains, he was simply unable to find work. And he had a health condition, to make matters worse. His story isn&#x27;t unique, at least not to the places I am speaking about.<p>I&#x27;ve heard this &quot;voting against their own interests&quot; rhetoric my entire life. It&#x27;s misguided. These people have voted their entire lives and where did it get them? Broke and unemployed, forced to scrape by however they could.<p>Trump won specifically because he was a vote AGAINST the status quo, which had stopped working for these people decades ago... Nothing more, nothing less.')
