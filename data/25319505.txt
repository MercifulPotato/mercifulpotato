There are many unsuccessful&#x2F;less successful capitalists who nonetheless still exploit people.  But it&#x27;s impossible to become a billionaire without exploiting people at a grand scale.  And by exploitation, I mean something very simple: paying workers less than the value of their labour.  Without exploitation there is no incentive for capitalists (within a capitalist system) to hire people.  Since capitalists (billionaires and non-billionaires) still hire people, it&#x27;s clear that exploitation is endemic to the capitalist system, and is required to become a billionaire.')
