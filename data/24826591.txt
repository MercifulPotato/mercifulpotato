There is land in Canada that’s been farmed for coming on 150 years.  The last 60-80 being “modern” farming methods.  It’s still highly productive land.<p>In terms of your link, it looks like it’s not counted as farmland if it’s abandoned (no intention to farm it in the future).  Some of that land may no longer be able to be cultivated, but I’d assume that’s not the only driver of the decrease.')
