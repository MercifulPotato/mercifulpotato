We got used to thinking of any Javascript as &quot;business logic&quot; rather than &quot;presentation&quot; because it&#x27;s an imperative language, but React&#x2F;JSX are tailored to using JS in a way that acts more like presentation. If you write it imperatively, it won&#x27;t be idiomatic React, and sooner or later something will break.<p>So it may help to think of JSX as using a functional subset of Javascript. It&#x27;s not, and that veil gets pierced pretty often, but the better you contain it, the more you can effectively use both Javascript and HTML together as part of a single concern.<p>Using Redux with sagas even further separates out the most side-effecty parts of it, though sagas are really heavyweight and I&#x27;m still not certain if I think they&#x27;re worth it.')
