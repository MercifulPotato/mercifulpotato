Before we relied on a single browser vendor or vendors to write the drivers... while google has an impressive engineering team as do all the browser vendors .. it’s not really reasonable or even as fun to have to only rely on them... imagine an IOT project adding support for HID device to control a robot or console style game... lot of neat possibilities')
