Item(by='shakna', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611958859, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25963206, text='&gt; Support for Annex F (IEEE-754 &#x2F; IEC 559) of C99&#x2F;C11<p>&gt; The  Clang  compiler  does  not  support  IEC  559  math  functionality.  Clang  also  does  not control  and honor the  definition  of  __STDC_IEC_559__  macro.  Under  specific  options such  as -Ofast  and -ffast-math,  the  compiler  will  enable  a  range  of  optimizations  that provide   faster   mathematical   operations   that   may   not   conform   to   the   IEEE-754 specifications. The macro __STDC_IEC_559__ value may be defined but ignored when these faster optimizations are enabled.<p>If you make use of Clang, you won&#x27;t find support for Annex F, and in point of fact you can&#x27;t even macro check to see if it even will support Annex F.<p>The story with GCC is... More complicated. It guarantees it&#x27;ll follow Annex F for only some operations [0].<p>So the upshot is... Most people can&#x27;t tell when and how Annex F might be followed.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gcc.gnu.org&#x2F;onlinedocs&#x2F;gcc-7.4.0&#x2F;gcc&#x2F;Floating-point-implementation.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gcc.gnu.org&#x2F;onlinedocs&#x2F;gcc-7.4.0&#x2F;gcc&#x2F;Floating-point-...</a>')
