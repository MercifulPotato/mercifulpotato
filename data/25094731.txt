Item(by='PaulDavisThe1st', descendants=None, kids=[25094884], score=None, time=1605381030, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25094413, text='&gt; The purpose of a corporation isn&#x27;t to continue existing in perpetuity, but rather, to maximize returns for its investors.<p>Society grants a group of people immunity from personal liability when they form an organization that has some chance of carrying out some useful work. The organization becomes a special kind of entity - a <i>corporation</i>. It can operate without its investors &amp; officers fearing that their own wealth is on the line should something go wrong. Societies do this because it is widely believed that it would be impossible for various things to happen without it. That is, if personal liability was always in play, nobody would organize human organizations to try to accomplish difficult&#x2F;dangerous tasks, and the same might also apply to unlikely-to-succeed-but-potentially-significant efforts.<p>That&#x27;s what the purpose of a corporation is, not maximising returns for its investors, which is a recent idea (dating back to the 1970s) and has nothing to do with why corporations exist.')
