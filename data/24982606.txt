COVID-19 and the global switch-off of the in-person economy is accelerating these trends: interacting with and understanding your customers online is key to surviving and thriving in the new environment.<p>At Snowplow we are focused on powering the data journey that these central data teams are embarking on. To win in the new world, itâ€™s essential that the data team can focus on the journey to value and mastery, and not get derailed by costly data delivery issues or burdensome organisational complexity. Snowplow helps data teams to do this, offering a data delivery platform that collects and operationalises behavioural data, at scale.<p>1) Technical Customer Success Manager - APAC<p>2) Head of Sales Operations - Remote<p>3) Sales Development Manager - London<p>Plus a lot more!<p>Apply here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;snowplowanalytics.com&#x2F;company&#x2F;careers&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;snowplowanalytics.com&#x2F;company&#x2F;careers&#x2F;</a>')
