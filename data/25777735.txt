I thought jail was not supposed to be for &quot;punishment&quot; but rather to protect the public from someone too dangerous to allow free, and even then it should mainly target &quot;rehabilitation.&quot;<p>You&#x27;re now talking about using it clearly just for punishment (which I would argue we do all over the place, totally inconsistent with it&#x27;s stated purpose).  This is before we discuss whether jail is torture.  Even if the &quot;jail&quot; is well regulated to prevent thing like violence and sexual abuse, it&#x27;s terrible to lock a person in a cage.  There are plenty of studies about the effects that has on a person&#x27;s mind.  Then you consider that you&#x27;re soft blackballed from employment (and therefore society) when you get a &quot;record&quot; and can&#x27;t pass a background check, and that the positive feedback loop leads to a life of poverty, crime, and suffering that is avoidable.<p>Please consider the significance of what you are arguing for here.')
