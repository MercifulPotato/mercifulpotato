And that is the specific statement I am saying is untrue.&quot;<p>The policy may not be explicitly stated, but having dealt ( and likely having have to deal with both this year ) with medical issues ( and related bills ) in US, to me it is clear that everything is stacked against the recipient of healthcare benefits. In other words, actions speak louder than words. The moment I have to spend multiple hours a day, faxing stuff, confirming receipt, complaining, contacting various overseeing bodies, I think the unstated policy is pretty simple.
