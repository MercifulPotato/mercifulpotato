It&#x27;s like asking that you trust your government but also allow yourself to be physically constrained from rising up and rebelling against it. And you&#x27;re not only trusting Apple you&#x27;re trusting whatever goverment Apple is accountable to where you live.<p>I&#x27;m ok with trusting Apple or Google for vetting most of the apps I have on my phone but I&#x27;m absolutely not ok with them restraining me from overriding their decisions when necessary.')
