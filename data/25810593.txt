Then there&#x27;s the other than intertwines around this to serve the first indirectly - and you can be more flexible here.\ne.g. Revenue from google&#x27;s adwords has to support the cost of their infrastructure and free services - if that&#x27;s ticking along well, you can have the nice buildings, free chef meals etc. This can be turned up and down depending on the market.<p>Counter-example that springs to mind is AvE&#x27;s Juicero teardown - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=_Cp-BGQfpHQ&amp;ab_channel=AvE" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=_Cp-BGQfpHQ&amp;ab_channel=AvE</a><p>Their product was lavishly over-engineered and beautifully made at vast expense - they were never going to make their costs back however over-priced their fruit-pods were.
