Hold an open book up so you can read it. Now turn it to face the mirror.  The text is backward!<p>Wait. How did you turn the book? Right-to-left? Well, that&#x27;s why its &#x27;backward&#x27;. Try it again, but this time flip the book vertically to face the mirror. Now the test is not flipped right-to-left, but top-to-bottom.<p>It&#x27;s nothing to do with &#x27;physics&#x27;.
