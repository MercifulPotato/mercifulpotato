However, they don’t have social reality. When chimps select a leader, they don’t vote by making marks on smushed bits of dead trees like we do. They follow the alpha male who will threaten or kill any others who challenge him.<p>with Jane Goodall&#x27;s study of the chimpanzees, quoting <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.janegoodall.org&#x2F;2018&#x2F;07&#x2F;10&#x2F;top-bottom-chimpanzee-social-hierarchy-amazing&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.janegoodall.org&#x2F;2018&#x2F;07&#x2F;10&#x2F;top-bottom-chimpanze...</a> :<p>&gt; chimpanzees, like us, have an incredibly complex social structure. And also like humans, that social structure involves friends, enemies, and battles for power. ... The highest-ranking chimpanzee in a group is the alpha-male. ... Take two of the alpha males observed in Gombe, Frodo and Freud, for instance. Though they were brothers, each chimp had a very different leadership style. While Freud maintained control through fostering strong alliances and grooming those he wanted to keep under his command, Frodo relied heavily on aggression and brute strength.<p>Also, bonobos are as close to humans as chimpanzees, so looking only to chimpanzees as a homology to human behavior is wrong.<p>&gt; &quot;Songbirds learn their songs from adult tutors.&quot;<p>and from their environment.

Their ability to transmit songs, not just within populations, but also between them, “is cultural transmission on a scale comparable to what we find in people,” according to Allen. Having a better understand of what drives cultural and social learning in whales could, therefore, help scientists gain new insight into why these traits have evolved with unparalleled complexity in humans.&quot;<p>Finally, the intro is: &quot;Humans are the only animals who can simply make things up, agree on them as a group, and they become real.&quot;<p>What experiments have been done to test that?
