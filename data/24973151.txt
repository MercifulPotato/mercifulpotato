The implication in the art example is &quot;iterate the above techniques a large number of times to obtain a finished result like this&quot;. It seems like a &quot;god leap&quot; because most people don&#x27;t see the thousands&#x2F;millions of iterated steps, they see the finished product as a finished product without the intuition of the component parts. That does seem to apply to the Cells project here: most of the same underlying components but yes iterated far enough and long enough it seems like a more insurmountable leap than it should without the right intuition pump.')
