The right one.<p>I don&#x27;t want to have to try and work out if it&#x27;s real or counterfeit, or how reputable the brand is, or whether the listed specs are accurate - I&#x27;m happy to pay a bit extra for a store&#x27;s merchandisers to do that for me.<p>So yeah, I&#x27;d buy a USB Stick from Amazon, but a television, not so much. I&#x27;m not even sure how they can solve these problems (how can you police&#x2F;accurately rank a huge inventory?) but at the very least they could get rid of co-mingled inventory etc. that are making it even worse.')
