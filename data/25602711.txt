I am pointing out that this claim is not necessarily true (or at least not as clear-cut as this) and if so it makes you question the whole thing somewhat.<p>For the record I DESPISE censorship and DESPISE the CCP and DESPISE apple&#x27;s rank hypocrisy.<p>But I also care a great deal about accuracy and truth hence my pointing this inconsistency out.')
