Item(by='virgilp', descendants=None, kids=[25700136, 25699644], score=None, time=1610186316, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25698715, text='&quot;Defund the police&quot; is such a bad catchphrase, it does all sorts of disservices to the actual proposed measures. It sounds vengeful and petty, not thoughtful. It&#x27;s also misleading - the purpose is not (or should not) be primarily to make sure police has less funds; it&#x27;s to make sure social services and other programs have funds. Why not call it &quot;fund social services&quot; instead of &quot;defund the police&quot;, instead? (&quot;fund social services&quot; is a bad name, but the spirit is right - focus on the positive outcome, not on how you&#x27;ll &quot;hurt&quot; the police. If you want to focus on police, focus on how you&#x27;ll improve their mission and help them do a better job at reducing violence in communities)')
