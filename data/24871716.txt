You can&#x27;t get the swing states because the existing system makes them the focus of national politics and you can&#x27;t get always-red states because the party that controls them benefits from the extra two delegates per state which go predominantly to that party. And together they&#x27;re the majority of the electoral college delegates.<p>What you could do is do something like national popular vote weighted by electoral college delegates, because then you could get everyone but the swing states, and that would represent a majority. And then you&#x27;re not disenfranchising half of both California and Texas.')
