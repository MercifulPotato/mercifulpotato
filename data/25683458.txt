Item(by='Aachen', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610103573, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25680676, text='&gt; Did you measure fuel consumption per km?<p>I have a configurable display that shows average fuel consumption per 100km, momentary fuel consumption per 100km, kilometers remaining with available fuel, or some other value that I forgot about.<p>It&#x27;s always set to the momentary fuel consumption and I have a good idea about how much things like grades (in&#x2F;declines), wind, acceleration, etc. impact the consumption. The consumption per 100km is not the best measure for acceleration or idling (more useful would be something like &quot;ml used in last 10 seconds&quot;), but it give me some indication. Using the cruise control to accelerate (when safe; e.g. on steep uphill highway on-ramps you need to shift down and put that pedal down to get to a more safe merging speed) it&#x27;s limited to about 8-9l&#x2F;100km which is pretty good (many Germans consider such amounts normal for their cruising speed, let alone accelerating).')
