Apple Arcade and a few indie studios have done great, but for the most part, iOS games are micro transaction laden trash. It will take years before we see any real desktop level games developed to run exclusively on ARM macs.<p>I think the success of gaming on the platform will come down to game engine devs like Unreal and Unity. If they can optimize exports to target Apple silicon with minimal overhead, that’s the best bet to see gaming live on. Otherwise, I don’t see how any AAA studios can find it worth their time to build for 2 completely different architectures.<p>One interesting exception might be EA, as The Sims is hugely popular among casual crowds that might have a MacBook for college or something. But in the case of EA, they also will create a new Sims game and then milk it for a decade, thus paying back their R&amp;D costs. Other studios who frequently make new games and want to push the hardware may not be as inclined to spend that with such a small install base.')
