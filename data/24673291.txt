In many respects the TV has taken position that the fireplace used to have. What we&#x27;re missing is thus those deep and cozy fireplace conversations. I also like the idea of nooks and crannies. Perhaps it&#x27;s an idea to design future houses like that of native villages?<p>I think the meaning of the space in the house mentioned, wasn&#x27;t <i>just</i> socializing, but also relaxing to music, and observing the sound (the water body) flowing by outside. Othwerwise the house isn&#x27;t much bigger or smaller than other Norwegian 80&#x27;s houses, only the layout is different and more inspired.<p>Walking around in Oslo, or any city, for that matter, there are many examples of various forms of architecture, and the difference between inspired and uninspired or cheap is striking. For instance, I have a rather ambivalent relationship to the institutional brick architecture springing out of 30&#x27;s Funkis (Functionalism), that really reached its peak in the 70&#x27;s and 80&#x27;s evolving into Modernist structures. The uninspired or brutalist versions of it, are ghastly and cheap shells, while the inspired versions, such as Institute for Social Research in Munthes street in Oslo, gives off a feeling of welcoming peace and warmth.<p>I have often wondered about those spaces in hotels or office lobbies, where a divan or lounge chairs are set out, but serve no purpose, because no one in their right mind would ever consider sitting there.')
