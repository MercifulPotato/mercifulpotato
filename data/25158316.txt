It seems like they would have the resources to do native application. I can&#x27;t fault anyone for doing an Electron app as a demo, prototype, MVP, that&#x27;s seems completely reasonable.<p>What I don&#x27;t get is why they don&#x27;t want to make a native macOS client, or Windows client. For Linux I get that they don&#x27;t necessarily know if it should be GTK, QT, should they adopt KDE standards or Gnome, something else maybe? I can see why they would like Electron in that case.<p>For something like the Mac... They could do a fantastic client, it would use very little memory, play nice with the OS and be fast. Their users would notice and love it.')
