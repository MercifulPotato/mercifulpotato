Try using this on a satellite connection for example, and your experience won&#x27;t be very pleasant.<p>On my internet connection, which is pretty average by polish standards, the best ping I can get is 30ms, and that only happens when the server I ping is just one or two hops away. I probably won&#x27;t be able to go under 100ms when the server is in the US.<p>It seems like this approach sacrifices runtime performance for development speed. I feel like it might often be a good tradeoff to make, but it&#x27;s a tradeoff nevertheless, and we should recognize that. Separate layers for frontend and backend introduce complexity, but client side code is client side code, you can&#x27;t go much faster than that.')
