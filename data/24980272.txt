Wages can go up 5% per year, but if you think you have a decent chance of losing your income and not being able to get it back in your working years, you will need to act more conservatively.<p>Americans especially should be worried about their income security at 45+ years of age, when health insurance premiums become $12k to $14k per year per person plus $15k oop max, in todayâ€™s money (who knows what it will be 20 years in the future).<p>If you lose your source of income that comes with employer subsidized health insurance in that 45 to 65 year range before you get to Medicare, and you have a medical problem, all of your assets might be in play since the sky is the limit when it comes to healthcare costs.  Not to mention you will have lost ability to learn income if you are having to take care of yourself or your spouse.')
