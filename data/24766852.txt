This was one of the things we had to polish way back in the first Linux boom when I was working at Lindows.  We got a report from QA that &quot;when I uninstall this random thing called dpkg I can no longer use the app store&quot;.  After the lead dev managed to collect himself from off the hallway floor (the only literal ROFL I have ever seen), everyone realized that yes, you should be prevented from uninstalling the core software.')
