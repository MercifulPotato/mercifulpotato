I tried KDE a few months ago and I couldn&#x27;t stick with it; it is slower than Gnome in a lot of ways, it&#x27;s (to my eyes) much more cluttered, and has lags at annoying places. For example, I tend to hit the windows key and start typing to launch things, but under KDE there&#x27;s enough lag before the menu opens that it doesn&#x27;t catch my first few keypresses.')
