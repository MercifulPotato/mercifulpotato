I am quite the magnet for controversy.<p>HN is a place I spend a lot of time because the culture here is reasonable.<p>To me, saying &quot;Hey I like Edge, it&#x27;s not so bad&quot; is pointless shit-stirring. It&#x27;s looking to start trouble for no real reason.<p>It&#x27;s a low value comment. The guidelines actively discourage that, so it&#x27;s not surprising that it would be downvoted, having nothing to do with &quot;disagreeing&quot; per se.<p>If you have something meaty and thoughtful to say that disagrees with the majority view, the HN crowd will give you a fair shake. Jumping into the midst of a discussion where everyone is saying &quot;This is junk!&quot; to say &quot;Well, I like it!&quot; isn&#x27;t thoughtful or meaty.')
