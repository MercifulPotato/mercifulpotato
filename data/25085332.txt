Any profit would mean an additional wage being withheld. I may not understand the dynamic here, but my understanding is that tip laws ensure that if the employee comes in under $15, the company makes up the difference.<p>I&#x27;ve alluded to it a few times, but I think we disagree in that tipping is a quasi-voluntary <i>tax</i>. A tax is a fee paid to subsidize a service. That tax, in this case, subsidizes fare charges by reducing overhead labor costs. If you want to not tip, you should pay a higher fare because otherwise those who <i>do</i> tip are subsidizing your ride. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s unethical just because it&#x27;s called a &quot;tip&quot; unless you assume people don&#x27;t understand how the tipping system works.  If your claim is it allows a corporation to make an unfair profit, I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m tracking the logic of that argument because the tax in this case is entirely voluntary. Where I have an ethical problem is when wages are suppressed so much that the public must subsidize employee wages in the form of government benefits. In that case, non-customers are subsidizing the company profits; since they are not consumers of that company, it makes it a compulsory tax to protect their profit. This is entirely different than a voluntary tax on those who use the service.<p>Personally, I would prefer tipping in general to be banned because it&#x27;s a clunky, inefficient system. It&#x27;s much more transparent and straightforward to just have a fair wage without all the game theory that comes along with a convoluted system of tipping.')
