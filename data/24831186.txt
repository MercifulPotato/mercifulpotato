If they&#x27;re into computers, let them tinker with computers. If they like to take things apart, give them your old electrical components and teach them about electrical safety and soldering. If they like making things, show them some cool DIY videos on YouTube. Whatever it is, if they&#x27;re into it and you support them, then all that time spent is practice doing something they love, regardless of whether or not it ends up being a career.')
