Was that &quot;junk science that just hadn&#x27;t been debunked&quot; until Einstein and General Relativity?<p>Are all scientists who have followed an avenue of research that didn&#x27;t pan out in the end quacks, pseuds and wackos?<p>Or is there maybe a simpler, more nuanced view that doesn&#x27;t happen to tar every past generation of science with a very offensive brush?')
