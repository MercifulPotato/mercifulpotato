It&#x27;s not about &quot;deserve&quot;.<p>Some people have a lot of potential but need a chance to prove themselves and gain experience. Maybe they would start by bussing tables and eventually own their own restaurants. They need a ladder to success with rungs that are actually climbable.<p>If we mandate that you must be able to support a family of four and save for retirement to work bussing tables, we won&#x27;t have prosperous people bussing tables. We&#x27;ll just have more self-service restaurants, sit-down dining will become more of a luxury service, and we&#x27;ll have more wait staff struggling because they have to have fewer tables that they have to bus themselves.<p>The training you yearn for <i>can</i> happen by virtue of the economics of the industry. It&#x27;s like apprenticeship or interning. Except it&#x27;s working at entry level jobs and earning advancement. And it&#x27;s egalitarian because anybody can be an excellent busser.
