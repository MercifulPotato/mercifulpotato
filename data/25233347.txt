However I still havent found a good way of creating slides. I find writing directly in  HTML too tedious, but haven&#x27;t really found a good other way. Most of the Markdown converters that are floating around are to restricted. At the moment I&#x27;m using org-reveal which works quite well, but I often find that the layout options lacking so I end up putting a lot of HTML into the org files which again defeats the purpose. Anyone have a good solution?')
