And a needful reminder, as long as the implementations being compared are allowed use of that strategy.<p>It would be interesting to see benchmark comparisons with somewhat more rigorous guidelines about what’s being compared, perhaps mandating the use of the same algorithm. That approach would introduce problems as well, like some languages benefiting more than others from the chosen algorithms. I think benchmarks are useful but the fact that they’re so often “flawed” or “misleading” may paradoxically mean that we need more of them so we can get a clearer view of the field.')
