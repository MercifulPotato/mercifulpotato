I won&#x27;t bother spending time on fixing it if it&#x27;s not something I&#x27;m actively using. If someone submits a PR with a fix then that&#x27;s great and I&#x27;ll most likely merge it in if there&#x27;s no objections and tests still pass. I don&#x27;t perceive the submissions as if the person thinks they&#x27;re entitled to getting it fixed since majority of the time they&#x27;re nice about it or they never come back to check on the status. When I submit bug reports and PRs to other projects, I have no expectations that it&#x27;ll be fixed or merged since I understand what it&#x27;s like to be on both ends.')
