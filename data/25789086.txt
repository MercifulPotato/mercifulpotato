If you hold tether it may turn into air. But your bitcoin is still bitcoin. Also, when tether is going down wouldn&#x27;t you want to sell it thus creating pressure in btc&#x2F;tether market and value of of tether&#x2F;btc going up? It&#x27;s always been clear to me that USD&#x2F;BTC and USDT&#x2F;BTC are two different markets. USDT is just another cryptocurrency. Many of them were scams and disappeared and many more will. Same with exchanges. It seems like describing somebody maliciously selling fake or paper gold and concluding that gold is bad.')
