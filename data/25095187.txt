This is what most people want. An open source free as in beer copy of Slack or Discord with mobile apps, push notifications, and API support. My company isn&#x27;t dropping a paid Slack plan with hundreds of integrations for something that kind of works just because it&#x27;s free. This stuff has to be polished to be taken seriously.<p>Just look at iMessage which has been around for 7 years. Even Google is too inept to realize that it&#x27;s what Android users want. What the hell is wrong with them?')
