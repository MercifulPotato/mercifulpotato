The main points are:<p>Vitamins and minerals (which you can still find in non-vegetables or supplements)<p>Fiber (which you can get from whole grains)<p>Prevents heart diseases (which is not exclusive to vegetables)<p>Makes a balanced diet (which is pretty vague, what’s so balancing about it?)<p>Taste good? (there are tastier foods...)<p>I’m still not seeing the point or hassle of vegetables. If you don’t even cook them right you can destroy the vitamins which are the primary benefit. Not to mention eating the quantity required to reach recommended levels is probably not sustainable.<p>For someone that doesn’t like eating and cooking, vegetables are a logistical nightmare, a little cup of broccoli only provides like 30 calories and just fills your stomach with useless fiber that makes it a struggle to eat other more efficient nutrient dense foods.<p>I feel like vegetables are more for spicing up a dish than as a primary source of nutrition.')
