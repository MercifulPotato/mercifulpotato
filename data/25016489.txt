I&#x27;m a FANNG guy. A lot of our problems aren&#x27;t even these mystical &quot;FANNG problems&quot; people talk about and get solved by REMARKABLY boring tech. So, I&#x27;d welcome his opinion in an interview. ^_^<p>Picking a non-sexy, non-scalable, &quot;wrong&quot; technology that does nothing more than solve the actual requirements at hand is a rare and amazing quality for engineer to have imo.<p>Everyone wants to build infinitely flexible, infinitely scalable machines using the most rapid iteration tools possible as though that&#x27;s what &quot;engineering&quot; is. But sometimes... all you need is a REST API. Sometimes you need GraphQL. Sometimes, all you need is to stuff data in a bucket somewhere and call that an &quot;integration point&quot;. All solutions have trade offs. Pretending otherwise, or faulting others for weighing those trade offs differently than you, is silly.')
