But if the metal isn&#x27;t chemically reacting with the water - and it doesn&#x27;t look like molten iron does - that&#x27;s not <i>that</i> bad.<p>If you asked me to fight such a fire, I&#x27;d setup some unmanned nozzles, retreat, turn on the pumps slowly, and just wait it out. Probably will be an expensive total loss. But no-one gets hurt, and the burning iron doesn&#x27;t itself release particularly toxic fumes, so no long term harm. Not that bad really for an industrial fire.')
