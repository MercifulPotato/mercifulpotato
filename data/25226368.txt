Sure it&#x27;s got 12 more cores, but it does all that for less power at boost than the i7&#x27;s nominal TDP.<p>Include modern memory and storage into the equation, and we&#x27;ve come quite a long way, and it&#x27;s only going to get better now that Intel are desperate, AMD are finally back, and Apple have demonstrated ARM is good enough to displace x86.')
