Before that I got a mechanical enginerring degree from a conventional university and must say that for me the Distance learning University totally sucked compared to the &quot;real&quot; university. Social life is IMHO very important for studying. At the converntional university we had a great group of people who helped and motivated each other. And we had a lot of parties and fun. Not so at the distance learning university, which was dull and boring. There was nobody who motivated you, nobody you could have a good time with. I think there was one meeting in person, which was quite horrible, and of course you do not make real friends within a week.<p>On the other hand I heard from a friend, who is very introverted, that he liked studying at the distance learning university quite a lot. So it looks like it depends what kind of person you are.')
