Item(by='adventured', descendants=None, kids=[25055266], score=None, time=1605062650, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25053051, text='&gt; The bulk of Trump voters are from rural areas, and tend to be less (or un-)educated.<p>You&#x27;re of course ignoring even worse problems on the Democrat side.<p>The lowest education rates and highest drop-out rates in the US are not in rural areas, they&#x27;re almost exclusively in the inner cities where Democrats tend to completely dominate the vote.<p>Rural students at 87% are more likely to graduate from high school in four years than the national average at 83%.<p>The graduation rate by comparison in Washington DC public schools is typically around 65%-70%. Shall I list all the major blue cities by graduation rates, or is that not necessary because everyone already knows what the outcomes actually look like?<p>The persistent low education and high drop-out rate problems in so many major Democrat dominated cities (eg: Philly, Los Angeles, Baltimore, Detroit, Atlanta, Cleveland, Milwaukee, DC, etc.) is terrifying as an American. They&#x27;re rates that low-development nations might be ashamed of.<p>The left pretends none of that exists when it&#x27;s inconvenient, like when making blanket statements about Republican voter education levels.')
