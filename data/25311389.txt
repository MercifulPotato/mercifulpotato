Objections and responses that-I would boldly say-are not <i>stopping</i> you from making said critiques, or rather, they hold no enforceable power that precludes you or anyone from making rebuttals of your own.<p>They are just that, objections and responses. Which you are free to entertain or not, attempt to unpack and understand or not, respond to with better critiques, objections, observations and rebuttals of your own...or not. But you&#x27;re not being <i>prevented</i> from making them by anyone or anything short of I suppose committing some sort of crime in order to make that point (that&#x27;s just an extreme example to stretch the metaphor).<p>This is the form and function of debate, it is a crucible that boils away impurities of all manner and dialect (for anyone who may be thinking they&#x27;ve heard this one before, yes, I absolutely stole this from an episode of Star Trek).<p>If you feel you are being stopped from doing any of this, might I ask why and how you have been completely prevented and kept from expressing yourself?')
