In people &lt; 70 years, infection fatality rates ranged from 0.00% to 0.31% with crude and corrected medians of 0.05%.<p>But this is a meaningless debate. Your own preferred source makes it clear that the &quot;average IFR&quot; is heavily dependent on population demographics (i.e. in the very next sentence after the one you quoted:<p>&gt; our results indicate that about 90% of the variation in population IFR across geographical locations reflects differences in the age composition of the population and the extent to which relatively vulnerable age groups were exposed to the virus<p>You&#x27;re also completely misinterpreting Figure 6 from that paper. It is showing that their model of age-specific IFR <i>correlates</i> well with observed differences in reported IFRs. It is <i>not</i> claiming that those reported values are meaningful in the absolute -- in fact, all of the &quot;reported&quot; values seem to be higher than the model by a factor of ~2-4, and they&#x27;re substantially higher than the numbers cited by the WHO bulletin.<p>(and yes, I know you don&#x27;t like Ioannidis, but this is a metareview, not original research. Also, not liking someone doesn&#x27;t make them wrong.)')
