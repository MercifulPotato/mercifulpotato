Item(by='ppod', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605286470, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25081952, text='A couple of interesting things about the journey from the press release to the story: the press release says &quot;associated with&quot;, but the summary says &quot;impacts on&quot;, and the headline says &quot;critical for preventing&quot;! Also, they pick &quot;screen time and sleep&quot; from among five factors, the others were less tobacco smoking, more physical exercise and more (yes) alcohol.<p>I don&#x27;t have a problem with causal claims from these kinds of methods in principle, if the regression is well done with good controls. But I&#x27;m not at all convinced that they can isolate self-reported sedentary screen time reliably from self-reported physical activity.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com&#x2F;track&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;10.1186&#x2F;s12916-020-01813-5.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com&#x2F;track&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;10.1186&#x2F;s129...</a>')
