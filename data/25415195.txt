You&#x27;re assuming that the sum total of profit generated is in that one manufacturer. It isn&#x27;t the case. You have subcontractors that also make an additional ten percent, then materials coming from a supplier that takes another ten percent, which comes from raw material suppliers that make yet another 10%, and then you&#x27;re going to have consultants in R&amp;D and marketing that might make even more than 10%, and so on. So it really can end up quite a bit higher than that.')
