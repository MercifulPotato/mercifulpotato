Item(by='presentation', descendants=None, kids=[25854537, 25854806, 25854163], score=None, time=1611191424, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25853719, text='My anecdata, coming from SF to Japan: people seem much less stressed about getting kicked out of their homes here or having their rent raised despite no rent control because there is actually sufficient supply, and people aren’t depending on their house to gain value over time for their financial future (housing is generally a depreciating asset).<p>People tend to stay in the same homes for very long periods of time, and are invested in their local communities, but you can get short term housing or move frequently if you wish (short term leases exist but to be expected, cost to value ratio isn’t great; generally 1 year minimums without penalty for long term leases with 1 month rent fee if you leave earlier, and with high fees (3-5 months rent!) when you move in, so it’s not economically encouraged to hop a lot; I personally find these high costs unreasonable, but seems to be well accepted here).<p>Housing is generally reasonably priced; you can live within 30 mins of central Tokyo by train for less than $400&#x2F;mo as a single person in an apartment (SF seems to completely lack cheap, small options for single people); but for a significantly larger premium, you can get a standalone house as well if you’d like. For me, despite living in a significantly more expensive apartment, I generally spend significantly more on going out to restaurants and stuff than my rent.<p>I personally think that if cities really invested in transit and relaxed zoning and permitting significantly, densifying neighborhoods, that market rate can produce the best of both worlds; but that would threaten the view that housing is an investment as the cornerstone of ones financial life, so it’s unlikely to happen in a place like the US.')
