I&#x27;m in a similar situation - from and in the middle of nowhere.<p>I am paid very well for my locality - indeed, I have more than doubled my starting salary out of college - but I still make less than six figures after ~8 years. My current job has some big benefits (light workload most of the time, little stress, a lot of flexibility, very strong job security, easily impressed management), but...well, if I could make 250k working remote, I&#x27;d strongly consider it.<p>My experience with interviewing with coastal companies for remote positions is they were adamant about basing my salary on what I currently make + x%; my impression is that by hiring remotely they thought they could get a deal. I ended up leveraging this into a counteroffer, so I still came out ahead, but I&#x27;m not really interested in risking my intangibles for just a few bucks.')
