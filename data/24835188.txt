I was near the top of my class at school (not because I was smart, just because I paid attention and worked hard), and hence my teachers gave up on me. Expending time on a kid who is likely to get A&#x27;s without intervention does nothing to improve the school&#x27;s metrics&#x2F;ranking.<p>I would have been fine in a good private school but my parents weren&#x27;t rich and couldn&#x27;t afford the fees. Somehow I convinced my parents to let me educate myself, and at least <i>for me</i> it was successful. I finally had time to teach myself programming, which at the time was not taught in school.<p>Would I recommend it to others? Kids should try school first and see if they benefit from it. Some kids <i>love</i> school and do very well out of the system. However, if school is failing your kid, they might be better off without it.')
