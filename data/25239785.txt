That doesn&#x27;t make it not be real.<p>Probability is something we invented to describe systems, based on what we know about them, when we have imperfect information. If we had perfect information about the coin, its surroundings and how it was flipped, we could tell which side it will land on, but we don&#x27;t. (Ignoring that there are some quantum things that physicist say can never have perfect information)')
