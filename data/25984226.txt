Following with your call out though yes, nukes stopped being something you could do to further your position and turned into something that is very negative for everyone&#x27;s position a long time ago. Even before this point nukes seem like a completely different dynamic though, they only move you &quot;forward&quot; in use by moving the other side back making the average worse and you can&#x27;t exactly use them against a section of a population rather other geographic groups as a whole.<p>The only similarity I can draw is that both have been restricted internationally.')
