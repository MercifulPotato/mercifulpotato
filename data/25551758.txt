Where would it come from? All science knows is that neurons receive inputs from sensors, mixes them together (with some quantum randomness sprinkled in), and eventually actuates muscles to produce outputs, exactly as GPT.<p>Thus “free will” must come from some sort of faith. Either it was given to us by “God”, or we’re all part of some simulation and it exists on a level we don’t know about, or something else entirely too advanced for us to understand.')
