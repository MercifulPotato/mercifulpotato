I have had great experience but I follow a methodology to keep the recommendations curated. I&#x27;ll also note that I listen to a wide variety of music ranging from EDM to metal to high enery jpop to classical. What I have found is:<p>- Adding things to playlists makes a big difference. If you really love a song, hit it with a heart, if you want to hear more but don&#x27;t love it, add it to a relevant playlist<p>- skip mildly bad songs<p>- actively dislike terrible songs (hide it on mobile, hit the no smoking sign on desktop)<p>I got into a chill beats phase and it took a couple months for me to eradicate it from my discover weekly but now it&#x27;s pretty on point. Just my 2 cents.')
