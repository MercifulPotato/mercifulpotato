First of all, as for learning the language, I have no idea why taarof would be an impediment. I mean, I guess if your plan is to exchange a handful of words with a ton of different people, taarof might make up a noticeable portion of your communication, but in language learning it&#x27;s far better to speak with fewer people and try to have longer conversations. Otherwise you&#x27;ll never move past the basics.<p>I&#x27;ve been to Iran and taarof never even crossed my mind as a possible impediment to learning the language. (Amusingly, I stayed with some Iranians that didn&#x27;t speak anything I spoke, so I was forced to learn some Farsi, which was a lovely time!)<p>And the Iranian people _are_ very hospitable, taarof aside. When I traveled to Iran I was invited into many homes, and I know the invitations were sincere because I was being accompanied by Iranian acquaintances most of the time, doing the translating. For one particular example of Iranian friendliness, in college an Iranian friend of mine was concerned that I wasn&#x27;t eating healthily enough, so every time he saw me after that (most days of the week) he made me sandwiches.<p>Furthermore, taarof is part of the Iranian culture. These little cultural differences are what makes this world beautiful, and not some mass of efficiently-communicating Soylent-drinking robots.')
