Copyright law has become too draconian and infringes on the public good, therefore some don’t respect it. This doesn’t mean content creators shouldn’t get paid.<p>Big difference between civil disobedience being justified by laws restricting fundamental rights (e.g. voting rights) and civil disobedience because you want to play an old game. Extreme measures (e.g. breaking laws) should be reserved for big injustices IMHO.')
