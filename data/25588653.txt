Item(by='mhd', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609379264, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25586426, text='German organic labels can get pretty weird, though. Your regular EU label still allows castrating piglets without anaesthetization. And if I remember correctly, the minimum requirements about how many you can keep per square meter aren&#x27;t that much better than the lowest rung of the new &quot;Tierwohl&quot; scale (1-4 on packaged meats).<p>On the other hand, with the &quot;Demeter&quot; label (the third-largest organic association in Germany) you get some better statistics, but not by much, and you&#x27;re also paying for the farmers to bury cow skulls filled with magic herbs.<p>I&#x27;d really appreciate a EU-wide label with some graduations that actually mean something.')
