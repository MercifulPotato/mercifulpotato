I share this sentiment however I wonder if streets would become pleasant to be in if all of the vehicles were silent and electric. Most towns have cars with revving engines and the pollution that comes with it. The Ami does not come with these problems and I think it would be interesting to see a large scale trial of a town where only silent true electric vehicles are allowed in town. Would people start using their front gardens and have time for passing neighbours?<p>Did the French get the G-Wiz a decade ago, only for it to fail? That too used the quad bike classification.')
