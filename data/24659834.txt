Different groups climbed up and down the ladder, aided by the socio-political movements.<p>* The modern version of caste is more about social prestige, and status. In my experience whenever people were curious about my caste it was to know what tribe you belong. Just like people asked me regularly where I was &quot;actually&quot; from in EU and US.<p>* A lot of rural Indians aren&#x27;t well versed with the metropolitan western concept of egalit√©, because the Dharmic system functions differently. This means the closest frame of reference is the caste system to know one&#x27;s place in the pecking order. Same structures can be found in Japan and Korea.<p>* The Dalits are a formidable political force now and a lot of caste based discrimination is done by non-Brahmins who fear the reduction of their share of the pie. I&#x27;ve seen brahmins being on receiving end of the caste based discrimination, countless no. of times.<p>* Caste system in corporate world is cloak-and-daggers game and goes hand in hand with using language, region, culture etc to further their aims. A Marathi Kunbi might be favoured by a Marathi manager over a Bengali Kayastha.<p>* I studied in a Govt. college which has more than 50% seats reserved for SC&#x2F;ST&#x2F;OBC&#x2F;NT and I have first hand experience that caste is not an indicator of talent.')
