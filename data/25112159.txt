The goal is not eradication of the virus at a molecular level, it is stopping the disease at a societal level.  Stopping the disease is accomplished when symptoms are prevented.  Because symptoms kill people, not the virus.<p>There is an incredible misunderstanding about the difference between a disease (i.e., symptoms caused by a virus) and the virus that causes it.  Viruses, bacteria, spores, and other toxic material is everywhere constantly.  COVID is the only virus I can think of where we have been actively scared of the mere existence of the virus.')
