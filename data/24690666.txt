Item(by='xedeon', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601923444, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24689803, text='&gt; You are asserting with no idea whatsoever, or relevance really given you&#x27;re apparently ignoring that I was answering a very specific comment.<p>I am directly addressing your comment about &quot;DMS&#x2F;DAM&quot;. How is that not relevant?<p>&gt; One, it really is not, there&#x27;s nothing impressive-looking so far.<p>What is impressive to you? That&#x27;s what the critics said when the iPhone 1 was announced. That&#x27;s what many also said about electric cars. Funny how the metrics (sales&#x2F;safety) played out on that one.<p>&gt; These are just events it might be able to generate, it tells you nothing about how well the events are detected and how the consumer of those events integrates them.<p>The fact that it can detect those events using a specialized redundant NPU hardware is a far cry from &quot;Driver drowsiness detection&quot; and &quot;DMS&#x2F;DAM&quot; from &quot;14 years ago&quot;. Hence, an apple to oranges comparison.<p>&gt; What do you think exactly, that other manufacturers just get a magical yes&#x2F;no blob?<p>It&#x27;s interesting you ask that, because they mostly are binary logic if you look at the ECU firmware. Some &quot;Driver drowsiness detection&quot; (MBenz) systems will also just beep at random intervals after driving non-stop for 1 hour. But they still market them as being able to &quot;detect&quot; drowsiness.<p>George Hotz talked about this many times. They also don&#x27;t have any firmware code signing whatsoever (esp Toyota) which presents a security risk.<p>Out of curiosity, which of the DMS&#x2F;DAM systems do you have experience with?')
