People run speed tests on Wifi routers, and don&#x27;t notice that the buffering that improves speed test scores kills interactive latency.  Consumer reports apparently reviews dishwasher detergent without following the dishwasher manufacturer&#x27;s recommendation to put detergent in the &quot;pre wash&quot; cup.  That&#x27;s the biggest problem I have with reviews; not shill reviews, but people trying to do a good job and flat-out failing.')
