For one, how do you do migrations? Do I need to include every migration in my application bundle in perpetuity, running them in the client on startup? There doesn&#x27;t seem to be a mechanism to help with downloading, migrating, and reuploading data. That doesn&#x27;t feel so nice.<p>More pertinent, though, how do I ensure my users aren&#x27;t abusing my service? If I allow folks to upload avatars for folks in their address book, how can I stop someone from running up my bill by uploading their MP3 collection? As far as I can tell, if everything is encrypted, I just have some very active users. Obviously there&#x27;s some amount of tradeoff here, but it would seem like a necessary counterbalance is strong quota controls, which I don&#x27;t see in the docs.')
