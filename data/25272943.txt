I don’t think it applies to everyone, but I feel the same way.<p>If you want to avoid C#&#x2F;.Net, it may be best to stay out of the northwest and north central US.<p>The universities primilarily teach C# there, which affects the applicant pool and solutions that businesses use.<p>You’re not isolated from it elsewhere, and you don’t need to stay away from it, but SQL Server gets expensive as you scale, and the rest isn’t free either, though it’s more free and there’s more Linux then there used to be.<p>You can get into just as much if not more expense though with AWS or similar cloud services. There’s benefit to being able to focus on development vs, infrastructure, but your burn rate can easily be higher due to IAAS these days rather than coder salaries.')
