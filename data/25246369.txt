My intention with DwarFS wasn&#x27;t to write &quot;a better SquashFS&quot;, but to make it better in certain scenarios (huge, highly redundant data) than SquashFS. SquashFS still has the big advantage of being part of the kernel, which makes it a lot more attractive for things like root file systems.')
