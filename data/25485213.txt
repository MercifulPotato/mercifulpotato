Item(by='ck425', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608459609, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25483658, text='Horizon and Spiderman (original and Miles Morales) are both great gameplay wise. Spiderman is more of a button smasher but still a little tactical, Horizon on hard difficulties really makes you think on your feet while still being an rpg.<p>Outer Wilds is one of the best things I&#x27;ve played in years. I don&#x27;t want to spoil anything because it&#x27;s main appeal is exploration but think walking&#x2F;space sim mixed with a platformer and a puzzle game. That doesn&#x27;t do it justice because emotionally it&#x27;s an incredible experience but unlike name rpgs the story is told through exploration rather than cut scenes. Best Â£20 I&#x27;ve spent all year.')
