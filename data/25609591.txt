This is not good. The amount of people that would fit the profile from any available variables of a spreader are probably around 100 million in the US. If you&#x27;re going to vaccinate most of them, you&#x27;re going to need so many doses that you can vaccinate literally everyone that has over 0.2% fatality risk, and a month or two later you can reach herd immunity. There is clearly very little advantage there.<p>And for selling them on the free market, it&#x27;s insane to expect that vaccine sellers with limited capacity will sell the vaccine for anywhere near an affordable price. You don&#x27;t have nearly enough demand elasticity to justify the manufacturers - two of them, by the way, to drop their prices at all, because even if they sold them for 5000$ they would sell every dose they could produce for months. By the time they would be affordable for the average person, we could again have vaccinated all vulnerable people and a few months later essentially everyone.<p>In the two or three months between full vaccination of privileged classes and herd immunities, there will not be new mutations that will be able to spread despite full vaccination.')
