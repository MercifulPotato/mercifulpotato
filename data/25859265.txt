They have been quite close to FB and Zuck (he&#x27;s had several meetings with the PM). The propaganda machine in the country relies heavily on WhatsApp and FB to spread (dis&#x2F;mis)information and polarizing content. Majority of the country&#x27;s population which is above poverty line is on one or both the platforms. The older generation amongst them, and many many younger gens too, tend to be more gullible and more conservative minded, which makes this self propagating behemoth utterly indispensable to anyone looking to reach the masses with a message.<p>Very predictably then, the govt does not want to lose out on the reach offered by this platform and is fighting for users&#x27; &quot;right to privacy&quot;, which is just a farce to keep opinions positive, if you ask me. I say this because, on the other hand, they have claimed in the Supreme Court that privacy is not a fundamental right [1] and the country capital&#x27;s High Court has told certain petitioners against WhatsApp that they can stop using the app if they don&#x27;t like [2].<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;timesofindia.indiatimes.com&#x2F;india&#x2F;No-fundamental-right-to-privacy-to-citizens-Centre-tells-SC&#x2F;articleshow&#x2F;48171323.cms" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;timesofindia.indiatimes.com&#x2F;india&#x2F;No-fundamental-rig...</a><p>[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thehindu.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;national&#x2F;dont-use-whatsapp-if-you-dont-like-it-delhi-hc&#x2F;article33599671.ece" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thehindu.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;national&#x2F;dont-use-whatsapp-if-...</a>')
