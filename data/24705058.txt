I, like billions of other people, am a heavy Google user: I use gmail, Google search, Google maps, Youtube, etc. I don&#x27;t pay a cent and the quality of the service is impeccable. Competition is good to benefit the consumer at the cost of the producer. But in this case, I, as the consumer, pay nothing for my services and am happy with the quality of those free services. What is the antitrust trying to achieve? &quot;When you don&#x27;t pay, the product is you&quot;, they say. Ok, fine, so maybe the &quot;true&quot; consumer is the advertisers. Is the antitrust here designed to benefit the advertisers? Who is Congress trying to help here? Are they simply punishing success for the sake of punishing success?')
