I sometimes ask friends and family why they use it and the answer is always either &quot;I don&#x27;t know&quot; or &quot;to keep track of friends and family&quot; (AKA: a glorified contact list).  Many of them talk about getting rid of it, but few ever follow through.<p>People love to speculate about &quot;Facebook Killers&quot;, but what is there to even kill?  Facebook doesn&#x27;t offer people a useful service.  It&#x27;s just familiar and ubiquitous, so it exists in perpetuity.<p>&gt; The Facebook Killer will thus be something completely different, not merely a better or more ethical version of contemporary social media.<p>Then it&#x27;s not a &quot;Facebook Killer&quot;, is it?  It would just be another social media platform added to the pile.  Just another Twitter, Snapchat, TicTok, etc.')
