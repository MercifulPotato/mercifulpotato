I see it more as “we need a certain amount to pay for necessary government programs and everyone should ideally contribute to that. Because some can’t contribute any and some can’t contribute much, we <i>are forced</i> to make the contributions progressive.” (Marginal utility of money also plays a related factor, but that effect is smaller in magnitude in my mind [or is the exact factor I describe above if you squint a little bit].)<p>I make no moral judgment that we should tax someone more highly in order to make things progressively more difficult for them.')
