I&#x27;ve had jobs and colleagues like that too.<p>But fundamentally, your employer - the other party in your most basic work relationship (between you and the company that employs you) - <i>does</i> see you as being &quot;there to work&quot;.<p>And the moment you switch jobs, or get moved into another business unit, or get laid off, those social relationships with your (now-former) coworkers aren&#x27;t automatically there during the work day. If you want to preserve them, guess what? You&#x27;re looking at using those off hours.<p>I understand your argument a bit better if you&#x27;re treating socialization like caffeine or something - a purely functional hit of dopamine that gets you through the day. But I think that&#x27;s maybe a fundamental disagreement on the premise of social life.')
