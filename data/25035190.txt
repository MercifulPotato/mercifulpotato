There&#x27;s an important distinction:<p>* Protection against disease means that you don&#x27;t get sick. You may still contract the virus and spread it to others (the Salk vaccine against Polio works this way).<p>* Sterilizing immunity means that you can&#x27;t even get infected, so that you can&#x27;t pass the virus on to other people. It does not look like there&#x27;s any information about sterilizing immunity in this press release.<p>Importantly, this means that even with this vaccine, the virus may still be able to spread, and only vaccinated people will be protected (i.e., no herd immunity).')
