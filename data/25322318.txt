Look at the 40-inch&#x2F;43-inch models.  They&#x27;re like $800.  I bought all my 40-inch 4k screens for under $300 in 2016.<p>The insane price gouging in these &quot;professional displays&quot; cannot be explained by advertising subsidies.  We weren&#x27;t paying those prices for equivalent-spec dumb TVs back when those were available for sale.')
