You&#x27;re just making up a different version of the tweet to fit your narrative.<p>&gt; I think it&#x27;s reasonable for people to assume the WHO had actually investigated how people contracted covid...<p>The tweet explicitly says &quot;Preliminary investigations <i>conducted by the Chinese authorities</i>&quot;. The WHO team didn&#x27;t get there until Jan 20. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.who.int&#x2F;china&#x2F;news&#x2F;detail&#x2F;22-01-2020-field-visit-wuhan-china-jan-2020" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.who.int&#x2F;china&#x2F;news&#x2F;detail&#x2F;22-01-2020-field-visit...</a><p>&gt; otherwise why bother tweeting?<p>Because everyone was wondering at the time if they had the evidence yet.<p>&gt; &quot;[we looked but] we couldn&#x27;t find any evidence of human to human transmission&quot; is clearly misleading<p>That&#x27;s not what they said, though.')
