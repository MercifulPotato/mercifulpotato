Item(by='Cthulhu_', descendants=None, kids=[25332965], score=None, time=1607347756, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25329289, text='It&#x27;s one reason why manufacturing of anything from furniture to electronics is hardly done in the west anymore; because shipping is relatively cheap compared to the wage difference, it&#x27;s much cheaper to have things built in china and shipped here.<p>I do believe that long-term, probably in our lifetime, this balance will shift; China&#x27;s economy (and with it, wages and cost of living) is and has been booming for decades, and the US&#x27;s wages (slash minimum wage) have been static for just as long. I suspect this is why China is investing a lot in infrastructure internationally; I think we&#x27;ll see Africa become a big player in manufacturing, sponsored and financed by China.<p>To me it seems to be an er, interesting kind of economic &#x2F; capitalist colonialism, something not done by force but by incentives (loans to pay for it, people to build it, forfeiture of the infrastructure if the loan cannot be paid back).')
