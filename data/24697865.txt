The ATLAS &amp; CMS experimentalists who discovered the Higgs particle were passed over, but they outnumbered them ~1,000:1, and only up to 3 people are allowed to get the prize in one year.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;physicsworld.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;overlooked-for-a-nobel-the-cern-physicists-who-discovered-the-higgs-boson&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;physicsworld.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;overlooked-for-a-nobel-the-cern-p...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;life-and-physics&#x2F;2013&#x2F;oct&#x2F;08&#x2F;nobel-higgs-boson-experimenters" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;life-and-physics&#x2F;2013&#x2F;oc...</a><p>However, Rubbia &amp; van der Meer (1984) got the prize for discovering the W and Z (ultimate proof of electroweak unification) on behalf of the large CERN SPS collaboration.')
