Item(by='leecb', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608568017, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25496027, text='Introduce a ceiling on the total amount of federally subsidized student loans that a person can get in a year. The ceiling steps down every year, until the loans have completely gone down. Start the first ceiling 2 years from now, so students and institutions have time to plan for the change, and complete the phaseout 8 years from now. That&#x27;s how I&#x27;d do it.<p>As for how you would do it, you&#x27;d have to convince your congressional representative that reform is worth doing, and is worth the inevitable political cost to them. Making loans somewhat harder to get will inevitably make universities upset with the politicians (as universities are the ones that actually receive the bulk of the financial benefit from these loans). For this reason, I see this reform as unlikely to happen, at least as I described it. You would have to pair it with more direct funding for universities.')
