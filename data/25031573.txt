The cupped shape of its wings does not appear to have curves, which means it will crease like oragami (welded sheet metal sections?)<p>Since the in-ground effect is limited to a couple dozen feet - this craft is compatible only with the calm waters of a bay&#x2F;lake&#x2F;river. Maybe shorelines, but large breaking swells would be rough for the small, personal vessel anyways. That is why it&#x27;s safe - unleaded gasoline spinning a prop with similar horsepower of a V8 barely suspended above the low friction and cushion\n of flat water. An error (equipment or operator) would occur at low altitude and the optimum resolution would be to skid-to-a-float (last resort safety measure is to guarantee the nose is up at sufficient angle because the marine body is both landing gear and airbag in a sense).<p>Could the wing sections fold along the creases and temporarily adopt a more aero dynamic configuration in order to &quot;leap&quot; across impediments to a smooth surface? Flat land could also be a surface off of which a fuselage could propel itself via in-ground effect wingspan geometry, in which case &quot;roads&quot; would only need to be relatively flat and straight &quot;lanes&quot; with wingspan accommodation. Impact buffer would be suspension and durable tires (along with similar software interventions - &quot;if impact imminent then nose up to skid instead of tumble&quot;)  instead of sufficiently deep water and a marine body.')
