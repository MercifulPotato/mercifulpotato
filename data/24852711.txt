Unless you are a very unusual person, you definitely have committed some recently.<p>Did you ever roll through a stop sign without a complete stop or make a quick highway lane change without signaling? Reckless driving, up to officer discretion.  Drove over the speed limit?  Same goes many places.<p>Ever forget your wallet and drive without your license? Drive with slightly over a legal limit of alcohol (hard to judge correctly)?  Cross over a signed private property you don&#x27;t have permission to access?<p>Maybe you smoke and you are too close to a federal or state building access.  Maybe your uncle gave you some hooch he made.  Maybe you went to an unofficial nude beach.<p>Been &quot;drunk&#x2F;disorderly in public&quot; ?  Again officer discretion but could easily be applied to majority of people leaving a club most Friday nights.<p>Maybe you just live in a place where jaywalking is a misdemeanor.<p>Honestly the lists are long and convoluted, and in many cases the discretion left to LEO mean that nearly anyone could be written up for it.  Which is sort of the point.')
