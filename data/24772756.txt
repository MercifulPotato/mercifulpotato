It may be moving in the right direction, but it&#x27;s not the destination we need. Spacing is inadequate in many places, such as left padding on the window title, left padding on the sidebar text (this should line up with the title text btw), the window chrome colours are too pale, the font is too small, the view change icons are confusing, what is all that empty space in the path bar?... <i>sigh</i> the second screenshot link is even worse.<p>Don&#x27;t take this the wrong way, I appreciate the work the KDE team is putting into this, but the UI just make me cringe when I try to use it. I have used all versions of KDE and IMO KDE 1 and 2 had the most consistent UIs. I think you guys should really focus a release on just the UI, rework it entirely to give it a polished, unique feel that can really push the experience forward. Something more like BeOS maybe? That had a nice polished, clean UI. All this transparency&#x2F;blurring by the way, is unnecessary, the next UI should not be full of it.<p>Also, would like to see widgets (and other bloat) removed and the bottom bar is not a nice thing to use either. Again, BeOS has a nice Deskbar that has a far nicer feel. Something along those lines would be awesome.<p>Just my two cents.')
