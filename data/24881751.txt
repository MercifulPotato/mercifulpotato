If you&#x27;re referring to black Americans, recall that <i>right now</i>, they get preferential treatment from top US universities, government loan programs, tech company jobs, etc. That&#x27;s not to say that there are no problems, but you&#x27;re just not speaking reasonably if you compare the two. You&#x27;re either speaking from emotion, or you&#x27;re engaging in typical CCP or Putin propaganda (I suspect it&#x27;s the first in this case).<p>Edit: For sure, historically, there are strong comparisons between the Uighur situation and the situation of African-Americans in the slave and Jim Crow eras. But those are over 150 and 50 years gone by, respectively.')
