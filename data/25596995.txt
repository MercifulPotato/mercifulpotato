It was neat at first because you could track why something was changed and what it was supposed to do, and even have a user confirm it’s working the way they expected (I hate when bugs are closed because the dev thinks it’s fixed but it actually isn’t). The ticket would point to source or git log if you wanted more detail.<p>Sadly it developed from a tiny, quick, useful note to a documentation slog when a new project manager joined and wanted a long description of everything typed into the ticket. So I ended up killing Jira altogether.')
