I want to play against better people; it&#x27;s really no fun to me to easily win games.<p>The main complaint I&#x27;ve seen re: SBMM comes from top level players, including creators, who don&#x27;t want to sweat &#x2F; they want to beat players who aren&#x27;t as good as them. To me this means SBMM is absolutely needed. Unranked play shouldn&#x27;t mean better players can crush those who aren&#x27;t as good.<p>This isn&#x27;t even considering the fact that creators rely on looking good play-wise for their income, and SBMM makes this harder.')
