So I&#x27;ll instead point out my own anecdata and let you do what you will.<p>My (((own))) family in the UK are all habitual Labour voters. In the last election, so far as I know, they mostly swung Tory because that nice Mr Corbyn frightened them. Not going to argue if they should have been worried about him or not. The simple fact is that they were. So far as I know from conversations with them, they all plan to vote for Labour again at the next election. From this, it has been my assumption that there is plenty of support for Labour in the Jewish community in the UK, Israel&#x2F;Palestine notwithstanding. Perhaps it is the case that many people really can tell the difference between criticism of Israel, and picking on Israel to the exclusion of all else, and think they saw one thing in the Labour Party before Corbyn, and another during, and yet another after. Of course, we&#x27;re back to my assumptions again. YMMV.')
