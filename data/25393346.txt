For what it’s worth, my agreement was initially based on personal experience with people who exhibit NPD traits, but I decided to refresh my memory of the DSM criteria. I know the DSM isn’t the only, or even best, resource for diagnosis questions[1]... but of its 9 criteria, 7 are either in whole or in part accommodating to low self esteem and the kinds of things described in this article.<p>I may be biased by the article’s prose (and by the site itself), but I get the sense that this is a diagnostic motivated to associate general expressions of victimhood (including the more visible expressions of trauma and oppression alluded to in the article) with harmful and manipulative expressions of victimhood that are plenty common in NPD (and certainly BPD).<p>I’m not qualified to draw that conclusion in a meaningfully scientific way, but I’m certainly skeptical that there’s a distinction in this classification that warrants distinction. And I think the harm it could do if adopted is pretty significant.<p>[1]: From personal experience, I likely wouldn’t have been diagnosed ADHD without being prepared with some creativity.')
