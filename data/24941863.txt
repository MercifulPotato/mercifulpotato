Because I didn&#x27;t encounter any glaring or obvious (certainly nothing game breaking) bugs when I played the PS4 version. I don&#x27;t actually remember encountering any, but I&#x27;m sure there were some minor ones that I forgot about. I certainly wouldn&#x27;t give the PS4 version as an example of how weak AAA titles are regarding bugs.')
