Sure people along the line <i>claim</i> to have attribution figured out but, coincidentally, they all attribute your spend to their &quot;value add.&quot;<p>The incentives of the current ad system and ad spend attribution for everyone along the chain from publisher =&gt; advertiser are all misaligned and almost no one is doing it properly.  It&#x27;s so bad because everyone gets paid to turn a blind eye.<p>For example, lack of good bot detection.  Publishers benefit by higher CPC&#x2F;CPM. Ad networks, ad agencies, and creative agencies all benefit because they take a vig off of total # of ads served and&#x2F;or total ad spend.  Average individual paid ad buyers benefit from the vagaries of the system because it allows them to justify spend by correlation, not causation (e.g. I bought this KW and traffic went up! Too bad conversions and revenue didn&#x27;t.....)<p>Like organic SEO, the gulf between the average and the good is huge.  If you find a good paid ad manager, hold on to them because they can be worth their weight in gold.')
