I think it&#x27;s because my muscle memory sloppily translates what my brain is hearing since it&#x27;s not focusing on the context, and those two words sound similar. This is also how &quot;your&quot; sometimes gets mixed with &quot;you&#x27;re&quot;, even though I most definitely know the difference and spot the mistake immediately when proofreading.')
