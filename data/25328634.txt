Qualcomm, Samsung, Intel, and AMD are not keeping up. Huawei has been knocked out of the competition, mostly by geopolitics as far as I can tell. The only question was the timing of the MacOS pivot. The A12X was good enough for a MacBook Air but a compromise for a MacBook Pro. The M1 is a no-compromise SoC for MacOS and the only question is the execution of the software transition; the focus of Gruber and Moorhead&#x27;s spat.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;users.nik.uni-obuda.hu&#x2F;sima&#x2F;letoltes&#x2F;Processor_families_Knowledge_Base_2019&#x2F;Apple&#x27;s_processor_lines_2018_12_23.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;users.nik.uni-obuda.hu&#x2F;sima&#x2F;letoltes&#x2F;Processor_famil...</a>')
