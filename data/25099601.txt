So what exactly is the new risk here?  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;login.publicdata.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;login.publicdata.com&#x2F;</a><p>It&#x27;s also a bit absurd that the victim count is 28M.  The total population of Texas is 28M, which includes small children who aren&#x27;t drivers.')
