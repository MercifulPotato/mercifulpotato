Probably Zero. If you count Live-Streaming, then 1 or 2 more. If we talk about alternatives to host videos? Probably dozens or more. If we talk about places for &quot;high business&quot; (proper company, not some lone creator in his ikea-flatroom) to make money, even more, but most of them are also specialized. Social Services like Instagram, Twitter, TikTok and even reddit are somewhat of a competition for short clips (&lt;2 min), but making money there is a bit strange I guess.<p>Youtube at the moment is the single place (for videos) where you get everything, from the high number of potential customers, to proper and easy tooling for managing stuff coupled with a good level of potential income. And as long as Youtube is to big to fail, this will not change.')
