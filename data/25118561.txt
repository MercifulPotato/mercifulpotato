And even if they do somehow see signs of fishing activity, they almost certainly have very little idea of what day to day life as a fisherman is like.<p>Again, I repeat that agriculture in our society employs about 1% of the population. Even those who live in rural America (as I do these days) don&#x27;t pick up farming by osmosis. Most people who live even in rural America do not farm, or work on a farm. They are just not that familiar with this kind of work (which is partly the cause and partly the result of the reality that most farm workers in the US now are migrant labor from latin american countries).<p>I don&#x27;t know who else does &quot;summer jobs&quot; anymore if it&#x27;s not college kids. Maybe ski&#x2F;surf bums filling in the off months? We can probably count the number of them, and its likely less than a mid-size American city in total.<p>Sounds like you might want to read &quot;House&quot;. Tracey Kidder pulled the same magic in &quot;Soul of a New Machine&quot;, the now-classic book about the engineering of an (old) new computer. &quot;House&quot; is an amazingly deep meditation of the design and construction of modern American family home. Or maybe just read &quot;Fine Homebuilding&quot; for a while - not so heavy on the philosophy but hints of it here and there.<p>I just can&#x27;t really get it into my head what country you&#x27;re talking about. I travel all over the USA (just did 4500 miles) and this land in which fishing, farming and carpentry are the jobs that <i>most</i> people do is invisible to me.')
