It was a 2-3 hour project that involved a whole kit of tools in addition to the new battery.<p>It was a PITA, but I am thankful that a) iFixit provided a helpful guide and a kit with all of the things I needed except for the rubbing alcohol and b) it was legal and there weren&#x27;t any software issues to deal with.<p>Aside from the aging battery and occasionally running out of storage, the phone was completely fine for my needs. For ~$50 and a few hours of time, I&#x27;ve essentially doubled the lifespan of my $700 phone.')
