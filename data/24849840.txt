Sorry it had to come about as a result of injury&#x2F;disease. Hopefully you&#x27;re not going to hurt your vocal tract -- are there precautions you take against this?<p>My interest currently is in voice-assistants and developing something like a personal assistant &#x2F; code-monkey &#x2F; grad-student.<p>I did have a stroke a few years ago, from which I&#x27;ve recovered, but it made me realize that almost all of my work, hobbies, aspirations, are tied to fairly extensive hand-eye integration. It&#x27;s good to start building a Plan B before I need it.<p>On a(nother?) side-note, my 88 year old dad still codes and his experiences have really shown me how bad we are at accessibility, as a developer community.<p>One final thing -- watching you work in this way highlights for me how low-level a lot of the stuff we do as developer is. There&#x27;s a certain amount of just text massaging that seems irrelevant to what we&#x27;re actually trying to get done (although it can be fun&#x2F;soothing&#x2F;aesthetic).<p>EDIT&gt; The last point is why I can&#x27;t give a fark about Vim&#x2F;Emacs&#x2F;whatever debates and obsessing. It seems like it might be fertile ground, but IMNSHO it&#x27;s a trap.')
