Item(by='tialaramex', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601709764, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24667613, text='I have a pair of hardware FIDO authenticators, and my phone and laptop are both platform authenticators.<p>I have personal accounts with Google, GitHub, GitLab, Facebook, and DropBox that use at least two of those four authenticators. I also have Login.gov (US government) and Gov.uk Verify (one of two UK government authentication systems, hooray for needless duplication)<p>Most of them offered one-time recovery codes which I hand wrote in a book of one-time recovery codes, but without fetching that book I can&#x27;t tell you it was all of them.<p>At my previous job I used a physical authenticator with AWS and <i>that</i> was indeed restricted to just one authenticator, on the other hand there&#x27;s an account &quot;administrator&quot; for that AWS account so if you lost your authenticator the admin can get you back in and I assume larger companies have multiple people in the administrator role.<p>The WebAuthn specification <i>explicitly</i> says that Relying Parties (ie web sites) should support multiple keys.<p>And yes, if you lose access to all methods of authentication in some cases you lose the account. I believe GitLab explicitly flagged their intent to act this way for accounts that don&#x27;t pay them money, and I would prefer this. As I wrote back then, if it&#x27;s not worth an hour of my time to somehow try to prove my identity to you after locking myself out of your service (which if I&#x27;m not paying you, it probably isn&#x27;t), then I don&#x27;t want it to be worth an hour of some social engineer&#x27;s time to steal my account.')
