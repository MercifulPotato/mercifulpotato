No need to have blobs of meat hanging around. Intelligence itself is human thing. Whether it needs to have a body &#x2F; physical metabolic processes to run by injesting cheetos all day, is totally absurd. Evolutionary processes have given us so much unnecessary baggage. Pure abstract intelligence is pretty damn human. There is already Neuralink and other hybird tech going on. I believe humans will willingly give up physical bodies in the long term (millenia scale).<p>This is bound to happen. There is no way it wouldn&#x27;t I believe, ofcourse in short term, we gotta worry about stuff like politics, solving hunger and world peace.')
