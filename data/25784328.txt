Item(by='dhd415', descendants=None, kids=[25784620], score=None, time=1610666009, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25783961, text='I think a more charitable interpretation of Elastic&#x27;s motives in the re-licensing would be to view them the same as your motives for your side project -- allow free use to anyone except those wanting to offer it as a hosted service. You say that you&#x27;ve licensed your side project with MIT and Apache2 but with an exclusion. In other words, it&#x27;s neither MIT nor Apache2 and it&#x27;s unclear how your exclusion would hold up legally (hopefully well!). At Elastic&#x27;s scale, uncertainty over a license is too risky, so I&#x27;m sure they paid their lawyers $$$ to ensure that the SSPL would hold up in the scenarios that were important to them.')
