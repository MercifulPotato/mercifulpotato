The sheer amount of injustice that happens there is just way to much. I am not sure I would be able to sleep comfortably living in a country where I would be making 7x or 8x what other families are making at the expense of leaving them with no safety net whatsoever.<p>Freedom at times kinda looks a lot more like selfishness.<p>The EU has a lot of other problems, but at least people here does not have to think twice before doing &quot;normal things&quot; like going to the doctor. I mean it is primarily important to think about one self, I get that, but what happens to others is really important and will affect us eventually!<p>PS: I left Buenos Aires in 2009, now I live in Spain, even though here it is not perfect at least I can sleep without regrets.')
