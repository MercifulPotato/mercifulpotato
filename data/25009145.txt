Very cool link you shared, I didn&#x27;t know about it. I also pondered if I should create this app as a browser extension of a standalone website.<p>I decided to go with a website, because it&#x27;s easier for non-users to discover content: having to install a plugin or app on one&#x27;s phone is one order of magnitude more effortful, and search engines can crawl this content but not what&#x27;s trapped inside an extension or phone app.<p>Also, if I see more people using it, I&#x27;d like to extend to Spotify (as they expand into the realm of podcasts), and possibly audio-only with Libsyn and such.')
