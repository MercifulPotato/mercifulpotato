That&#x27;s also why the best athletes don&#x27;t use coaches.  Wait, that&#x27;s not right.  Hang on.<p>Even though all real learning is at least 80% internal and must be owned-and-operated by the student...  maybe there&#x27;s a role for spoonfed knowledge.  Certainly there&#x27;s a role for teachers (disagreeing with &quot;good students learn alone&quot;), even if morale-management and goal-setting is a surprisingly large fraction of it.  But even spoonfed knowledge is helpful.  For example, as far as I can tell, most good mathematicians have a <i>lot</i> of spoonfed knowledge as part of their learning history (but they also have <i>even more</i> self-guided exploration, and even the spoonfed stuff you gotta chew on it and digest it).<p>Agreed, though, that a lot of articles like this are clickbaity and, like sugar, give you a <i>sensation of learning</i> rather than what you really need.  This particular article, I think, contains a mish-mash of good advice and, uh, pureed pap.  It&#x27;s certainly not worst-of-breed.')
