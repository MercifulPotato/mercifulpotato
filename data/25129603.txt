So i.e. &quot;use&quot; and &quot;utilise&quot; are not at all the same words, one fancy.<p>Same goes for syntactic structures. There&#x27;s a variety of approaches here, but you&#x27;d be hard pressed to find even a supporter of transformational generative grammar, the Chomskyan paradigm who says active and passive sentences come from the same underlying deep structure (roughly speaking), who&#x27;d say active and passive voice sentences are equal or equivalent in discourse.<p>Similarly, you can&#x27;t boil down &quot;complexity&quot; to the length of sentences or number of clauses. I&#x27;d be more willing to concede if this was talking about the distance of things that refer to each other, or the number of words that refer to previous discourse or outer world (i.e. long-distance dependencies &amp; deictic elements). But you can have paragraph long sentences that read just buttery smooth, and &quot;sentence&quot; itself is a pretty vague term that you can&#x27;t really pin down. Like, if I splat that previous sentence into two around &quot;and&quot;, would it really be two sentences, or is it really one sentence to begin with?<p>All these weird stuff like &quot;don&#x27;t use active voice&quot; or &quot;use &#x27;simpler&#x27; words&quot; etc. are the product of the same mentality that in ye olde times wanted you not to split infinitives, not to end your sentences with prepositions, and other nonsense up with which you should not put.')
