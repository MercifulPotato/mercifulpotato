I’m in no position to do or ask that of another woman even if she is a participant in my study. I personally know how time-consuming it can be to get braids or head wraps tied (and what lies beneath a headscarf may be extra personal). Further, a good number of participants didn’t just have big hair, they had hijabs as well, and these, more than any other updo, cannot be removed.&quot;<p>Quite frankly this seems like a non issue. I wear glasses and 3d glasses always are a pain to use but I don&#x27;t insinuate discrimination. Was the Oculus Go also not designed for Sikhs? The comment about hijabs is ludicrous. The people who want to control their insular culture but also want to be victims in mass culture are infuriating.')
