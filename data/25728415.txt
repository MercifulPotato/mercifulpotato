Most frequent ones are inter-frames, and those encode the difference from the previous frame â€” so if you don&#x27;t have those previous frames, you can&#x27;t decode a usable picture. You have to wait for the next intra-frame to be transmitted, which contains a complete picture by itself. Analog video doesn&#x27;t have that restriction, every single frame is self-sufficient.<p>&gt; Also Teletext worked always fast and was instant.<p>That&#x27;s not at all how I remember it. I remember it taking anywhere from instant to 15 seconds to load a page.')
