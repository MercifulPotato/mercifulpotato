And the content of the subscription is not fixed, for a few months some magazines appeared, and other disappeared. Some of the content is gore&#x2F;mature, while not straight porn.<p>The catch of course is that the subscription payment goes to Apple, and only Apple (no concurrent web version exists), and additional in-app purchases also go through Apple, no bypassing.<p>There is also audio subscriptions apps working on the same principles. The one I follow has been there for years.<p>Basically, as long as Apple gets  a decent cut the &quot;browser&quot; nature or fine grain policing content doesn&#x27;t seem to matter much.')
