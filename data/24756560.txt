One of the transcripts was something akin to &quot;you won&#x27;t believe it, but it&#x27;s back over there&quot; - there&#x27;s no claim by the radio operator that they &quot;saw&quot; a track move at speed X, it could just as well be taken as &quot;it was here, and then it was back there&quot;. Unless the object was squawking an IFF or transponder code, how would they know it&#x27;s the exact same object?<p>Since we don&#x27;t have that evidence - guy claims before he could even lock up the E2C tapes a pair from the USAF appear on a Naval Carrier (like teleported or what?) to take them.<p>All the worlds most advanced collection systems, optical and radar and all we have are fuzzy videos no better than a bigfoot video. The only decent video is debunked by someone actually doing the math.')
