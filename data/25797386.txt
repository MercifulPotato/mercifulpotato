People work really hard to make this semi-viable in Lua, but it is a path of frustration.</i><p>It&#x27;s unfortunate that Lua doesn&#x27;t work well for this. The Lua implementation&#x27;s light weight, portability and robustness [0] seem ideal for building these applications - especially for building applications that can be distributed to end-users (a scenario which is not a focus of Python [1]).<p>Obviously Lua is never going to include a large standard library because that conflicts with its embeddability. However, even in the Python community, “batteries included” is no longer considered entirely beneficial [2]. Instead, I think Lua would benefit from a set of officially recommended external libraries. This would improve the situation for people trying to write standalone applications in Lua, and I believe it would also help those who are writing scripts targeting embedded interpreters.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lua.org&#x2F;bugs.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lua.org&#x2F;bugs.html</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;gvanrossum&#x2F;status&#x2F;1347045076401147904" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;gvanrossum&#x2F;status&#x2F;1347045076401147904</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lwn.net&#x2F;Articles&#x2F;790677&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lwn.net&#x2F;Articles&#x2F;790677&#x2F;</a>')
