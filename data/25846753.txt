If that&#x27;s so, I&#x27;d argue that over the last century the time required to enjoy innovation (time to market saturation) has gone down. Even for physical goods? I think that the radio took decades to become widespread. The ipod took... a few years?<p>All that to say, maybe virtual innovation takes even less time, and should have less time to enjoy monopoly? But I&#x27;m only playing your devil&#x27;s advocate.')
