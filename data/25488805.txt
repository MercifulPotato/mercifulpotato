I agree that ideally I would have wanted to playtest this more before drawing attention to it.<p>That being said, I do suspect that these rules are probably pretty close to achieving the effect I wanted to achieve- the main doubt I have is whether the king&#x27;s moves work, or if they need to be adjusted to get the balance right, but even there, there&#x27;s a good chance that it works. I will make sure to update the article when I get a chance to test it out.')
