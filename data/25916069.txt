At those times making Linux distro was a highly unprofitable business. Companies did not care about Linux at all. Windows, Sparx, AIX, IBM mainframes, etc. everywhere.<p>Yet Red Hat people had a vision that Linux could be a thing in the real World and I would say, they deserve a premium for all those hungry years.<p>Second, Red Hat is one of the largest corporate contributors to Linux kernel. I bet that, for instance, Amazon AWS is making way more money on Linux and open software than Red Hat, yet their contribution is not particularly significant.<p>I am not surprised that Red Hat is not supporting financially something that is a rip-off of their software. A legal rip-off obviously and Red Hat is not suing or spreading FUD about such initiatives, but I don&#x27;t see any reason why they should financially back them.')
