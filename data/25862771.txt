I would love to see the whole collection on a 2d grid that I can zoom in to see the images themselves -- maybe some organization tools to reposition the images on virtual grid for different aspects (by time, by artist, by colors) but the interface seems like such a natural fit, with dragging and zooming, rather than the page navigation they have here.')
