This is especially the case if one considers that any nuclear plant whose construction started today would be competing against renewable and storage technologies of a decade or more in the future.<p>For nuclear to survive, not only do its costs have to come down a lot, but the ongoing crash in costs of renewables and storage have to come to a sudden halt.   Nuclear proponents are basically betting that all the many storage technologies fail to get cheaper.   This is quite the bet.')
