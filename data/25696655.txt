This is basically a &#x27;harangue&#x27; - and personally, I&#x27;m tired of it.  No one has a &#x27;right&#x27; to force people to listen to them.<p>&gt;&gt; We just assume we&#x27;re right.<p>No, I assume they&#x27;re wrong as the logic doesn&#x27;t hold up. There is a difference.  Personally, I think the election basically boiled down to &#x27;rural&#x27; vs &#x27;urban&#x27;, but I&#x27;m sure there are other views. I can&#x27;t force people to believe my views &#x27;cuz I said so!&#x27; anymore then Trump can force me to believe him, &#x27;cuz he said so!&#x27;<p>&gt;&gt; Wouldn&#x27;t you do the same?<p>I don&#x27;t recall doing the same when Bernie was written off by DNC, and there actually WAS evidence the DNC tilted things against him.<p>edit: fix formatting')
