Not one that I was the first to think of, but one which I came up with all on my own not based upon anything similar I&#x27;d already learned. It was hard but I satisfyingly recalled an early instance. I was in grade 7 back in the late 70s being taught that cutting a circle in half and unrolling each half to make the semi-circumference straight thus making a series of triangles (in the limit). Meshing the triangles together makes a parallelogram&#x2F;rectangle in the limit. This was a demonstration of the formula for the area of a circle.<p>After seeing this, I thought to myself, Pi is dumb. A diameter is double the radius, so the radius is the fundamental. I tried telling this to a bunch of people, kids or adults who just looked at me funny.<p>I was so happy to much later learn that there&#x27;s Tau. And very sad that alien races might hear the beeps of Tau&#x2F;2 being sent to them by the clueless terrans.')
