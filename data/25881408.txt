On twitch you can buy with credit card bits. A bit is about 1 penny. But you usually buy $5 bits incrementally. You can watch ad for 10 bits sometimes too.<p>You can then give anywhere from 1 bit to whatever to the streamer. Some streamers will set minimums of 5 or 25 bits. At end of month the bits are converted back to real money minus twitch fee. And they send check to streamer.<p>The problem really isn&#x27;t in the tech. Its solved and easy. Its getting some intermediary to be used by many.  New York times can&#x27;t be it for itself. It needs to be something that a user buys bits or whatever and then can use a large variety of websites.')
