Item(by='soneca', descendants=None, kids=[24771053, 24771338], score=None, time=1602614403, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24768263, text='I never use cases.<p>From the old indestructible Nokias, passing through a Sony Ericsson, a Nokia Windows Phone, and then the Moto G4. Until my previous phone.<p>My previous phone was a Moto G6, with glass in the back. In the second day, it fell from my lap and the back-glass broke completely, but stood in place with glass dust all over. I had to use a case (that is shipped with the phone, probably predicting this). I was pissed, always hated. All of that because of a useless aesthetic product decision.<p>Then I bought the latest iPhone SE, my first iPhone ever. I use it without a case and it fell, from various heights, probably more than 30 times now. The screen is intact, just a few scratches in the corners. I am pretty happy about it.<p>Edit: just in case anyone wants to know, I don’t like cases solely because it makes the phone larger. The “how easily and comfortably it fits in my pockets” is my main criteria. I don’t care about aesthetics much, consequently I also don’t care if my phone has scratches on its sides. That’s one reason I changed to the iPhone SE (small phone + great chip + privacy considerations). I would only ever consider buying the iPhone Mini out of these iPhone 12 line.')
