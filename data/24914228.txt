I&#x27;m quite overwhelmed by the response :) looking to address as much of the feedback as possible by the end of the week.<p>A major weakness seems to be my choice of ES5. I wanted an almost absolute minimum, which ES5 seemed to be at the time. I was lead by the fact that most bundlers produce ES5 by default, which may very well have been a mistake.<p>Interestingly, if ES5 is <i>really</i> dead (which it might be, I&#x27;m not sure) and ES6 is the minimum target, the study&#x27;s results would actually <i>improve drastically</i> (less verbosity, actual modules, etc.) and further support the claim that vanilla can be maintainable (even without build steps).
