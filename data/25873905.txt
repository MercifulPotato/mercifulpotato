Really. China and the US were flat for the year, and pretty much all the gains came from Europe, where BEV and PHEVs are selling like hot cakes.<p>There are also some electric cars being sold for the lower end of the market, mainly because auto manufacturers have to comply with CO2 legislation and they can&#x27;t do that only by selling expensive PHEVs, much as they would prefer to. On top of that, with more and more charging stations being built in cities and on highways, range anxiety is not as much as it used to be. Pretty much all new BEVs can go 200km in a charge and charge reasonably fast.<p>I believe 2021 this trend will only accelerate, especially in the US with Biden coming in.')
