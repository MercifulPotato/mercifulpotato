The comparables are a quarter of the price or less in any other major city.<p>SF as a tech hub needs to die. There are better cities that are far less NIMBY and regressive.<p>If you don&#x27;t succeed in launching a startup, you&#x27;re just participating in a meat market. Your salary goes to rent. It&#x27;s not sustainable.<p>My SF coworkers often have roommates. You can&#x27;t live like that in your 30&#x27;s. You can&#x27;t get married or raise kids like that. I&#x27;ve owned multiple concurrent properties in the heart of a city - historic properties with 25&#x27; ceilings - and I still pay less than SF rent. It floors me people put up with SF living conditions.<p>NYC, Boston, Portland, Austin, Charlotte, Atlanta, and Miami have way better adjusted costs of living and aren&#x27;t so broken politically. You can probably pick two cities and own homes in each for the cost of your SF rent.<p>Let the land owners have what they deserve. A brain and wealth drain.')
