It’s a desire to find the root cause to everything, to understand the reason behind everything, and to package that up into a chain of causality that fits within my mind.<p>The positive side of this is that many of these attributes are needed to be a good engineer. The negative side is, at least for me, trouble dealing with chaos or ambiguity in the world or anything that has an unclear explanation.<p>Maybe this contributes to being more susceptible to conspiracy thinking. I am not sure; that’s a question for social scientists to uncover.')
