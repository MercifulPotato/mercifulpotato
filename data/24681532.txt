It is folly to fight the natural drive to compete.  Instead focus on systems that channel that drive into innovation and production.  There will always be haves and have-nots as long as there is evolutionary selection.<p>My favorite metaphor is to think of humanity as gasoline.  Left alone it explodes, but put in an engine it does useful work.  Society and its laws are the engine that channels destructive force into useful output.')
