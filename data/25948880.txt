Item(by='lamontcg', descendants=None, kids=[25949697], score=None, time=1611866543, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25948358, text='The problem is that if big short sellers like Melvin Capital go under that their counterparties are the brokers that will be ultimately holding most of the bag.<p>This is what I couldn&#x27;t understand about what the endgame of this would have to be.  Because you can&#x27;t really have a situation where all the shares are bought up sending the shares to infinity.  At some point something breaks.  Someone has to pay money for those shares.<p>That could be that retail investors bolt for the door just like a bubble popping and because its difficult to maintain steadiness when you&#x27;re looking at huge gains that aren&#x27;t realized.  And that is what they thought would happen.<p>What would be more reasonable would be to liquidate Melvin Capital and anyone stupid enough to invest in them and the holders of GME shares would become creditors against that bankruptcy proceeding somehow.  SEC would have to manage that unwinding somehow.<p>But the problem is that the clearinghouses like Citadel are counterparties to Melvin Capital and they&#x27;ve privately bailed them out, taken over their shorts and will now hugely profit by suspending trading and riding those short positions down.  This now entirely makes sense to me as what was inevitable, because while WSB was trying to destroy Melvin Capital they didn&#x27;t understand that the implications of that were going to be destroying the clearinghouses through counterparty risk.  And they were never going to let that happen, so they shut it all down and will eat the SEC investigation.<p>This is a very interesting outcome just due to the moral hazard it creates with shorting.<p>It is also a very interesting outcome because a lot of &quot;little guys&quot; just learned an object lesson in what happens when it looks like you are beating the &quot;big guys&quot;.  They won&#x27;t let that happen.  There&#x27;s going to be a lot of political rage as a result of this.  We&#x27;re going to have to make a decision in the next 10 years or so if we&#x27;d like to funnel that rage towards socialism or fascism, the status quo is going to continue to enrage people.')
