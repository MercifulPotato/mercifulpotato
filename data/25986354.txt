Especially mechanical ones. Their beauty combined with their flaws puts people on the never ending, wallet destroying quest for the holy grail. And the diminishing returns from jumping from a &quot;budget&quot; watch of 3-500$ to a &quot;nice&quot; one of 2-3000$ are ridiculously small.<p>Collecting mechanical watches is especially bad in these last couple of years because the prices have gone up by a lot with little to none technical advances to back it up. It looks to me like a ponzi scheme supported by the watch media (hodinkee in particular [0]) as they try to push watches as a sort of investment - which they are not it you actually wear them. The manufacturers put out one overpriced limited edition after another where the only thing that changes is the color scheme.<p>There&#x27;s a lot to talk about and I&#x27;m sure I didn&#x27;t do a good job of presenting my case in such a short post, but at least keep this warning in the back of your head.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thetruthaboutwatches.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;ben-clymer-hodinkee-valued-at-100m&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thetruthaboutwatches.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;ben-clymer-hodinkee...</a>')
