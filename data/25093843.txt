I&#x27;m still bundling libgit2, it took a lot of effort to get it to work.<p>I&#x27;ve been working on dart-git <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;GitJournal&#x2F;dart-git" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;GitJournal&#x2F;dart-git</a> and it&#x27;s been slowly replacing most of libgit2.
