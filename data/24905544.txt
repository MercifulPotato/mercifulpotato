We don&#x27;t currently live in a society that comes close to maximizing freedom for everyone (freedom of opportunity is denied to the majority of folks in the US and elsewhere) but I think we&#x27;re on the right general path to eventually approach a Star Trek future.<p>I really appreciate parliamentary governments over the hot mess the US has - I think you get a lot better representation especially when no one party has a majority.  If everyone is in a minority then you have consensus through coalitions of different fractions and it gets a lot closer to each skinny slice of the nation getting a legitimate say.  The more slices you have the better your representation of the public will (up to, ultimately, true popular democracy) but as a society we probably want either majority or strong majority decisions to guide us and that&#x27;s just conceptually incompatible with no one getting their free-will stomped on.<p>This hits a really deep point on the topic of freedom - I have the right to not be murdered, but that right comes at the cost of anyone who wants to murder me... restrictions of rights are necessary for greater general societal rights.')
