It was and is a way to stop (ultimately nuclear) confrontation between members to prevent WWIII.It has been instrumental to this goal, and this is the actual purpose of the UN. The General Assembly is a nicety.<p>At different points in time, any member could have had such charges like you make leveled at them. This doesn&#x27;t mean crimes against the Uyghurs (and indigenous people more broadly) should not be challenged, but &quot;abolish the UN&quot; isn&#x27;t going to help.')
