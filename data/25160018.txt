It’s like Dawkins who only attacks fundamentalists and never looks at more philosophical interpretations, never mind approaching non-Abrahamic traditions.<p>So yes, rituals differ, maybe outdated and allegory is difficult to relate to. But people throw around this word “God” without even bothering to define it. It’s like saying the answer to an equation is X. No, the answer is not X, X is a postulation which you are required to solve for.<p>Similarly merely accepting the existence or non existence of God has no meaning. God is unknown. For anyone interested in further reading, please see “The Monk and the Philosopher” (Rivel &amp; Ricard) which served to properly call into question my materialist, “scientific” view of the world and its nature. If you’re looking to challenge your beliefs in this regard and are similarly persuaded as parent or GP, it’s worth a read.')
