Some facts are obvious, like pigs not growing on trees, but others aren&#x27;t, like climate change. Science has been corrupted for decades and I don&#x27;t believe it to be a proper arbiter of truth in certain areas, particularly ones that can&#x27;t be tested against reality easily, such as climate change.<p>You probably disagree with me, which makes my &quot;bar for misinformation&quot; different than yours. And I&#x27;m guessing that we won&#x27;t be able to bridge that gap through reason and logic.')
