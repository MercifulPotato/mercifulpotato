Been that way for five years and I have no intention of ever changing it.<p>I&#x27;m skipping this year, mostly because I want the Max camera and the regular form factor, but also to get some field data on whether this newfangled mag connector scrambles cards.<p>On the one hand, they&#x27;re prominently featuring an accessory which clips your cards to the magnet itself.
