Item(by='twodave', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609291844, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25577008, text='This reminds me of a piece of local history I recently learned in my hometown (Northeast FL).<p>In the late 1800s, a number of slave families traveled down-river from Georgia after being emancipated and homesteaded in my area on the St. Johns River. As property values increased and they started being taxed more heavily on their (mostly waterfront) land, many of these families (whose patriarchs were mostly illiterate and not at all business-savvy) ended up selling to (i.e. getting taken advantage of by) housing developers, basically losing their identity and heritage.<p>The story isn&#x27;t necessarily a direct parallel, but the pattern reminds me of the &quot;milkshake&quot; scene from the movie There Will Be Blood. People shouldn&#x27;t have to worry about their basic livelihood and property being stripped away by anything other than perhaps a natural disaster of some kind.')
