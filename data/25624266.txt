Everyone loved it but every time I tried i fell asleep and just couldn&#x27;t get into it.<p>I&#x27;m semi happy with Go. It&#x27;s a hands on language that is fast enough. But it&#x27;s missing elegance and something I can&#x27;t put my finger on is missing.<p>But Rust, it feels like a step back.\nWhat do I think in? Boxes? Wrap unwrap move what? It&#x27;s so hipster I just hate it. And compilation takes a lot of resources and time. Hell, Java makes more sense to me than Rust.<p>And why all those macros?\nAnd impl for order is backwards.\nWhy couldn&#x27;t the word class be used, no they just want to be different for the sake of being different. It&#x27;s a language for hipster rebels without a cause.')
