I can buy that you may want to train on a balanced dataset, but the testing condition should reflect the true case distribution as closely as possible.<p>I agree that you would not want to use only the class priors for prediction.  However, I do not think it is clear that you would want to throw that information out.  Also not sure that I agree with the statement that neural network has “no memory” of the prior class distribution.  That is a strong claim to make about something as opaque as a neural net model.')
