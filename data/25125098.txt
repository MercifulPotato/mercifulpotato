IIRC that&#x27;s worked quite well for me.<p>It&#x27;d need passwordless sudo so only a minor improvement, but avoiding root login allows you to limit which tasks run as privileged&#x2F;non-privileged users, tick boxes when it comes to audits, and allows multiple users to run the same playbooks under their own account.<p>As you&#x27;ve just said, it might not fit everyone&#x27;s needs, but thought it&#x27;s worth putting out there for anybody who would prefer not to log in as root.')
