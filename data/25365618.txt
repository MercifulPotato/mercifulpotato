Not always, but some of the time.  And if they win, they can in fact ask for Facebook to be broken up, and get it.<p>And even if they don&#x27;t win, Facebook has to take it seriously, which takes time and energy from executives.  They have to at least consider the chance that the FTC will win, which means that they might think about a settlement rather than rolling the dice on a trial.  How much that settlement changes things depends on how the sides negotiate, which depends (at least in part) on how much confidence each side has that they would win.<p>Does <i>this</i> suit have enough merit to succeed?  I have no idea.')
