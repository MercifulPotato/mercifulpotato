I was in the bay area and handsomely overpaid.\nI have no personal experience of it being abused, but I&#x27;m obviously privileged, having worked at reputable tech companies and coming from reasonable wealthy european country.\n(I was never as scared of loosing job or healthcare as my American co-workers, because I would just move home, and have access to healthcare if I lost my job)<p>But I will say, that the lottery aspect of the H1B adds a lot of uncertainty that might discourage me from living in SF again.
