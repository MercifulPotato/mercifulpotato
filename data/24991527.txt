In classic vi, these commands are illogical in that cw doesn&#x27;t eat the space following the word like dw does, and Y works on the entire line, whereas D deletes only from the cursor to the end of the line. The Vim manual states that:<p><pre><code>     If you like &quot;Y&quot; to work from the cursor to the end of line (which is more logical, but not Vi-compatible) use &quot;:map Y y$&quot;.\n</code></pre>\n...however, I&#x27;m used do cw and Y being illogical like that, goshdarnit, so when these Vim-clones come along and &quot;fix&quot; it, I&#x27;m thrown off at every step I take.')
