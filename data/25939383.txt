Being immature means you <i>behave</i> immature. Scolding someone for behaviour is very different than scolding them for something they can&#x27;t change about them selves (e.g. like where they have been born).<p>Usually we also factor in age when calling someone immature. So if someone calls you immature, they mean &quot;immature given your age&quot;, so it is certainly different from e.g. hating on all kids, teenagers or old people.')
