(In my late 20s I ran at least a couple of marathons every year.) I run about four times a week, and have always regarded running as the perfect exercise for a lazy man: find your shorts, find your shoes, and head out; no need for reservations, exercise partners, etc. And I walk most days: generally twice a day on days I don&#x27;t run, once on days I do. And I do not hate running or walking: I inherited a love of walking from my mother, and it carried over to running.<p>I should do more resistance work, but don&#x27;t. Something in one shoulder does not care for push-ups. Well, in the summer I do yard work.<p>Anyway, I&#x27;m glad you found something that works for you. Would that I had the same body-fat ratio that I had in college.')
