The top bins that can sustain longer boosts on higher temps would be binned for the MBP. The ones that can boost with a bit more cooling gets into a Mini. The lower binned ones would be on an MBA, and “faulty” chips with 1 GPU disabled would go in the cheaper 7GPU MBA. Higher yields, better economics.')
