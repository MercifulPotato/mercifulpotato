I probably remember &gt;90%. But the other way it&#x27;s harder. I remember maybe half of those German words, further 1&#x2F;4 I can recall after some mental effort, and probably 1&#x2F;4 are lost or they would require say &gt;10 min thinking (actually possible to recover them with some techniques).<p>In any case I use many of those words actively today (e.g. during my German classes).<p>E.g. yesterday, I tried to use word &#x27;horizontal&#x27; in German, as it was on the list, and couldn&#x27;t recall it quickly. My teacher gave me the word (&#x27;waagrecht&#x27;), and I should have obviously know it, and would know the meaning if somebody used it in German, but couldn&#x27;t recall it easily.')
