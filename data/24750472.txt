I&#x27;d say there&#x27;s junk like sitcoms and the latest marvel tv series or whatever, you don&#x27;t learn anything from it but you can relax and have a good time, and then there&#x27;s absolute trash reality tv about celebrities and making fun of poor people. Junk tv is fine in reasonable amounts. Trash tv is on the same level as social media.')
