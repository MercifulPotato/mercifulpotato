It’s just a bit uncomfortable to have a programming language with a particular, kind of formal-sounding human name like Julia (or like Michael, Lauren, or Jonathan).<p>It just feels weird to me. I know a number of people (family, friends, colleagues) named Julia.<p>I honestly think it could have an effect on adoption. People have to say the name a lot in making a choice to adopt a language for a project. Names like C, C++, Java, Python are fairly neutral. “Julia” is just an awkward name in this context, in my opinion.')
