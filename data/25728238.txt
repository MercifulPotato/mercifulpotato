I occasionally go directly to the Fox News web site just to see their take, because I&#x27;m basically a conservative and have been a lifelong Conservative voter here in the UK. The main problem I have with Fox News is the lack of reflective self-analysis of conservatism or republicanism. There&#x27;s no sense of trying to figure things out, to look at problems with a clear eye and then say what the conservative answer to an issue is, there&#x27;s no attempt to course correct when things go wrong or in an unexpected direction. It&#x27;s all about on-message heavily editorialised spin, omitting or heavily spinning anything that doesn&#x27;t fit the narrative. As such, I find it almost completely useless to me. The news is incomplete and the opinion is uninteresting. They&#x27;re really little better than RT.<p>Fortunately there are some decent conservative leaning news sites, such as The Federalist and National Review, but Fox News does seem to dominate. Even though I often find myself disagreeing with what the leftier US news organisations say as opinion, they&#x27;re much better at actually delivering facts and presenting differing opinions with useful context.<p>To be fair, we have the Daily Mail over here. It&#x27;s not as bad a Fox generally, but it depends on the topic. The BBC does definitely have a left bias, but it&#x27;s pretty mild and they&#x27;re really good on informative content. We do have The Economist though, which is our jewel in the crown of news and opinion IMHO.<p>The bottom line is though I even can go to the Guardian web site, and I might think they&#x27;re off the rails a bit and missing context. Some of their opinion pieces are ridiculous, but I can generally trust their factual information. I can&#x27;t trust Fox or the Daily Mail on facts. That really worries me because a movement based on or informed with extensive misunderstanding of basic facts, or worse with a disregard for the truth, is doomed long term.')
