The M1 SOC pretty well kills everything CPU-wise, and does graphics as well as a GT 1050 discrete GPU. It also throws in AI silicon and RAM, and runs all of it in a 20W (or so) power budget.<p>Single-thread performance is quite comparable to a Threadripper.<p>It&#x27;ll be interesting to see how things look when M1 style silicon is introduced for the 16&quot; Macbook Pro (guessing 8 performance cores, 32 GB RAM), and the Mac Pro (guessing up to 32 performance cores, and at least 64 GB RAM used as cache for a potentially much larger main memory).<p>&gt; There’s also the fact that cost (including peripherals and support) and software availability, not performance and efficiency, are what guide most PC purchases. The M1’s advantages are far less pronounced in those areas.<p>Actually as to cost, it&#x27;s highly competitive in the premium laptop segment (like Dell XPS for instance).<p>Software availability is good, since it&#x27;ll run almost all Intel Mac software, all M1 Mac software (soon to be ~everything), and all ARM-compatible Linux software (ARM Linux runs in a VM).<p>The only thing missing is Windows, and that may well be temporary.<p>I&#x27;d say if you&#x27;re doing web, Mac or Linux software development the Apple Silicon Macs are the wave of the future! :-)')
