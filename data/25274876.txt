Each agency is going to have holes, and many previously unknown ones could be exposed given the unusual time and societal pressures they’re working under.<p>If the UK approves something and everyone goes “eh, good enough” that’s significantly riskier than if we wait the extra week or two and get consensus from the UK, EU, US, etc. The chances of large holes showing up in the processes of all of those agencies that align to miss something is much less.<p>We’re talking about things we’re going to be injecting into literally hundreds of millions of people very quickly. The risks of a fuckup here are pretty severe and it’s quite likely a severe mistake would cause more harm than delaying another week or two.')
