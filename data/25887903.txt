Item(by='eloff', descendants=None, kids=[25891700], score=None, time=1611451283, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25887445, text='Most people just ramp up their lifestyle when they make more money.<p>I&#x27;ve been petty conservative about doing that and living below my means since the start of my career. In the beginning I was saving 80% of my income. That dropped over time as I got married and had to accept ramping up my expenses, but I&#x27;ve saved enough over the years to be about halfway to financial independence by my mid thirties. I strongly recommend intensely saving as the only fiscally responsible way to live. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s affected my happiness negatively at all. I couldn&#x27;t buy everything I wanted, but having that safety net was well worth it in exchange.')
