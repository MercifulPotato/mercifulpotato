My home server is running Ryzen 5 Pro 4650G (yay for integrated graphics) and Asrock B550M.<p>I went through the effort of using qvl memory, but actually testing ECC is a bit more difficult. While ECC is supported &amp; active, memory errors are sadly not reported to the OS. I remember seeing a forum post somewhere of somebody overclocking&#x2F;undervolting the ram to force errors, but I can&#x27;t seem to find it right now. There&#x27;s a fine line between stable, stable with recovered errors, and unstable.')
