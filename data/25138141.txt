Buy her some drawing and art apps. Lean into the TikTok thing and find her a local dance or drama troupe. This is what we did with my younger sister, who is the same age. Instead of painting on a canvas, she paints digitally. Instead of bemoaning her TikToks, we&#x27;ve taken her to singing and dancing competitions, which she&#x27;s won.<p>Or, perhaps, accept that during a pandemic, when your child&#x27;s entire social sphere has collapsed, the internet, Roblox, Minecraft, TikTok, et. al. are the closest they can get to interacting with and making friends.<p>&gt;When friends visit, she occasionally asks them to watch her latest TikTok videos. Some are even funny and creative. Or so I tell myself. It helps with the guilt.<p>I can&#x27;t be the only person who finds this comment to be really sad.<p>This isn&#x27;t the iPhone&#x27;s fault. This is someone failing to support their child&#x27;s hobbies because they&#x27;re not the perfect idyllic vision they had. End of story.')
