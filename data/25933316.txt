Sure, he could donate more, but % wise that&#x27;s probably more than many people reading this have donated in 2020. And I don&#x27;t want to start a debate over it, but I do believe that the primary intention behind Blue Origin is to benefit humanity.<p>The main issue with Bezos is worker conditions at Amazon, I think.')
