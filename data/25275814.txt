Someone must have the flat on their balance sheet. Someone must have a cleaner lady on a payroll. Is Airbnb value chain more effective that hotel value chain? Maybe. Maybe not. But for AirBnb host having a tax advantage of not being charged as a tourism business while in fact being one was clearly an advantage.<p>Similar laws have been passed all over the world, including the US where it goes by a city or a state, Las Vegas being notable.')
