I can&#x27;t imagine it&#x27;s more than a dozen assembly instructions, even on a crappy architecture. Worst case (divide by 2), it takes 32767 iterations, and you even get the remainder out of it.<p>With this example, say 100C. Convert to deciC and offset, say, 25 degrees to make it unsigned. 1250. Multiply by 9. 11250. Divide by 5 takes 2250 iterations. I am unfamiliar with the MCS-48, but Google says it can be clocked at 11Mhz. It would take maybe 40ms to do the divide?')
