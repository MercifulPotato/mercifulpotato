We need to align incentives properly if we&#x27;re going to have any hope of building trust again.  ex:<p>1. The internet, as a technology, is amazing but functions as a possible bullhorn for everyone, without filter. It does not reward the best possible or most positive idea, only the one that grabs the most attention.<p>2. Shock and outrage drive the clicks&#x2F;views&#x2F;attention and everyone gets paid on these metrics.<p>3. Social media companies thrive on and optimize for attention metrics.  The longer you use them, at the expense of things like participating in your community and building relationships, the more &quot;successful&quot; they are and the more $$$ they get<p>4. Society has moved towards more specialized play and communities.  We participate in fewer and fewer activities where we just randomly encounter strangers.<p>5. Our current election system rewards divisiveness because it drives turnout.  The candidate that can do the best job doesn&#x27;t win-the candidate that can get the most votes does.<p>Possibly unpopular view: Encouraging religious participation would go a <i>long way</i> to help.  Whether you believe or do not, religion helps align society away from purely individualistic pursuits and more towards a &quot;corporate good&quot;.')
