Item(by='Dgetman', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611510564, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25893986, text='Wozi is a plant-based flavor enhancer that not only sweetens foods, but also allows you to satisfy your cravings with healthy foods in just 30 seconds. It doesn&#x27;t have any bitter&#x2F;&quot;chemical&quot; aftertaste like other alternative sweeteners and also a single serving will last you 30-60 minutes regardless of how much food you eat with it.<p>Here is a 30 second demo I presented at Pioneer’s demo-day. Check out Avichal Garg’s reaction (investor in Cruise, Boom Supersonic, Optimizley, and many more): <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;XC5fSUtbf_0" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;XC5fSUtbf_0</a><p>It is made from Synsepalum dulcificum, more commonly known as the miracle berry. This fruit has been used for centuries by tribes in Western Africa to make their food more delicious. The miracle berry contains a protein that safely and temporarily binds to your tastebuds to make sour foods taste sweet as well as remove unpleasant bitter and tart flavors. For instance, bite into a lemon and it will taste like lemonade. It allows you to discover flavors previously masked by those unpleasant tastes. A strawberry tastes even more &quot;strawberry&quot; and a plain greek yogurt now tastes much more creamy like a cheesecake.<p>Wozi is the first miracle berry product that is convenient for daily use. Whereas competing products take 5-10 minutes to dissolve, mine takes 30 seconds to dissolve and contains only NATURAL ingredients. It also has pop rocks to not only make the experience more fun, but also give you a cue for when you’re ready to start eating.<p>I believe miracle fruit has the potential to take willpower out of the equation of a healthy diet by making nutritious foods taste as indulgent as the junk foods that we crave. No one has the patience to wait 5 minutes in the morning while they are rushing to school or work, so I knew this is what needed to be changed in order for miracle berry to go mainstream.<p>Please check out my website for more information and demos. Your feedback would be greatly appreciated. Feel free to ask me anything!')
