So for me: GMail, GDrive, GCP, etc. are too risky; even though I use Firefox because of its customizability I could use Chrome(based) browser; GMaps and Youtube are fine; I use neither Google&#x27;s nor Cloudflare&#x27;s DNS, they have too much of my data as it is anyway and frankly speed difference between DNS providers is negligible; only time I don&#x27;t act completely rationally is good ol&#x27; search - because I&#x27;m worried about google&#x27;s monopoly I try to use&#x2F;support an alternative.')
