Item(by='kamyarg', descendants=None, kids=[25614468], score=None, time=1609608413, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25614142, text='I know someone that immigrated to EU from middle east, after ~1 year developed a severe life threatening stomach&#x2F;liver illness(can not recall the details), went through multiple operations, after 1.5-2 years away from work but getting most of his salary due to welfare got better and got back to work. He is very young and I suspect you could have anything close to this in US. Let alone immigrants, even citizens can not afford to do this.<p>I have never lived in the US and this all from online media, reading and talking to various ex&#x2F;current US citizens&#x2F;residents colleagues, so I might be wrong still.')
