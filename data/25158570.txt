Their $$$ reward is based on installation numbers across Tidelift&#x27;s subscriber base, not value added or cost saved.<p>Definitely not a model that would help most (read: more niche) open source developers.<p>For example, I maintain a Python library with 10k+ Github stars and millions of monthly downloads, and was told by Tidelift it&#x27;s not even on their radar. Zero reward in Tidelift&#x27;s reward system.<p>Which is not to say they&#x27;re not helpful to others, they might be. Just to manage your expectations vs their marketing.')
