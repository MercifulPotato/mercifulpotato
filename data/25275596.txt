Andso the way they fold 1 at a time is different from simulating how the whole thing end-to-end will fold.<p>another thing to be aware of is the environment in which it folds, the local pH can affect which -OH groups exist as OH or as O(minus), which affects the way it folds. Then there is local salt concentrations, various proteins incorperate calcium, magnesium or other metals into the structure.<p>There are Post-translational modifications that are made, where other enzymes come in and snip bits off, add sugars to proteins, catalyse S-S bonds etc.<p>Finally, we want to know how they are folded because we want to be able to modify their behavior. If you know that an enzyme is key in a disease you might want to design a drug molecule that can fit into its active site, for that we need to know how the protein is folded.')
