I&#x27;m talking about angular resolution.<p>Here, the airy disk diameter is the image size. At the same magnification, the image height is proportional to the object size.<p>Since when the f number is smaller, at the same magnification, substituting in the thin lens formula with the magnification, you find that the object size is inversely proportional to the focal length.<p>From this you come to the conclusion that, at the same focus distance, the smallest object you can image is a function of the absolute diameter of the aperture.<p>Intuitively, this is because even though the airy disk has the same size, the focal length is much smaller, therefore the field of view is much wider for the same sensor size, therefore the angular confusion is much bigger, therefore for the same FoV at the same f number detail goes down.<p>Or put another way, yes the light spreads more, but the sensor on a camera is bigger, so in the end you have much more detail anyways.<p>This is why, for example, spy satellites despite operating at f&#x2F;11 or so can resolve much more detail than a cellphone :)<p>This is a standard exam question if you ever take a Wave Optics class, by the way. But as you say, enthusiast discussion, such as on DPReview, is often based on basic misconceptions about optics :)')
