What I don&#x27;t miss from Ubuntu are the PPA&#x27;s, AUR is much much much nicer. If you plan to do any gaming in Linux, Arch is in the end much more convenient due to AUR.<p>And, I&#x27;m biased a bit because my installation is always quite minimal. I only have i3 and my tools for programming, and whatever is needed to run proton games.')
