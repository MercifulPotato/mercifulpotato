It’d be a rare job in video game production that didn’t involve crunch time, and if you want to work in those roles you can, so long as you accept&#x2F;embrace that. If you’re the sort of person for whom 2-3 months a year of crunch time is going to destroy your relationships&#x2F;family&#x2F;mental health, you should probably choose a different industry. There are lots of 9-5 ish coding jobs that involve zero or minimal outside-office-hours work. Don’t fool yourself I to pretending your “dream job” is one of those if there are obvious (or even subtle) red flags that it’s not.')
