A very dubious proposition.<p>Given your example, thinking about who is beautiful and who isn&#x27;t (not &quot;Scientific Study&quot;, just thinking) would be pointless is well, and in reality, in practical objective reality of a lot of people, isn&#x27;t.<p>&gt; quickly leading to reductions to the absurd such as here.<p>That is the whole point of the original thought experiment, it shows exactly that.<p>But it leads there by showing not that the question itself is wrong. But by showing that if you try to apply scientific thinking to everything, you end up with absurdity. That there are many areas of life where intuition is a much more suited, practical, and result-rich method of thinking.')
