I thoroughly enjoy using JIRA and Confluence. The two go hand in hand very well.<p>As many others have mentioned thought, it is abysmally slow. At least their Cloud offering is, which is the core product we use at my job. I&#x27;ve used older on-prem deployments though and they were lightning fast.

Hopefully the Product teams read through those surveys or peruse HN. Everything else about JIRA works great for our Software Development needs.')
