They always had the annoying disclaimer. Very hard to ignore and miss.<p>Why not just be transparent in there actions. Add an icon to thing they deem offensive to there ethics. Dump it from the Main page algorithm feed. And make the icon clickable to a page where it shows why you added they censored or tagged the content. People need to see this stuff go down in real-time and why it happens. But leave free speech intact.<p>Or make everyone pay for it then they can do whatever they want. Disappear anything Lol')
