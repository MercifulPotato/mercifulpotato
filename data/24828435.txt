It felt like inflamation. It stayed for about 10 years and devastated my life every single day. I considered that chronic. I never gave up. Fast forward to present: I&#x27;m 45 and still have very faint feeling of inflamation on a bad day. How I dealt with the problem: changed my lifestyle, diet, sleeping habits.
