But Fortran will never be Python, and Python will never be Fortran, no matter how much maturity&#x2F;improvements. Because maturity means getting close to it&#x27;s potential (local maxima), without the ability to drastically move to a hypothetical global maxima (without breaking all it&#x27;s legacy, like a more drastic Python 2 -&gt; 3, or adding things indefinitely until you get effectively many languages&#x2F;dialects in one like C++).<p>New languages on the other side don&#x27;t have as much baggage (and can start with increased knowledge from previous attempts) so they are able to freely potentially target better local maxima that old languages cannot anymore. Plus in this particular case, Python was not really designed to target the scientific domain (nor ML which did not even exist in the way we use nowadays), it was repeatedly retrofitted with possibly a lot more effort than would be necessary to create something better from scratch.')
