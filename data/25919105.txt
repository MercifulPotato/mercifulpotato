Sadly, I learned the hard way (by trialling their software and immediately discovering a handful of dumb bugs that should’ve been caught by QA, plus serious security problems[0], and some OSS licence violations[1]) that it seems to not actually be the case. This situation where they continue to pump out blog posts about hard drive stats, yet don’t even <i>have</i> a status page for reporting outages, is another example of their marketing-driven approach to development.<p>I have mentioned this on HN a couple times now[2][3], including again just yesterday. I really dislike doing this because I feel like I am piling on—but as much as I hate it, I feel even more strongly that people deserve to be informed about these serious ongoing failures at Backblaze so that they can make more informed choices about what storage&#x2F;backup provider to use. I also genuinely hope that I can incentivise them to actually start following software development best practices, since they do provide a valuable service and I’d like them to succeed. If they keep doing what they’re doing now, I absolutely expect to see a massive data breach and&#x2F;or data loss event at some point, since they are clearly unwilling or unable to properly handle security or user privacy today—and I’ve gotten the impression over time that some prominent people at the company think these criticisms are invalid and they need not make any substantive changes to their processes.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;zetafleet&#x2F;status&#x2F;1304664097989054464" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;zetafleet&#x2F;status&#x2F;1304664097989054464</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;bagder&#x2F;status&#x2F;1215311286814281728" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;bagder&#x2F;status&#x2F;1215311286814281728</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25899802" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25899802</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24839757" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24839757</a>')
