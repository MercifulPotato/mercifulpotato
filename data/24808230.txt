If <i>knowing</i> with certainty is a matter of definition, then doubt about it is expressly excluded. You can go down the slippery slope and deny objectivity all together to arrive at the quote popularly attributed to Sokrates, and develop platonic ideals to finally hold it with Descartes idealizing yourself, <i>cogito ergo sum</i>.<p>Yet, we fundamentally can&#x27;t know what others think and feel. If we can only take a best guess, and converse to peek and poke for improving the estimate, then that&#x27;s what philosophy really means in the all daily sense, our &quot;company philosophy&quot; and such like. It generalizes well either way, whether anthropomorphizing the environment, or objectifying people, if we always can only project from the self onto others. And <i>esteem</i> is actually a good analogue to <i>philos</i>!<p>Still, a notable duality remains in my philosophy above. The point I&#x27;m trying to make is, I guess, that I will have to keep that formyself and leave yours to you, because ambivalence is a feature, and a bug.')
