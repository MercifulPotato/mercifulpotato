If I went to a language without static type checking today, I wouldn’t trust myself to provide the right function arguments in the right order all the time, or to send the right message types, especially after refactoring. It would be a nightmare for me to have to write unit tests for this. Maybe that would improve over time, or maybe I’m just a crap programmer.')
