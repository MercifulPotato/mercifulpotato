I don&#x27;t try to remove the dry peel, instead I just remove the whole outmost layer, comes off with a shallow cut then removing it. Yeah it&#x27;s a bit of a waste, but often that first layer isn&#x27;t in a great shape and you&#x27;d toss it anyway.<p>* Cut in half, place the halfs flat side down. Much easier to do the rest when it doesn&#x27;t try to roll away from under you.<p>* Cut to slices without breaking the pack (i.e. keep it half-onion shaped). This is probably easier to do with a small knife than a large one.<p>* Cut the sliced packs orthogonally to previous cuts. Done, except if you want a tiny mush (in that case, use a bigger rounded edge knife, cut with a rolling movement so that the tip end of the blade keeps in contact with the board; same technique also works great for garlic).<p>As others have pointed out, you&#x27;ll want a sharp knife (a knife sharpener is a good investment). Cut with sideways motion with a hint of downward pressure, instead of just trying to press down through the onion.<p>Edit: Forgot the first step.')
