The measles vaccine is very efficient (over 95% after two doses), but still requires something like a 90% vaccination grade to prevent outbreaks. Measles is very very very contagious.<p>Covid is not nearly as contagious, so to prevent outbreaks it doesn&#x27;t have to be nearly as good at the same vaccination grade.<p>For an individual, however, 70% would not feel very reassuring, which is why we need a lot of people getting vaccinated.<p>Edit: fixed some autocorrect issues. I feel I should add: measles is not at fun, even if you don&#x27;t have any complications. You become very sick. Serious complications are _a lot_ more common than adverse reactions to the vaccine. Don&#x27;t rely on other people being vaccinated unless you have a compromised immune system in any way.')
