Monty picks another door at random - he has clearly committed to doing so, flips a coin in front of you or whatever.  God only knows what would have happened if he&#x27;d revealed a car, but this time he didn&#x27;t.  Having found yourself in <i>that</i> situation, what are your odds if you switch doors?<p>If you simulate this procedure, you&#x27;ll find that the number of outcomes where &quot;switch&quot; wins is about 1&#x2F;3 of the total games; &quot;stick&quot; wins in about 1&#x2F;3 of the total games; and 1&#x2F;3 of the total games Monty revealed the car.  When Monty <i>does</i> pick the goat <i>reliably</i>, as in the Monty Hall Problem as it was intended to be understood, Monty is doing the work to convert those &quot;revealed&quot; games into wins for &quot;switch&quot;.<p>If you disagree, I&#x27;ll happily take your money.')
