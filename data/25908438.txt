And unless you are the moderator&#x2F;host, there&#x27;s nothing to do. I was having problems with some other instances, but as a user there was nothing I could do. I thought Mastodon would do a better job on allowing me to block or limit my viewers based on their instance, but no luck.<p>So I went back to Twitter. If I can&#x27;t do anything about instances I don&#x27;t like, better use Twitter and get rid of that extra layer of complexity.')
