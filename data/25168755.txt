I converted both of my main computers to 3x displays (using computer monitors) and put up 3 of these super cheap 4k TVs with chromecast ultras on them.<p>I love having a few displays playing ambient information or live 24&#x2F;7 video streams (eg of the Starships they’re building down in Boca Chica) in my lab.<p>Having a dedicated (large) room in your house to work is critical, IMO. I set mine up pre-pandemic because I always work from the places I am living, unless I’m directly (and temporarily) onsite with a client.')
