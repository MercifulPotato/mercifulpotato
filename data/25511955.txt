No, we don&#x27;t know the other side. But the OP is here and asking for advice, so rather than sliding into some kind of false balance you could simply assume that they are telling the truth and basing your advice on that. The obligation to inform is on them, and speculation on your part what the other side may or may not be is pointless.<p>&gt; But knowing what we know, what&#x27;s the best case scenario for the OP? Even if he&#x27;s 100% right and the cofounder is the worst human being on the planet, what&#x27;s ultimately the best outcome they&#x27;ll get out of a startup with $0 revenue, maybe a potential $60k ARR with ads (but maybe not), and has $40k in the bank?But knowing what we know, what&#x27;s the best case scenario for the OP?

If you can&#x27;t see such a path then maybe just stay out of it rather than trying to talk the OP into something that they may regret gravely?')
