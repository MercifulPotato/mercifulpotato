This is actually pretty fast compared to other projects. I&#x27;m proud of the fact that the oldest open PR in zig is from October 2, 2020 - only 2 months and 11 days old.<p>From the perspective of someone submitting a pull request, it&#x27;s frustrating to not get a response within a day or two. I completely get that. But it&#x27;s just not possible when you have a team of 1-3 people who are able to engage with PRs, and hundreds of people submitting PRs.<p>Since this project has started, the Earth has completed 1732 rotations, and yet 2877 pull requests have been closed. That&#x27;s 1.7 per day, including weekends and holidays. Consider that for the first couple of years of this project, I was moonlighting it with a day job.<p>I&#x27;m not trying to throw shade at you, just saying, man, cut me some slack. I&#x27;ll get to your PR.')
