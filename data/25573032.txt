Your drink choice was milk or chocolate milk. Both had artificial sweeteners. Apparently, we had no lactose intolerant kids in the whole school.<p>2. We were fed lots of bread and potatoes. Even the main dish was often pizza or similar, which contains bread.<p>3. Green vegetables were exceedingly rare.<p>4. A kid in Kindergarten and a 6th grader got the same lunch.<p>In retrospect my lunch diet was atrocious due to this as a kid. You don&#x27;t need to feed kids sweetened crap all the time. It&#x27;s especially hard to justify given that all the public schools had complete kitchens that were used every day.<p>Basically, public school was just state sponsored day care where I grew up. Not only that, it was awful quality day care.')
