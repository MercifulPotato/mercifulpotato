Been frustrated with bureaucracy related to covid (specifically the vaccine) and the lives it&#x27;s costing. And that frustration was redirected to other people following silly rules with far less at stake.<p>I still think a lot of research  in software engineering is useless because researchers spend too much time focusing on different methods and not enough going out into the world to collect better data.  And  researchers should be mildly ashamed for doing crappy research.<p>But also my tone should have been more constructive.')
