I mean, when I look at code, I&#x27;m not appreciating it as visual art, I&#x27;m <i>reading</i> it. Usually the point at which that stops happening is the point at which my brain is tired enough that it&#x27;s time to go do something else for a little while and recover.<p>So, as long as the font I&#x27;m using doesn&#x27;t actively impair legibility, which is a pretty low baseline, it doesn&#x27;t really matter - and in any case, if it&#x27;s a visual aesthetic I want, I&#x27;ll go do it in Illustrator where I can actually have precise control over every aspect of that aesthetic, instead of forcing my programming environment to double as an installation art piece.<p>(DejaVu Sans Mono, in case anyone cares, or Menlo on Apple hardware since it doesn&#x27;t want installing. Haven&#x27;t changed it in what must be close to a couple decades by now; somebody sneakernetted me a copy of Vera Sans Mono in my earliest days of moving up from the helpdesk and I never looked back. Doesn&#x27;t changing fonts impose a cognitive overhead of its own for a while?)<p>...all of which is to say I favor brutalism, I guess.')
