Is this a slight upcharge? Or an order of magnitude?<p>I&#x27;m what the Brits might call a &quot;keen motorist&quot;, but as someone who considers speed enforcement a necessary evil, there&#x27;s a world of difference between paying a bit more for much better tech, versus way more.  If this costs 4x what a normal radar gun costs, one must ask &quot;what is the problem we&#x27;re solving&quot;, and is it worth the money? Are there renegades out there going double the speed limit, then magically slowing to below the limit 1&#x2F;2mi from a radar gun, somehow?<p>I&#x27;m certainly happier with the idea of an officer-operated speed camera than one parked by the side of the road with no discretion whatsoever.<p>Of course, there are plenty of people who rightfully point out that discretion can mean discrimination.')
