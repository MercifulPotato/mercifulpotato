I do this too and find it quite addictive. It’s a sort of groggy high, certainly an easy form of escape. It’s a place between dreaming and thinking.<p>I have many things I do just to get me out of bed to stop the cycle. I have a Philips sunlight alarm clock placed on  the other side of the room, which combined with painfully chugging a pint of water is how I get up. I then have my breakfast arranged so I just have to press a button and my porridge will cook. Now if I don’t get up for that there will be a burnt pan which is more incentive not to lay in dreams.')
