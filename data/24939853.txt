By my experience by then the body is used to ist and you can easily push it to 40 hours, didn&#x27;t really try 48 hours, but I guess with some preparation also not that big deal.<p>It&#x27;s pity can&#x27;t really do it anymore, since I cook for whole family and need my brain working at full capacity, which is not big deal during first day of fasting, but on the 2nd one it would take its toll already, maybe doable during weekend.')
