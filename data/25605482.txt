(A fun experiment you can do in dry cold weather is hold up a warm finger to a window and watch condensation immediately appear even at a distance.)<p>The design is especially prone to this failure mode in the dead of winter when you have the highest temperature gradients.<p>Because these arenâ€™t waterproof, I doubt they did much testing outside where you would experience such large deltas in temperature.')
