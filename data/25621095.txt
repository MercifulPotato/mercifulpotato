Always with proper spacing between experiences (usually a year).<p>Doses between 60 and 100 mg of crystal that I have tested with Marquis reagent to be MDMA, as accurate as that test can be (there&#x27;s no substance testing available for public in my country).<p>I had read beforehand that the comeup can feel uncomfortable especially right before the full effect hits. During my first experience I was kind of surprised how restless and annoyed I became at everything and I attributed it to not being able to be alone (I&#x27;m an introvert). On subsequent experiences alone I have come to realize that it&#x27;s just part of the comeup for me and now I know to just ride it out. I read somewhere that MDMA triggers the release of norepinephrine which would make sense. One of my friends also commented that during comeup he too gets quite annoyed, to the point of ready to fight someone.<p>Basing on my experiences, the long comeup and the additional agitation is why I find it surprising to recommend MDMA for psychedelic crises. A benzodiazepine like Xanax has a quick onset of action and calms people down which makes more sense to me for these kinds of situations.')
