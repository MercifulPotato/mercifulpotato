Courts and regulators significantly weakened enforcement in the 80s, but the laws haven&#x27;t changed.</i><p>Price discrimination (known as price segmentation in the business world) is perfectly legal, as long as it is between products and not between customers (and even there it might still be as long as the discrimination isn&#x27;t based on a protected class). Price segmentation of products has <i>always</i> been legal in the US.<p>Store brands have been a thing for centuries. Most stores used to just sell the house brand.<p>Indeed, the concept of selling a &quot;third party&quot; brand in a store is a relatively recent development that can largely be traced to farm supply stores and the rise of department stores...which, notably sold their own store brands alongside those of other companies for decades without antitrust issues. (In fact, Sears&#x27; antitrust issues related to their use of market power to obtain discounts or to fix prices in certain geographic markets. They never had issues with selling store brands).')
