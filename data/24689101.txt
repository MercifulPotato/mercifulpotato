What the article is talking about is not Data-Oriented Design, the practice of organizing your data for efficient processing. It&#x27;s proposing a separate (but not incompatible) concept of organizing your code for easier maintainability. For example, the sample code (which appears to be JavaScript) is not doing ECS at all. It&#x27;s almost exclusively doing the data modeling by creating one heterogeneous map per entity.')
