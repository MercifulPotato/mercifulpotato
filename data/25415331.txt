In theory it is possible, but in practice it has proven to be so hard, that I am not sure if there ever was or will be a secure computer that is connected to the internet.<p>Another problem is that the complexity in modern systems is increasing and designing secure systems on top of complexity is next to impossible. I think Unikernels have a good chance of delivering secure systems from a software perspective, but it seems even modern hardware has enough vulnerabilities to thwart those plans.')
