You&#x27;re only advocating further normalisation of fascism, and depriving them of the consequences of their actionsâ€”consequences that have always been a part of civil society.  What&#x27;s more, that you seem to be more preoccupied with not upsetting these fascists rather than that just a few days ago these very same fascists either attempted a coup or supported a coup does indeed speak of your self-professed naivety (at best).  These fascists are a cancer on the body politic and the solution is not to listen to many of the posters here who think that somehow magically the best course of action is simply to do nothing at all, lest we upset the poor lickle fascists.')
