The player has to assemble, restore and upgrade his father&#x27;s dilapidated Satsuma AMP (modeled after the Datsun 100A) using the car parts scattered inside the garage, as well as by purchasing new parts.<p>&gt; To earn money for parts, the player can perform various countryside chores for neighbours such as delivering firewood on a tractor-pulled trailer, using a vacuum truck to empty their septic tanks, making kilju (Finnish homebrew sugar wine) and selling it to an alcoholic neighbor, and picking up the aforementioned neighbor from the town pub in the early morning in exchange for a small sum of money.<p>&gt;After passing the Satsuma at the vehicle inspection office and installing the appropriate aftermarket parts (which can be obtained by mailing an order form to a parts dealer), the player&#x27;s car is eligible to enter a weekly amateur rallying event for a chance to win a trophy and prize money.<p>..<p>Writing for Rock, Paper, Shotgun, Brendan Caldwell called the game &quot;Funny, detailed and thoroughly confusing&quot;; while writing for Kotaku, Nathan Grayson called the game &quot;Janky and weird as fuck, but fun&quot;.<p>:-)<p>Having grown up in the Swedish countryside - all of this seems <i>very</i> authentic.')
