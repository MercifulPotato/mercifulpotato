Well, it&#x27;s a bit more to get a good yield, but not that much more, you can (and some places do) teach that to literal kindergartners in a single day. We can&#x27;t sustain 7 billion of people this way, but if some catastrophe kills 99% of humanity, the  availability of better cultivars makes subsistence farming for the remainder much easier than five hundred years ago.')
