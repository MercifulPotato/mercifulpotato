Light paint photography allows you to be really creative as you are basically using the light to paint the picture.<p>Furthermore I also do blogging but got burned out now I’m trying to get back into blogging<p>I also tinker with my laptop such as trying out different linux distros or building out tools or even learning about linux internals and commandline tools<p>For physical activities I usually go out for a run but it’s too cold where I live now and I’m also exploring about golf<p>Anyways I would love to see your photography work if you have published online')
