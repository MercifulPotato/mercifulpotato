You can group multiple such changes in a variant.<p>When the visitor loads the page a random variant is loaded and executes all the changes for that variant and tags the user with the variant that he saw. You can then filter in the interface all users who saw a specific variant and compare different stats (eg. bounce rates, heatmaps, etc.).<p>I will make a walk-through of the dashboard to showcase the features and that will act as a short tutorial.')
