I dont use plastic containers for food. Only wood, metal and glass are in my kitchen when it contacts food. I dont even like plastic for anything else. If I can opt for something that&#x27;s not made of plastic, I&#x27;d rather pay a premium than have it all if I can (obviously what I&#x27;m holding to type this flies in my belief&#x27;s face, but right now the anti-plastic war I wage is a hill I will die on and it&#x27;ll be a brutal death). Yet, after reading the article, I have doubts on what he&#x27;s claiming.<p>Journalism used to be emotional only at very key, important points. The deadpan nature allowed for disciplined emotional tones to have extreme, nearly atomic impact on a subject. That used to move people. Now, everything is a life or death struggle. For fucks sake, figuring out what bathroom to use was and still is a &quot;heated debate&quot;. 99% of people have zero issues figuring this out. Less than 1% are arguing yet everyone has to feel like THIS is what will collapse society if we dont fix it. The constant barrage of outlandish &quot;passionate&quot; claims to &quot;save the world&quot; along with the deep dark shady underworld of business, after a while, &quot;yup, whatever&quot;. While I will always err on the side of &quot;fuck plastic&quot;, I will also admit that I&#x27;m a casualty of the current &quot;journalism&quot; climate of ever increasing sense of doom around every corner. I dont believe the author even though I philosophically should knee jerk to being a cheerleader all because of the tone of the article. And given some other comments, I&#x27;m not alone.<p>And yes, my word choice is relevant to the theme I&#x27;m discussing.')
