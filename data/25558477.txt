There is nothing else to it.<p>Previously, westerners thought animals were just automatons, without a &quot;soul&quot; or feelings, so it was OK to kill them. There were public shows where exotic animals would be collected and killed in front of the masses only a couple of hundred years ago. In fact, Edison killed an elephant publicly to show how dangerous AC was. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Electrocuting_an_Elephant" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Electrocuting_an_Elephant</a><p>At some point, people saw enough of that and decided to tie everything to &quot;we&#x27;re guilty&quot;, another one of Christian memes, which now encompasses all of environmental destruction, anthropogenic climate change and everything else that is an example of &quot;original sin&quot;.<p>&quot;They&#x27;re majestic creatures&quot; is a retarded meme, spread by TV shows. I grew up around wild elephants. They destroy crops, destroy houses and even attack people, specially males in their mating season when they are particularly aggressive. Westerners fund &quot;environmental conservation&quot; everywhere else except where they live. As long as it&#x27;s the poor helpless people suffering the consequences, it&#x27;s OK. The environmental conservationists who visit these poor countries are accompanied by armed rangers, but if villagers shoot the animals, they&#x27;re &quot;poachers&quot;.')
