This is true for all vaccines, and reminds me of the tragedy of the commons.<p>I&#x27;m actually curious, though, why the OC wants to discuss this.  There is truth to his comment, but if you aren&#x27;t willing to be a team player, there&#x27;s no good in recruiting others to your way of thinking.')
