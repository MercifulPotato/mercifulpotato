It&#x27;s not as many as you probably think. Email the moderators (link is in the footer). Other users can also click &#x27;vouch&#x27; on comments, I&#x27;ve done that a couple of times. If comments are short or non-substantial others tend to ignore them. And I don&#x27;t know how many readers have showdead=yes switched on.')
