Newspapers are turning into websites. TVs to on-demand streaming. Radios to podcasts. But for magazines, it has been a little stagnant. The magazines were “digital” but only the electronic versions of the print files with a few hyperlinks. It just wasn’t enough.<p>In general, magazines are easy to read, fairly brief in length, and include illustrations or photographs. They’re fun and engaging. Then digital magazines must be equally stimulating while being far more inclusive as well as interactive. Articles should be alive, personalized, and real-time. Brands should get the chance to interact, one-on-one, with their consumers present in any part of the world. Interactive videos, such as ads which tell emotive stories should hit the right chord with the right audience at the right time. Publishers should be able to better understand the readers by actually connecting with them. Moreover, digital magazines should be affordable and accessible to wherever content is consumed digitally.<p>That was, is, and will continue to be the driving force behind WorldPlus.
