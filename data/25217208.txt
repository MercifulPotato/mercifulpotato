As an Asian American it is baffling how throughout years of propaganda, so many Americans firmly believe that personal freedom and democracy cannot co-exist with a competent and effective government that has all the tools and resources to do its job.<p>Propaganda? What?<p>&gt; I think it comes from shallow interpretation of sayings such as &quot;power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely&quot;. I mean it&#x27;s a catchy saying, but in reality it&#x27;s just a result of terrible system engineering (in this case the government system) in many places.<p>I&#x27;m pretty sure it comes from the enlightenment era and especially the American Revolutionary War. American colonists were never been big fans of the powerful churches and monarchs of Europe they were trying to escape.<p>&gt; If your big government devolves into individual dictatorship it just mean the single executive position likely had too much power to begin with.<p>Would you believe me if I told you this very thing was happening across the world in the 1930s and 1940s? And pretty close to home too? Maybe all it takes is enough people to forget history.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Roosevelt_dictatorship" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Roosevelt_dictatorship</a>')
