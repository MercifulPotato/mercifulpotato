I was doing a lot of work with mesos at the time, and we chatted a bit about this as our work overlapped a fair bit.<p>Are you still using a similar sort of setup to orchestrate the backend of this, and if so have you published anything about it? I&#x27;ve had a few people ask me about this sort of problem lately and there aren&#x27;t too many great resources out there I can point people new to this sort of tech towards.')
