The normal path for successful founders was for them to come to the house, experiment, meet co-founders, move out, ... funding. Any equity agreement made at the outset (SAFE) would be worthless. New project. New people. Or maybe they could be enforced, but not easily, not like Erlich. Those were the successes. Most would just get discouraged and start full time job hunting. So I couldn’t find a way to make it sustainable even when home runs graduated out of it.')
