And it does that for a dozen or so different languages, not just C.<p>It can abstract across different function signatures in the libraries you&#x27;re using. For example if you&#x27;re calling a libc function where the arguments have changed, you can detect which version of the function you have and make your code work with either one.<p>It can do the same for structs and types as well.<p>It can test for system services, such as X Windows or the ability to run Perl scripts.<p>It can abstract over the differences between different implementations of common utility commands such as awk, grep, install, mkdir, and so on.<p>It does a lot of stuff!')
