A government that had the capacity to develop treatments but choose not to would have been in dereliction of their duty; if there&#x27;s ever been a clear, classic case for communal response, this is it.  Claiming as success a response that only partially obstructed dealing with the virus is obscene; and even the parts that appear to be well-executed were clearly not due to exceptional executive action; many parts of government were involved, not least of which the bureaucrats (aka the deep state, those horrible people that actually keep things running).<p>Exceptional leadership would have been taking action December 2019 or early January - and as many south-east Asian countries show: even clear guidance and simple public health measure matter hugely; but people need to <i>understand</i> and <i>support</i> the measures, because it all hinges on real people changing their behavior; and creating controversy and abusing possible future treatments as distractions from actions that needed to be taken many months ago - and still do - undermines that.<p>And to cap it all off, the president is not working towards delivering those treatments and vaccines, because he&#x27;s actively undermining the normal transition of power.  <i>Even if</i> the election outcome <i>were</i> uncertain, gambling with people&#x27;s lives like that shows a careless disregard for actually serving country - because an ethical person would at least work to protect others when it&#x27;s not only their job, but easy, and conventional to do so.')
