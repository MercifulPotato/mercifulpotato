It uses a tiny  LED and light sensor on the print head to see the printed ink on the page during the alignment process.   If that sees no ink, it marks the cartridge as empty and orders another.<p>The same will happen if you pull the half-printed paper out of the printer midway through the alignment process, which is how I discovered it.')
