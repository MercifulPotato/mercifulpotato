Cop literally landed on him and start beating him with the nightstick.  I hollered &quot;you caught him, stop already&quot; and I still remember the savage look in the cop&#x27;s eyes when he looked up.  Thankfully some other cops showed up and carted the guy off.  &quot;In the heat of the moment&quot; should not be a justification for LEO personnel.')
