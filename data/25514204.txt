You cannot just work with &quot;decentralized&quot; systems and call it a day. Every action you do is answerable, everything is questioned and scrutinized.<p>Having someone like Ripple and XCurrent as an intermediate as a regulated company helps solve a lot of problems. Since Ripple itself is regulated it&#x27;s easy to justify to regulators. Ripple is also answerable when transactions delay happens.<p>For Etherereum &#x2F; Smartcontracts who do you contact for support when transactions SLAs aren&#x27;t being met?')
