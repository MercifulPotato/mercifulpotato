The question of how to create a materialy closed but energetically open system where humans can thrive is such an interesting one. And it is already a really hard problem. But the biospherians went one further. They didnt just wanted to build a working biosphere, they also wanted to make it mimic the earth. Like I understand if for some chemical or even psychological reason you need a giant pool to make your humans comfortable, but why spend resources and attention to create a salt mars of varying salt gradient? It just adds more moving parts to an already complicated puzzle. It is as if you donâ€™t only want to build the worlds first aeroplane but you want it shaped like a jellyfish with tinny bells. They had a hard problem and made it even harder for themselves.')
