They were used a lot in British schools, and hung around into the early 1990s -- schools had invested in software for them, but didn&#x27;t have the budget to replace them.<p>My dad had an IBM 286 clone, which is the oldest computer I can remember using (Captain Comic!).  That had both 5¼&quot; and 90mm¹ floppy drives, but we almost always used the latter.<p>All these machines were very expensive at the time, and not very common for home use.  Are there any popular old computers (Commodore, Amiga, Mac etc) that used a 5¼&quot; drive?  My impression is everything was on cassette, until 90mm drives became cheap enough for home use.  (Even the BBC machines sold for home use usually used cassettes; the disk drive was a separate, expensive purchase -- double the cost of the computer itself!²)<p>¹ Yes, I&#x27;m that much of a metric purist.<p>² <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;chrisacorns.computinghistory.org.uk&#x2F;Computers&#x2F;BBCBI3.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;chrisacorns.computinghistory.org.uk&#x2F;Computers&#x2F;BBCBI3....</a>')
