Item(by='filleduchaos', descendants=None, kids=[25751406], score=None, time=1610474222, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25746341, text='&gt; Apple is making the use of many security functions black or white: either you allow complete control by Apple, or you have little to no protection at all.<p>Wow, thank you for providing a perfect example of what I mean.<p>I specifically brought up upgrading bash because that was the use case that prompted me to actually learn about SIP. It took me all of fifteen minutes to read a few docs on it, restart and disable it, upgrade to Bash 5...<i>and re-enable SIP and move on with my day</i>, because the dichotomy of &quot;complete control&quot; and &quot;little to no protection&quot; you&#x27;re presenting here is an egregiously false one. But god forbid anybody actually learn about the platform they&#x27;re criticising (and there are plenty of real things to criticise about macOS that aren&#x27;t just projected fears from iOS) before clutching at pearls.<p>I came to macOS from Linux, and there most definitely are conflicts between what I want to do and what Apple thinks I should be doing. Astonishingly I&#x27;ve almost always been able to go ahead and do those things (barring a complete lack of functionality e.g. with dropping support for 32-bit libraries, an unsolvable dilemma I&#x27;ve managed to crack by...leaving one of my devices on Mojave) because I don&#x27;t just sit on my hands and whine about it. Apparently this is defending a giant faceless corporation, so I should probably wear that badge with pride.')
