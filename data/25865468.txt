You can&#x27;t license your way out of this problem. You can&#x27;t services-company your way out of this problem. The fundamental issue is that it is <i>good for the world</i> for skilled developers to spend all day writing software and giving it away, but they can make much more money writing software and not giving it away.<p>And I&#x27;m not even necessarily advocating we change our system of governance - we can do it fine with our current one. Even the culture of academia would be fine here. There certainly are skilled scientists who find it more profitable to do secret work in for-profit labs, but far less so than in software. (In large part, that system works because of government-funded universities and government-funded research grants.)')
