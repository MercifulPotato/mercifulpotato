Item(by='JohnBooty', descendants=None, kids=[24717416], score=None, time=1602147568, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24717119, text='I read Slashdot nearly every day for quite a few years, stepping away at some point in the 2000s.<p>That particular aspect of the moderation system sounds good on paper, but was rather useless in practice.<p>Essentially, what &quot;matters&quot; is that people are upvoting or downvoting a particular post. Theoretically, it&#x27;s good to have a bit of additional metadata telling us <i>why</i> they&#x27;re doing it: i.e., do they find the post Funny, Insightful, or Informative?<p>In practicality, it&#x27;s not that useful, or at least it wasn&#x27;t put to any practical use by Slashdot when I stopped reading it back in the 2000&#x27;s. At a moment&#x27;s glance, it&#x27;s pretty trivial to see why people might&#x27;ve upvoted a particular post - it&#x27;s clearly meant to be funny, or it has a lot of informative links, etc. So the metadata of &quot;why&quot; was just redundant.<p>On the other hand, I suppose the metadata could have been put to some practical use after all. For example, it would have been perhaps useful to filter out all of the &quot;Funny&quot; [1] and &quot;Insightful&quot; [2] replies on Slashdot  and to focus on the most &quot;Informative&quot; [3] ones. I don&#x27;t remember the interface allowing you to do that. Perhaps they added it later, or perhaps it&#x27;s something you might explore in your own system.<p>------<p>[1] I mean, one can only read so many &quot;Imagine a Beowulf cluster of THOSE!&quot; jokes before one wants to jump off of a bridge.<p>[2] In my experience, 99% of the &quot;Insightful&quot; comments were just those that forcefully&#x2F;eloquently regurgitated FOSS talking points that resonated well with established Slashdot groupthink. &quot;Insightful&quot; upvotes tended to mean &quot;I agree with the author of this comment&quot; and not &quot;wow, actual new insights are presented here.&quot; <i>Perhaps</i> this might have been avoided if there was a separate &quot;I agree with this&quot; upvote method, distinct from &quot;Insightful.&quot;<p>[3] It was easy to farm for karma this way; if you stumbled upon a recent Slashdot article without many replies, you could throw a few easily-Googled relevant links into a reply and be assured of getting a bunch of &quot;Informative&quot; votes. Nonetheless, while imperfect, the replies deemed &quot;Informative&quot; had a decent signal-to-noise ratio relative to the rest of the replies.')
