Item(by='rgbrenner', descendants=None, kids=[25296741], score=None, time=1607026863, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25293631, text='It&#x27;s only being mentioned alongside threadripper because the article went overboard and claimed the M1 &quot;embarrass all other PCs â€” ... including ... every single machine running Windows or Linux&quot;<p>This is a joke. The M1s performance is no where near the threadripper. Even on per-thread performance, new AMD cpus perform better than the M1... and they have many more cores. The M1 can only win these comparisons when we start adding all kinds of conditions, like power draw, heat, price point, etc. They need to add those conditions to redirect the conversation, because on raw performance threadripper destroys the M1.<p>The article made the mistake of leaving out those conditions to make it seem even more impressive than it is... but hyperbole and fantasy will always sound better than reality. Reality requires those conditions. That doesn&#x27;t detract from the m1&#x27;s impressiveness.. but it&#x27;s foolish to forget that and go off and start making ridiculous claims like the article has done.')
