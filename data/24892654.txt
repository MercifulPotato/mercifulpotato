Laptops are a bunch of compromises in every detail: screen size, storage volume, keyboard, sound etc etc.<p>I got my first PC 30 years ago and never bought a new one ever since. It was always upgrades, small or large. Even stepping up MB and CPU I&#x27;ve kept my drives, graphics card, most of the smaller peripherals, sometimes even RAM, so even the largest changes are always in several hundred dollars ballpark. The process is fun, interesting and makes me keep tabs with industry.<p>I&#x27;ve bought a laptop when switching to &quot;digital nomad&quot; lifestyle for several years, and it was my very worst experience with personal computing. I&#x27;ve spent about 15 hundreds bucks and never made worst investment ever since.')
