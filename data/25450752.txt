But keep in mind it was only possible by decades of development of layers upon layers of abstracting away most of the CS into easily composable libraries, APIs, and other components.  You many not need to know algorithms and datastructures yourself, but you&#x27;re definitely using them by building on them and with libs that encapsulate them.')
