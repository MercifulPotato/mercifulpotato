I love Live, but it’s getting harder to keep justifying additional money into it as a hobbyist. I might give Logic another go (purchased years ago and still getting free updates), even though it has always felt less intuitive to me than Live for whatever reason.<p>Edit: I’ve seen other folks online posting a price of $183 for Suite upgrade, so I would just login and see what price they give you. I think I came from Suite 9, so maybe that accounts for the price difference.')
