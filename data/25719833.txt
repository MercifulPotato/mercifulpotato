Especially if you&#x27;re a small company, engineering time (really any employee time) is _insanely valuable_.  Valuable such that even if Airflow is cash-expensive, if using it allows your engineers to focus on building whatever makes _your business successful_, it is usually a much better idea to just use Airflow and keep moving. Clients usually will not care about whether you implemented your own version of an AWS product (unless that&#x27;s your company&#x27;s specific business). Clients will care about the features you ship. If you spent a ton of time re-inventing Airflow to save some cost, but then go bankrupt before you ever ship, rolling your own Airflow implementation clearly didn&#x27;t save you anything.')
