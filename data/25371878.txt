As many people know the good thing with Arch is that what you gey is the bare minimum to have a shell running, so anything that is not necessary for the system to be up is something I installed; I <i>know</i> what is on the system.<p>I do upgrade my packages from time to time. It&#x27;s almost always happened smoothly. The few times problems happened were due to 2 reasons:<p>- the software itself has a buggy upgrade procedure. I probably would have had the same issue with any other distribution, assuming they would contain the latest version<p>- it&#x27;s an Arch-specific upgrade issue, but I have so few packets that this happens at most twice a year and it&#x27;s always documented on the front page of the arch wiki<p>I have to admit that since it&#x27;s only my own server, there is no pressure for services to stay up. In practice in the years I&#x27;ve used this setup I&#x27;ve never had an issue because a package was too recent and buggy; it was always a misconfiguration from my part.<p>I very much like the process of steadily keeping up to date bit by bit, instead of stagnating on a stable base and doing a big bang update every few years. I also like the fact that I don&#x27;t need to know which version of which release am I going to get, it&#x27;s always the latest one and it&#x27;s the one that upstream released.')
