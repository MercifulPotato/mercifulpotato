They where a little long in the tooth but certainly where in use. Personally when the internet broke out of the Universities I was using an Amiga, then switched to Mac and finally a Next box when the web took off as at the time Next had the best tooling for web-dev and I was still dabbling in Motorola assembly so wanted to stay on a Motorola based system. IIRC PowerPC based Mac&#x27;s hit around the time AOL was finally offering Web access thru their service. I never used AOL so don&#x27;t recall for sure, but it seems right around the same era. The BBS type dial-ins offering web access is what really transitioned the net and specifically the web into what it is today. Before they offered access, you had to get a provider (if there even was one in your area), configure your TCP&#x2F;PPP settings and connect in, it was not just pop the AOL CD in and put in your credit card number. So those services (Specifically AOL and Compuserve) offering easy access really spring boarded a lot of general non-tech users onto the net and started the next era of the net&#x2F;web.')
