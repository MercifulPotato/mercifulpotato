When you&#x27;re starting hit limits with that, then optimise, within reason.  When you&#x27;re starting to hit limits there, then scale horizontally (add more servers).<p>The point with optimizing before scaling horizontally is to make sure you understand what is going on.  Scaling horizontally without a good understanding is going to be a fail-whale shitshow.<p>I&#x27;d also note that high availability needs some horizontal scaling.')
