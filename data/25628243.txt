Consider the cases:<p>- I absolutely hate giving phone number to new ecommerce sites as it is just a database that will eventually get leaked. The only one I can trust here is Amazon probably.<p>- Phone number on packages. A person can read your name, address and phone number from a package which seems like a lot of info. Address is required but phone number shouldn&#x27;t be as you can very well redirect the call using custom pins.<p>- Talking to new people on dating apps. I don&#x27;t use IG, so phone number is something I have to exchange. Now I would never give my number to an anon on internet but on dating apps I have to for my own benefit.<p>Do you guys maintain burner phone numbers for these cases?')
