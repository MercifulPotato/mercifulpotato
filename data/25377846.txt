No one uses it!&quot; But it&#x27;s highly cultural. I only use WhatApp for two friends in Europe. Most of my friends here in the US use Facebook Messenger for our group chats. My iPhone-using friends use iMessage, but if I&#x27;m communicating with an Android-using friend, it&#x27;s just plain SMS. I prefer more robust platforms but I also send hundreds of plain SMS messages each month. It&#x27;s just easier than trying to figure out if they&#x27;re on WhatsApp, Messenger, Signal, Discord, Telegraph, Hello&#x2F;Allo&#x2F;Duo&#x2F;etc... everyone has SMS and everyone has a phone number so it&#x27;s the lowest friction way to communicate.<p>That&#x27;s what I love about these forums, is getting the cultural experiences of other people and finding out they&#x27;re not always the same as your experiences. Very eye-opening.')
