Item(by='roryokane', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604716694, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25000586, text='The ~140 MB zip file containing the code itself (but not the commit message) is still downloadable from the Wayback Machine, as linked from this comment: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24996616" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24996616</a>.<p>Apart from the code linked above, I don’t think you’re missing any significant information that was on that archived page whose URL is now excluded. The screenshot at the top of this article matches what I remember of that page: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arstechnica.com&#x2F;information-technology&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;githubs-source-code-was-leaked-on-github-last-night-sort-of&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arstechnica.com&#x2F;information-technology&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;githu...</a>.<p>To describe the screenshot in words, for the sake of those who prefer text to images for whatever reason: the commit was an orphan with no parent; it had no commit history. The message was as SethTro quoted it: “felt cute, might put gh source code on dmca repo now idk”. GitHub’s interface suggested the committer was <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;nat" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;nat</a>, but there was no “Verified” label. The interface described the commit as having been created “1 hour ago” at 2020-11-04 05:00:26, the time of crawling.')
