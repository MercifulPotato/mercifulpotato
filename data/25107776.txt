Certainly stopping the war on drugs is one plank of the libertarian platform, but it&#x27;s only one small piece.<p>Other issues include stopping America&#x27;s eternal military actions, reining in public debt, stopping abuse of police power (some overlap with BLM here!), ensuring that civil liberties such as speech, voting, self-defense, and sanctity of private property are protected, and so forth. There&#x27;s a LOT there (and so assuredly there&#x27;s space for everybody to find disagreement). It&#x27;s just wrong to claim that it&#x27;s all about weed and drugs.')
