Item(by='Doctor_Fegg', descendants=None, kids=[25142090], score=None, time=1605729132, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25137235, text='As a long-time OSM contributor (former editing software maintainer, former OSM Foundation board member yadda yadda) I like this piece, because it actually gets the &quot;mutual aid&quot; dynamic between corporate OSM and enthusiast OSM.<p>The two should not be opposed. Rather, the more people are exposed to OSM via Facebook, Apple and so on, the more enthusiast contributors OSM gets. The more rendering tech that Mapbox releases as open source, the more opportunities OSM enthusiasts have to build cool stuff. And so on.<p>We get a fair amount of sniffiness from some of the more corporate types, denigrating enthusiast contributions as just early-stages stuff that should now inevitably give way to AI-assisted machine mapping. So to read a more balanced view like this is genuinely refreshing.<p>_But_ it does require both sides to understand the bargain and play fair, and that doesn&#x27;t happen as universally as I&#x27;d like. There are some among the enthusiast community who are unremittingly hostile to corporate actors beyond what anyone should have to put up with, salaried or not. To some degree that&#x27;s inevitable when you have a project that attracts single-minded 15-year old Linux geeks, maybe, but that explains rather than excuses.<p>Conversely, corporate OSM too often acts in its short-term interests without a view to the wider good. Attribution is the most notorious example, where Facebook, among others, is basically flouting OSM&#x27;s attribution requirements. This breaks the &quot;more eyeballs, more contributors&quot; compact. We also see it where corporate editors steamroller some of the nuance from individual contributors&#x27; edits (particularly logistics-driven), and I&#x27;ll confess I&#x27;m not a great fan of Mapbox&#x27;s recent decision to close the source of the dominant in-app renderer, though that&#x27;s clearly their right to choose.<p>If this thoughtful article helps both &quot;sides&quot; realise that they&#x27;re better working together than against each other, that would be a win.')
