Item(by='gspr', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606229989, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25198149, text='&gt; Once you get to 50-100km away from the city center, then your options look very bleak.<p>I&#x27;d say that at 100 km you&#x27;re no longer talking about that city&#x27;s public transit anymore (for a city this size). At 50 km I&#x27;d maybe agree with you. That&#x27;s also a bit of what I meant to indicate with the Swiss trains comment â€“ the (heavy rail) train services indeed aren&#x27;t great around Oslo.<p>&gt; I live in Copenhagen myself, but I grew up 100km outside of Copenhagen. Using a car to go back and forth from there to Copenhagen takes approximately 1 hour each way. Using public transportation all the way takes closer to 2 hours. Using a combination takes 1h 30min on a good day.<p>But then again, in fairness, at 100 km outside of Copenhagen you&#x27;re halfway to Germany! It&#x27;s getting to be a stretch for a commute anyway, is it not?<p>&gt; Banning cars from cities seems to only think of people who lives inside it and not how difficult it will be for a lot of people already &quot;taxed&quot; with hour long commutes because of stupidly expensive housing combined with centralization of workplaces.<p>Well, in return, those people do get vastly cheaper housing (I&#x27;m well aware that suburban housing around Oslo and Copenhagen is still very very expensive, but once you start hitting the 100 km range that certainly stops being the case).<p>Adapting cities to be car-friendly make them sprawly, congested or pedestrian-unfriendly. Or all three.')
