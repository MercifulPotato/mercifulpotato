And claim that it fulfilled the terms of the agreement.<p>That isn&#x27;t an improvement. It is nothing more than muddying the waters enough it makes it hard to point out that the situation is no different from a default. Which I suppose is why they do it.<p>There is an amount of stuff in the world at this moment. The US either gives back more stuff than it borrowed, or less. The idea that it can give back less stuff but that is OK because it is a government is a foolish idea. Making it hard to understand who is getting what doesn&#x27;t magically mean everyone is happy, it just means we only find out who is paying with benefit of hindsight.')
