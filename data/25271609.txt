I use them daily in our team chat -- we can talk in the main chat about anything relevant to the whole team, and if someone has a specific comment on someone&#x27;s message, they reply and create a thread while the rest of the conversation continues on.<p>The nesting-within-a-larger-conversation aspect felt very intuitive to me. I&#x27;ve been in other Slack workspaces that didn&#x27;t use threads nearly as well, though -- I do think they take some &quot;correct usage&quot; to perform well.')
