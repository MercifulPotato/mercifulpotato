Or is it Gmail meet?) event this morning. It somehow dialed out of my Gmail app (WTF?) instead of the Meet app, said it was &quot;joining as&quot; my personal account and I had no option to switch it to my work account, and I wasn&#x27;t able to look at my e-mail during the meeting because the Gmail app was busy dealing with a call.<p>I don&#x27;t even know where to begin about how awful of a UX this has become. I&#x27;d give them feedback but there isn&#x27;t even an obvious option to do that.<p>Also, I truly hate the new UIs from Google where buttons jump around. The order of &quot;Maps&quot;, &quot;Images&quot; tabs in search results jumps around depending on the search and that messes with my muscle memory. Buttons just randomly disappear and appear as you scroll up and down. Names of streets and restaurants randomly disappear in navigation mode. Some buttons get bigger and smaller as you scroll. What was the product manager smoking when they called for this BS? As a user I constantly feel like I can never use my phone, and I have no way to even relay this to them. Did they even care to A&#x2F;B test this stuff and analyze how many times users were e.g. hitting the back button (or other metrics of user fumbling)?')
