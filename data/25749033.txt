Both are FOSS, and both serve HTTP, an open protocol. There were definitely attempts to build proprietary protocols, none of which were successful, and in the long run the proprietary web servers ended up second place to the open source projects.<p>Here in the US, I get reminders via SMS from my bank or my doctor telling me that payments went through or that I have an upcoming appointment. More thorough messages are sent via Email. Every form I&#x27;ve filled out since the turn of the millennium asks for my email address, none of them have asked for my MySpace, Twitter, or Facebook handles.<p>I edit my code in either Emacs, Vim, or Visual Studio Code -- one of those is an open-source product by a very much for-profit company, the other two have survived decades as powerful editors&#x2F;IDEs.<p>If I had to make a prediction, I&#x27;d say that over time open protocols will end up winning -- not because of some kind of ideological purity, but because they permit people to build platforms that interoperate with one another. The Fediverse is young yet, and Twitter&#x2F;Instagram&#x2F;FB are making adversarial interoperability hard, but the entire history of the Internet and the World Wide Web is one where open has won over the long haul.')
