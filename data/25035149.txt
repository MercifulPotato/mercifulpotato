The mere suggestion that we should seek to limit terrorist access to encryption is evident of a fundamental misunderstanding of the technology.<p>Encryption is not a product.  It is not an application made by Apple, Microsoft, Google, or whoever which you use to secure data.  Encryption is an idea.  Humans have been encrypting information since long before computers.  We cannot stop it.<p>It&#x27;s like arguing that we should limit terrorist access to algebra.  I&#x27;d say anyone arguing for that is illiterate when it comes to algebra.  Likewise, I&#x27;d say anyone arguing for limitations on encryption is illiterate when it comes to encryption.')
