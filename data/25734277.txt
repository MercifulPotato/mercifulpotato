At what point do you begin to question your ideology for it&#x27;s intolerance, double standards, and moral inconsistencies? Have YOU learned nothing from history, ironically Hitler&#x27;s rise to power, to even question the dogma being fed to you regarding racism and violence? I&#x27;m not saying you have to tolerate or even agree with your opposition. However, I&#x27;d challenge you to not partake in the past dictator&#x27;s favorite action of belittling and scapegoating his political opposition. You are contributing to the very acts you espouse to be against by labeling all of your opposition as racists, mentally ill, brainwashed extremists. All you&#x27;ve demonstrated with your words is violence is okay, so long as you agree with the cause as we experienced COUNTLESS acts of violence in the US riots occurring throughout the year.')
