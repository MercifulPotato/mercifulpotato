I can&#x27;t imagine what a &quot;certification for programming&quot; would even look like. Programming is a completely different field than others - it&#x27;s exactly that type of difference that has made programming far more welcoming than others.<p>No one is denying that you&#x27;re not going to be the best developer in a few days. But I welcome everyone learning the way they want to and how they want to, and for others in the industry helping them learn.<p>And for your example, I&#x27;d much rather hire someone who has worked in their garage with wood for a decade than someone who just got a certification to call themselves a professional carpenter right out of trade school.<p>And yes, you are literally trying to gatekeep because you&#x27;re realizing the thing you&#x27;ve spent thousands of hours learning is actually not that difficult and is getting easier and easier every day.')
