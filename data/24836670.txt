It&#x27;s not &quot;market share&quot; or &quot;barriers to entry&quot; or even engaging in &quot;anti-competitive behavior&quot; anymore. But more about how corporations can control the free flow of information.

I&#x27;d put it at under 25%.<p>The real behemoth is NVidia + ARM. GPU shortages are endemic. And the cost of a new entrant to the market just to construct a fab is probably $20B+. Ask Intel XE how much they are spending just to keep up ;)')
