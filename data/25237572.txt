In code it is really stretching the metaphor to do much more than very basic tasks like renaming or code formatting (e.g. picking up trash). Adding a test doesn&#x27;t feel like &quot;left alone&quot;.<p>One of the examples in the article is upgrading a dependency. This could easily fall into the category you mention if the upgrade itself is not properly tested. A considered approach would be:<p>&quot;I want to make a small improvement, oh I see this dependency is out of date and has some minor vulnerabilities or perf issues, or is missing a feature that could come in handy for XYZ. Hmm, there are no tests confirming our assumptions about the current library version, nor are then any tests are our code &#x2F; systems that use it. I guess my improvement should be to add those tests, then next time someone has the same idea it&#x27;ll be an easier upgrade&quot;<p>I am unsure but I also interpret from your first sentence that you may have seen people use this rule as a defence for gold plating (the opposite of KISS or YAGNI). Similarly this should fall under the heading of changes made without proper discussion, thought or consideration.<p>Otherwise I think we&#x27;re really stuck, if team members cannot be trusted to properly interpret the boy scout rule without messing up a codebase then how on earth can they be trusted to build the foundation of their company &#x2F; team &#x2F; system?')
