Social network that people vote on where in the political quadrant something is, at the same time it takes into account their own political leanings&#x2F;upvotes&#x2F;etc. So you can say this is lefist, I&#x27;m right-leaning, but I still like the article, and think it&#x27;s newsorthy so I&#x27;ll upvote it.<p>Basically adding a lot more granular user sentimentality around articles. Letting users organically fact check, but having it all be transparent, you can see the user, and they&#x27;re color coded by their political leanings so you can know you&#x27;re talking w&#x2F; someone who supported Biden or Trump.<p>2. News show like Morning Joe with Krystal Ball, Cenk, Tucker Carlson, Hannity, Joe Scarborough, Cuomo, Anderson. -- Essentially voices from left, right, center-left, center-right, and mid-center. All with equal air-time on the issues.<p>Format could be something like: Announcer announces topic&#x2F;news. Each person gets 1 minute to respond, 15 seconds for rebuttals. Then move on to next topic.<p>At the end of the show, fact checkers will grade each person&#x27;s performance based on the percentage of factual statements vs lies and post it online with the video segment for transparency.')
