But x86 really does have fundamental problems.  The length of an instruction can’t be determined until the instruction is almost fully decoded, which makes deciding in parallel quite nasty. And the x86 memory model is fundamentally more expensive than ARM’s.<p>M1 is the first serious attempt to make a competitive high-performance non-x86 CPU.  Perhaps the real lesson from M1 will be that x86 can’t compete.')
