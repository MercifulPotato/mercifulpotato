Item(by='tialaramex', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603997234, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24930149, text='It&#x27;s a GoA 3 system, so it isn&#x27;t designed to be safe without a human staff member on every train. There <i>are</i> GoA 4 systems which do not need a human but the DLR isn&#x27;t one, so while it would seem to operate normally if you just let passengers operate the doors - when anything goes wrong those passengers are in trouble because the system design assumes a trained member of staff is there to fix it and now there isn&#x27;t.<p>That triangular key opens a panel by the front left seats of the train, which reveals a complete set of controls for manually driving the train which that member of staff is trained to use. If the GoA 3 system has given up when the train is just out somewhere random then &quot;just get out&quot; while technically possible since there&#x27;s a walking route along the side at all times - is clearly not ideal even for able-bodied passengers, so in fact the member of staff will drive the train manually to a station unless obviously that&#x27;s impossible somehow (e.g. terrorists blew up sections of track either side like a Hollywood movie).<p>Because humans are bad at driving trains, they aren&#x27;t allowed to move at full speed, they can either let the GoA 3 automation oversee everything (e.g. it won&#x27;t let them go anywhere it wouldn&#x27;t be willing to go) at a reduced speed or when that&#x27;s not useful they can switch off all automation and move at a crawl with no oversight.<p>Every morning the first train of the day on each route is driven in the first of those two modes, because overnight human maintenance teams sometimes manage to leave tools and equipment on the line and the automation doesn&#x27;t know not to drive the train into a welding kit left on the track by some idiot who just discovered his wife is leaving him or whatever. So the human staff member&#x27;s job is to drive the train (with the AI preventing them smashing it into other trains) while looking out the front window for problems.')
