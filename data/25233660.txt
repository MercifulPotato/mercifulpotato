I don&#x27;t know anyone who works at SpaceX, but a bunch of my classmates went to work for ULA (their competitor). I imagine that SpaceX is better managed, but the nature of work is the same - you&#x27;re either calculating things using conventional wisdom, or you&#x27;re writing simulations or coming up with other ways to achieve higher performance or save money. Either way, the work is slow and highly co-dependent on a million other moving parts. Once a project is complete, your ownership is unlikely to be higher than a tiny fraction of 1 percent. Also, at least at ULA, you better excel at selling your work internally.<p>On the other hand, SV is littered with names of people who single-handedly turned unprofitable late-stage tech companies into major successes. There&#x27;s less regulation, stakes are lower, capital requirements are lower, less of the available landscape has been claimed, and the industry lends itself well to the power of computation. It&#x27;s a little bit like trying to get rich in 18th century England vs 18th century USA. Would it be fair for US farmers to claim that they are doing &quot;radically different&quot; work compared to their English counterparts? Perhaps the work looked similar (&quot;put food on the table&quot;), but the rules and opportunities were vastly different and created different outcomes for individuals (as in - the smartest&#x2F;most fit&#x2F;hardest working people got more out of their work).')
