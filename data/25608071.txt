Surprisingly, most of the illegal market for non-meth amphetamine is misdirected legal pills.<p>They&#x27;re also quite different from opiods because unlike them, they aren&#x27;t inherently addictive if prescribed properly. For example, prescribed for ADHD, all cause addiction rates do not increase from amphetamine use. In general, it&#x27;s about as addictive as alcohol, and that&#x27;s perfectly acceptable as the name for software such as WINE.')
