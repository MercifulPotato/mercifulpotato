Nobody gives away their edge for free, although they may give away their trades.<p>&gt;I don&#x27;t really see how that cashes out in an inaccurate overall system<p>Imagine a strategy that has a 50% chance of blowing you up completely over 10 years, but nets you 50% more profit if it works. The average return of this strategy is 25% less than a safe strategy (zero risk, zero gain), but it has a 50% chance of winning in this marketplace. If it were real money, nobody would go near it.<p>Ok, now imagine there&#x27;s 100 people running strategies with that profile and 100 running the safe strategy. <i>All of the top spots will be held by the suicidal strategy.</i> This is an artificial example but you get the point. Real money forces you to avoid that risk profile as soon as you identify it.')
