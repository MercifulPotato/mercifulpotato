Item(by='drdaeman', descendants=None, kids=[25771912, 25773274, 25775522], score=None, time=1610595623, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25770854, text='&gt; My net salary is just over 1000â‚¬<p>That&#x27;s really low, even for poorer European countries. Decent middle-level software engineer in, let&#x27;s say, Ukraine (no offense meant - it is a good country, just isn&#x27;t one famous for high incomes), easily makes at least 2k (and I say &quot;at least&quot; - that&#x27;s awfully underpaid).<p>&gt; that means that i&#x27;d need anywhere from ~8 to ~14 years to save as much as they could in a year<p>That&#x27;s a bit exaggerated figure. It&#x27;s 100k before taxes (so, around $5.8k&#x2F;mo), and rent (or mortgage) costs are significantly higher (I believe it&#x27;s around $1-3k&#x2F;mo, highly varying depending on where you live and how comfortable you live). And it&#x27;s not just rent but other expenses as well.')
