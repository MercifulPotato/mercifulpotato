You&#x27;re conflating a business model that doesn&#x27;t work under a set of (possibly) onerous regulations to a failed business model. Who has it failed for? And don&#x27;t say investors, because these are smart people who believe there is a path to profitability.<p>It&#x27;s a failed business model because it cannot operate once these companies are asked to pay living wages - which they don&#x27;t. Hence...failed. If I were to open up a factory and paid my workers $0.50&#x2F;hour and then got shut down for not paying minimum wage; the burden of that failure would be on me, not the state that&#x27;s asking me to pay minimum wage.<p>Who cares about investors?')
