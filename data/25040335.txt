Remember that countries have local agencies and national numbers are not everything.<p>Ontario is only 12M people, British Coloumbia 5M people and they have active contact tracing of literally every patient.<p>So with 90% effectiveness, the numbers will be brought way down, and in many areas, the threshold of cases will be low enough that contact tracing can be enacted.<p>So about the 50 people - we have to basically still maintain a degree of isolation, and that&#x27;s entirely possible.<p>We don&#x27;t need to tell the grocery store workers to &#x27;self isolate&#x27; because someone came into the store with COVID that&#x27;s already happening, those are low-risk events.<p>During social isolation, people should absolutely not be contacting 50 people.<p>So masks, basic social isolation at very least (no unnecessary contact) can remain in place.')
