There are a great many other incidents in which large numbers of people have been deliberately killed yet we seem to just take such things as normal. The specifics of Khashoggi&#x27;s murder were shocking, but the murder or disappearance of such persons is far from unusual on the world stage.<p>This is hugely important context to always keep in mind. The fact that MBS had managed to bamboozle the western media into fawning over his token &quot;reforms&quot; prior to the Saudis brazenly murdering Kashoggi was a disgrace.<p>It&#x27;s telling that the media only really started caring about Saudi governmental corruption and criminality after one of their own - a fellow pundit who traveled in elite western circles - was grotesquely killed. MBS presumably had good reason to believe he could get away with murder, with Kashoggi being the exception that proves the rule.')
