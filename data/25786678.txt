In specific spaces, however, this makes a lot of sense.<p>From a more distanced perspective, political discussions are exhausting at best, as you need to discuss many varying aspects influencing a complex system, and harmful at worst, as soon as they turn toxic (which they tend to on some topics). Having a break from these is necessary. That doesn&#x27;t mean we don&#x27;t need those - having these discussions is important. But there is a reason politician is a full time job.<p>Additionally, HN has a very international audience. Internal politics is irrelevant to a large part of the readership - irrespective of the discussed country - and therefore these discussions are simply annoying.')
