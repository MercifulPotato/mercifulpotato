E.g. if a SaaS company is trying to negotiate a contract with a prospective client, it does so on the basis of the benefits or ROI that the client would get (&quot;you spend X with us, but we&#x27;ll help you generate Y&quot;). If a competitor offers a comparable service, the conversation focuses on the difference in product offerings, not whether their HQ is in a lower cost city or a higher tax state or whatever.<p>For the employees who are making these value-based arguments on behalf of their employer to then be told that they should be payed less based on where they live seems hypocritical at best.')
