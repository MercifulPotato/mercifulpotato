There is indeed a sizeable French expat community in many African countries but they are afraid of physically getting out of their bubbles, usually located in a posh district in the respective country&#x27;s capital city. My friend (also French) was not afraid of getting out of that bubble hence his direct interactions with people who had almost never interacted directly with a white person before.')
