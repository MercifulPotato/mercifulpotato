With a tiny kitchen, I&#x27;d stored it in my oven, and after baking a dozen or so loaves of bread while it was in there I discovered that the coating had almost completely burned off. I obsessively researched cast-iron seasoning (included Sheryl Canter&#x27;s article), heard about the flaking flaxseed oil (not to mention the insane price of the stuff), and ultimately opted for high smoke-point grape seed oil ($4 @ Trader Joe&#x27;s), the science-y logic being the goal of exceeding the smoke point at the highest possible temp, and indulged in $6 worth of lint-free (blue) shop towels (hardware store), and then:<p>1. preheat oven to ~ 200deg F;\n2. give pan a vinegar&#x2F;water bath (~50&#x2F;50) for 30 minutes, then steel-wooled it for a minute to ensure it was down to the bone;\n3. thoroughly dry ... and crank the oven to 450+;\n4. using lint-free towel: thoroughly apply a coat of oil to the warmed pan, then wipe almost completely dry, then bake for about an hour;\n5. apply another coat (yeah, silicone oven mitts), another wipe-off, another hour ... at most 3x;<p>The thing is now the gem I always wanted it to be; eggs slide around like on teflon. I wash after use in hottest water using a chainmail scrubber for any tiny stuck bits (almost none ever), and don&#x27;t mind if there&#x27;s a drop or two of dish soap. Dry thoroughly, on the fire for a minute to be sure, and then a quick wipe of oil - no re-seasoning, just protection. So the cleanup and maintenance is a bit of a ritual but for me it&#x27;s well worth the performance.')
