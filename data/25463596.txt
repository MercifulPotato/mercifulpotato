Glad to see your work here man :) Will be watching the project closely over the next year. Having recently re-built authn + authz using Cognito (we evaluated Auth0 and building it ourselves as well) I can confidently agree that doing auth right is hard and complex. Especially once you get into social providers, keeping identities synced, MFA, etc. Excited to see where the project lands!')
