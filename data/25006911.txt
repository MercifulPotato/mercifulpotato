Most WANT their stuff being downloaded. If I&#x27;m uploading an educational or family video to Youtube, it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s a convenient way for others to watch it, not because I want to maintain control, or earn $0.0001 in ad revenues for Auntie being shown a Trump campaign ad.<p>youtube-dl makes it possible for kids in the developing world to watch educational videos, for people to watch family videos in rural America, and for kids to learn remotely.<p>Youtube-dl doesn&#x27;t do what Youtube does. What it does is extends Youtube to millions of people without high-speed internet connections. That&#x27;s not a population Google particularly cares about including (not a lot of ad dollars), but it&#x27;s also not one Google particularly cares about excluding (they are not douchebags, like the RIAA).<p>If the RIAA wants locked-down controls, they should go with centralized platforms. That&#x27;s what they&#x27;re there for. In the meantime, shooting educators using Youtube in the foot means, eventually, educators will go somewhere else.')
