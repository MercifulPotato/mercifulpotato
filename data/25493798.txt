Just reboot your phone, and you&#x27;re good to go. Only creeps like NSO who spy on normal people need that degree of persistence. Everyone else can just hang out in ram on some always-on server.<p>Vendors need to make it easier to verify the integrity of persistent firmware, in an offline fashion.  It will dramatically increase the cost of persistence, which is the best way to put these thugs out of business.')
