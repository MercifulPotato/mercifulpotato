Take an interest in data.   Be interested in the details of how statistics and numbers make things more complicated than black or white.   Take a look each day at some of the more popular plots on <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;dataisbeautiful&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;dataisbeautiful&#x2F;</a> .   Go to wikipedia and read about the demographic distribution of the USA, or the federal tax brackets, and how you would visualize those in data.   And think about what data, numbers, information you would need to plot such things.  Write down the example data you would need and think about how to plot it, or make some conclusion about it.  Think about where in your cases you would bring in data (and of what kind) to support the point.<p>-- 2. Be interested in why small differences in data can change the &quot;takeaway&quot; point of what you&#x27;re seeing.   What would it take in numbers to reach the conclusion you&#x27;re reaching?   How reliable are those numbers, and how do they interact that some error in one would change your whole conclusion? Learning to like the detail behind a &quot;principle&quot; is important.   When Justice xyz questioned the petitioner on the distance radius of doctors who were able to be affiliated with an abortion-performing hospital and the effect on the number of women with access to medical procedures, why did that matter?<p>-- 3. Don&#x27;t be satisfied with the summary numbers that someone tells you.  Learn to ask the next level question about the numbers and think about what it means.    When some article or person on the news says, &quot;xyz went up by 30%&quot;, ask for more -- what number did it go from to?  When was it measured, and by what metric?   What was the error?  If it went from 3 to 4, well, is that <i>meaningful</i> to say it went up by 30%?    When they say a vaccine has 90% efficacy, what does that mean?  What numbers are they looking at to say such a thing?  What number would <i>you</i> look at?<p>You will know you&#x27;ve reached a level of quantitative thinking when you can call bullshit on other people&#x27;s claimed statistics, or ask &quot;did they really measure that in a meaningful way?&quot;.<p>If you don&#x27;t take an interest in numbers and how people present them, and what they mean, you can just be led around by other people who are in control of them.  It will be in your interest and increase your future success against adversaries to feel comfortable with numbers.')
