These are part of the workshop notes from 2017 (with a few updates, but mostly left intact) on &quot;A Deep Introduction to Julia for Data Science and Scientific Computing&quot;. It&#x27;s a full day 8am-3pm workshop (with extended problem exercises to take home!) that can be found here:<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;ucidatascienceinitiative.github.io&#x2F;IntroToJulia&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;ucidatascienceinitiative.github.io&#x2F;IntroToJulia&#x2F;</a><p>The section that was pulled out to be the heading link here was the portion that comes after first explaining the semantics of the language. The &quot;Why Julia?&quot; section is an explanation of why Julia is fast but also the engineering trade-offs that were made to get it done (and thus the drawbacks of the approach). That is the page is that is linked, but if you&#x27;re curious about the greater context of this page (and learning the language) do check out the rest of the notes. I will say that they are a bit old (one comment noted that a compiler specializations on literals does handle one of the cases I pointed out in the trade-offs) but for the most part are still a good introduction to the Julia programming language. Surprising to have people tell me this ended up on Hacker News but exciting to see!')
