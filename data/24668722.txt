This is a basic consequence of the underlying pseudo-Riemannian geometry. In terms of PDEs, the field value at any point is <i>fully</i> determined by the initial conditions on a Cauchy surface within its past light cone.<p>Quantum mechanically, field operators at spacelike-separated points commute.<p>&gt; Also, it seems pretty clear that Wolfram does not understand the concept of Warp drive, which is not used to propel the craft, but instead used to warp space to come to the craft<p>You didn’t read the article. This is addressed at the end, under “What about warp bubbles and the Alcubierre metric?”.')
