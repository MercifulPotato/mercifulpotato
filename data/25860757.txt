His doctor then goes on to explain that pretty much all men eventually get prostate cancer and there&#x27;s not much you can do about it and you&#x27;re far more likely to die of something else first so, not really much reason to get the PSA<p>Anyone have any other info? Is there actually treatment and is it worth while?')
