Code is transient, and even good code today will be called techdebt tomorrow when the next language or framework or library shows up. But bad documentation impedes your ability to write good code, your ability to work with other parts of the organization, and your ability to grow your business by having outsiders integate with you (as in this case): it also has the effect of <i>turning</i> code into techdebt, by causing people to write new implementations of code they otherwise could have used, because they have no documentation for it.<p>One step we could take is in hiring. When interviewing developers, let&#x27;s ask them to write documentation, not just code.')
