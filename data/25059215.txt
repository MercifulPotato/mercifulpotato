In the case of fuel taxes, they&#x27;re mostly used to fund road maintenance. Since the amount of road damage (and therefore maintenance cost) increases exponentially&#x2F;geometrically with axle weight[1], it doesn&#x27;t make sense to tax cyclists because the amount of cost they incur is negligible. On the other hand, it <i>does</i> make sense to charge electric vehicles extra $$$, because they incur road wear but don&#x27;t pay for it via fuel taxes.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;streets.mn&#x2F;2016&#x2F;07&#x2F;07&#x2F;chart-of-the-day-vehicle-weight-vs-road-damage-levels&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;streets.mn&#x2F;2016&#x2F;07&#x2F;07&#x2F;chart-of-the-day-vehicle-weigh...</a>')
