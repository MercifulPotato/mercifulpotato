Put that Mac Mini in your data center with redundant power, redundant networking and complete failover to another data center. I&#x27;ve been there and done that - it ain&#x27;t cheap. Your rack enclosure with redundant power sources and Fibre Channel Adapters is going to run you more than the Mac Mini itself. Add in the need for high availability and failover and yeah, you&#x27;re looking at some real money. When you look at the <i>total cost</i> of putting a Mac Mini in your data center, and not just the cost of a Mac Mini itself, then you&#x27;ll see this is a good deal.')
