Everything is generally slower when you have to interact with hardware.<p>Politics is still there as others have talked about, and the complaints about the tools become more &quot;do we really have to code in ANSI C with a proprietary toolchain?&quot;.<p>I&#x27;m not saying don&#x27;t go for it, it&#x27;s a really nice domain and IMO there&#x27;s a satisfaction that&#x27;s unmatched by pure software when you see your hardware project comes to fruition; but don&#x27;t expect the paradise.')
