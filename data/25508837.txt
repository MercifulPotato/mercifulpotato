I am aware of the bitterness trap, and it&#x27;s something I have take into account in life as it is a very potent danger, especially for people with my personality type.<p>In this case, I made the analogy with feudalism because the perspective seemed to fall in the diagonally opposite trap, that of just-world or bootstrap thinking. I believe the equilibrium lies in trying to see power relations as they are, which is obviously a difficult task that I don&#x27;t claim to be proficient at. These power relations are wrapped in so many social constructs that my intuition tells me to be extra-critical to correct for these hidden influences.<p>Another aspect is that I don&#x27;t have an outlet to discuss intense topics in real life, so I jump at the chance online. I hope other posters can relate to this ;)')
