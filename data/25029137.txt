If you deny an app the location permission, you would expect that the app cannot use GPS, and that is exactly what happens on Android. If you want faster location information in return for sharing &quot;anonymized&quot; location information with Google, you can optionally turn on location services to do so. This is considered a big enough privacy invasion that Android devices with Google services ask the user about it on initial set up.<p>On iOS, if you want to get your location at all via <i>any</i> app, even an app that keeps the locations it receives on the device, you automatically consent to having your location sent to Apple, and Apple doesn&#x27;t even tell the user that they&#x27;re doing this unless they go out of their way to find the privacy policy.')
