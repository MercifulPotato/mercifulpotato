I have a pretty intense job, and I&#x27;ve struggled to some degree with the way stress eats into both my work productivity and my well-being after work. I wrote this script to mitigate the bouts of workday akrasia that induce me to almost-unconsciously procrastinate, as well as the unfortunate habit of checking work email&#x2F;Slack after work hours or while on breaks (one of the pitfalls of not physically separating my work and recreational machines).<p>I use a simple launcher app called gmrun, which allows defining custom protocol prefixes. I&#x27;ve defined a few of these protocols, but my favorite is &quot;m:&quot;, which switches &quot;modes&quot; on my laptop. Appending a prefix-string of either &quot;work&quot;, &quot;rec&quot;, or &quot;all&quot; rewrites my i3 config file to switch to the corresponding &quot;mode&quot; by selectively disabling a set of switch-to-workspace keybindings. It&#x27;s about 100 lines of straightforward Python code incl docs and newlines, took me half an hour, and it paid for the time I put into it in less than a week. Probably a _dozen_ times a day, I catch myself trying to switch to the workspace that has my messenger apps or personal browser windows, and disabling the keybinding is enough to short-circuit the stress-driven impulse to distract and procrastinate and remember that I am trying to do focused work. It works very similarly for checking my email&#x2F;Slack after work hours, something I almost never do now for the same reasons.<p>This is pretty tuned to my situation, OS setup, and personality, but that&#x27;s pretty much the point: I&#x27;m extremely spoiled by Linux, i3, etc due to having a system that&#x27;s been custom-fitted to my every need every moment of my computing life since late high school.  If there&#x27;s a rough edge, I sand it; if there&#x27;s an optimization opportunity, I take it (if the ROI seems clearly worth it).<p>Not to get on my soapbox, but it saddens me a little that so many people I talk to, particularly technical ones, have become disconnected from just how many affordances general-purpose computers can offer without ever being _forced_ to avoid choosing the ease of a one-size-fits-all approach.')
