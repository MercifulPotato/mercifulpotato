Item(by='plif', descendants=None, kids=[25832440], score=None, time=1611023791, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25821430, text='Point well taken about culture and great examples. I completely agree with your premise.<p>However, tone is an extremely important part of cross-cultural training, and the tone of this article takes its premise from: _you may have a conflict of interest with group B_ to something between _group B is out to get you_ and _group B is evil_. I personally wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone because of this.<p>&gt; As a footnote, quotation marks suggest you&#x27;re quoting someone. Your claimed quote doesn&#x27;t exist in the source article. Your point would be stronger if you commented on what the author wrote than your (somewhat inaccurate) read-between-the-lines.<p>The original post has always had the exact paragraph that I derived my subtext from in it. Emphatic quotes are a bad habit of mine, so I removed those, but c&#x27;mon -- this is a pretty common grammar mistake and the sentence preceding it pretty clearly &quot;implies&quot; (emphatic quotes) that it&#x27;s only my interpretation :)<p>&gt; That&#x27;s another place cultures differ a lot: how things are implied and subtexts. People misread subtexts, which I think you did here.<p>Can you please explain how you would otherwise interpret the exact paragraph that I quoted? I&#x27;m usually pretty good at seeing the other side, but I genuinely can&#x27;t see this one. Maybe it&#x27;s because I&#x27;ve been in management too long (or maybe I&#x27;m too Canadian). Either way, I&#x27;m genuinely curious.<p>I&#x27;ll quote the paragraph again directly from the article for you:<p>&gt; Expert gaslighters, they are. What really makes me wonder is how the people keep doing these jobs. Many of them are in the very classes that get abused by other people regularly. How can you honestly keep doing that job when you are just enabling the abusers?<p>The only other interpretation I can think of is the author was referring to the people in the previous example. However, she switches from singular (&quot;person A&quot; &#x2F; &quot;person B&quot;) tense in the example to plural (&quot;gaslighters&quot; &#x2F; &quot;abusers&quot;) tense in this paragraph, so it&#x27;s either an uncharacteristic grammar mistake or a generalization applied to a broader group.<p>The generalization is that HR people are &quot;gaslighters&quot; and managers are &quot;abusers&quot;.<p>With that in mind, how would you interpret this sentence? &quot;What really makes me wonder is how the people keep doing these jobs.&quot;<p>I can only see: _how can these people live with themselves_. How is that subtext not correct here?')
