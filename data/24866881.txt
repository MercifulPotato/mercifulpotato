Now that someone is building a modern equivalent (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wigetworks.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wigetworks.com</a>), I wonder what they are doing about avoiding collisions.<p>Normal aircraft typically spend long periods in autopilot, whereas these things would presumably require a constantly vigilant pilot. And not just to avoid big ships, there are plenty of things floating in the ocean that could destroy one of these things: small boats, buoys, debris. The mast of a small sailing dinghy would be enough to cause a catastrophic crash.<p>I like the idea of this kind of craft, but I can&#x27;t see it working at scale.')
