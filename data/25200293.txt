I&#x27;d rather have the ability to remote into a user with limited privileges on a more secure server, given how big of a target mobile devices are. That and it turned out I had no real practical reason to be fiddling with most of my devices -- I mostly work on server &amp; web code, anything outside that the closer it is to 0 configuration the better it is for my sanity.')
