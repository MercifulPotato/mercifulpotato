Item(by='jsnell', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607016465, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25280619, text='&gt; Yammer is a social network and if Yammer counts for Microsoft as a &quot;chat app&quot; then Google gets to add Buzz, Reader, Orkut, G+, Wave, etc to the list.<p>The list of supposed Google chat apps up the thread did in fact include both Buzz and Wave, so I&#x27;m just applying the same criteria. Hangouts was the chat part of G+, so I think it&#x27;d be double counting to include G+.<p>&gt; Groove wasn&#x27;t exactly a chat app either<p>Neither are Duo and Meet, which were in the list of supposed Google chat apps.<p>&gt;  Kaizala is in the process of merging into Teams, and the Lync line (last Skype for Business) is considered to have already merged&#x2F;migrated<p>I don&#x27;t understand. The entire thing we&#x27;re supposed to be mocking Google for here is that they launch chat apps, and then force users to migrate away. Now you&#x27;re saying that all these Microsoft ones don&#x27;t count, because they&#x27;ve either already killed them and forced a migration, or are already in the process of doing so.<p>&gt; Skype, Qik, Yammer, and Groove were all acquisitions. (None of Google&#x27;s messenger churn has the excuse of being an acquisition.)<p>Fair enough that this is different. But first, note that when Google discontinues a product they got from an acquisition, HN does not consider that to be an exenuating circumstance. I think it&#x27;s fair to apply the same policy here. And second, nobody forced Microsoft to buy Skype when they already had a popular app doing just the same thing, which they then killed to make room for Skype.')
