(They&#x27;re easy to spot if you look, because they don&#x27;t ask you to buy their course).<p>Imagine, for example, that you had stumbled across a Magic Formula to create a niche Software as a Service business that brings in $5,000&#x2F;month while only taking up 10 hours of your time each week.  Why would you give that formula away when you could just use it yourself over and over and become a zillionaire?<p>Well, let&#x27;s think about it. Assuming you do have that Magic Formula and have used it once, what are your options?<p>1. Go live on the beach in Thailand.  Forever.<p>2. Build another business that brings in $5,000&#x2F;month for 10hrs&#x2F;week effort.<p>Notice that each spin of the Magic Formula cuts another 10 hours&#x2F;week out of your schedule of growing your hair and hanging out with that blonde girl from the article.  Spin it 4 times and you&#x27;re back to having a full time job like the rest of the world.<p>So you don&#x27;t do that.  You hang out on the beach, wondering why more people don&#x27;t do what you&#x27;re doing.  And you from time to time try to nudge a few more people into doing so themselves.<p>At least that&#x27;s my take on it, having spun that formula twice.')
