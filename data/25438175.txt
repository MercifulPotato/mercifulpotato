Vague pseudocode and fairly narrowly focused laws are quite similar in nature.<p>I&#x27;d also compare these two to mathematical proofs written in natural language in textbooks or academic papers. They have recurring structures and patterns, but are not formalized proofs, leave things explicitly or implicitly as an exercise to the reader or assume cases as trivial. (The gap to a formal representation is often nontrivial effort and has never been totally done for most of math)<p>But then again, we have lots of similar things. Household equipment user manuals, revenue reports, soccer match descriptions in newspapers, stock market updates, phone calls to make an appointment at the dentist, etc. Lots of things on various points of the structured&#x2F;formal&#x2F;closed -- unstructured&#x2F;informal&#x2F;open spectrum.')
