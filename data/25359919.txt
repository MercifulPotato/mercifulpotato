The thesis of a text is somewhat straightforward to summarize in articles and reports of that length.<p>Personally, I thought <i>Range</i> was a fantastic book. I agree that it was repetitive at times but that drum beating of the theme was welcome and showed the un&#x2F;kind learning environment thesis in many areas of human learning.<p>I gave copies of the book out to my group at work in 2019 and everyone in the group loved it (so they told me!).
