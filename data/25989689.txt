The fundamental issue is that 1) deposit is required, 2) there&#x27;s a spike in demand&#x2F;deposit requirements, 3) current reserves can&#x27;t pay for deposits. Going to 1 day settlement will just cause brokers to reduce their overall reserves in response (no need keeping all that money around!), so the next time a spike occurs the same issue will occur.')
