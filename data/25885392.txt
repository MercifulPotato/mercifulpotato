If I put a pot of water on the stove the specific way the water swirls around is a chaotic non linear system, but it’s not going to keep the water from warming up.<p>Similarly, if hypothetically increased global temperature results in increased cloud formation that reduces the impact of climate change that presupposes some increase in temperature otherwise the change in cloud formation doesn’t happen.  As such it’s reasonable to argue about the magnitude of change but not the direction of change.<p>I can clearly see arguing about a specific location bucking global trends because there complexity actually plays a direct role, thus the term climate change.  But, globally I can’t see how everywhere on average would buck these trends.')
