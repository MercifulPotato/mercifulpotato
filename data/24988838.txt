Most oil people who really look see that electric cars will have a place in the future world (as oil people they want to minimize it, but they are forced to admit there is a place for it). China doesn&#x27;t have the built up oil infrastructure that the rest of the world has, and is seeing the affects of pollution in their cities. Thus it makes sense for China to adopt electric cars faster than the rest of the world: if you don&#x27;t have infrastructure in place it is easier to justify building electric over oil, as opposed to US&#x2F;Europe which needs to justify replacing otherwise working find oil infrastructure. If you can&#x27;t be confident that you can fill your gas car on a long trip anyway you are going to prefer a gas car for those rare long trips, and so lack of charging infrastructure doesn&#x27;t mean as much. This of course means more demand for electric car charging stations over gas stations and the effect can snowball into gas not being viable to use for long trips in China.<p>The above is speculation of course. It seems reasonable, but only time will tell.')
