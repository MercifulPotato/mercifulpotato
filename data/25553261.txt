Over achievers donâ€™t need to redefine a problem set to  more narrowly qualify their performance.<p>For example an expert JavaScript developer can quickly produce an MVP with an original code solution. A less competent (confident) developer might also be able to produce a similar MVP but only in certain contexts, such as requiring a particular framework. The less competent developer may refer to themselves as an expert developer in React, or whatever other framework, but in doing so redefines the problem to fit a more narrow context not immediately aligned to the product.')
