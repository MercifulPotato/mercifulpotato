It seems like a bit of a slippery slope towards losing track of what&#x27;s happening. I have been tempted to write things like below because I really just need it for the print.<p><pre><code>    f&quot;Info print for item  {hex(do_some_parsing(do_some_conversion(value)))}&quot;\n</code></pre>\nWhich runs perfectly fine, but at least on my editor syntax highlighting stops working as it is all part of the string. And with that it becomes increasingly hard to work out what is actually being called. Now I resolved myself to pretty much just have one function call and no nesting. Things like f&quot;{str.lower()}&quot; or f&quot;{hex(value)}&quot; are great and I use them a lot.')
