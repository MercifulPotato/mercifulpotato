Item(by='esprehn', descendants=None, kids=[24662304, 24664359], score=None, time=1601624684, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24659506, text='&lt;style scoped&gt; was a very interesting idea, in practice it had a number of issues though like poor fallback (the styles become global in browsers without support which breaks pages) and implementation complexity because the root of a tree no longer defines the styles.<p>There were other reasons at the time as well, as mentioned in the linked email: the feature wasn&#x27;t owned, wasn&#x27;t shipping in any browser, and was making it difficult to improve the Shadow DOM styling system which was shipped already.<p>That was also a long time ago, and I think browsers and standards groups have learned a lot about designing features to be backwards compatible and how to avoid certain implementation complexities.')
