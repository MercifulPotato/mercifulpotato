For example, abridging a company&#x27;s right to not &quot;associate&quot; with minorities&#x2F;gays&#x2F;etc, i.e. their right to not serve them, is not anti-liberty. If the goal is maximizing liberty, it takes targeted regulation to achieve the maximal state. Ensuring everyone can participate in the economic and social infrastructure is a feature of maximizing liberty<p>I didn&#x27;t realize that I needed to specify that this didn&#x27;t apply to protected classes[0].  I assumed that was understood, but I guess not.<p>Yes, there are a number of groups (see link) which individuals and businesses are barred from discriminating against.  But in this circumstance, that&#x27;s irrelevant.<p>Because political affiliation is <i>not</i> a protected class under federal law, and even where it is (CA, NY and a few other states) that <i>only</i> applies to employment issues, not business-to-business contracts&#x2F;transactions.<p>The right to political association has <i>never</i> been abridged, nor should it be.  Any suggestion otherwise is, as I said, anti-liberty and anti-democratic.<p>Political choice is a bedrock principle of our system.  And <i>forcing</i> anyone to support a political viewpoint they do not wish to support violates both settled constitutional law and the ideals of a free society.<p>Nitpick about protected groups if you like, but there&#x27;s no &quot;there&quot; there.<p>The law is the law.  We are a nation of laws.  We are <i>not</i> a nation of &quot;do what hackinthebochs wants.&quot;<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Protected_group" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Protected_group</a>')
