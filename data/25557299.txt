If you tell the kernel you want to send a packet to ::ffff:1.2.3.4, you&#x27;re actually telling it you want to send a (v4!) packet to 1.2.3.4, you&#x27;re just doing it using an AF_INET6 socket rather than an AF_INET one.<p>Since packets aren&#x27;t APIs, you should never see ::ffff:0:0&#x2F;96 in packets on the wire. A v6-only host can&#x27;t use this prefix to send v4 packets to v4 hosts.<p>(What would the source address of those packets even be?)')
