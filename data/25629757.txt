Who is going to constantly ping the server for up to date ephemerides every 30 seconds when the GPS chip can give you them for free?<p>I agree with the general point you&#x27;re making, but this is wrong. The main benefit to getting ephemerides data is to get reasonably up-to-date orbital paths, you don&#x27;t need it every 30 seconds.<p>The GPS device needs to project future paths anyway up to 30 seconds into the future even in the best-case scenario, so it&#x27;s already making predictions based on past data.<p>The devices in question were already caching this data for days or weeks. It only became a problem when the server-side data was wrongly generated for whatever reason.')
