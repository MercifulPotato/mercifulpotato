One interesting thing is that the whole modern approach to immutable data structures seems so wasteful to me now. C++ you literally take strings and overwrite characters, where now people duplicate lists of records just to stay clean.<p>Once you have the discipline you need in C++ to make mutable data structures work its a hugely efficient place to be. However I sleep much better in the non-C++ world.')
