In the test, we compared the timestamps of performed operations, and checked to confirm that the operations happened in sequence based on their timestamp (I&#x27;m sure many of you see where this is going). On Windows, the timestamp for all the actions was exactly the same, so when sorted, the actions appeared out-of-order. It was then that I discovered Python&#x27;s time library on Windows only reports times with a resolution of ~1ms, whereas on Linux the same code reports times with a resolution of ~10us. That one was actually super fun to track down, but super disappointing to discover it&#x27;s not something that&#x27;s easily remedied.<p>(For those about to suggest how it should have been done, the application also stored an atomic revision counter, so the unit test was switched to that instead of a timestamp.)')
