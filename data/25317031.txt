Prior to Python type annotation, at a previous job, someone commented that Python didn&#x27;t scale not because of performance, but because as you add more and more developers to a complex codebase, the lack of type safety ad growing codebase made safe changes hard.<p>Over in Java, a lot of the language changes are just syntactic sugar to make Java less verbose. Granted, Jigsaw is an exception, and JVM enhancements are good for everyone.')
