Of course I immediately created a Pop! partition and started installing stuff. I tried Doom Eternal... and it was running extremely slow for what you&#x27;d expect from a RTX 2080. Surely enough, I switched to my Windows 10 partition and the game ran smooth like butter over there. I spent some time looking at the issue but couldn&#x27;t figure it out.<p>I decided to love back to Windows for the time being, enjoy the laptop and try again later on.')
