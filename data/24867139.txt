So you have granted tenure (and pensions and retirement) to people who are gonna seek it for longer than you thought they would so you don’t have place and money for younger people. The same thing applies in the job market, where there is literally no place for someone hired in the last decade or two to grow in management because no one above them in the hierarchy is retiring. Then you have government jobs that are paying out pensions for way longer than anyone expected them to.<p>Over and above this the the government will not dare to cut any policies that would adversely affect old people because they are the only age cohort that votes reliably. What they will try and do is mess around with social security, which, ironically, is one of the few programs that both predicted the baby boomer issues and accordingly created a trust fund to handle that and is actually paid for.<p>All these costs are being picked up by younger generations and all they get in return are the olds complaining about why they can’t just do a part time job to pay for their college degrees like they did in the 60s (nvm that the changing pricing and salaries mean students today could work multiple full time jobs and not be able to pay their college tuition without loans while the boomers complaining could pay their college fees with their weekend burger flipping positions with no debt).')
