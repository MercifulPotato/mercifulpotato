Look at any other non-conical thread, like for garden hoses or fire hoses. The thread doesn&#x27;t even get wet. All of the vitamix machines I&#x27;ve seen let pulverized food collect in the threads and quickly begin to smell terrible, because the rubber seal is at the base of the male side rather than the base of the female side.')
