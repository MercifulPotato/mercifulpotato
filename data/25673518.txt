Resource constraints were also an issue back then, as well as a client-first approach.  Most large mail servers only had enough resources to run the IMAP and POP services themselves; adding search index maintenance would have overloaded their CPUs.  (Not that they couldn&#x27;t have added more CPU, but this was all pre-cloud.)')
