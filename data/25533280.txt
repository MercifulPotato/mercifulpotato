All answers that you put in the first category are people answering the wrong question, that nobody actually here asked. They are answering the question &quot;what was the thing that lots of other people liked, that <i>I</i> also liked&quot;, as if their opinion is somehow special here, on a semi-anonymous forum, where visitors don&#x27;t recognize most other visitors. And since it isn&#x27;t, their opinion is just one of the data-points in the &quot;people, that liked product X&quot; dataset. And people, who upvoted their posts also upvote something they like. And since things, that are liked and endorsed by a lot of people, but that are not worth the attention (in your opinion) you call &quot;overhyped&quot;, it is pretty much by definition that the top answers to <i>that</i> question (which nobody asked) would be a collection of overhyped things.<p>The answers from the second category are answers to the question that OP actually asked: what are the things that were hyped prior to their release (or shortly after) and didn&#x27;t disappoint. Unlike the first question, this can be answered somewhat objectively, because it&#x27;s not about the opinion of some semi-anonymous HN user anymore, it&#x27;s about things that are hyped before the release and having impact after. You personally may not like the original iPhone, but you&#x27;ll have to admit that the early hype didn&#x27;t really fade â€” maybe it&#x27;s a shitty product in your opinion, but it did conquer the market. And even if people are answering&#x2F;upvoting <i>that</i> based on subjective feelings, in the end it&#x27;s still turns out to be a somewhat fair assessment of the topic: because a product was hyped before the release a long time ago (well, not M1) and enough people still can vouch that it &quot;lived up to the hype&quot;. That&#x27;s impact.<p>Exceptions here are Apple Watch and Ruby on Rails, because they received some, uh, prenatal hype,  but let&#x27;s be honest: Apple Watch doesn&#x27;t have nearly the amount of adoption iPhone had, and while Ruby on Rails was quite a significant thing at some point of time, it isn&#x27;t anymore, other frameworks and languages filled the domain and now it&#x27;s just &quot;one of them&quot; at best.')
