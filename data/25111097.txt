The value is in the content, not the paper and ink.&quot;</i><p>Physical books do actually matter to a lot of people, especially if these books have a history.<p>In fact, books are really no different than any other physical item in this respect, and their ability to be digitized does not decrease their value as physical objects in the slightest.<p>There was an interesting Radiolab episode called <i>&quot;Things&quot;</i>[1] about exactly this.  I&#x27;d recommend listening to if if you&#x27;re interested in what makes things with a history valuable.<p>[1] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wnycstudios.org&#x2F;podcasts&#x2F;radiolab&#x2F;episodes&#x2F;things" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wnycstudios.org&#x2F;podcasts&#x2F;radiolab&#x2F;episodes&#x2F;thing...</a>')
