There were some Indian IT outsourcing firms that promoted people to higher roles for EB-1 GC purposes and then demoted them after they got GCs. Thousands of people got it(thanks to mind boggling levels of office politics), now the EB-1 queue is flooded due to his abuse(fraud?). EB-1 used to be current, now the wait is again in a few years(&lt;10).<p>Part of the problem here seems to be at least to some extent everyone(us Indians) flooding these queue&#x27;s while native population keeping these quotas fixed(to control they don&#x27;t change their society too much).<p>One also needs to realize there will always be limits to these things. Now given every one wants to come to US, they can&#x27;t accommodate everyone. There will be limits. Limits to number of H1B&#x27;s, limit to yearly GCs. What should the limit be? 6K, 60K, 600K? How much?<p>Imagine India doing this. We recently passed laws to restrict immigration. For some reasons we expect to shut doors to everyone, while simultaneously expecting the whole world roll out red carpets for us.')
