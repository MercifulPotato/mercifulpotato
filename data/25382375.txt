It could be <i>relatively</i> benign, but we&#x27;re painting ourselves into a corner in terms of long-term management with our current rate of plastic production.<p>* Plastic is a petrochemical product. Like all petrochemical products its <i>extraction</i> and <i>production</i> steps are environmentally devastating, even if the end material is relatively inert. We also like to produce it in countries with poor environmental and safety controls.<p>* Current policies for managing plastic waste fall into two categories: we either put it in a hole and forget about it (see the long tail point above) or we externalize it to a significantly poorer country for &quot;recycling&quot; (read: dumping into waterways, burning as trash, putting in their own holes in the ground). The former is an unknown, the later is bad and unsustainable.')
