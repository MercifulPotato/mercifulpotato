Item(by='simias', descendants=None, kids=[25487112, 25486108, 25486002], score=None, time=1608468138, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25485308, text='&gt;And clearly upvote&#x2F;downvote system didn&#x27;t happen by an accident, it&#x27;s there for a reason.<p>This system has been corrupted on websites like reddit to become a &quot;like&quot; system, but outside of very divisive political topics it still works mostly as intended on HN: they moderate bad contributions, not stuff people disagree with.<p>You can actually observe this in this very thread so far: while people express opposite viewpoints at this moment none of the comment are in the negative. I&#x27;m sure that on Reddit the hivemind would&#x27;ve decided what the Right Opinion(tm) would be and people disagreeing would be sitting at -200 comment score.<p>Maybe the system could be pushed further and hide the scores even for your own comments though, removing all gamification. I don&#x27;t know if it would improve things but I&#x27;d be curious to see how it would impact the quality of the discourse.<p>&gt;otherwise, why are you replying to strangers that you are unlikely to ever meet or speak to again?<p>I mean even on forums&#x2F;mailing lists&#x2F;newsgroups&#x2F;BBSs&#x2F;imageboards without scoring system (or even publicly identifiable accounts) people would do the same thing, so I think that you overestimate the influence of the scoring system. I guess the closest equivalent on these other forums in general is getting &quot;replies&quot;, i.e. engagement with your content, which I suppose is what we really crave in the end. We want people to listen to us.<p>Beyond that HN does have a few huge quality advantages over other social media. A big one is that the focus is still on textual content, not images and videos which means that you have to take some time to digest every story instead of mindlessly scrolling through the main page one gif at a time.')
