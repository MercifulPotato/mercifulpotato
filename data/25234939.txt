(You can check this using archive.org - I don&#x27;t have the link readily at hand, unfortunately)<p>* Yes, PPE was a concern but also it was thought that there is no spread without symptoms initially. Which was the main reason why masks were not recommended for the wider population:<p><pre><code>   * non-respirators don&#x27;t really *protect* the wearer\n   * respirators like N95 do but PPE is in short suply\n   * if you have symptoms, wearing a mask helps, sure, but best to fully isolate as much as possible.\n</code></pre>\n* Opinion largely changed due to incoming evidence of presymptomatic spread - and yes, some campaigning by various groups like masks4all.<p>I&#x27;m sure there were some people and groups that connected the PPE and &quot;masks don&#x27;t work and thats why they are not recommended&quot; but it was certainly not a blatant lie - it was really thought they wouldn&#x27;t help and isolation for the infected is much better. With presymptomatic (and therefore possibly asymptomatic) spread and the realization of millions infected everywhere, everyone wearing masks became a viable option.<p>Aerosols are a whole other topic I won&#x27;t get into (and I don&#x27;t really have the expertise for it either!) but suffice to say from my understanding its not really as simple as &quot;works&quot; &#x2F; &quot;doesn&#x27;t work&quot;.<p>Yes there is a problem with science failing us here as well, as the bar for evidence is simply set too high and the processes are too slow to deal with a pandemic. This is true for medications too...')
