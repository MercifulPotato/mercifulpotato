I imagine we are at an all-time high for number of people feeling depressed this year due to the pandemic.<p>Throughout history, pretty much everyone belonged to some sort of community. Your neighbors, your fellow workers, your whole town if it was small enough. Us tech workers often work remotely, and even those in offices aren&#x27;t getting enough human interaction.<p>The biggest thing to combat this is to get out into the real world and be around other people, but we can&#x27;t do this right now, so we need to bide our time. The world has changed drastically and it&#x27;s likely there will be some long term changes as a result, but it&#x27;s important that when it is safe to do so, we try to resume our social lives. It&#x27;s important for our health and for our humanity.')
