I’ve seen this happen when your department is the object of derision from other departments. Ie when IT is treated as a cost sector. This is a huge red light and a reason to run for the hills. Perhaps the nice option is it’s just your immediate management who’s overreacting and switching teams can make it better. But I file this combination as a grave condition to avoid at all costs')
