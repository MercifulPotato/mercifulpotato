A good way to understand it is that if two different colors have the same lightness (or hue, or saturation) in some color space, that &quot;predicts&quot; that they will be perceived to have the same lightness as well. It&#x27;s impossible to get these predictions exactly right (in part because actual perception depends on so many variables), but some can be better than others.<p>Another useful function of a color space is to predict the threshold of when two similar colors are just barely perceptibly different.')
