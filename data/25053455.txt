For instance, in this story I learned that some people can down-vote, and a lot of work is done in the background to keep goofballs like me from derailing things.<p>I too would like to thank the moderators.<p>Further, and more interestingly to me, I learn that HN is written in a LISP variant called ARC... I&#x27;ve never understood LISP, and especially never thought that anything useful could be built with it... at least at the subconscious level, yet I know AutoCad and Emacs are built around it. I have similar feelings about Prolog, which I tried once and just didn&#x27;t grok.<p>Is there an IDE for lisp?')
