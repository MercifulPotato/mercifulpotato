There&#x27;s been a lot more &quot;commenting without reading the article&quot; here recently than in the past. So when someone comments on an article without anything in the comment that refers back to the article and merely offers the exact advice that was in the article without further analysis or insight:<p>1. That gives the appearance of a user who hasn&#x27;t read the article<p>2. Even if the user did read the article I&#x27;m not sure what their comment adds to discussion of the article. For comparison, imagine participating in a conversation with a few friends in real life, friend X says &quot;It&#x27;s a good idea to write tests for your code,&quot; then friend Y replies &quot;It&#x27;s a good idea to write tests for your code.&quot; Usually the way people discuss things is to reply or offer addendums to the original idea. It&#x27;s not a rule, it&#x27;s just good conversation.')
