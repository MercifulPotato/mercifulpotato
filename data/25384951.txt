I work in such a company and they are always looking for one and only one vendor for their millions of PCs. It used to be Dell, now HP but they completely outsource procurement, maintenance, repairs and disposal of the computers to that one full-service provider.<p>Apple wouldn&#x27;t be considered because they don&#x27;t offer this full-spectrum service.')
