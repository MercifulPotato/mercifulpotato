You&#x27;re talking about glyphs that are composed of multiple unicode codepoints; my earlier comment is true of single codepoints only.  The comment I was responding to is also talking only about single codepoints (wcspbrk cannot represent delimiters longer than a single codepoint).<p>On joiners &#x2F; combining characters: I&#x27;d encourage using composed normalization (NFC) rather than decomposed normalization (NFD).<p>Just curiosity: are there any glyphs that lack a single codepoint representation, where one of the joined codepoints is an ASCII character?  (That only helps after normalization, of course.)')
