I wouldn&#x27;t say Grin is dead, the early years were designed to be tough on the price. There&#x27;s definitely places where it can improve, especially in the usability. I know that Grin can do a few tricks e.g. accumulate the kernels into a single point after they have been validated, the caveat though is that this does not improve initial sync and a node doing so can&#x27;t seed new nodes. But it allows for running a fully validating node on a mobile for many years.<p>Could you explain a bit the Zcash scalability improvements?')
