Seriously, just look at the docs, it&#x27;s pages upon pages of complex behavior. Some of it fairly unintuitive.<p>It took me days to dive in, get used to it and kind of know what I was doing, and then promptly forget everything about I knew over the months&#x2F;years.<p>Everytime I have to dive into the webpack related config, I basically set aside a whole and feel a deep sense of dread. This isn&#x27;t normal.<p>Also, Webpack has horrible UX. At first I thought that was because it&#x27;s complicated and covers a difficult problem space. But then I used parcel, which is leagues better in terms of usability. I absolutely love parcel and think it&#x27;s so much better overall. Unfortunately, their team is much smaller and much less used so webpack is a couple more features that make it more &quot;stable&quot;. Well actually, it goes both ways, but most of the time parcel has some very small error that webpack might not.<p>Whic is why I basically run both at the same time - parcel for it&#x27;s speed and ease of use, webpack to catch a lot of errors (like those outputted by ts) that for some reason parcel (1.x at least, I think 2.x is coming soon) doesn&#x27;t catch.')
