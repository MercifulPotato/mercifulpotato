Item(by='_huayra_', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608491199, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25487420, text='{part 2}<p>It really breaks my heart in these comments when people say they&#x27;d encourage their daughters to engage in sex work if they chose it (or, on the opposite side of the coin, encourage their sons to hire prostitutes or explore their sexuality through isolated encounters with algorithmically suggested, endlessly-streaming high-def porn videos). These activities have serious consequences on one&#x27;s future due to social stigma (for engaging in sex work) or one&#x27;s social growth &#x2F; personal development due to neuroanatomical changes (primarily men, but women as well I&#x27;d venture). Whereas my Irish Catholic ancestors avoided broaching the subject through religious damnation and even more extreme social stigma, it feels like the version of this non-conversation that is had under the guise of &quot;free sexuality&quot;, i.e. &quot;just explore your sexual urges on your own I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll figure it out&quot;, is equally problematic. The pendulum has swung too far from overbearing guidance to absolutely none at all (and, in fact, encouragement). In the middle is where the conversations should be had. The conversation has to be based in reality, i.e. that actions have consequences (social stigma of sex work or the rewiring of one&#x27;s brain to hypernormal stimuli during formative years), that everyone has a complex web of feelings, and that understanding how those feelings and emotions involving one&#x27;s sex life is very important for long-term fulfillment.<p>As I think we both agree, the best decisions and interactions are made when all parties involved are made fully aware of the benefits and consequences of each course of action. Pretending that sexuality is an exception to this is unwise at best.<p>I understand that a lot of the most inspiring people in the world were the ones who had a vision of a better reality and brought it into being (Ghandi, MLK, both Roosevelt presidents, Nelson Mandela, Steve Jobs, etc), but encouraging kids to take that path when it goes against social stigma and neuroscience in regards to human sexuality will almost certainly not result in their success.')
