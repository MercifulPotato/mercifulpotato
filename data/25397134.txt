Make it impossible to vote multiple times&#x2F;places, or as someone else. Invalidate registration [6] for , and immediately flag when, a dead person tries to vote. Make it so you can instantaneously see that your vote was entered and confirm it to help with the anomaly detection. I think this is what everyone wants, and I think it would appease many worries. Unfortunately, this would almost certainly require voter ID, which has mixed popularity, and a reporting system, which requires tech, which the governments lowest bidder mentality appears to be wholly incapable of.<p>Additionally, harden these electronic voting machines, which have had constant press about their vulnerable for the last two decades [1][2][3][4]. Open source the software stack. Even simple, human, steps like each person  puts a provided penny into the machine, so counts can be correlated, would be an improvement and add a real world aspect that people could personally understand, over the counter in memory that has no traceability.<p>The thing that I find most frustrating part about all of this is the perspective. Rather than silencing talk about fraud, hoping it will go away, we should tackle the reality of it and ask why people distrust the voting system, and find real world solutions, to increase that trust. The fact that every election before this one ended with sensational headlines of examples of voter fraud, but this year it&#x27;s journalistic silence and social taboo, probably doesn&#x27;t help (as insignificant as those previous stories were).<p>[1] 2018: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scientificamerican.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;the-vulnerabilities-of-our-voting-machines&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scientificamerican.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;the-vulnerabiliti...</a><p>[2] 2015: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arstechnica.com&#x2F;tech-policy&#x2F;2015&#x2F;04&#x2F;meet-the-e-voting-machine-so-easy-to-hack-it-will-take-your-breath-away&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arstechnica.com&#x2F;tech-policy&#x2F;2015&#x2F;04&#x2F;meet-the-e-votin...</a><p>[3] 2010: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.texastribune.org&#x2F;2010&#x2F;10&#x2F;22&#x2F;e-voting-suit-reveals-frailties-of-the-ballot-box&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.texastribune.org&#x2F;2010&#x2F;10&#x2F;22&#x2F;e-voting-suit-reveal...</a><p>[4] 2004: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2004&#x2F;01&#x2F;29&#x2F;technology&#x2F;security-poor-in-electronic-voting-machines-study-warns.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2004&#x2F;01&#x2F;29&#x2F;technology&#x2F;security-poor-...</a><p>[5] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.city-journal.org&#x2F;html&#x2F;how-steal-election-12824.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.city-journal.org&#x2F;html&#x2F;how-steal-election-12824.h...</a>')
