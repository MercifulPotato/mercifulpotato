When I&#x27;m at at a fast-food restaurant, I can usually pour myself a little to try first, and then mix in some unsweet tea if it&#x27;s overly sweet. If it&#x27;s undersweetened, then I usually just toss it and get a soda. It really would be nice if you could do something similar with boba tea, but I understand that the way it&#x27;s made doesn&#x27;t facilitate that.')
