The source dataset lets those inferences or joins be tied back to the original identifying data.<p>The main point is that de-identified data can still be &quot;personal&quot; so it&#x27;s regulated. If you share or make public psuedonymous data, that data is still covered by GDPR so you have to inform the individuals, have a legal basis (such as consent), let them opt out (if applicable), etc. Even if it&#x27;s been pseudonymized, I would want to know if&#x2F;when my data is sold to a marketing firm or whatever.')
