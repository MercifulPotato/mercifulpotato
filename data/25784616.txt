It&#x27;s being used to shore up the holes that AGPL doesn&#x27;t cover[1], to enable the business model of &quot;free for small guys, paid for by the big guys&quot;.<p>People want a license that says something like, &quot;you can only use this if you also contribute to the commons, or if you pay for the privilege not to&quot;. SSPL is an attempt to be that. Maybe it doesn&#x27;t do that job well, but don&#x27;t confuse it as competing with permissive licenses.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;writing.kemitchell.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;11&#x2F;04&#x2F;Copyleft-Bust-Up.html#bounty" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;writing.kemitchell.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;11&#x2F;04&#x2F;Copyleft-Bust-Up.h...</a>')
