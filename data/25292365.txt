I&#x27;m not saying this is entirely good&#x2F;correct, but I am saying you misstate the message.<p>&gt; just look at the lack of respect for work that doesn&#x27;t make money<p>This conflates individual value with societal&#x2F;communal. But why should anyone give a dam about stuff that doesn&#x27;t benefit them? To be clear, I&#x27;m not saying people <i>shouldn&#x27;t</i> give a damn, I saying why <i>couldn&#x27;t</i> they i.e. why should they be forced if they choose not to.<p>There&#x27;s also a nuance to value: Capitalism determines value on the basis on what money people are willing to spend. Firstly, if people go out of there way to ensure money is not involved with something, don&#x27;t be surprised if it&#x27;s value is miscalculated by a capitalist system: this is like not winning a competition you never entered. That said, the economic impact of packaging is undervalued because no one is attaching an accurate debt&#x2F;penalty to it, which is arguably the real problem here.<p>Secondly, there is a notion that things of value create &quot;market demand&quot;, so if little money is offered for something, then market doesn&#x27;t want it, and people supplying it are refusing to offer what society actually wants. I think this makes sense: people have children even though parental benefits might be low suggesting they aren&#x27;t really doing it for society, though I&#x27;ve discussed this before: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24423077" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24423077</a><p>TLDR: Capitalism only deals with societal value; so it only determines your value (of actions, say) on the basis of value to society. People are free to value things outside that system; If you think &quot;people don&#x27;t care about X&quot; because &quot;people don&#x27;t provide money for X&quot; then it is <i>you</i> declaring the value of something to be its dollar amount.')
