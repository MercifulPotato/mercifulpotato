As you say, you cannot really tweak much once the wall is done. In a day and age where electrical devices continue to multiply, it&#x27;s sadistic to bang on about extender-cords being &quot;fire hazards&quot; while not providing alternatives. You don&#x27;t want fire hazards? Give me a way to safely upgrade the energy distribution of my home that is as easy as plugging in an extender cord.<p>Glad someone else is sharing my views. Burying cables into physical fixtures that cannot be accessed any other way than brute force is, I find, completely archaic. The solution is modular home design. Houses should be built more like gaming PCs in a way. Every wall would be 4-5ft thick, be mostly empty on the inside, and have a special door to allow a human to go inside. This &quot;closet inside a wall&quot; would contain standardized \nplugs&#x2F;hooks&#x2F;supports for electrical cables (along with plumbing and gas lines and internet fiber and any kind of wire or pipe that passes through the home). Load bearing would still be assumed by columns and other hard elements, but hidden inside these 5ft thick walls.')
