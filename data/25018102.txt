The House majority is smaller. So his mandate is effectively toast. Another interesting historical fact. America has never elected 4 consecutive 2 term presidents. If Trump would have been elected it would have been the first time in US history that this has happened. This election wasn&#x27;t a blue wave by any means, Trump underperformed House Republicans in many swing states implying this was more of a personal decision rather than political.<p>What do I see changing? Not much:<p><pre><code>  - foreign policy: policy changes with Syria and Iran\n\n  - China: An end to tariffs\n\n  - local changes: No more federal opposition to safe injection sites in San Francisco\n\n  - federal taxes could still go up, the Senate has two liberal Republicans who could deliver tax increases to Joe\n  \n  - expanded federal regulations that do not require changes to the law\n</code></pre>\nWhat will likely not happen:<p><pre><code>  - PR and DC becoming states is no longer plausible\n\n  - packing the Supreme Court is no longer plausible\n\n  - a green new deal or expansions to entitlements are no longer plausible\n\n  - state bailouts are now in question, which could force major structural reforms</code></pre>')
