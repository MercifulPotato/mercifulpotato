People share news stories as if they are true, with context often omitted,  manipulated or outright fabricated. But people still trust their news.<p>CNN, NYT, Washington Post, HuffPost, Vox, Fox News turned into extremely biased sources of disinformation and blatant propaganda.<p>E.g. a fabricated story in The Atlantic magazine,  citing anonymous sources, was repeated and amplified by all these major media hubs and then further by social media for weeks. It&#x27;s like a giant wave after wave of misinformation and rumors presented as facts. The burden of evidence apparently no longer applies.<p>The bias is mostly on the left wing of political spectrum, but the right wing are not too far behind.')
