A normal general AI strategy is to try to increase the number of future options, it doesn&#x27;t really plan it just makes choices which gives it more choices in the near future.<p>For humans it can be things like going to college, getting a computer science degree opens a lot of door so it is good even if you don&#x27;t plan to do anything specific. Similarly as a company founder you can just try to do things opening doors, like Google focused on making a great search engine because they believed that having the best search engine would make all other aspects of the company easy.<p>You could say that focusing on areas which will give you more options in the future is a plan, but I don&#x27;t think that most people see it that way. For example when you ask a kid why they go to college and they answer &quot;I don&#x27;t know what I want to do, I&#x27;ll just study something interesting and see where it leads&quot; you&#x27;d typically not say they have a plan. Yet many of them still go on to get valuable degrees and succeed in getting a much better job than the average person.')
