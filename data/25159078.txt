Let&#x27;s say it&#x27;s Le Roux. <i>So what?</i> First, he is in jail, which is more that we can say about a lot of other Criminal Lords. Second, having a bitcoin stash does not get him out of there. Third, even if you pull the &quot;he can use his stash to order bad things to happen&quot; argument you know that the same thing would be true if he was in control of a gold stash or a Swiss account. Lastly, even if managed to get out and managed to prove that he was Satoshi, he would not be a leader of a &quot;new world order&quot; were his ethics and morality would suddenly be glorified.<p>Also, you confusing Bitcoin with crypto leads to the interesting position where you sound both as a Bitcoin maxi and a Buttcoiner. Case in point: if you are right about &quot;small cluster of criminals owning a lot of Bitcoin&quot;, there will be no need to &quot;fight for scraps of the chain&quot;. What will happen is simply is that those will start using another chain. When Tether does go out in flames (which I am with you and I hope they do as soon as possible), Ethereum will go on. Fuck, even if you are against ETH you can still use ETC, so where is the part that people are being forced to adopt one chain over another?<p>To sum up: don&#x27;t throw the baby with the bathwater. It&#x27;s not because Bitcoin <i>at this point in time</i> has a lot of issues that crypto&#x2F;blockchain should be considered &quot;all hot garbage&quot;. Your attitude is reactionary and leaves no room for any kind of change.')
