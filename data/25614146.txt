This is not as acute in tech but the situation in tech is not good either.<p>- Startups are chronically poor. There is little investment in startups and it&#x27;s hard to secure it. If you are involved with a small startup it&#x27;s likely it has existed for 5+ years and it has never had a round of more than â‚¬100k.<p>- Companies can&#x27;t just compete with each other here the way they do in the US. There are a number of EU laws that limit job mobility and competition, which mostly affect tech &#x2F; engineering &#x2F; insert qualified trade. This is an issue for companies and workers.<p>- Salaries are low when compared to rent and property prices.<p>Feel free to avoid the EU vs US salary conversation. As a developer in the uglier side of the EU I know experienced developers in the not-so-well-off states of the US are doing way better than experienced developers in the not-so-well-off countries of the EU.')
