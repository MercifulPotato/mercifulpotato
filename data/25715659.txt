A huge portion of the &quot;miraculous&quot; returns come from the fact that this fictional person was able to put an entire year&#x27;s worth of salary into the market in one go, 50 years ago.  In 1970 the average salary was about $6,000, but he managed to save one third each year to invest?<p>So, sure it demonstrates the power of compounding.  But, to me, an alternative lesson is that you can be an incredibly diligent saver and, through sheer bad luck, have barely enough to retire.  I mean, it&#x27;s not like $1MM in retirement money means &quot;set for life&quot; anymore.')
