The idea of cutting headcount is a fallacy.  In small shops the guy that was managing on-prem infrastructure is now doing that (because it turns out you still need switches and phones and routers and firewalls even if you host things in AWS) as well as managing the AWS infrastructure.  In large shops you&#x27;re typically replacing &quot;cheap&quot; headcount (the guy who racked servers) with someone significantly more expensive (a team of cloud architects).')
