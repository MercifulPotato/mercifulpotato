This one would be much more like the old factory workers banding together. The people at Amazon make far less than the people at google and often don&#x27;t have the luxury to think about &quot;societal concerns&quot; they just want to put food on the table. I think all around it&#x27;s good, but this would be a much different type of union and probably better be much larger or it will get squashed quickly')
