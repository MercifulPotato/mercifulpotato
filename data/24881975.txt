That is news to me like the number of cyborg street thugs and automatic weapon proliferation. Jokes aside it is a Texas Sharpshooter fallacy and more something that one can look back on and find resemblances by comparision like say Star Trek and Tricorders vs cell phones and replicators vs 3d printing.<p>I don&#x27;t think that is a difference on solarpunk&#x27;s part though. One thing that became more and more explicit with cyberpunk was that the &quot;independence from society&quot; was fundamentally a lie the &quot;fringer&quot; told themself because they broke into offices and factories for money instead of working in them and obeyed laws only when the barrel of a gun was staring them down but fundamentally they were just as much as an interchangeable cog as everybody else. Getting over that delusion could be considered a painful step forward as they need either steps towards truer independence or move to try to change what they don&#x27;t like about society. They don&#x27;t have to be subservient proles by any means but well the first step to solving a problem is recognition.')
