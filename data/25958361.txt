If you&#x27;re civil, respectful, and on-topic you&#x27;re seemingly allowed to present just about any idea.<p>Absolutely, and it’s an excellent principle! Notably, however, HN <i>does</i> restrict what types of <i>stories</i> can be submitted, which has much the same effect of limiting what &quot;ideas can be presented&quot; (particularly when combined with an expectation to stay on topic).<p>To me, the difference is that HN isn’t trying to be a one-stop destination for all of your communication, whereas Facebook absolutely is.<p>Which is to say, I agree that complete free speech on any individual website is impossible without it devolving into a hellscape, so the best way to support free speech on a <i>societal</i> level is to have a diversity of social networks, instead of a handful of major platforms.<p>And we&#x27;re failing at the diversity part.')
