Suspicious users are highly punished (in the real life examples, often violently) and quickly removed from the network.<p>Obviously can be gamed like any other system, but would be much harder to do so and you can leverage the vouch&#x2F;invite graph to detect trusted users that are highly connected to suspicious ones.<p>Surely there&#x27;s something like this out there, though? Or is this just not a valuable business problem to solve?')
