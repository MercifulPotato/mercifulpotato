As stated at the beginning, the project is still WIP, and I didn&#x27;t expect it to end on HN. Sorry for the lack of documentation and convincing example for now !<p>The post is intended to present the ideas and let people look at the repo, but while the core language is rather complete, a lot of small but important things are still missing to make it usable right now. I sidestepped this issue to still be able to illustrate some points with simple examples.<p>To answer your questions:<p>- numToStr would be either in a standard library, or implemented here using standard library functions. It does not exist currently<p>- the fact that the urls are non empty could be either enforced by the contract itself (ie use a NonEmptyUrl contract). Or you could combine a NonEmptyStr and a Url contract via merging. By default, things with a contract without a default must be present.<p>- I&#x27;m not sure I fully understand your last point, but I don&#x27;t think a configuration file could &quot;redefine&quot; a function in any meaningful way. Say you write a program &quot;main.ncl&quot;, which import some external downloaded source, check it against a contract you&#x27;ve written, and generate a config accordingly. Since the language is pure and variable are lexically scoped, nothing from an import could redefine anything in your current scope, be it your contracts or your functions.')
