I don&#x27;t mean normal conspiracy theories like there being something more behind the JFK assassination, but like QAnon, Bill Gates injecting people with microchips, Pizzagate, etc. A lot of people in my own family in a rather backwards state believe that stuff. It&#x27;s making me completely lose faith in this country and I&#x27;m seriously considering getting out because of this widespread idiocy.<p>How do you even begin to &quot;meet in the middle&quot; or have reasonable conversations with people who believe in that stuff?<p>edit: Don&#x27;t really understand why this was de-nested from the original parent comment down to the third-fourth page :&#x2F;')
