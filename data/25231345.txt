BW is governed by the greens. You know what counties get the highest CDU vote in elections? It&#x27;s not in the south, it&#x27;s in Niedersachsen (Cloppenburg etc.).<p>2. Switzerland has different cantons which are very different. I live in the French part where the average person speaks three languages and 40% are foreigners.<p>3. I can totally understand swiss&#x27; people wish to be separate, this has resulted in them having by FAR higher living standards than other Europeans. Salaries are TWICE as high while taxes are TWICE as low. I&#x27;m underestimating that by the way. In the meantime Europe has fucked themselves with the Euro and massive migration which has depressed wages, good luck dealing with that.<p>4. There is HUGE amounts of funding compared to Germany. I&#x27;m in the process of that right now and it&#x27;s kind of insane how many different options are for getting 5-6 digit sums. Got approved for 100k last week and applying for more.')
