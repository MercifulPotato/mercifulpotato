For example, an individual will state that &quot;if you don&#x27;t support Black lives, unfriend me&quot;. I fail to find fault with that. Can you explain why it is problematic for someone to want to distance themselves socially from people that are opting-in to oppose a modern civil rights movement? I would certainly do the same with anyone who opposed the right of Women to vote, or gay people to marry.')
