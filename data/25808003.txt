In the end, they&#x27;ll conclude that BigTech is so huge that only they are the rightful arbiters of an app store, hence we&#x27;ll not see a breakup or any disciplinary action on them soon.<p>It&#x27;s already too late for a competing app store to develop, but now is the time for government to actually hold its nose and protect the small players. Else why bother with the charade of Free Speech and governmental sovereignty, when both of those will be controlled by tech platforms in proxy?')
