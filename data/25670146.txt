Whether you agree&#x2F;disagree with this, that&#x27;s for another thread. Point is, we&#x27;re printing money.<p>If you&#x27;re familiar with inflation, stop here. Obviously the country and the world are not producing nor consuming at the same level. Thusly at an extremely extremely simplistic level, we&#x27;re not creating more &quot;intrinsic&quot; value, but adding more printed money to represent that &quot;intrinsic&quot; value. Each dollar now has less &quot;intrinsic&quot; value. (this is over simplified to the n-th degree).<p>This is the basis for inflation. Any unstable country would have seen hyper inflation given these numbers. So, the parent comment is alluding to this... eventually production has to catch up or inflation will.')
