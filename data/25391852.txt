(generators, lamps, etc.)<p>+ 10 hours covers up a good day in field.<p>- a lot of farms are away from electricity sources to charge and sometimes internet connection is non-existent. It is risky to leave a 50k machine on its own to do its job. And what to do if battery runs out on the field?<p>- how long does it take to recharge? A lot of farmers will not have fast charges on their farm.')
