Apple is a hardware company, so making it difficult to run their OS in the cloud means more people need to keep buying their hardware. Microsoft has their own cloud, where they don&#x27;t have to deal with the license requirements they force on other cloud providers, which gives them a competitive advantage over their competitors (when it comes to windows servers). The key is that these companies don&#x27;t just sell operating systems. Red Hat on the other hand, which doesn&#x27;t have competing market pressures, is much more friendly to licensing in a cloud environment.')
