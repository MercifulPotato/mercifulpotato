E.g. I&#x27;m using uberspace.de (shared server available for as low as 1â‚¬&#x2F;month) and they run qmail. Big advantage: You can setup as many aliases as you like (one for each site you&#x27;ve signed up to) and also install whatever web frontend you like (Roundcube, Nextcloud, etc.). And you can keep as many mails and as long as you like (and pay storage for). You&#x27;ll need to read a bit into qmail rules, though.')
