I would use that sometimes.<p>However, I question whether this will work consistently, since in my experience it takes a <i>lot</i> of developer attention to cover all the design anti-patterns out there.<p>It&#x27;s a classic problem of course but I don&#x27;t see why this is better than using something like Pocket, which has enough traction to get parsing right most of the time even if its print style might be less nice.  It also has good integration with my e-reader.<p>For the intended physical-book version, I think you&#x27;re setting yourself up for serious copyright problems.  You&#x27;re going to republish the Wall Street Journal because one of its readers asked you to?<p>Anyway it looks like a fun project and I wish you luck with it!<p>Regarding the video I&#x27;d like to point out:<p>1. It makes the service look really slow!  Probably not what you want!<p>2. The video ends with an ad for the video hosting company, which I found confusing at first.<p>[edit: less speculation]')
