I think a big part of why this whole thing is fascinating is the depth. Yesterday morning, financial press were blathering generalities pinning WSB as market manipulators and calling for regulation to stop them. That is, stop retail investors trading at a scale that moves markets. IE, the stuff that insiders get away with regularly.<p>Between yesterday afternoon and now, millions of people have been catching up on the detailed mechanics of stock trade execution. There&#x27;s a mad dash from reporter to get interviews with brokers, clearing house operators &amp; such.<p>Note that the maneuver itself was analyzed in detail, and in public. That&#x27;s what allowed big names like Cuban, Musk, various politicians and such to take a side and comment on it intelligibly.<p>Ultimately, whoever is holding these meme stock shorts needs to buys stock to cover their positions. I acknowledge that brokers had legitimate&#x2F;legal&#x2F;normative reasons to stop retail buys. But, it&#x27;s also true that they created a window where short sellers <i>could</i> buy without competition from retail investors. Maybe brokers are covered legally against market manipulation charges because clearing houses were genuinely short on liquidity. But, (1) that doesn&#x27;t change what happened and (2) Isn&#x27;t this the regulator&#x27;s job?<p>The reason people are cheerleading is because of these shenanigans. &quot;Rigged&quot; gets thrown around often, usually it&#x27;s devoid of subtlety. This time, it&#x27;s detailed. We can debate the details and construction of the rig. Truths fly around reddit for an afternoon, and are discarded the following day.<p>Few people cheerleading because they want a no regulation, pre-depression stock market. They just aren&#x27;t willing to accept a rigged system. In any case, who are the speculators here? Short sellers like Melvin or Redditors?  Short sellers future-sold 140% of the stock... hoping for a crash and potentially creating one. Redditors recognized this by looking at publicly available information and discussing it in the open.')
