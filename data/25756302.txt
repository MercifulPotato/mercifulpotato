Telegram in general provides more features and best of breed UX (among messaging apps) for the majority.<p>I&#x27;ve been using Wire (also using Signal protocol) but does not require mobile number to register (email and a @username), so 1 to 1 and group chats are end-to-end encrypted, but the UI really sucks, only using it to transfer files and messaging with a specific group.
