And when? I&#x27;ll confess I have very little experience in this area.<p>I&#x27;d imagine that only happens when the people involved in the accident want to go after an insurance company for denying a claim or not paying the full agreed upon amount. In fact the only time I&#x27;ve ever heard of it in my life was when my ex sued the insurance company for trying to get away with covering less than 10% of her medical bills following an accident that had totaled both cars and left the at-fault driver dead.<p>I don&#x27;t think lawyers are common in most trivial accidents- I don&#x27;t know how accurate it is to say that lawyers often get involved.')
