However, I think the main reason is that &quot;big tech&quot; is a winner take all market. For example, look at Google, they are investing way more than $10 billion in their cloud and yet still can&#x27;t make a dent in AWS, even Microsoft is still far away. Same thing with search (Microsoft invested billions in bing) or Office (Google investing billions in docs) etc. There is no way in hell â‚¬10B is going to be enough. The market already picked AWS.<p>The only country where these are not dominant is simply the one where they prevent these winners from entering, that would be China, they have their own cloud, search, retail etc.')
