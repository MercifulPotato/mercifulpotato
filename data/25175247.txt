If anyone wants to get started making a jmap server, about a year ago I pulled out the cyrus jmap email parsing code into a standalone C&#x2F;wasm library:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npmjs.com&#x2F;package&#x2F;mime-to-jmap" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npmjs.com&#x2F;package&#x2F;mime-to-jmap</a><p>Its a bit of a mess and it needs a write-up, but it should be a reasonable start to making more jmap servers. (This does <i>not</i> implement the jmap application protocol, but it does generate fantastic json from any email blob, incl attachments, snippets, html and text output. And thats crazy difficult to implement correctly.)')
