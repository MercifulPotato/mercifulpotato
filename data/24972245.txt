Comets are consistently flying by earth and always have some small chance of collision. Doesn&#x27;t mean the science is wrong, but the headlines probably still touted the possibility. With climate change, it was always more in the realm of probability that larger events would be later down the road and we would see more gradual change (like we are now!), rather than the doom and gloom possibilities presented in many documentaries.')
