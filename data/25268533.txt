I&#x27;m in the military, an organization where fitness is literally in my job description.  I should be able to step away from my desk for a few minutes to exercise, but 10&#x2F;20&#x2F;30 minutes can be a long time when the boss needs something asap.  And it is always asap.<p>Ironically, even though I am on a base the majority of my work occurs over phone&#x2F;email connections to people other locations.  Covid has only made that worse as we are to avoid in-person meeting whenever possible.  I feel like a remote worker ... one that still has to commute to the office each morning.')
