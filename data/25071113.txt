I think it is actually remarkably accurate. Yield curve inversions work like a charm to detect slowdowns and recessions (not just in the US), and if you think for a second then a yield curve inversion is exactly what the market should price in if there&#x27;s an &quot;air pocket&quot; ahead in nominal gdp. Then, there&#x27;s the story of Japan, which was predicted early on (1995) to be in stagnation for decades. And guess what, over 2 decades later it turns out the JGBs were right!<p>There are times when the bond market is very explicitly manipulated, such as towards the end of WW2 in the US. The country&#x27;s economy was getting seriously inflationary and rates were pegged at 2% (the rate should have been probably over 10% without the manipulation). Thankfully there was much collective sacrifice and the country managed to win the war in time before its economy imploded. Then the typical post war recession and later the baby boom solved everything.<p>You can detect such situations by things like: wage freezes, rationing, shelves not completely full in shops, large premium on gold bullion particularly small coins, the politicians&#x27; talk of &quot;great effort&quot;, things like that')
