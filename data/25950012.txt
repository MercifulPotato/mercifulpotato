I didn&#x27;t lose much, but it feels bad knowing that I only lost because people in power used their influence to protect other people in power at the expense of the average retail investor. I was perfectly willing to accept the risk of owning a small amount of volatile shares. Now, Robinhood is saying they&#x27;ll open up trading to an extent. I wish wall street would play by a consistent set of rules. I&#x27;m definitely not being protected by their heavy handed interventions.')
