People wondered if he was a genius baby.<p>No, he&#x27;s pretty average in terms of raw computing power. We spent an ENORMOUS amount of time with him as a baby, just talking. We narrated everything we did. We spoke to him as a human person, instead of babbling back at him like a lot of people do. We described the steps of everything we did. We explained the reasons for what we were doing as we were doing it.<p>That focused, invested time had a clear, and definite impact on the child&#x27;s development.<p>And that&#x27;s not even talking about the benefit for our mental health when engaging in a substantive manner with that tiny weirdo.')
