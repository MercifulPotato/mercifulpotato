Sort of like a Raspberry Pi with the camera in a case that is advertised as an “Ethernet AI camera”.<p>Openpilot on officially supported cars impersonate those ADAS unit. They are not directly meddling with pedal potentiometer readouts and such. That kind of rigging are used in some lab experiments but not in the majority of OP driven cars.')
