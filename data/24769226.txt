KDE 3 looked ugly. KDE 4 looked OK but kind of wasteful in terms of screen area.<p>&gt;  KDE4 was unusably broken for years and years, it&#x27;s basically why I stopped using a Linux desktop.<p>I just went to XFCE which has hardly changed at all since then. XFCE is always a perfect fallback DE for weird times. I also went XFCE (for about a year or 2 every time) when Unity was first introduced and when it got retired. I just disabled the standard XFCE panels and added a 3-rd party dock instead.')
