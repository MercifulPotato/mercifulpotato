Item(by='fireattack', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602241943, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24727841, text='&gt; sans-serif stands for Arial or Helvetica by default<p>Not really, I think it just means &quot;sans serif&quot;. On iOS and Android, it will fallback to the default system font fine.<p>On Windows (and maybe MacOS, but I never use it), it will likely fallback to Arial because that&#x27;s most of browsers default to [1], which is one layer before the system one.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;bmVRwg0.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;bmVRwg0.png</a><p>However, users can always change this default font in browser setting [1] to whatever they want.<p>And I think this is a superior approach (just use &quot;sans serif&quot;) than typical &quot;system font stack&quot; because<p>1) Users not necessarily want the same font for system UI and web page. I knew I don&#x27;t because Segoe UI is too bulky. Anyway, If they do, they can always just set so in their browsers.<p>2) it&#x27;s not hard-coded. What if an Android user changed their <i>system front</i> from Roboto to something else? Now whole premise &quot;consistent look and feel&quot; breaks down by having the hard-coded &quot;Roboto&quot; in your website&#x27;s CSS.<p>3) The users still get the consistent look across all the websites that use such rule. And even better, they can control what exactly (back to point 1).')
