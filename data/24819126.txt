This one is easy enough to break evenly with a normal knife:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;livedoor.blogimg.jp&#x2F;ddmp-mmpj&#x2F;imgs&#x2F;5&#x2F;4&#x2F;549fd611.jpg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;livedoor.blogimg.jp&#x2F;ddmp-mmpj&#x2F;imgs&#x2F;5&#x2F;4&#x2F;549fd611.jpg</a><p>This is not very far from the standard American 4oz stick, as far as I understand, and for most Japanese households it might be enough.<p>Beyond that size you can commonly find 150g and 200g slabs in supermarkets, and huge 450g slabs in bulk-oriented supermarkets (like Hanamasa or Gyomu) and specialty shops (like Tomiz). I tend to use butter quite regularly for cooking so I&#x27;m generally buying the 450g ones, as it is quite expensive here.<p>I guess the reason many people here mention they&#x27;ve never seen these kind of tools in Japan, is that you wouldn&#x27;t find them in a normal house. Relatively few people bake at home here (or even OWN an oven) and butter is mostly used for toasts. If you have an insatiable <i>kodawari</i> (pedantry) for nicely cut butter cubes, I guess you could just go ahead and buy the pre-cut sticks.<p>I am using the wire grill cutter myself though, so I know it exists. And I&#x27;m pretty sure that these different cutters are heavily used in cafe&#x27;s restaurants, which often serve butter toasts. They tend to serve fancy-looking toasts like this one:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;storage.googleapis.com&#x2F;mbs-recipe-and-restaurant-asset-production&#x2F;fe45e265-63c6-4b83-80d4-96c77fa9e479&#x2F;menu-6d72361e-84b5-4cc1-a8a9-c77b1a063e52.jpg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;storage.googleapis.com&#x2F;mbs-recipe-and-restaurant-ass...</a><p>Yes, the toast bread is quite thick (though usually not as much as this), and the butter is frequently served as a perfectly slice on top. So perhaps having tools for perfectly slicing butter in right angle out of bulk-size slabs is not so surprising.')
