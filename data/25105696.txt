I am not claiming this is how you meant your comment: What you wrote really reminds me of the &quot;we should be colorblind and that will fix American racism&quot; argument. However implicit biases are a thing and past damage does not get fixed by simply being colorblind (rather it festers). Similarly, your comment sounds like &quot;just do not be racist&quot; is a trivial thing to do, while usually subscribing to that view just makes you more susceptible to your own biases that you are unaware of. Very active thought is required to avoid in-tribe knee-jerk behavior. Maybe it is easy for you, but then I claim you are underestimating how difficult it is for others, even when they are well-meaning.')
