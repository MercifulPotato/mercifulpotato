Undoubtedly the manufactured products are lighter, more robust, and made from better materials. That isn&#x27;t to say that these desks are more suitable.<p>One could build a desk from even better materials than the $1000 desk; maple, walnut, mahogany, stainless steel, brass, whatever. But it wont be &lt;$1000 for materials then, let alone &lt;$100.<p>I&#x27;m in favour of DIY and think it&#x27;s admirable that you would build your son&#x27;s desk yourself rather than buy, but I think it&#x27;s important to be realistic about the costs and materials. These costs were a surprise to me at least, after getting into woodwork&#x2F;metalwork.')
