I certainly don&#x27;t think I would fair very well. Another AppStore doesn&#x27;t change that reality.<p>So are you suggesting that Apple should not be allow to develop and sell apps they make (even if they are doing what my apps do)?<p>Anyone can always come along and build a better&#x2F;cheaper mousetrap than I have, that&#x27;s just reality.')
