It consists of checking whether a person has cold&#x2F;flu symptoms and&#x2F;or a temperature over 37.5.<p>This test may sound ridiculous but it is part of the reason why Taiwan has had hardly any deaths from the virus and yet did not have to have a lockdown.<p>In Taiwan, checks are made at entrance to work, school, transport, shops. Those who have symptoms as above are excluded. This, combined with other measures (below) has been enough to produce successful control of the disease.<p>Some numbers Country, deaths&#x2F;million, GDP fall Q2&#x2F;2020<p>Taiwan,0.3,-0.6<p>Australia,35,-7.0<p>Germany,158,-11.2<p>Sweden,167,-8.3<p>USA,767,-9.6<p>Belgium,1278,-14.5<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.worldometers.info&#x2F;coronavirus&#x2F;#countries" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.worldometers.info&#x2F;coronavirus&#x2F;#countries</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ourworldindata.org&#x2F;covid-health-economy" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ourworldindata.org&#x2F;covid-health-economy</a><p>Measures Taiwan took<p>1. Close borders as hard as possible very early.<p>2. Strictly and competently managed mandatory quarantine of overseas arrivals.<p>3. Mandatory facemasks. Initially supplies were rationed until supplied caught up.<p>4. Health checks as above.<p>5. Competently managed contact tracing.<p>Some of this strategy may be difficult to duplicate in certain countries. See the steps with the word &quot;competent&quot; included.<p>Also the Taiwanese public appear to trust the government&#x27;s competence and good intentions, something that does not seem to be true in some other countries.')
