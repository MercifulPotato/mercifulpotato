The truth is somewhere in the middle of all the bullshit we&#x27;re being fed.<p>I completely agree.  All &#x27;sides&#x27; are greatly over-reacting to this and most everything else.  Yes, this is a very serious situation, and requires serious and well considered discussions and actions.<p>A great way to get groups of people who are naturally somewhat suspicious of government mandated activities, like wearing a mask, to never ever consider wearing a mask is to over-act and react irrationally.
