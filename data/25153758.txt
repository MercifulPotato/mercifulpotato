There are so many things in youtube that <i>should</i> have been a text post but are videos on youtube (for example how to do something technical), that somehow mysteriously come out as top results on google search. They&#x27;ve been rendered even more useless than they were before. I&#x27;m already not willing to sit through a video if it could have been text, but I&#x27;m sure some people are. I wonder if a slate of ads before, and during, will kill of that type of content.<p>Honestly, I consider the existence of such things kind of toxic, which is a weirdly extreme view, I admit, so I&#x27;m kinda rooting for these types of videos to get pushed out of the results.')
