Most of the &quot;smart&quot; one tell me their classes are really easy. I tell them to expect to actually have to study and for those easy A&#x27;s or B&#x27;s just for showing up to become C&#x27;s and D&#x27;s in college.<p>My buddies kid actually took the advice to heart and has been getting A&#x27;s and B&#x27;s in college still which is good to see. I wish someone would have given me that advice and saved me an extra semester.')
