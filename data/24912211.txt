Continuously adding data is fine, but when you remove data either you leave a &quot;hole&quot; in the file and have to keep track of the &quot;empty&quot; blocks, or you shift everything to fill the hole. Off-by-one errors corrupt files.<p>Those are all resolved problems for filesystems, but additionally, I learned the hard way (performance) that SQLite wasn&#x27;t good as a production db. The situation here is different of course (db access isn&#x27;t very frequent), but I can&#x27;t quite shake it.<p>Maybe I&#x27;ll dig into the internals to understand what kind of optimisations they made. The wiki and bug-tracking are definitely a plus though.')
