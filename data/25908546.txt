There have been plenty of good reasons to suspect electronic voting in the past, at least in the absence of verifiable paper backups <i>and</i> regular random sampling recounts of those paper ballots. Which is still a pretty rare practice, isn&#x27;t it? In the absence of those standards, it&#x27;s still reasonable to have suspicion even if you don&#x27;t have evidence; the entire problem is that you&#x27;re kept from <i>gathering</i> the evidence.<p>The biggest reason to doubt the &quot;voter fraud&quot; theories this time around is because of who is making the complaints, not because the voting companies (or the laws surrounding e-voting) are beyond reproach.')
