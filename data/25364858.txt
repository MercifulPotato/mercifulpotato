I decided to double down in SoCal instead and buy property. I&#x27;ve spent a decent amount of time in Austin for work and have family nearby, but the weather and cultural opportunities won me over in California. I like that I can go to running on beach path, cycle in the mountains, carve canyons on a motorcycle, eat stellar sushi, sit in traffic :(, and walk down any downtown all in one day.<p>I&#x27;ve been very grateful to have non-extreme weather throughout the year. I am looking outside at a sunny sky right now and I will go walking on a path shortly to clear my mind. For someone with high allergies, I found that I am not allergic to trees, pollen, and grass in LA. I&#x27;ve had several nasal surgeries in the past to fix issues from allergies. I didn&#x27;t want to risk it in Austin with different plant landscape.')
