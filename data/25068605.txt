There is a new hype weaving around ATM to rediscover functionality which exists in old tools for decades already. Graph-View pokes in that area. Similar reasoning for the tag-view and search.<p>But Obsidian has more points speaking for it. It works on local files&#x2F;folders with well known types. No special formats involved which lock you in. Recently it started development of it&#x27;s plugin-API which already started gaining some useful plugins from the community. And overall it&#x27;s quite polished and userfriendly, not many quirks and corners which stay in the users way.')
