False positives are a fact of life, garaunteed so long as we have an adversarial malware ecosystem. (For example, the fixes for bad decisions are pretty much indistinguishable from bad actors evading correct decisions.)<p>The other side of the coin is a web that looks like my missed calls list - everything is assumed to be spam and malware infested until proven otherwise. No one will use your startup anyway, because any given site is probably terrible. The whitelist becomes a thing that people maintain in their heads, and, again, you get a massive incumbent advantage.<p>The right balance is somewhere in-between, and involves fine tuning the false positive rate. The false positives are always going to be unhappy, and hard to tell apart from true positives trying to keep their scam going.')
