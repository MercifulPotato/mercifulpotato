Organizations will spend many years writing and maintaining dubious unit tests that break with the smallest change, when they&#x27;d get an order of magnitude more value spending that time on an automation suite.  One of the biggest reasons is testing at the same unit of granularity as the spec means you&#x27;re tests break when the spec changes, and usually unit tests are far too granular.<p>*I still think unit tests are great for tricky logic, but a lot of coding is just gluing together different systems where unit tests don&#x27;t have a lot of bang for their buck.')
