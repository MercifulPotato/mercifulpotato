Every single one of those I can think of is a micro-ISV (or similar) and lacks a multi-million-person-sized user-base.<p>Those same types of companies also tend to <i>not</i> sell-out to a mega-corp that simply wants to shut it down - if they really need the money they could presumably sell it to a competitor that would actually capitalize on their investment.<p>In a more general sense, I would like to see moves towards laws and regulations prohibiting more detrimental-to-the-public business activity - we already ban loss-leaders in many circumstances, so it&#x27;s not a stretch to ban (or rather: to retroactively punish) buying out the competition simply to shut it down.<p>What&#x27;s interesting to me is that our industry has plenty of examples of big corporations buying competing companies and products - and keeping them running despite internal competition and even cannibalizations, such as Autodesk and Discrete (3ds vs. Maya), Adobe and Macromedia (GoLive, Dreamweaver, Fireworks, Photoshop, Illustrator, FreeHand), even Microsoft too (Microsoft Works vs. Microsoft Office).')
