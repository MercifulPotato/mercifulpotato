There&#x27;s isn&#x27;t even a concept of a frame or page at all.<p>There was an extension added in an attempt to fix this situation, IIRC it&#x27;s the xdbe extension, but I don&#x27;t believe it gained much traction.<p>If you look at the implementation of xcompmgr and the extensions introduced to make compositing possible, namely Composite and DAMAGE, they too don&#x27;t have any frame-oriented coordination.<p>So it&#x27;s just more racy uncoordinated capacitance in the immediate mode rendering pipeline of X.  Your X requests logically just throw things on the screen as they occur.  There may or may not be a compositor in the middle of that.  When the compositor is scheduled and how much of your X requests sitting in the queue become processed as part of the same timeslice is fairly non-deterministic.  There&#x27;s unpredictable scheduling occurring at the kernel level, the compositor process&#x27;s event handling, and the X display server&#x27;s client multiplexing level.<p>There are some good reasons for a replacement like wayland, this area is definitely one of them.')
