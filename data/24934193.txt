My experience has been _far_ from that. I very much welcome these changes.<p>In late 2017, I spent upwards of 80+ hours standardizing 80 different MDN docs pages so they used the same best-practices layout as other more popular docs pages on the MDN.[1]<p>Of the 85 pages I updated to have better formatting, over 18 were reverted by random contributors within 2 days with no reason or explanation in the changelog. It was _impossible_ for me to get in contact with the people reverting the changes, because they are only a username.<p>I tried contacting MDN maintainers on IRC, searching for those users on IRC, and came up empty handed. I was left to make a plea on the mailing list asking for those change authors to get in contact with me, only to receive no response.<p>I came away from the experience highly encouraged not to contribute to the MDN.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;hexops&#x2F;vecty&#x2F;issues&#x2F;136" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;hexops&#x2F;vecty&#x2F;issues&#x2F;136</a>')
