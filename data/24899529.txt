I’m trying to force myself to take more video&#x2F;live photos than stills, and the 12 Pro’s HDR video is a major improvement so far.<p>I’m considering getting rid of my Nikon Z6 since I rarely actually use it due to the size and weight. Its still image quality is still noticeably better than the phone, especially with my Nikon f1.8 50 mm lens, but the iPhone wins for video and Live Photo’s.')
