I am an EU citizen residing in the UK, but I was and still am Austrian by nationality and only hold an Austrian citizenship. Luckily I never fancied a .eu domain, but if the EU would have prematurely revoked my domain then I&#x27;d be very unhappy. I find the EU mostly very incompetent. Great ideas, but terrible execution on literally every matter.<p>EDIT:<p>I&#x27;m being downvoted because I have an honest opinion which isn&#x27;t nationalistic. That&#x27;s quite funny. I don&#x27;t see myself as any particular nationality. I don&#x27;t see myself as having a strong allegiance towards the EU, Austria, the UK or Poland (my cultural heritage). If the EU sucks at something (and unfortunately they do that a lot) then I&#x27;m not afraid to point it out. Patting people on the back and pretending that they are awesome when they actually suck isn&#x27;t going to help anyone. Sometimes it&#x27;s best to be brutally honest, especially if it&#x27;s people who are unelected and the only way to show discontent is through voice and not ballot.')
