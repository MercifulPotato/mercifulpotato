Item(by='mundo', descendants=None, kids=[25206024], score=None, time=1606255975, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25200732, text='A number of commenters seem hung up on the actual measurement of information, which I think is a little ancillary to the point (which I think is valid).  So I&#x27;ll add that I think the author&#x27;s point here is that the press has shifted from focusing on surprising news to reiterating things we already know, because that is a good way to reassure and flatter their audience.<p>Consider a headline like, &quot;Trump says illegal immigration is a big problem.&quot;  He&#x27;s said that many times, it&#x27;s very unsurprising that he would say it again, and hence it contains very little information.  However, each time he says it, it affords the press that agree with him a fresh opportunity to talk about why he&#x27;s right, and the press that disagrees a new chance to talk about why he&#x27;s wrong.<p><i>That</i> is the point here - that what we call &quot;news&quot; has shifted from spending most of its energy informing us of things we don&#x27;t know towards reinforcing and emphasizing things we do know.  If that trend is true, then certainly it represents a reduction in information (in the Claude Shannon sense as well as the everyday sense).')
