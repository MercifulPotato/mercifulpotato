Yes, data collection is imperfect, advertising dashboards lie about attribution, and any metrics that aren’t connected to valuable, verifiable transaction data are terrible if your marketing team follows them the wrong direction. Marketing- finding the people that could use your products and communicating value- is a real skill and a soft science. Great marketing teams understand how to show value to the human beings at the other end of these digital processes, how to leverage tech to communicate most effectively, AND how to create directionally useful predictive models that connect noisy, messy data to valuable outcomes. There are plenty of bad marketers, but don’t confuse the lack of skill in the teams you’ve worked with for the upper bound of what’s possible in the discipline.')
