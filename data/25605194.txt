However, it suffers from imaging (a reconstruction artifact) due to using a stair-step (zero-order hold) as a reconstruction filter. And IMO reconstruction artifacts sound worse (not harmonically spaced) when the sampling rate isn&#x27;t an integer multiple of the note&#x27;s frequency (the note pitch&#x27;s period isn&#x27;t an integer number of samples).<p>Aliasing (a sampling artifact) <i>is</i> an issue in synthesizers which run at low&#x2F;fixed sampling rates and sample waveforms to produce output (often using frequency registers). This includes modern software synthesis, and also hardware like DS (ZOH, samples, almost like Amiga), N163 (ZOH, short wavetables), Yamaha (FM on sine waves, IDK the details), and to a lesser extent SNES (Gaussian reconstruction, samples).<p>Reconstruction artifacts (extra frequencies at x * fundamental, may exceed sampling rate) are different from sampling&#x2F;aliasing artifacts (frequencies are taken modulo the sampling rate). But they can combine (like on DS hardware).')
