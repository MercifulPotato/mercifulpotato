I help out at a local hackerspace and the excitement of someone discovering a software&#x2F;hardware interface bug is contagious.<p>Here&#x27;s an example: someone was trying to make a plant watering machine and was using a FET to control the DC motor. The wire to the FET was about 15 feet long so the slope from the poor GPIO was horrendous, and the motor would basically brownout because it couldn&#x27;t overcome the initial stall di&#x2F;dt. The idea that not all edges are perfect 90 degrees was eye opening to him.')
