Item(by='kmill', descendants=None, kids=[24687516], score=None, time=1601877572, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24682123, text='&gt; Eg Conwayâ€™s notation for knots<p>I&#x27;m not sure how well-known this is, but Conway notation can be thought of as taking a Tait graph of the knot (i.e., a checkerboard graph) then reducing all the series-parallel networks until you get some irreducible graph.  He noticed that certain kinds of series-parallel networks can be represented by an extended rational number (includes infinity), which can dramatically simplify the analysis of small knots -- to the point he was able to classify all of them in an afternoon!  So, Conway notation corresponds to an irreducible planar graph with an expansion of each edge by a series-parallel network, with each edge in the expansion labeled by a rational number.  You can even work out a set of moves such that if two such diagrams correspond to the same knot then there is a sequence of such moves connecting them.<p>I do wonder if there&#x27;s a similar analysis for lambda calculus represented as graphs...  It might be that certain expressions play the role of rational tangles.  (Though very likely not :-) )')
