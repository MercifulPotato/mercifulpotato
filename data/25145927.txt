They extend a fixed term, one-time line of credit equal to your transaction amount and no more. Want to use Affirm for another transaction? That&#x27;ll be an entirely independent line of credit for that transaction, subject to its own application&#x2F;approval process.<p>There are a lot of somewhat novel aspects to Affirm&#x27;s approach, but the core premise of Affirm itself one of them.  For better or worse, making it easy for consumers to over-extend themselves by dangling a credit line at the point of sale was widespread and lucrative <i>long</i> before Affirm entered the market.')
