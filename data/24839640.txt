I encourage others to give it a shot.<p>I agree. I tried to switch several times since 2016. A couple of months ago, Firefox finally performed well enough I could do it. I&#x27;m the type of person who has five windows open with twenty tabs each, and it handles that now.<p>I also added Container Tabs Sidebar, DuckDuckGo Privacy Essentials, Firefox Multi-Account Containers (this thing is amazing for keeping sites separate!), and uBlock Origin. I like it now more than Chrome.')
