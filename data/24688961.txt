I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s amazingly obvious but at least the information&#x27;s there. In fact I&#x27;m mostly posting this comment so others know what to look for.<p>(I know this because I just spent 60 seconnds staring at my message trying to figure out why the formatting was off before it told me it wasn&#x27;t sent. It sent immediately when I retried though.)')
