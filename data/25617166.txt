Points for trying but he&#x27;s got the maths wrong.<p>The issue he has missed is that transmission rates directly affect lethality. 3.2% of covid patients require intubation [1]<p>So the lethality rate is 0.8% ONLY for as long as you have enough ventilators and nurses and beds. The minute too many people have the disease at the same time, those beds get full, and the disease becomes 3.2% lethal.<p>This has been the key issue since day 1: avoiding a quadrupled death rate from system collapse. So far, we couldn&#x27;t keep R values below 1 in the UK or US. Some places are at risk of being overrun already. Now the R value is going up, as the new varient is more transmissible. So it is possible that the new varient is both impossible for our societies to handle AND torpedoes our main plan.<p>This is why the EU suspended all flights with the UK when the numbers came out. Its effectively BOTH more transmissable AND more deadly.<p>I&#x27;m starting to think we need a 24h covid channel like we have 24h news. People seem to be trying to work this stuff out. But they&#x27;re all failing. I&#x27;m probably wrong too in at least part of the above?<p>This is also why I don&#x27;t source anything from fucking twitter threads.
