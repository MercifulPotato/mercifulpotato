You have to own a phone.  The phone has to connect to a network.  You have to have a payment plan, presumably with a credit card&#x2F;bank involved.  Your car has to communicate with the charge point.  The charge point has to have internet.  There are just so many little things that need to be installed and maintained just <i>to deliver a few pennies worth of electricity</i>.  An alternative is to install very small&#x2F;free outlets on literally every spot (something common in cold climates already).  That would cover much of daily commuting.  The faster charging points could be relegated to highway stations outside of town centres.  Then all that complexity, those points of failure, can be abandoned in favour of the simple century-old delivery of electricity over wires.<p>I do wonder how much electricity is used by these complex charging systems when they are not in use.  How much does that charging point draw from the grid just to keep all its wifi&#x2F;cell&#x2F;internet systems running 24&#x2F;7?')
