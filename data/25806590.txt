There&#x27;s far more variety within constituents of a political or religious group (including atheists) than between them. Arguing that one group is more &quot;zealous&quot; than another is almost certainly untrue for any meaningful kind of comparison (e.g., Muslims have more extremists than other groups, but we would rightly balk at generalizing Muslims as extreme). At best, these comments are meaningless; at worst, they incite hate and divisiveness (predictable whataboutism: &quot;but Trump is divisive! Why can&#x27;t we be divisive toward his supporters?!&quot;--yes he is divisive, but he shouldn&#x27;t be our moral standard).')
