If anything troubles them they will use monetary policy.<p>&gt; In the case of shiny metal money, that’s usually deflationary, but not always: see the Spanish Price Revolution of the 15th Century <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Price_revolution" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Price_revolution</a><p>I&#x27;m not going to see anything useful to me an economic event from 500 years ago in a language I don&#x27;t speak, enmeshed in a foreign legal system, totally different technological and social conditions and potentially questionable record keeping with uncertain customs around law enforcement.<p>Even the frame there is incomparable; Wikipedia is quoting 1–1.5% inflation as &#x27;high&#x27;.
