The pages had no problems displaying.<p>Out of curiosity, I just finished testing with two old DOS browsers I had in DOSBox. The results are here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;ScpJqaK" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;ScpJqaK</a><p>Also uploaded here:<p>Knots HTML Viewer: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ibb.co&#x2F;3Tf9VTk" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ibb.co&#x2F;3Tf9VTk</a><p>Dillo for DOS: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ibb.co&#x2F;mqsF8kp" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ibb.co&#x2F;mqsF8kp</a><p>Knots was a simple HTML viewer released in 1996. I was surprised it loaded the page. From the image: it was unable to scroll past a certain point. Singlefile embeds all assets within the page (so I had to scroll past all the CSS). It stopped scrolling soon after the CSS.<p>This was a real (unfair) torture test of Singlefile and I think it passed with flying colors. Knots had trouble even with pages written in 1993 - it was useful for only the simplest of html tags.<p>The other image is of Dillo for DOS (released in 2011). Really nice job displaying the Singlefile page.<p>These were the only two DOS browsers I had on the system (for now...)<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;addons.mozilla.org&#x2F;en-US&#x2F;firefox&#x2F;addon&#x2F;single-file&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;addons.mozilla.org&#x2F;en-US&#x2F;firefox&#x2F;addon&#x2F;single-file&#x2F;</a><p>&gt; I swear, browsers have gone downhill since the days of Opera 12...<p>LOL.
