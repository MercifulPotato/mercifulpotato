This is one of the exact results predicted by opponents of Prop 22.  Also there is basically no way for Prop 22 to be amended or repealed through the state legislature.  These companies effectively bought a law and are already repeating the benefits at the expense of the workers of California.  Expect other industries to follow this path in coming elections.')
