This is based on a conference that I went to (20 years ago granted) where an Australian group had actually measured the utilisation of the spectrum.  This was in the context of &quot;whitespace&quot; radio, where they were investigating the opportunistic use of licensed but unused spectrum.  Their answer was that from a technical perspective it&#x27;s worth doing as 95% of the spectrum is available for opportunistic use, the main barriers being non-technical.<p>Personally I can&#x27;t see a problem with a &quot;free for all&quot;.  As space-time (MIMO) coding comes to dominate, WiFi access points will be increasingly focusing their transmissions on specific spatial regions leading to less interference on average, even if the devices are sharing a frequency.<p>It&#x27;s in the transmitter&#x27;s self-interest to maximise channel capacity by focusing as much power as possible on the receiver of interest and not wasting power by spraying it around in an omni-directional manner.  This self-interest will avoid a &quot;tragedy of the commons&quot;, provided the rules say that everyone has the same maximum power, forcing people to use their radiated power wisely.')
