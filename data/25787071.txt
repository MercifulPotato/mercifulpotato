(Www.Fintor.co)\nIt’s Robinhood for real estate investing. You can invest in an app with $5 in a house. Super cool. I just joined their waitlist on their website. Can’t wait to access. Seems like they’re giving away free shares of houses as well. One of the coolest ideas I’ve came across recently. Anyone have access to the app yet?')
