I did not say the author conflated these <i>terms</i>, I said he conflated the things themselves (i.e., the concepts). Krisoft&#x27;s reply to your comment explains well what&#x27;s wrong with the article.<p>That Wikipedia and the FAA do not have special terms for these distinct concepts does not mean they conflate them. Indeed, basically nobody cares about re-entry pollution because it&#x27;s just an utterly trivial type of pollution (and it&#x27;s the only thing this proposed tech addresses).')
