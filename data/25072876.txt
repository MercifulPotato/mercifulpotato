Microsoft has done an impressive job of making software development better lately, and if any community needs it, it’s Python. Python has a lot of potential, but it’s sorely hampered by poor package management and performance, which are ultimately both symptoms of its commitment to exposing the entire CPython interpreter as a stable public interface. If the Python leadership were willing to commit to a narrower interface that met the goals of the c-extension community and also allowed Python to improve with respect to performance and package management (and I think this is very possible, hpy gets us close afaict), then we could have the best of both worlds, and I’m optimistic that Microsoft could provide this leadership.')
