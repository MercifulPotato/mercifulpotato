It’s great, but real battery life is abysmal, it runs very hot, although this has been massively improved by switching from FF to Safari, and I usually have Turbo Booster Pro restricting the cpu to base speed. And, not much uses the GPU. iTerm can, big deal, and Snap Camera does, big deal, but DaVinci Resolve free doesn’t, and neither does Capture Pro or ffmpeg, so it’s all a bit pointless right now. Find a compromise Intel machine for now.<p>P.S. also: lots of fans.')
