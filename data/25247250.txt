You could ask many Steam user what Steam got that others platforms doesn&#x27;t, and most will say that it&#x27;s because everything is on there. We prefer to use a single product instead of multiples, thus you choose Steam not because it&#x27;s superior in any ways, simply because it&#x27;s the default choice.<p>Epic Store had to give games for free to start being considered.')
