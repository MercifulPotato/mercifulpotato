Look at this unrelated library that is doing the same thing.

If you call main inside the closure then groovy will call sourceSets.main and set that property.<p>What you are probably complaining about is that parenthesis are optional in two contexts. Your function fits on a single line or your last parameter is a closure (curly braces)<p>You&#x27;re also confused by the fact that you can pass a map as a parameter by simply doing &quot;function key1: name1, key2: name2&quot;.')
