No desktop enviroment. Just a simple manual tiling window manager. StumpWM is my favorite option, but ExWM or dwm also work fine.<p>I could use macOS or Windows, but with Linux I can simplify furhter. In some distributions, there&#x27;s a minimal layer between me and upstream. Just creating binaries and dealing with dependencies. An easy litmus test for a good distribution is to set up the above configuration and check what is running with e.g. htop. Is it clean, with nothing added by me?<p>I have learned not to change defaults till I understand why they are there. That&#x27;s an intance of Chesterton&#x27;s fence, a very useful heuristic. Owing to this, I have very few dotfiles, which are ~100 LOC. They are completely trivial. I almost know them by heart.<p>NixOS and GuixSD are an interesting alternative. They make simple things very simple. You can set up your whole machine in a declarative manner with a few LOC placed in a single file. Nothing breaks, it&#x27;s functional. You can rollback anytime. However, some complicated things require a lot more work than with a normal setup, others less.')
