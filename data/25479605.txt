Item(by='leetcrew', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608401596, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25478982, text='&gt; Honestly, my major problem with wealth inequality is not that rich people get to have money; it&#x27;s that wealth concentration leads to power concentration. That&#x27;s not healthy for democracy. This is probably extremely controversial, but I say go ahead and collect a wealth tax and then burn everything you collect. It&#x27;s not about the budget, it&#x27;s about limiting the power of billionaires and the corporations they control. There are probably better ways to accomplish that goal, but a wealth tax is at least a start in the right direction.<p>I&#x27;m not totally convinced by this. in fact, I&#x27;d argue the opposite: wealth is the result of power, not the cause. consider jeff bezos; I&#x27;m sure we would all consider him a powerful man. is he powerful because the shares he holds are worth $200 billion (on paper), or is he powerful because he controls one of the largest companies in the world?<p>here&#x27;s a thought experiment. suppose there was an asymptotic tax that limited net worth to a maximum of $1 billion, so jeff bezos would only have 0.5% of his current assets. how much would his power be diminished? I tend to think his status as the founder and CEO of amazon would put him in a pretty similar position.')
