In 1994, they announced a partnership for an OS on the Sega Saturn, although it was never realized:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mdshock.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;06&#x2F;22&#x2F;sega-and-microsoft-announce-partnership-for-saturn-os&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mdshock.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;06&#x2F;22&#x2F;sega-and-microsoft-announce-p...</a><p>But the first contact between the two companies was reportedly during the development of the Game Gear. Bill Gates was in Japan at the time, and he requested a meeting with Sega, possibly about an idea he had for a handheld device. It&#x27;s not clear what his idea was, since nothing ever came of it, but that meeting helped forge the ties that led to their later relationship. This info comes from a recent interview with Hideki Sato, a former president of Sega.')
