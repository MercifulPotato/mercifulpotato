Two data points.<p>Episode 1. Growing up I picked up Serbian&#x2F;Croatian without knowing, from comic books, movies (never synchronized, foreign movies subtitled only), songs and books. Got the surprise of my life 1st time I went to Belgrade (while in high school). I could understand everything spoken, I could read too. They could not understand a word I was speaking in Macedonian. And I spoke their language really badly, laghably so. ;-) It was funny.<p>When I visit my old home, I have the impression that the youth nowdays don&#x27;t understand Serbian&#x2F;Croatian as much as we did.<p>Episode 2. Sometime in the 90-s, I went to Sofia to see the city for the 1st time. I bought bunch of Computer Science books, the likes of The Art of Computer Programming and similar. Some bits I could understand, but all of the computer related words were translated in Bulgarian (from their English forms) and I had hard time following. Some works I could guess (remember the term for computer keyboard was similar to what we use for a piano keyboard), but looking up and translating sapped my enthusiasm for CS. :-)<p>These days sometimes when I hear &quot;Macedonian is a dialect of Bulgarian&quot;, I give a news site like <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dw.com&#x2F;bg&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dw.com&#x2F;bg&#x2F;</a> a try, to see what I can understand. I recognize lots of words, the meaning of simpler sentences, news on current events news that I already am familiar with. Longer more complicated sentences, or themes I am not familiar with, I do struggle, to get the meaning of what is written.')
