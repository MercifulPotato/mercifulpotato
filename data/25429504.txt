Google setup the rules and the legions of clever SEO consultants fly 747s through the loopholes. Google closes them, SEOs pivot, and the tit-for-tat goes on.<p>Meanwhile legitimate businesses suffer.<p>Meanwhile users suffer.<p>Google has one view on the world of content -- namely &quot;one big index to rule them all&quot; and &quot;remove humans at every step of the way&quot;<p>This has made the behemoth blind to their next existential threat -- the real threat to their search dominance will not come from Bing, or Baidu, or another other big-ish play.<p>The threat is on the bottom. In the niches. In curation.<p>Curation from enthusiasts and subject matter experts who will run their own micro search engines.<p>Just as we look at &quot;influencers&quot; for what software to run, makeup to buy, and books to read -- I think one day we might like to use Paul G&#x27;s search engine on startups and entrepreneurship.<p>Or perhaps a hyper-local search engine run by a consortium of small business owners and civic-minded people?')
