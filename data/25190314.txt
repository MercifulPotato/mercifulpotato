The industrial revolution happened because we learned how to substitute fossil fuels for human labor, and modern agriculture has been described as using land to turn petroleum into food.<p>So, yeah, if energy gets cheaper, it will require fewer hours of human labor to do what we do now, freeing up human labor to improve rockets, robots and phones; improve CPUs; build more housing using the same number of people, thereby decreasing housing costs as a fraction of the average income; etc; and <i>definitely</i> to grow more or better food.<p>It will probably free up <i>fewer</i> hours of human labor than the industrial revolution did (because there is probably less low-hanging fruit than there was at the start of the industrial revolution) but it will probably free up a significant fraction of the hours.<p>Another way to look at is that almost everything valued by humans (exceptions: air, water as long as the population of earth is below a few billion) requires significant amounts of human labor to produce, and just keeping a human alive requires a lot of energy. (And before the industrial revolution, just keeping the humans alive required most of humankind&#x27;s ability to harness useful energy.)<p>Keeping humans alive <i>and</i> happy enough so that they are not constantly plotting violent revolution or invasion of their neighbors in a desperate attempt to improve their situation requires even more energy per capita.')
