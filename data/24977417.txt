This type of advice is heavily fact-specific, and if you create a complicated legal structure, you can&#x27;t take your eye off the ball for a minute. Otherwise you can end up blowing the whole thing up, or worse.<p>I would note that the world you describe (where people have tax tricks just like corporations) used to exist. Before the tax reform bill of 1986, doctors&#x2F;lawyers&#x2F;dentists&#x2F;etc. were able to take advantage of tax shelters that greatly reduced their wage income, without actually incurring any real losses. These passive loss tax shelters were heavily marketed by accounting firms because of their general applicability. But in 1986 they were eliminated by a tax reform bill that outlawed perceived abuses and lowered tax rates.')
