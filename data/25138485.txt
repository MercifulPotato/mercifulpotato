The soundproofing made the room nearly airtight, so I had to think about (at the very least) CO2 buildup within the office.<p>I&#x27;ve hit an interesting problem regarding CO2 monitoring: calibration and validation.<p>Every IAQ CO2 meter I&#x27;ve come across allows self-calibration and&#x2F;or calibration by exposure to &quot;open air&quot; which is assumed to be about 400 ppm CO2.<p>But none of the meters provide any means to calibrate &#x2F; validate CO2 levels <i>other than</i> the reference level.<p>For example, suppose I buy two CO2 meters from Amazon. They can both tare to 400 ppm. But once the CO2 in my office builds up, one might read 1200ppm while the other reads 800ppm.<p>According to medical literature, 800 ppm vs. 1200 ppm is a pretty significant difference for human mental performance. If the CO2 level is <i>actually</i> 1200 ppm, I want to crank the office ventilation system, even though it means higher background noise. At just 800 ppm, I may prefer the quiter work environment.<p>Another downside to this difficulty in testing is that it&#x27;s hard to <i>truly</i> evaluate a particular meter&#x27;s performance. Which seriously limits side-by-side comparisons of different models, and makes it harder to hold manufacturers &#x2F; retailers accountable for poor performance.')
