But, its my understanding that Twitch pays for a live performance license from the major music publishers to enable musicians to stream on their platform [1]. Of course, this didn&#x27;t work for Herman Li, but I think it at least speaks to their long-term goals for the platform.<p>Additionally, while they say to never play recorded music on stream, unless from a source where the copyrights are taken care of, their specific recommendations even in this &quot;clarification&quot; post are very opaque. Never play recorded music on stream, unless you own all the rights, but you probably don&#x27;t, if you&#x27;re not sure turn off your VODs. None of that is consistent with some overarching idea of why people get DMCA&#x27;d; would I get DMCA&#x27;d for playing recorded music live, but not having VODs? I would guess even Twitch doesn&#x27;t know; its outside of their control.<p>In short, music on Twitch is REALLY risky, primarily because their rights enforcement is so immature. Its akin to them wildly shooting in the air with a machine gun. YouTube&#x27;s Content ID is a bit more mature and predictable, so diversifying there may be a good idea.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.twitch.tv&#x2F;en&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;11&#x2F;music-related-copyright-claims-and-twitch&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.twitch.tv&#x2F;en&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;11&#x2F;music-related-copyright...</a>')
