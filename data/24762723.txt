I also don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;d consider that specific to serverless (it&#x27;s easy to create a ball of mud in anything).<p>All of our serverless projects are located in a single repository, and each little service gets its own little google doc that explains what it does, what functions it has, and any resources that it uses.<p>As mentioned below, as soon as an ETL gets multiple steps I agree that pure-lambda is not the right tool for the job (Airflow would be my preference, though we&#x27;ve also successfully used Step Functions)')
