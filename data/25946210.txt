The paragraphs are too short and are not as freestanding as they should be. For instance the following should have been folded into the preceding paragraph, which provided the vital context:<p>&gt; <i>But thatâ€™s often the cause of the failure.</i><p>I also find it jarring to read a sentence beginning with <i>and</i> or <i>but</i>, although not everyone agrees with me that it&#x27;s poor style.')
