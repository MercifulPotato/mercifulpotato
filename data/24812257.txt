Keybase never really wanted to bother with that and the implicit SLAs that come with it?  Charging money is a great way to actually guarantee it will be around for a while longer than your typical ad or VC funded &#x27;free&#x27; service.<p>I feel like the major problem with E2EE cloud services is getting apps to adopt it.  For example, I like bear editor, but I don&#x27;t like their encryption model.  I like standard notes &amp; inkdrop&#x27;s E2EE encryption models, but I don&#x27;t like them as editors that much since a bunch of their energy is probably being consumed by encryption stuff.  It feels like the engineers who make good UIs have a hard time doing well on the security standpoint and the ones who bother to make things secure have a hard time dealing with making good UIs.<p>I want something that the bear&#x27;s of the world will adopt and then they don&#x27;t have to think about E2EE anymore.')
