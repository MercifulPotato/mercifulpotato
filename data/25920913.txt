The brain doesn&#x27;t have to follow a specific model (e.g. the shaky model ML uses, and I alluded to), for the analogy to work.<p>It just has to have memory and remembrance as a core attribute of learning, which it does.<p>Whether this happens through neurons and weights or some other mechanism, it&#x27;s still remembering. Your counter-argument focused on implementation details.<p>&gt;<i>Remembering certainly plays a role in learning, though it is but one component. For it to be what learning is, everything has to be exactly the same with every instance.</i><p>Well, remembering doesn&#x27;t just &quot;play a role&quot;, it plays the biggest role in learning. It&#x27;s not even remotely optional: without remembering there&#x27;s no learning.<p>And inversely, discovering ourselves what we learn or applying it are both optional. I can listen to a professor tell me about something someone else discovered, and never apply it, but as long as I remember that information, I have learned it.<p>And, of course, as I already wrote, the contraption doesn&#x27;t just remember but also discovers the solution (and can even re-apply it).')
