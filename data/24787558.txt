They didn’t even want to hear problems internally in quiet. It still wasn’t appropriate to trash them or talk to the media while you were an employee.</i><p><i>&gt; If you don’t like it and you complain to HR or your manager and they don’t or can’t address the problem, you should work somewhere else. If enough people leave, change will happen. Before that, don’t expect much.</i><p>I&#x27;m curious, how did the PE situation you described work out? <i>Did</i> enough people leave to make change happen?')
