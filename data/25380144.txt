Car makers and oil companies employees for polluting the earth?<p>a lot of people complain about those all the time. In Iceland they even put them into prison.<p>&gt;The reality is most employees have virtually zero impact on the direction of their company<p>I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s true. Software workers, in particular at those large companies in senior positions wield quite a lot of influence. It&#x27;s right that they&#x27;re not owners of the firm, but they&#x27;re in short supply and they command a lot of power. That said, even your average lowly developer has a very simple choice to have more than zero impact. Don&#x27;t help them build these systems.')
