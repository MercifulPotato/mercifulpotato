Item(by='petercrona', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611304285, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25865436, text='Thanks for the comment and a very good point! Nice blog posts too!<p>I wrote a little about CO2 in <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.babyfriendlyair.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;guides&#x2F;air-pollution-primer&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.babyfriendlyair.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;guides&#x2F;air-pollution-prim...</a> .<p>I often see very high CO2 levels in bedrooms, which was also observed in the mini study <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mdpi.com&#x2F;2076-3417&#x2F;9&#x2F;17&#x2F;3533" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mdpi.com&#x2F;2076-3417&#x2F;9&#x2F;17&#x2F;3533</a> , and the simple act of leaving the bedroom door open might presumably therefore improve sleep quality (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;onlinelibrary.wiley.com&#x2F;doi&#x2F;abs&#x2F;10.1111&#x2F;ina.12435" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;onlinelibrary.wiley.com&#x2F;doi&#x2F;abs&#x2F;10.1111&#x2F;ina.12435</a>) according to these small studies. But of course, adequate ventilation could make sure this isn&#x27;t a problem regardless if the door is open or not.<p>Just to add to your point about the importance of ventilation, there are also VOCs (eg. from furniture off gassing and cleaning products) that HEPA filters can&#x27;t do much about, and at least in my experience (which is a bit skewed due to only measuring with &quot;cheap&quot; sensors), active carbon filters only help for a short while. Other technologies, like photocatalytic air purification, seem to also have limited effect, and do in turn produce CO2 as they break down pollutants (I&#x27;m not sure how much though), which again means adequate ventilation is important. So having &quot;control&quot; over where air gets in to the building is very helpful indeed, as you can&#x27;t get around needing an adequate air exchange.<p>You seem to know quite a bit about this already, but in case you or anyone else is curious, a few more articles:<p>Effects of Classroom Ventilation Rate and Temperature on Studentsâ€™ Test Scores\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;journals.plos.org&#x2F;plosone&#x2F;article?id=10.1371&#x2F;journal.pone.0136165" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;journals.plos.org&#x2F;plosone&#x2F;article?id=10.1371&#x2F;journal...</a><p>Stuffy classrooms may lower test scores (easier read that discusses the above but also some other studies)\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencenewsforstudents.org&#x2F;article&#x2F;stuffy-classrooms-may-lower-test-scores" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencenewsforstudents.org&#x2F;article&#x2F;stuffy-classr...</a><p>Poor air quality on the day of a test can have big impacts on how well a student performs (doesn&#x27;t discuss CO2 specifically though)\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aeaweb.org&#x2F;research&#x2F;pollution-effects-highstakes-tests" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aeaweb.org&#x2F;research&#x2F;pollution-effects-highstakes...</a><p>Possible future impacts of elevated levels of atmospheric CO2 on human cognitive performance and on the design and operation of ventilation systems in buildings\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;journals.sagepub.com&#x2F;doi&#x2F;full&#x2F;10.1177&#x2F;0143624418790129" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;journals.sagepub.com&#x2F;doi&#x2F;full&#x2F;10.1177&#x2F;01436244187901...</a>')
