A stable country where the citizens trust the government and judicial systems is resistant to corruption.  If you can destabilize those countries by spreading lies, hate, disinformation, etc. there&#x27;s an opportunity for the most corrupt morally bankrupt scumbags on the planet to come in and seize control of important assets and infrastructure.<p>Just watch closely for a while and you&#x27;ll see it happening everywhere.  There are lies and misinformation and hate and fear directed _everywhere_ no matter what &quot;side&quot; you&#x27;re on and the volume of it is massive.  Then the media and influencers and regular people amplify it and spread it and debate it until they all hate each other and don&#x27;t trust anyone.<p>It&#x27;s working too.  America is imploding.  The UK got duped into Brexit.  Several countries have a growing following of citizens that think immigrants and minorities are the cause of their misfortune even though those tend to be vulnerable groups that are exploited the most.  Cancel culture is dialed up to 11.  It&#x27;s crazy and scary.')
