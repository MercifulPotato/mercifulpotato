Through-trains, all to the same destinations, are every 2 minutes and the platform is frequently closed due to overcrowding.  To the point, in fact, where there&#x27;s often a one-way system enforced in the station, or people are kept at street level.<p>Ultimately it&#x27;s usage levels and capacity.  UK stations don&#x27;t have the capacity for the passengers, and often the capacity on the trains either.')
