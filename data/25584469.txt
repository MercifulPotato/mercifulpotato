Hiring someone&#x2F;something to drive your family around isn’t a reversion to the mean. You can make certain efforts (interviewing, not tolerating bad behavior, etc). It’s a third person version of the usual debate of ‘I’m a safe driver’ versus ‘I only had like three beers and that was two hours ago’ versus ‘robo car.’ If you bucket the first two together and throw your hands up in the air saying humans are humans oh well, you’re pretending you don’t have the agency you actually have.<p>In the third person version, I suppose there’s an implicit unstated option that while your particular chauffeur has evidence they are better than average, you have an option to hire someone more responsible. That aspect of agency is central here.<p>&gt; if the statistics he cites are correct and also apply to chauffeurs<p>I meant compared to the general population.
