It&#x27;s better to instead approach both constructing and using them as an exercise in making invalid states not expressible.<p>A macro lets you build a domain-specific abstraction that not only is extremely readable (matching the domain), but also ensures you just <i>can&#x27;t</i> produce things that don&#x27;t make sense domain-wise. In this way, such abstractions are much better than boilerplate you&#x27;d have to do with classical languages (though Haskell-like languages can probably get a similar effect through judicious use of types).')
