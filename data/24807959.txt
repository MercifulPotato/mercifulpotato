A single character in Japanese generally has many entirely different readings depending on context, and the strokes have pretty much no relation to any of those pronunciations; my Japanese wife says she didn&#x27;t speak aloud kanji while learning them, and I can&#x27;t even imagine how a 15+ stroke kanji would be &quot;sounded out&quot; as you wrote it if the form you&#x27;re pronouncing is a single syllable.')
