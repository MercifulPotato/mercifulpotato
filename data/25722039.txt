It would be a bigger threat to free speech if Twitter etc. were required to publish the president&#x27;s tweets just because he&#x27;s the president. Of course it might end up being a bad idea for tech companies to deplatform the president and his cronies, but doing so is <i>excersizing</i> free speech rights, not restricting them.<p>In general where two entities free speech rights are in conflict I would suggest it&#x27;s best to make sure the less powerful entity gets the right of way. As powerful as social media platforms are, they&#x27;re still not at powerful as the U.S. President.')
