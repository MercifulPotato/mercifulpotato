JavaScript-only sites are pretty fragile.<p>If the same content was just a normal HTML document it could at least be easily archived. It&#x27;s also trivial to keep online. Even if some CDN dies and CSS or JS doesn&#x27;t load it&#x27;s still readable.<p>JavaScript developers have never been great about progressive enhancement but it seems of late they&#x27;ve gotten <i>worse</i>. If the sole purpose of a site is to be an <i>app</i> then tons of JavaScript is necessary. But that&#x27;s a minority of sites. A blog post or news article doesn&#x27;t need to dynamically build the DOM with JavaScript and short circuit all of a browser&#x27;s loading and rendering logic.')
