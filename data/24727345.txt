What other company is doing this?<p>Facebook, Google and Amazon are known to do their own server design; it wouldn&#x27;t surprise me if any or all of them were doing custom processors (e.g. better virtualization features for their clouds, or processors that are more oriented towards their workloads). It doesn&#x27;t sound like innovation, more like cost cutting; these processors aren&#x27;t delivering a step change to end users, at best they&#x27;re squeezing out a little more battery life. (By contrast e.g. that sapphire screen that was rumoured would have been innovative, because sapphire can do stuff that glass simply can&#x27;t).')
