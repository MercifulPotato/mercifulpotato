There was a time that you could use chrome:&#x2F;&#x2F;global&#x2F;content&#x2F;config.xul to get to the old about:config, but they removed that too.  Don&#x27;t know why they did that, only people who wanted the old behaviour would use it.  Being able to sort by column is really useful, that&#x27;s what I miss.<p>Edit:  Didn&#x27;t see your last line about chrome:&#x2F;&#x2F;global&#x2F;content&#x2F;config.xhtml , now I can get the old behaviour back.   Thank you, thank you, thank you.')
