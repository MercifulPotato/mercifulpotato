The Oxford vaccine was developed in the UK. Of the approved vaccines, only the Moderna vaccine was developed in the US (and it&#x27;s actually being manufactured in Switzerland). The J&amp;J vaccine is being developed in Belgium.<p>That&#x27;s not to say that the US hasn&#x27;t been playing important roles, both now and in the research that enabled this. But &quot;without American ingenuity&quot; we&#x27;d be using vaccines from several other countries (including several more that are currently in development, as well as China and Russia, who have approved vaccines already in use).')
