If a part of a function is a hotspot of unavoidable complexity then it&#x27;s good to split it out and test it.<p>But then some people will say that you&#x27;re testing the internals of the caller and that you shouldn&#x27;t do that. If we follow that logic to the absurd, there should only be one test for the entire application, one for main(), or whatever your entry point is.<p>I&#x27;ve never seen an answer to this problem coded as an intelligible, easy-to-follow guideline. Empirically and intuitively I think my &quot;hotspot&quot; approach kinda works in maximizing reliability.')
