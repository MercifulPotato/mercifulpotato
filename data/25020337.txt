Same was said of Biden who barely squeaked out wins in key states.<p>Biden is winning those key states with more votes than Trump did in 2016, and the margins are going to continue to increase.<p>This narrative is driven almost entirely by the fact several of these states are now allowed to count mail in votes until the start of election day or after polls closed on ED. Without that, the narrative would be talking about Biden&#x27;s decisive victory in all these states.')
