Item(by='Izkata', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602084327, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24702457, text='&gt; but I think if you teach the &#x27;why of the equations&#x27; instead of just memorization of them - the memory would lock in with &#x27;forced memorization&#x27;<p>I have a simple but great example of that:  A decade of schooling and I could never remember the formula for volume of a sphere.  And then, one day when I was bored at my part-time job, I pulled out a piece of paper and used what I&#x27;d just learned in calculus to derive it.  It&#x27;s stuck with me since, now that all the parts of the equation have meaning.')
