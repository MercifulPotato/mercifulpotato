Item(by='chillfox', descendants=None, kids=[24808371], score=None, time=1602897984, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24806015, text='&quot;please update&quot; is kinda the &quot;try restarting&quot; equivalent for sysadmins. And people get angry because it is usually delivered in a &quot;I have no idea if it will work&quot; kinda way. \nAll you would have to do to make people calmly accept that they need to update is explaining why, so you know do the minimum and search the issue tracker so you can tell them that this is actually a known problem that was fixed in version x.y.z and updating will fix the problem.')
