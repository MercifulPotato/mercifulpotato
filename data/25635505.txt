In this otherwise forgettable story, the family settles on an Earth in a parallel universe where most of the taxes are property taxes. The rate is set by the government, but each parcel is self-assessed by the owner. The catch is that anyone, including the government can purchase the property at the assessed value at any time. It sounds like a good idea, that would encourage fairness, but I wonder if there are unforeseen consequences I am overlooking.')
