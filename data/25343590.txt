Item(by='taejo', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607421898, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25342851, text='&gt; But outside of a hospital environment the masks provide little protection, especially cloth masks.<p>My experience of talking to medical professionals is that they consider a number like 50% reduction in infections &quot;very little protection&quot;, because they (correctly) would use a mask providing 99% protection or whatever in any situation where real protection was needed. But outside of a hospital setting, epidemiologically, a 50% or even 20% reduction in reproduction number makes a big difference to the overall dynamics of an outbreak.')
