Newton and Leibniz developed calculus long before it could be given proper axiomatic foundations. If a theory turns out to be unsupportable, science abandons it and moves on, scavenging any useful ideas.<p>Maybe knowledge is more like a web than a building that strictly has to be built from the bottom up.')
