It led me to:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mondo2000.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mondo2000.com&#x2F;</a><p>From an interview on the front page, a snippet that captures a bit of that feeling:<p>&gt; ..There was this whole alternate, intellectual, metaphysical kind of thought in the 90s about where things were going. The Terrence McKenna school — we are going to find a way to get free of these monkey bodies and we’re going to find a way to enter other dimensions and we’re going to expand intelligence and extend life. We’re going to break free of a lot of these things that have held us monkeys back for thousands of years.<p>&gt; There’s a sadness when you hear [Robert Anton Wilson] talking about that now because it didn’t happen. The world now is even more fucked up than when he wrote <i>Illuminatus!</i> It just seems like we’ve been completely incapable of breaking free of that stuff. We’re still fighting the same pathetic cultural wars, the same primitive religious wars, despite our best angels pushing us forward to get better. The vast majority of humanity is just this epic failure. It’s sad.')
