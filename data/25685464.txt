But also as noted, its current feature set means it doesn&#x27;t really do a whole lot. It can&#x27;t even free memory. Unlike Java and Flash, it provides no cross platform GUI, file handling, etc. When you get right down to it, all it provides is cross platform primitive instructions. All the hard work of porting a WASM application to another platform is therefore just shifted to the runtime.')
