A place will probably want both, a low frequency one by policy and freedom for the employees to set any frequency to themselves. Voting doesn&#x27;t make any sense, you need all the participants to agree on a date.<p>The policy meetings ought to be fixed and with a low enough frequency that people can plan their lives after them. Like once every 6 months. Otherwise people will resent them.<p>After a date is set and the people come together, they can work on whatever they decided to have the meeting for. Of course, it&#x27;s probably not for doing solo-work, but the company shouldn&#x27;t dictate a lot here. It would go counter to the goal of the studios.<p>I imagine the company expects every worker to be able to meetup at some point.')
