Itâ€™s no different from any other CEO or union or high profile individual making endorsements. Ron understands that ranked-choice voting does not allow for multiple votes for the same candidate, though his enthusiasm for some candidates seems to have been interpreted otherwise. The fact is a lot of people in the tech community look to Ron for recommendations and he is glad to share them and encourage others to share them as well,&quot; said Alex Tourk, Conway&#x27;s political advisor in an email to Business Insider.</i>')
