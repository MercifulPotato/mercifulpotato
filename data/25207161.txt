Our wolf population (Czechia) has been expanding for years now, so the problems are very well known.<p>If the authorities want to keep both sheepgrazing and wolves in existence, they need to reimburse torn-down sheep quickly. Sheep are really prone to massive slaughter and if the governmental response is to investigate the event for 10 months trying to find a reason not to pay, the shepherds will find a way to get rid of the wolves, especially in countries with liberal gun laws.<p>Sheepdogs are a good solution for sheep, but they are dangerous to people. More so than wolves themselves, who tend to hide away from humans. In my country, hiking is somewhat of a national sport, the landscape is criss-crossed with marked trails. That brings hikers close to flocks of sheep and sheepdogs have a strong protective instinct and will stand their ground.<p>I like big predators, but finding a new equilibrium will take decades, especially in densely populated countries. It can be done, but the more people (and sheep) around, the higher the costs. Europe can definitely afford them now, though.')
