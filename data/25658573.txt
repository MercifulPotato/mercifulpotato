That could also help in a more rapid improvement of maps as opposed to the mostly-useless state it&#x27;s been in (except for a few countries and regions in certain countries that Apple likes and works more on).<p>If apple would have done that (for Maps and other services), how would it be different than Google?<p>Google offers these services for free to the end-user and generates revenue from ads.<p>Apple is using these services to sell more hardware devices, and generates revenue from there.')
