But I am ranting again... as for Tesla...<p>It&#x27;s all this frothy fed money and Elon, the guy steering the damned ship, doesn&#x27;t even think the value is warranted. He&#x27;s been saying for a year that the company literally cannot live up to the hype and the price will need to correct. I think investors are going to lose out big and Elon is going to look like the bad guy. After all, he kept irresponsibly using the Reality Distortion Field Generator which Jobs, peace be upon him, left him in his estate.<p>In the year 2017, Musk claimed that by 2019, the world would have cars that can drive itself while the passenger sleeps. He just didn&#x27;t mention it would drive you into a highway divider head-on at 80mph.<p>Damn these rants.')
