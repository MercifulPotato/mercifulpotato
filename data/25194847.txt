It depends on the type of service you receive. As a general rule, you&#x27;ll need to pay a yearly deductible before receiving insurance benefits for non preventative care. This can be anywhere from $500 to $8000. High deductible plans are commonly referred to as &quot;catastrophic&quot; plans, because the deductible is so high, and the kind of people who purchase them are typically not wealthy, that their owners would only seek care in a true emergency where the service would exceed the cost of the deductible. After paying your deductible you will often also have a &quot;co-pay&quot; which is typically a flat rate based on the type of service. Something in the realm of $25 to $500. After that, many plans have something called &quot;co-insurance&quot; which is a percentage of the bill you are responsible for even if you have met your deductible. Say, 20%.<p>Add all these charges and fees up, you&#x27;ll keep paying them until you hit your &quot;maximum out of pocket.&quot; So as an example, I was hospitalized a few years back in December while on what would be considered a &quot;good&quot; healthcare plan. I paid my $1000 deductible, a $250 co-pay for emergency room care, and co-insurance of several hundred dollars. I stayed a single night in the hospital and received a CT scan. I was given Tylenol, released the next day, and referred to a specialist. I wound up seeing the specialist in January, so my deductible reset. I was given another CT scan, so I had to pay my $1000 deductible again. The total bill for the entire process pre-insurance was in the realm of $80,000. After insurance, I paid $5000, which was my entire life savings at the time. I didn&#x27;t hit my maximum out of pocket for either year, so I got lucky in a way. I could have had to pay double what I did.')
