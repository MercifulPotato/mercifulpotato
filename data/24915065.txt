There&#x27;s a known correlation between low vitamin D readings and inflammatory diseases. Severe COVID complications seem to be primarily inflammatory in nature. It seems to me that folk that are prone to inflammatory problems are likely to both measure low on a vitamin D test and be prone to having a severe reaction to COVID.<p>A low vitamin D reading doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean you are vitamin D deficient. There are two forms of vitamin D in the body, inactive and active, and the more common&#x2F;cheaper blood test only measures the inactive form. The active form is what affects the body, though.<p>High levels of active vitamin D can cause serious damage to your body. It&#x27;s probably not a good idea to supplement vitamin D without consulting a doctor.')
