E.g. WW2 is clearly in scope: while we do have documentation and eye-witness reports for a lot of it, they are far from universal and on-site studies of battlefields, former prisoner camps, sites of war crimes, ... are done and contributing to what we know. And historians in general are dealing with even younger events, e.g. historians are studying the cold war (although I&#x27;m not aware of any archeological studies of it - maybe there are some of the actual wars during it?)<p>On the other hand, just because an investigation of a somewhat recent event is digging through material doesn&#x27;t make it archaeology, but I guess that&#x27;s partially distinguished based on motivations? (e.g. accident&#x2F;crime investigations etc)<p>EDIT: younger example: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.archaeology.org&#x2F;news&#x2F;8291-191213-south-carolina-vietnam" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.archaeology.org&#x2F;news&#x2F;8291-191213-south-carolina-...</a> &quot;Archaeologists are investigating a possible Vietnam Warâ€“era military training site at Fort Jackson, an initial entry training center for the U.S. Army in South Carolina, according to an ABC News report.&quot; - I guess discarded beer cans could be useful dating something like this')
