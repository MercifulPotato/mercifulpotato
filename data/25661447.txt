Architecturally, WebRTC connections are always peer-to-peer, in the sense that each transport carrying media is negotiated individually and does its own bandwidth shaping.<p>This has some really nice properties. Doing the bandwidth shaping individually for each transport maximizes video quality for each track, but it also means that in an N-way call you have to <i>encode</i> your outgoing video N-1 times. Even with a perfect network connection, you run out of cpu to do the encoding at some point.<p>Today, on a pretty new-ish laptop the limit for how many outgoing videos you can encode (&lt;waves hands about codecs and settings&gt;) is ~10. On an older Android phone that limit is ~1.<p>It&#x27;s possible to imagine changing how WebRTC works so that separate transports can reuse encoded streams. And hopefully that will become possible at some point (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.w3.org&#x2F;TR&#x2F;webrtc-nv-use-cases&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.w3.org&#x2F;TR&#x2F;webrtc-nv-use-cases&#x2F;</a>). But not anytime soon. :-(')
