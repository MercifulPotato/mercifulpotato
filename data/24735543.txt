Fortunately, I was able to write a parser to find the queries and rewrite them, at least for whatever subset of the language they used.  It&#x27;s been a while, but I think there was an issue with multi-query transactions, so the program warned that you&#x27;d have to convert and&#x2F;or verify some parts yourself, but fortunately there weren&#x27;t too many of those.')
