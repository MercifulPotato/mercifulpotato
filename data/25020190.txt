If you&#x27;re not reading the New York Times and the Atlantic you&#x27;re looking at Breitbart and Fox News. (There&#x27;s the Journal and the Economist, but they&#x27;re kind of dry, and you can subscribe to Substacks, sure, but those are mostly analysis, not news).<p>So if you&#x27;re a relatively technocratic person -- someone who say, believes that Trump&#x27;s handling of the pandemic has been abhorrent and climate change is real but also that Brian Armstrong&#x27;s blog post wasn&#x27;t unreasonable and looters are making BLM look bad -- there&#x27;s basically nothing for you.<p>I guess what I&#x27;m trying to ask here is -- am I crazy naive in believing that there could be a non-negligible audience for a more balanced news publication? The tricky thing about centrism is that it defines itself sort of inherently in relation to the two poles, but I still think there are a bunch of topics that a centrist newspaper could concretely offer a different take on, including technology and social justice.<p>Do you guys think that people WANT nuance, and can&#x27;t access it, or that mainstream media is just catering to people&#x27;s existing worst impulses to consume a flattened narrative?<p>I would be interested in having some concrete sense of number of interested people, so I&#x27;m including a Google Form if you want to get notified if I go anywhere with this idea.')
