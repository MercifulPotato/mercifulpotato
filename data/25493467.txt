When doing an MSc in neuroscience, even though our research was about the contribution of early visual areas to reading tasks, we always asked permission to get in contact if we found anything problematic on structural MRI scans. If someone explicitly says no to that (which I can&#x27;t remember happening - as you suggest, the vast majority of people would like to know) that&#x27;s their choice.<p>Edit: What no-one has said here is whether the initial study did say that, and the original researchers were going against the wishes of the participants. Given how the researchers behaved that doesn&#x27;t seem entirely unlikely.')
