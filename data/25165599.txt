Everything in Asia screams of respect for elders. In this case, the elders are the old design patterns and the older programming languages. It&#x27;s the thought of why do something when it&#x27;s not broken? As we move forward globally, we are all now realizing that it takes disruption to really create change. Something cultures in Asia are strongly against but are now slowly grasping. I believe this will all change within the next decade or so.<p>Just to add to this, I am Asian myself so I have experienced this and seen this first hand.')
