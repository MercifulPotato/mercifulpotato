The problem is that Greek money terms were fixed: 6 obols to the drachm; 20 drachms to the stater.<p>But the Seleucids minted obols in bronze, drachms in silver, and staters in gold. The value of each metal is set by market forces -- they move independently of each other. For silver, this wasn&#x27;t really an issue -- it was the reference currency, so a rise in the value of silver just meant that the price of everything fell. One drachm of silver stayed one drachm of silver.<p>But a change in the value of bronze caused problems. A bronze obol was always notionally worth one sixth of a silver drachm. But if the value of bronze had risen since the obol was minted, the coin might be worth more for its material than for its face value.<p>The only real solution is the one that was implemented; bronze coins contained much less bronze than their face value called for. At most one metal in a multimetallic coin system can be valued by weight.')
