From a public health perspective there is very little increase in danger for someone buying a <i>second</i> gun, especially of the same type. All of the risk is for their first firearm.<p>IIRC licensing programs for handguns typically have shown promising results in reducing firearm suicide in particular, but they&#x27;re also unpopular for predictable political reasons. If you&#x27;re pro-firearm, there is very little difference between &quot;you have to register your gun&quot; and &quot;you have to register to buy a gun&quot;.')
