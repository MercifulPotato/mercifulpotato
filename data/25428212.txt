The ticket to Paris was €60 for a 400 mile journey that takes 2hr15 pretty cheap. The cheapest option for that leg if we’d got up really early was €33, this was booking less than 12hrs before travel. That’s on the SNCF which is state run. The Eurostar from Paris to London is privatised and is much more expensive for some reason. Trains in the U.K. tend to be ridiculously expensive and slow compared to France but we have a privatised system that’s based on a poorly designed artificially created competitive market that just created a huge amount of expensive contract bureaucracy and no coordination between operations and maintenance.')
