Certain factions of society would like to present white supremacy as more prevalent than it is, and these include white supremacists, but upsettingly, also include organizations and political stances that &quot;fight&quot; white supremacy. These &quot;opposing&quot; factions would love to hijack the OK symbol as a white supremacist symbol, so that each can claim that white supremacy has more support than it does. Each of these factions will feel satisfaction of fighting their fight, as they point at pictures of West Point cadets, Mexican truck drivers, Japanese tourists, college kids having fun and say &quot;See! White supremacy is everywhere!&quot;<p>I have contempt for all of these people, who insist that &quot;OK&quot; is white supremacist. They promote white supremacy, irrespective of whether they are for it or against it. They turn a stupid joke into a battle cry, because they <i>want</i> to. This is despicable. Reprehensible. Awful.<p>If you actively insist that OK is white supremacist, you are a bad person and I have zero respect for you. Noam Chomsky talks about how the most violent of two opposing factions gain prestige within their factions by escalating drama and violence with the other faction. That&#x27;s you. You &quot;fight&quot; white supremacy by promoting it. Contemptible.')
