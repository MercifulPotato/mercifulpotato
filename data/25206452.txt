A small ISP came along (init7, they&#x27;re awesome <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.init7.net&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.init7.net&#x2F;</a>) and started offering symmetric gbit at $65 per month, disrupting the ISP market. The big ISPs were scrambling at first, now there&#x27;s actual competition, with offers like 10git for ~$40 a month (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fiber.salt.ch&#x2F;en" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fiber.salt.ch&#x2F;en</a>). Granted that&#x27;s marketing 10gbit and not real 10gbit, because it&#x27;s XG-PON [0], so &quot;up to 10gbit&#x2F;s&quot; and it&#x27;s a shitty ISP. But still way better than you used to be able to get.<p>So it would seem to me that many roads lead to rome. Eitherway I&#x27;m pretty happy because I don&#x27;t hate my ISP anymore, something that was unimaginable 10 years ago.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;10G-PON" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;10G-PON</a>')
