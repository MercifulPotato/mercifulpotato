Item(by='chills', descendants=None, kids=[25353610], score=None, time=1607469966, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25352626, text='The article mentions unions vs discriminated unions and then mentions nesting nullable being different than nesting optional, but it doesn&#x27;t really tie the knot.<p>Imagine (sorry for pseudocode):<p><pre><code>  type Option T = Some T | None\n  type Nullable T = T | null\n</code></pre>\nThe difference here is that Option &quot;tags&quot; each part of its union, which guarantees that the parts are disjoint. In Nullable, the parts of the union are disjoint only if T is not itself nullable. If T is S | null, Nullable T is S | null | null, which is just S | null (since null and null are not disjoint.')
