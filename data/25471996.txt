SpaceX flies Starlink with Xilinx FPGAs, while NASA and DoD are still baselining new platforms on incredibly expensive (albeit rad-hard) PowerPC RAD750 and similar. This is a huge bottleneck for any computationally intensive task we might want to do on-orbit, and I&#x27;m curious if or when it will change. It&#x27;s one technical reason, in my opinion, that the private sector is currently calling the shots in space.')
