Or people getting fed up with stupid politically motivated approaches gathering en masse to protest, making matters worse. The problem in Southern Europe is that people like to party. That still doesn&#x27;t warrant 1 km radius lockups which I hope would be deemed a violation of human rights in court. I understand that we&#x27;re not allowed to gather in large groups, but restricting going out on a bike ride alone or with your partner or walking the dog is quite a different matter. Also the French curfew is exagerated, eleven o&#x27;clock would have worked equally well. I guess we shall see in a few years which approach was correct.<p>I just hope the vaccines achieve immunity and stop this pandemic. This is great news. Too bad it&#x27;s not approved in the EU yet. Hopefully early next year.')
