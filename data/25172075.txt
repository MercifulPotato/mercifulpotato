No paradigm wins because none is substantially better. The tools&#x2F;libraries etc are much more important.<p>There might be a time where we see a new paradigm emerge victorious (like in the transition from machine code&#x2F;assembly to procedural). Or maybe programming will stop existing and we&#x27;ll just have A.I.')
