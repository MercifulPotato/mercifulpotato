If someone became an expert in editing snippets into movies with ffmpeg from the command line and then told me that writing movies that require lots of editing is just bad writing and that it would be better if I wrote my movies so they required as little editing as possible I&#x27;d look at them funny.<p>Isn&#x27;t it possible building up the system is a force multiplier in the same way that all the examples above the false restrictions prevent lots of progress?')
