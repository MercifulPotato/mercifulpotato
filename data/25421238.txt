We could e.g. take the infections from June and look at how many of those resulted in death as a final CFR estimate. However, the number I gave (deaths over cases) didn&#x27;t do that. It&#x27;s a preliminary CFR without that sort of correction, and a correction to final IFR can go up (people who haven&#x27;t died yet) or down (unidentified cases).<p>anoncake argued this was an overestimate by definition, and anyone who said otherwise didn&#x27;t have a clue. anoncake was wrong.')
