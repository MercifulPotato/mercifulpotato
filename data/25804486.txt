Difficult to describe, but that is really really nice<p>- I have the MBP and the only time I heard the fan was when I compiled the Rust toolchain.<p>- Tried to run Linux in Parallels but that didn&#x27;t work (some sort of weird error, didn&#x27;t investigate further)<p>- Within Xcode&#x2F;Swift everything works as expected, just much faster ;)<p>- My M1 has problems when I&#x27;m connecting my external 5K display. It works great, but when I put the M1 to sleep and wake it up again it can&#x27;t find the display anymore. Even plugging it in &#x2F; out doesn&#x27;t help. I read somewhere that that&#x27;ll soon be fixed with a software update.<p>- I had higher hopes for the ability to run iOS apps. I really wanted Netflix and Amazon Alexa to work. I hope they&#x27;ll reverse their stance to not support M1s at some point.<p>Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with the M1, but I still have a 2018 Mac mini that continues to be my main machine. I bought the M1 because I have an upcoming Mac app that I&#x27;ve worked on for ~2 years and I wanted to make sure it works on M1 (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hyperdeck.io" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hyperdeck.io</a>).')
