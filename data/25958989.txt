In fact, at one point, the exchanges would close every Wednesday just to give people time to catch up on all of the exchange of certificates<p>- everyone, rightly, agreed that there needed to be a better way and the idea of a clearing house emerged. In this model, all of the physical certificates lived in one place. Ownership was tracked via a central &quot;database&quot; (originally not electronic). This made it MUCH easier to transfer ownership aka &quot;settle&quot;. This is very similar to how gold is traded e.g. the NY Fed holds it for other countries etc<p>- An added benefit of a clearing house: it&#x27;s easy to see how much everyone owns of everything. e.g. if one party is over leveraged or has gone extremely short, in theory, the clearing house can choose to not deal with that party or, more flexibly, request additional capital etc.<p>Here is also a specific example about settlement risk:<p>- let&#x27;s say you report all of your trades to your clearing broker (think of them as a mini-clearinghouse)<p>- a data file gets lost or corrupted and the clearing broker says &quot;Wait! Something is wrong! We are not letting you trade until we get this figured out!&quot;<p>- EVEN IF YOU ARE CORRECT and they are wrong, you now have market risk because you may be holding a position that is losing you money. So much money in fact that it might drive you out of business.<p>The above is an actual answer to a settlement expert when asked &quot;What is your nightmare scenario?&quot;. This in turn, could have ripple effects to other clearing brokers and trading firms and is generally all part of &quot;settlement&quot; or &quot;clearing&#x27; risk.<p>Source: have worked in fintech trading for many years.')
