The following is about choosing Linux over alternatives.<p>I avoid Apple because of the slow descent into vendor &#x2F; walled garden lock-in, which suits neither my wallet nor personality.<p>I have a couple of ChromeOS devices for the kids&#x27; schooling, but they&#x27;re unwieldy for my workflow.<p>You didn&#x27;t ask, but I moved away from Windows because of increased bloat, telemetry and the dual issue of decreasing control of &quot;services running&quot; alongside noticeable slow-down of performance frustratingly too soon after a fresh install.  I&#x27;ve also had two occasions (which is two too many) where Windows decided, upon it&#x27;s own, to install updates and reboot, losing whatever I had open at the time, no message pre- or post-update just clean login screen next time I went to use the machine.  I think they&#x27;ve made that better, and there are options to control the nature of how updates are dealt with, but I&#x27;ve already made the jump.<p>&quot;what&#x27;s presented&quot; by Linux may not be perfect, but it&#x27;s closer to my perfection than the alternatives I&#x27;ve tried (to be clear, this is what works for me, not necessarily anyone else).')
