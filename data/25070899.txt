It&#x27;s optimized for real time encoding and not high quality or small file sizes. I think on H.264 it&#x27;s about equivalent to the x264 veryfast preset, no clue how the H.265 quality stacks up, only the more recent Intels even support that. NVENC has better quality, but still a software two-pass encode will give much better results.<p>It&#x27;s the same on these phone chips, sure the encode is much quicker, but it&#x27;s not a fair comparison because you have much more control over the process using software. We&#x27;ll have to wait and see how the quality and file size on the M1 encoder stacks up.')
