(BTW very nicely walked around that hot bowl of mess!)<p>First, Usenet was just as much of a dumpster fire as Reddit et al. in some branches (<i>alt.</i> I am looking at you).  The rest (comp. soc. sci. etc) were heavily self moderated.<p>Second, I am not sure the author is clear on what is the primary product of social media, as I see it. We, the users are the product.  By moving to a protocol, there is little to no opportunity to capture private information about the product. (Not complexity, too big, or filter bubble.)<p>Why would a platform give up such income stream?<p>Am I misunderstanding what the author means by protocol here?')
