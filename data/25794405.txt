That &quot;inflated fee&quot; would have to be over a dollar to cover the costs of doing the transaction; possibly several dollars. Not only are there the costs associated with the payment, but also the additional code infrastructure, dealing with complaints, excruciating security, etc.<p>As you say, it would likely cost as much as the dead-tree edition, and how much usage would it get? What fraction of people would ever use it? I suspect a lot of people would say, &quot;I could see giving you $.05 or $.25 for this, but I&#x27;m not going to pay $3.00 to read one article. And I don&#x27;t want access to more than that; I just want this article.&quot;<p>I mean, it would probably be worth the experiment for some major newspaper or magazine. I bet somebody has tried. But the history of micropayments is already a long string of failed attempts. Money just makes everything hard, and there seems to be a minimum below which it&#x27;s just not worth it.')
