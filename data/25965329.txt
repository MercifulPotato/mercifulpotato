Item(by='sramsay', descendants=None, kids=[25970120], score=None, time=1611972766, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25962568, text='&gt; intent to manipulate the price (which IS illegal)<p>Is it &quot;illegal price manipulation&quot; even if it&#x27;s done completely out in the open for everyone to see?  (I&#x27;m seriously asking this question).<p>I feel like laws governing market manipulation imagine secret collusion among actors that one might reasonably assume are either competing with one another or pursuing their interests independently.<p>But in this case, the actors are entirely transparent with their motives.  Anyone can go see what they&#x27;re up to.  Figuring out why these stocks suddenly went through the roof required no formal investigation at all, as far I know; it didn&#x27;t take long to figure out <i>why</i> it was happening.<p>I also wonder whether those motives are even an issue here. Certain people in the system might be legally bound to be truthful with their clients, they might be required to pursue their clients&#x27; interests faithfully, and so forth.  But isn&#x27;t it true that as an individual investor, I am perfectly free to invest in stocks based on my horoscope, my initials, random throws at a dartboard, or anything else?<p>In other words, are the &quot;lulz&quot; illegal here?  Is it illegal to not be &quot;serious&quot; with the market (whatever that means)?<p>Let&#x27;s suppose there&#x27;s a massive oil spill tomorrow.  Everyone goes on reddit and says, &quot;Hey, let&#x27;s destroy this company by executing the following actions with the following securities . . .&quot;  (let&#x27;s assume this is possible for a moment).  Is that &quot;market manipulation?&quot;  Is that illegal?  Is that &quot;abusive&quot; (as the SEC puts it)?  After all, in that case, they are <i>trying</i> to abuse the company for reasons they regard as entirely rational and reasonable, and they&#x27;re doing it for all to see.<p>[edits for grammar and clarity]')
