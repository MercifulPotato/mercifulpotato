I wouldn&#x27;t go so far as to say that I&#x27;ve <i>learned</i> it, but it hits all the pain points I&#x27;ve had with every other language. It honestly feels like a gift from the universe that shouldn&#x27;t, by rights, exist; a fast, dynamic, elegant language that seems to do The Right Thing at every turn. I do believe it will gradually eat the world, in the way that Python did.<p>I&#x27;ve already replaced some little utilities I wrote in C with Julia equivalents. They were easier to write, handle errors more gracefully, and run several times faster (because free multithreading).')
