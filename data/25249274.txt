You know you need to transmit a secret, but it is rare that people think about under what future circumstances they will want to deny having sent it.<p>The second is a practical defeat of the assumed security model. The GPG secret is a high-value target that is relatively easy to snag from unencrypted memory on untrustworthy devices.')
