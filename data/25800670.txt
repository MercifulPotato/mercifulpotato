The most important thing to me (and I suspect many other people in favor of decentralization&#x2F;federation) is the ability to host my own service. I couldn&#x27;t care less if 90% of email users are on gmail as long as I can run own email server or pay someone else to run one for me while still communicating with everyone.')
