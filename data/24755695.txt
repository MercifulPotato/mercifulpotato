Item(by='gambiting', descendants=None, kids=[24757260], score=None, time=1602517932, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24755557, text='Look, I don&#x27;t disagree with you, it&#x27;s a problem - but I can guarantee that more Ferrari customers are affected by someone trying to steal their car than there are Ferrari customers driving through an unpopulated desert with no phone signal(and trying to do roadside repair). It&#x27;s just a question of probabilities, and the first issue seems more important to solve.<p>Besides, I think there&#x27;s a certain fundamental misunderstanding here - the car disabled itself because it &quot;thought&quot; it was being stolen. It&#x27;s no different than triggering a car alarm in any car made in the last 30 years - most systems will kill the ignition until you reset the alarm.<p>The difference here is that Ferrari can unblock the car remotely for you - but I&#x27;m certain it&#x27;s also possible in-person with some kind of key&#x2F;button input or some diagnostic device.<p>It&#x27;s no different than what 1990s volkswagens used to do, if you removed the battery the radio would be locked until you entered a special pin code, but of course the dealership wouldn&#x27;t give you the pincode, you had to take it to them and pay them some money. The only difference here is that Ferrari can now do this remotely(if you have signal).')
