I usually write a big sprawling one-page HTML, magnify it, and do a presentation by gradually scrolling them. The advantages are obvious:<p>- No need to tweak the content to fit the page boundary.<p>- Highly accessible (adjustable to any screen).<p>- No JS.<p>- All figures are in SVGs.<p>- Can also support printing (just insert CSS page break).<p>- (edit) The scroll bar always shows where you are in the slides.<p>I keep recommending this to my colleagues, but they&#x27;re still sticking with PDFs and PowerPoints.')
