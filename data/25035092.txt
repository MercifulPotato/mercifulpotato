A week or so ago I read about an experiment in Brazil that compared 5 of them. So this Pfizer press release doesn&#x27;t seem terribly exciting to me. I already knew it was very likely that at least one vaccine will be available to some people in a month or so.<p>I know a couple of people who are experimental subjects in COVID-19 vaccine trials (meaning that they may or may not have received a COVID-19 vaccine: it&#x27;s double-blind, of course). It&#x27;s an interesting question what happens to those people if they become elligible for real vaccination before the trial they are participating in has come to an end.')
