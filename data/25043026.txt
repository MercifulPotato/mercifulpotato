Aristocrats were the best fighters in their day. They were the ones with money for good arms and time to train well, besides which fighting was for many of them their profession.<p>Besides, &quot;toughest warriors ever&quot; sounds more like popular colouring than an academic assessment. I don&#x27;t know a lot about Vikings but as I understand they were principally raiders, which I would absolutely expect to perform worse than a Frankish aristocrat-led army.')
