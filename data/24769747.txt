Nobody can really control when someone takes a nefarious interest in them. Public identity is only fine if there&#x27;s nobody out there who wants to harm you. But since you can&#x27;t control who wants to harm you, you can&#x27;t really decide in advance if having a public identity is OK or not. The answer isn&#x27;t &quot;stay off the Internet&quot; which is tantamount to &quot;don&#x27;t leave your house.&quot; This is why Facebook tries to put controls in the hands of the tagged; they only did that after a string of teenage suicides related to cyber bullying. Surely these kids thought they had no reason to be so concerned. But it turned out they did, they couldn&#x27;t control the damage done to their reputation, and killed themselves.')
