Item(by='marcan_42', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608123701, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25441692, text='That GSM one is.... exactly the same as this attack.<p>Literally.<p>DDR3-1600 RAM, 800MHz I&#x2F;O bus, 800MHz GSM frequencies. Pump out data encoded in bursts of noise by exercising RAM. Receive it with a hacked phone. They built on all the work of OsmocomBB (which already is a completely open source GSM stack on a commercial phone baseband). Even building on such a powerful and well-documented platform, they only got a, quite honestly, pathetic ~1.5 bit&#x2F;second speed out of it, making excuses about &quot;inadequate access to the DSP&#x27;s full capabilities&quot; and it being an old phone (which is nonsense, the entire point is that it&#x27;s an open stack, thus much easier to build powerful software on even with hardware limitations, they just weren&#x27;t capable).<p>Then they gave up on OsmocomBB and just used an SDR as a receiver to get 1kbps.<p>Sorry, this is just sad. Anyone actually experienced in these fields would be able to do orders of magnitude better, guaranteed, with that kind of hardware.<p>Oh yeah, there&#x27;s an appendix to the paper where they got it to work with an unmodified Android phone... by putting it 10cm from the motherboard, so the emission jams the cell signal, and you see the bars drop. No actual bitrate attempted, but it looks like you wouldn&#x27;t get more than 0.5bps out of that from their graph.<p>And now 5 years later he&#x27;s rehashing the same exact technique, on a different frequency. Sigh.')
