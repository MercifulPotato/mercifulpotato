Yes, there&#x27;s nuance and as soon as multiple people are involved there&#x27;s the risk of public outcry, but as far as I know, there&#x27;s not a legal obligation for a peace officer to make an arrest just because they have witnessed a crime. Whether there is a social obligation to make an arrest is highly situational and depends on not only the crime but the surrounding circumstances.')
