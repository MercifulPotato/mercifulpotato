I donâ€™t think the individual flight rate would be anywhere close to $50&#x2F;kg for the vast majority of customers.<p>The more relevant number is the all-in immediate price per launch, the rate where one could simply wire the money and SpaceX would launch next week, divided by the actual thing(s) launched, which will weigh some intermediate amount. And compare that to the same for the other rockets.')
