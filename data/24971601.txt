But the pain receded in seconds each time, and the whole inspection takes maybe 10 minutes.<p>It was really interesting to see what the doctor saw, fully alert, and be able to leave immediately afterward without a ride.<p>For those who are curious, not squeamish, and don&#x27;t mind a little transitory discomfort during a professional procedure, consider less or no sedation.')
