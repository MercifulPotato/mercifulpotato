I&#x27;m not returning it, but I can&#x27;t particularly recommend it - both the annotation and eReading experiences are significantly inferior to what you&#x27;d get with Onenote, Notability, or Drawboard on iPad&#x2F;Surface.<p>The reMarkable hardware is nice, but its stock software is frankly disappointing.  The hackability is a &quot;plus&quot;, but I don&#x27;t want to have to resort to unsupported firmware tweaks to fix a $500 device.<p>Specific feedback:<p>* Zooming is incredibly coarse.  There is no pinch zoom, only a button in the UI that jumps in intervals of 100% or more.  On many of my documents it goes from slightly too small to WAY too big with no level in between<p>* Speaking of zooming, the pen controls overlay the document, often blocking parts of the text.  There is no way to scale the document to fit in the remaining space.  There&#x27;s not even a way to have the button backgrounds be transparent so you could still read most of the text.<p>* It doesn&#x27;t support in-document hyperlinks in PDF or ePub, so your table of contents and index are worthless.<p>* If you somehow know what page you want to jump to, that&#x27;s buried two menus deep and frustrating to get to<p>* Search is very slow in large (100+ page) documents, and results trickle in gradually so you can never be quite sure when you&#x27;re looking at the whole list.  Given that one of my desired uses for the device is to carry around some PDF textbook-style references, this hurts.<p>* You can&#x27;t change the default writing utensil, so if you don&#x27;t like the grainy mid-width pencil you have to change it every single time you open a new document<p>* There&#x27;s no pressure sensitivity in the pen<p>* The eraser works like a pencil eraser, not a digital one.  There is no way to erase a stroke, so you&#x27;ll inevitably erase more than you want to and have to redraw some of it')
