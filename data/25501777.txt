Its not just about touch-less payments (which doesn&#x27;t actually require the Apple Card), it&#x27;s the way you are notified, legibility of bills, convenience and immediacy of cash back, nicely integrated and payment options plus a bunch of other great features. Notably, Apple was the only card company which notified me in a conspicuous way that I had the option to skip payments during COVID.<p>Nothing is specifically amazing about the Apple Card, but collectively it&#x27;s easily the best credit card I&#x27;ve had. The only time I use my other cards at all is when they have significantly better cash back programs. (Amazon card for example)<p>Your comment is close to the truth though. Apple&#x27;s strength is in creating polished&#x2F; well integrated products. Often those products don&#x27;t need bleeding edge tech, just someone integrating them better than existing players. The credit card is kind of a classic example. It&#x27;s not fundamentally different, just a better experience all around.')
