I kinda think that distributed SQL is a mostly commoditised space, and wondered what replaced Spark for distributed training.<p>For context, I&#x27;m a DS who&#x27;s spent far too much time not being able to run useful models because of hardware limitations, and a Spark cluster is incredibly good for that.<p>Additionally, I&#x27;d argue in favour of Spark even for ETL, as the ability to write (and test!) complicated SQL queries in R, Python and Scala was super, super transformative.<p>We don&#x27;t really use Spark at my current place, and every time I write Snowflake (which is great, to be fair), I&#x27;m reminded of the inherent limitations of SQL and how wonderful Spark SQL was.<p>I&#x27;m weird though, to be fair.')
