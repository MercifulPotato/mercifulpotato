Pardoned restaurant chain fraud for an italian not even charged in NY. Sounds like mafia related crime to me.<p>The other no name money laundering criminals are all related to either his gambling businesses or his place of living in Florida.<p>He&#x27;s basically pardoning people he&#x27;s been doing crimes with for a long time and then if course some big names.<p>I&#x27;m happy to see some rappers pardoned though tbh. Their music has influenced my life, they&#x27;ve done  great deal of good outside of music and none of them were in the can for things like harming women or animals etc.')
