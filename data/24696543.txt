If you look to the side of the display, you can notice the rendering getting blocky. If you search for it, you can make out a border from sharp rendering to blocky rendering, but it&#x27;s seldom noticeable in normal gaming.<p>Since the field of view is limited in today&#x27;s VR displays anyhow, you don&#x27;t lose much from the foveated rendering: if you look to the side of display, much of your own field of view is now black, which is more limiting than the fact that the few pixels that you still see are rendered in a blocky fashion.')
