Mine is the exact opposite. I make several hundreds of thousands of dollars for working about six hours a day indoors in a nice chair with air conditioning. I don’t care about the company’s success nor do I need to care. If my kid is sick or I’m having an off day I just don’t come in. I can afford basically anything I genuinely want. It’s a very good bargain from my side.')
