Item(by='nextdnsleaks', descendants=2, kids=[25077235, 25077380], score=11, time=1605194020, title="Tell HN: Nextdns.io, a “privacy” company, leaks users' email and violates GDPR", item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='Dearest HN community, I am reporting today a leakage of users&#x27; email addresses on the nextdns.io website.<p>When you sign up for an account, a POST request is made to a website called &quot;intercom.io&quot;, it also sets cookies in your browser, a GDPR violation as no consent was provided. This can still be done as of the creation of this post, so you can see the violation of the GDPR for yourself.<p>If you study the request using dev tools, you will see the following is sent (among others):<p>URL: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;api-iam.intercom.io&#x2F;messenger&#x2F;web&#x2F;ping<p>Data sent to their server:<p>user_data: {&quot;email&quot;:&quot;email@email.com&quot;} - this is your email<p>page_title: Setup - My First Configuration - NextDNS<p>referer: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;my.nextdns.io&#x2F;[url]&#x2F;setup<p>When disclosing this issue, one of the founders sent me this URL:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;nextdns&#x2F;comments&#x2F;jayc69&#x2F;googleanalytics_scripts_running_on_the_homepage&#x2F;<p>In the sticky reply, it suggests they&#x27;ve known about this leakage for at least a few weeks, if not longer.<p>Here&#x27;s NextDNS privacy policy:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nextdns.io&#x2F;privacy<p>&quot;We do not (and will never) sell, license, sub-license or share any of the data submitted directly or indirectly by our users with any person or entity.&quot;<p>Lol. That was clearly a pack of lies then, wasn&#x27;t it?<p>Here&#x27;s intercom&#x27;s privacy policy (note point 4 and who they share NextDNS users&#x27; emails with):<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.intercom.com&#x2F;legal&#x2F;privacy<p>That is all.<p>(P.S I did disclose this to them first, I did ask for a bounty, considered standard procedure for reporting such issues, and the co-founder didn&#x27;t seem to understand how&#x2F;why this is an issue, so I am letting the HN community decide instead).')
