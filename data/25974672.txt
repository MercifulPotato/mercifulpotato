In comparison, macOS is truly an infuriating platform because Apple strips their code and recommends others do so to (it&#x27;s done automatically as part of deployment postprocessing) for size improvements but because Apple and third party developers are sold on the FUD that providing symbols will ruin their business nobody ever provides them separately. (Aside: if you ship software and run any sort of stripping&#x2F;minification on it and want to claim it is for the size benefits exclusively, you are honor bound to provide the information you removed, whether that is DWARF or a source map. No exceptions. Personally, I consider this important enough to not do these things at all, but I get it if you fall on the other side of the &quot;size vs. inspectability&quot; spectrum–you just need to also provide the stuff you throw away if you don&#x27;t want to be annoying.)<p>More on point, though, I can see both Windows and Linux getting the experience of finding debug symbols to be pretty good™–but for the same reasons I cannot see macOS getting this unless attitudes change. Apple of course runs this internally and &quot;forgets&quot; to share the scripts with us, and I have heard of other companies doing similar things, but I don&#x27;t see any sort of unified effort in this area at all :(')
