The other day a major service gave me less than 10 seconds to solve a puzzle with a mouse in a maze and some cheese, and subsequently locked out of my account.<p>Actually before I got locked out, I thought I would stand more chance with the alternative for the visually impaired. It jumped straight in to a fuzzy voice reading 20+ numbers at a rate of more than 1 per second. I was already behind on typing them in before it started, and I failed that too.<p>Its as if solving an unfamiliar problem with fuzzy images&#x2F;audio (that are increasingly fuzzed beyond the absurd) wasn&#x27;t mad enough. But now I&#x27;m expected to be faster than a computer as well.')
