You still need to set up your DNS records for the second domain like the first.<p>(I bought two domains and did exactly what you&#x27;re asking - after using the first for a day or so, having decided I liked the other one better I reached in and simply flipped the dropdown and chose the second one to by the default, clicked OK and it all just worked nicely)<p>When I look at my set message headers, it would appear that your primary @fastmail.com (or whichever of their domains you choose) is your actual primary, and that even your first domain is just an alias to the actual user account domain.')
