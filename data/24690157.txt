It all works out because the operations are atomic (heh) (don’t need to worry about two proteins trying to break down the same molecule at the same time) and the type safety (proteins are highly specific on what kind of chemicals they target) means you don’t need to worry about trying to perform some invalid operation.<p>Turns out collision detection is real fast in real life!')
