I became a single dad when I had a baby and a two year old. Honestly, I don&#x27;t think most men are wired for doing this role. The 4-5 years that followed were very difficult for me mentally. I was socially isolated, had no support (all support structures were mother orientated) and I had two really little kids to care for.<p>I&#x27;m not sure if I changed, or it&#x27;s simply easier for me now they&#x27;re a bit older, but over time I had merged into this parenting role really well. My kids are both happy and well balanced, other kids and adults both like them and they&#x27;re doing really well at school.')
