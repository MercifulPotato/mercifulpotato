Item(by='Lammy', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610402808, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25737726, text='I like Aruba Instant APs, the kind that don&#x27;t require cloud management or a separate controller, though it seems they&#x27;ve folded the IAP line into the regular AP line or something with their new Wi-Fi 6 gear.<p>I&#x27;m still using Wi-Fi 5 because it&#x27;s fast enough and cheaper. My central AP is a IAP-315, an IAP-305 in the garage, and another IAP-305 at the wall by the back yard. They&#x27;re all PoE and linked with wired backbone to form a single big coverage area using a single elected IAP leader as controller for the rest.<p>You shouldn&#x27;t have trouble buying grey-market ones as long as you are careful to stick to the same regulatory domain for all of them. Aruba gear is available as USA&#x2F;FCC, Japan, Israel, and RW (Rest of World) versions. I have operated RW units in FCC territory (<i>proooobably</i> legally but probably not worth the risk) by setting them to &quot;US Virgin Islands&quot; so they match FCC-allowed frequencies and power limits, but linking more than one AP still requires the hardware to be same regulatory domain.')
