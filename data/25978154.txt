They only need to do that if you have enabled fractional scaling.<p>Fractional scaling is exactly what we&#x27;re talking about. At 1x&#x2F;2x everything works.<p>&gt; If you really want to avoid the overdraw associated with that, just don&#x27;t use any scaling on your primary display and then turn the font size in your client up.<p>That&#x27;s what I do but doesn&#x27;t work with mixed-DPI. The fact that it works and improves things just shows how this could be done better.<p>&gt; The reason you pass the buffer scale in wayland is because you explicitly want the compositor to scale your buffer and you want it to do it correctly. If you don&#x27;t want that, don&#x27;t bother with messing with fractional scaling.<p>That&#x27;s circular. You&#x27;re arguing that the way things are done is an argument for things to continue to be done like that.<p>&gt; Only the simplest of browsers, image viewers, 3D renderers, PDF viewers that have no UI chrome could get away with just passing on a fractionally scaled buffer.<p>Both Firefox and Chrome have their whole UI scalable at arbitrary values and have for many years. See layout.css.devPixelsPerPx in Firefox for example. There&#x27;s nothing special about the window where the Webpage&#x2F;PDF&#x2F;3D gets rendered versus the UI. Vector UIs that can scale arbitrarily not only exist they&#x27;re widely used. And the worst case is still &quot;if you don&#x27;t know any better do 2x and scale down yourself client&quot;.<p>&gt; And for those, you can do what I described above, disable fractional scaling and do your scaling in the client, you don&#x27;t need any special support in the compositor. I believe in most applications you can press Ctrl-Plus and Ctrl-Minus :)<p>You can&#x27;t disable fractional scaling on a per-program basis, it wouldn&#x27;t work at all, and it would still be broken in a mixed DPI setting. I want the Browser&#x2F;PDF&#x2F;Image&#x2F;3D windows on my 1440p screen to have different scaling from my 4K screen and for them to switch scaling automatically, just like they resize automatically, when I switch them between screens. That&#x27;s currently not possible because there&#x27;s no support for it in Wayland.')
