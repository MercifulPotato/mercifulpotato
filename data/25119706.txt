Item(by='redvenom', descendants=None, kids=[25120272], score=None, time=1605580336, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25118865, text='The answer you got from lmm and others is wrong (I am a professional mathematician and did research in logic).<p>The completeness theorem says simply: if T is a first-order theory (list of axioms in first-order logic), any sentence true in every model of T is provable by logical deduction in T.<p>The first incompleteness theorem says: if T is a consistent recursively enumerable theory that can contains a sufficient amount of Peano arithmetic, then there exists a sentence which is neither true in all models nor false in all models. In other words, there is a sentence which is true in at least one model of T, and false in another.<p>The second incompleteness theorem says that if T can interpret Peano arithmetic, then we cannot prove the consistency of T within T.<p>So a tl;dr:<p>-Completeness: any SENTENCE true in ALL models is PROVABLE - applies to all first order theories<p>-1st Incompleteness: there EXISTS sentences which are TRUE in some models, FALSE in others. - Applies to theories that contain enough arithmetic<p>-2nd Incompleteness: if a sufficiently strong system is CONSISTENT, we CANNOT PROVE that CONSISTENCY within the system.<p>NB: of course, if you have a sufficiently WEAK system, like the axioms of group theory together with &quot;FOR ALL x FOR ALL y (x=y)&quot;, then that theory would be COMPLETE and Godel&#x27;s incompleteness theorem does not apply here.')
