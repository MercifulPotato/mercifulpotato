I can&#x27;t really put my finger on why, but perhaps it falls into the &quot;uncanny valley&quot; where it looks a lot like Ruby but is slightly different in peculiar ways.<p>I vaguely recall being confused about including other files and module definitions last time, like you could put the requires in really weird places. It has been a while, though.<p>Oddly, I found Elixir much more enjoyable, and extremely quick to learn. Whereas Crystal feels like an attempt to build a &quot;compiled Ruby&quot;, Elixir feels more like it took the ideas behind what Ruby is and applied it to a wildly different design, and as a result actually feels like how Ruby felt when I first learnt it.<p>But I do give Crystal a go every once in a while just to see if I finally get the hang of it.')
