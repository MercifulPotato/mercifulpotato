The IRT and the BMT were the original systems and operated on different loading gauges. The city then built the IND system before acquiring the IRT and BMT and consolidating them into one system. The IND system itself is built to the same loading gauge as the BMT, so that the BMT and IND are interchangeable for operational purposes, but the IRT is not interchangeable. The remnants of this is seen in the line names: the numbers are the IRT lines, and the letters are BMT or IND lines.<p>Note that while the loading gauges are different, other operational aspects (such as signalling and traction power) are the same. So the delay in getting this information up is less a factor of &quot;there&#x27;s multiple systems&quot; and more &quot;the MTA can&#x27;t&#x2F;won&#x27;t modernize its systems to get this information.&quot;')
