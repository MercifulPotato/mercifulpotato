As the application will run on this, in a similar way that you would have to install a JVM + classpath for Java apps. And this one is really fat an ugly.<p>For &quot;cpu bloat&quot;, even if JIT can be more efficient on the long run, there is usually a higher cost at startup. For GUI application that you start often, like a calculator, that could be annoying.<p>For &quot;ethics&quot;, the code will have to run on the mono(ie .net) kind of jvm and so you are dependent of this engine to run your code. And this engine, even if mono is the open source one, is controlled by Microsoft.\nThey control the language, they control the features, and it is not the spirit that built the linux community to rely on &quot;base components&quot; controlled by Microsoft.\nIt is a little bit like the control that Oracle has on Java even if not completely similar.')
