It doesn&#x27;t reset back to 15% in year two.<p>So a developer making $1,000,001 in year 1 will pay ~$150,000 in fees because they would just pass the threshold, but then makes $1,000,001 in year 2 will pay ~$300,000.<p>As a developer and growing business, I think I&#x27;d prefer a higher rate over on revenue above the threshold and reset it every year. A bit like how the tax system work in the UK.')
