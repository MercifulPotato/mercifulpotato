Item(by='6gvONxR4sf7o', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606944447, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25279275, text='I think it&#x27;s still not that frequent. More frequent than I expected before running the numbers, though. Let&#x27;s say you have a five number interesting sequence starting at N. If the highest number that you can draw is M, then at most, you will have M-5 of these possible. Call it M of them. But we probably don&#x27;t have sequences starting at each N.<p>Let&#x27;s say we&#x27;ve got k of these different kinds of interestingnesses, and an average sequence can start at like a quarter of the numbers. Then the number of draws that we would consider interesting are no more than 0.25 * k * M. So the probability of an interesting draw is 0.25 * k * M &#x2F; (M choose 5). If M = 69 (apparently the PowerBall rules), then it&#x27;s 0.25 * k * 69 &#x2F; 11238513 = k &#x2F; 651508.<p>The probability of drawing one of these in c draws is 1 - (1 - k &#x2F; 651508)^c. For a draw to be at least 50-50 (where it becomes more surprising to <i>not</i> have seen one, that&#x27;s at least -log(2)&#x2F;log(1 - k&#x2F;651508) draws.<p>For 5 interesting sequences, that&#x27;s about 90k draws. For 10 interesting sequences, that&#x27;s about 45k draws. For 100 interesting sequences, it&#x27;s about 4.5k draws. By 100 sequences, I think the number of numbers the sequence is eligible to start at will drop by a ton. Even having a quarter of numbers be eligible start positions with 10 really interesting sequences seems like a tall order.<p>So I&#x27;d guess the number of draws for a &quot;real&quot; answer is between 5k and 100k draws.<p>Looks like about 50 U.S. states and territories do it 2x &#x2F; week. I don&#x27;t know internationally, but let&#x27;s double that number to 100 places, 2x per week: 200 draws per week.<p>5k&#x2F;200-100k&#x2F;200 = 25 - 500 weeks = 6mo to a decade before this isn&#x27;t surprising. I&#x27;m leaning more toward the decade end.')
