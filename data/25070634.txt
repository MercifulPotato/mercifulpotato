There is barely any consumer inflation which means there is no demand for low income workers. Asset inflation on the other hand is growing steadily which means high income workers and capitalists see their incomes rise rapidly.<p>Inflation is merely the rise in price when demand exceeds supply. Since consumer inflation is dead it follows that there is an abundance of goods, primarily because companies have access to a lot of capital but they don&#x27;t have to deploy that capital in the USA or Europe and actually employ workers there. They can simply deploy it in countries with low labor costs. In principle that is perfectly fine because countries like India and China deserve to grow but in practice it means that a lot of the money printing is completely misguided. It&#x27;s like taking the wrong medicine. It won&#x27;t cure you but you will still suffer from side effects. The end result is a lot of overalued stocks without any of the economic performance to justify their market cap.<p>Instead of a UBI it would make sense to have jobs programs that invest into public infrastructure like road maintenance or into the power grid. Those jobs cannot be shipped away to another country and they are the type of &quot;busywork&quot; that is actually useful without directly competing with private industry.')
