Not migraine-levels of pain, but leave work and go lay down kind of pain.<p>I wonder what that mechanism is. Why not worse headaches, or any headaches with large doses? Why would such a tiny amount cause so much pain?<p>Has anyone here experienced anything similar?<p>It&#x27;s a shame because I enjoy the glow of microdoses prior to the delayed onset of the headache. I don&#x27;t feel anything remotely like a trip, but I do feel a sort of positivity and warmth I otherwise wouldn&#x27;t. Almost like my mind has slowed down to take a break, and as a result, it feels a little nicer.')
