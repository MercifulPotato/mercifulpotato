What would I even call a &quot;hoe&quot; if I weren&#x27;t allowed to use the word &quot;hoe&quot;?<p>Until recently there were a lot of roads in the UK called &quot;Gropecunt Lane&quot;, and I think there are still a few of them left. The name really is rude: no alternative meaning of &quot;grope&quot; or &quot;cunt&quot; is involved. But it was also the official name.')
