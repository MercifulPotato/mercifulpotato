Just wait until you learn what the job of the police is in a civil society.<p>&gt; Boeing did not benefit from 346 deaths on other hand it suffered massive losses.<p>It absolutely did. It benefited up front from not having to redesign the 737 MAX to conform to global aviation standards. This allowed it to go to market faster, reduced development costs, and gave it an edge in sales against its competitor, the A320 family on the order books. You know, the one that didn&#x27;t fall from the sky spontaneously. Boeing achieved this through lying and deception.<p>All this fine did was attenuate the benefit.<p>&gt; Remember how USA bombed countries while making completely fraudulent claims about WMD ? Who went to jail for that ?<p>One unprosecuted crime doesn&#x27;t mean all crime should no longer be prosecuted. Whataboutism is never a good look.')
