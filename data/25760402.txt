I didn&#x27;t know that Apple also started doing the same and hit WireGuard again. Extending the definition of an &quot;in-app payment&quot; to a link to the project homepage in the &quot;About&quot; window that doesn&#x27;t buy any good or service related to the app is an overzealous restriction. Especially so when that button is clicked by, perhaps, only 10% of the users. This is just evil.<p>[0] Open-source apps removed from Google Play Store due to donation links<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=21268389" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=21268389</a>')
