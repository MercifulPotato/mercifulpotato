We have the same mentality when we have to personally explain what code does to our colleagues. We take the necessary measures of using better abstractions, writing documentation and Wikis, simplifying code, and making efforts so that &quot;failure demand&quot; does not arise.<p>In terms of product, it&#x27;s either our documentation sucks, or a problem of &quot;affordances and signifiers&quot;, or a problem of targeting the &quot;wrong&quot; users.<p>See also: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vanguard-method.net&#x2F;failure-demand&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vanguard-method.net&#x2F;failure-demand&#x2F;</a>')
