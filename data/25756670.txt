ISPs provide a service that&#x27;s strictly tied to very expensive and hard to duplicate infrastructure (often with strategic significance, even). To make an even more extreme example, if the companies controlling the North Atlantic TAT cables suddenly decided to arbitrarily deny service we&#x27;d have a huge problem, nobody is denying that.\nBut social media are literally a database and some javascript, that&#x27;s not even remotely in the same league.<p>Again, I do agree we have a quasi-monopoly problem; but if we do, the logical solution is to break the monopoly. Imposing political control creates more problems than it solves.')
