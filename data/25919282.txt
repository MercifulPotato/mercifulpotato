We staff our datacenters with our own datacenter technicians (Backblaze employees) 7 days a week.  When they arrive in the morning the first thing they do is replace any drives that failed during the night.  The last thing they do before going home is replacing the drives that failed during the day so the fleet is &quot;whole&quot;.<p>Backblaze currently runs at 17 + 3.  17 data drives with 3 calculated parity drives, so we can lose ANY THREE drives out of a &quot;tome&quot; of 20 drives.  Each of the 20 drives in one tome is in a different rack in the datacenter.  You can read a little more about that in this blog post: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.backblaze.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;vault-cloud-storage-architecture&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.backblaze.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;vault-cloud-storage-architect...</a><p>So if 1 drive fails at night in one 20 drive tome we don&#x27;t wake anybody up, and it&#x27;s business as usual.  That&#x27;s totally normal, and the drive is replaced at around 8am.  However, if 2 drives fail in one tome pagers start going off and employees wake up and start driving towards the datacenter to replace the drives.  With 2 drives down we ALSO automatically stop writing new data to that particular tome (but customers can still read files from that tome), because we have notice less drive activity can lighten failure rates.  In the VERY unusual situation that 3 drives are down in one tome every single tech ops and datacenter tech and engineer at Backblaze is awake and working on THAT problem until the tome comes back from the brink.  We do NOT like being in that position.  In that situation we turn off all &quot;cleanup jobs&quot; on that vault to lighten load.  The cleanup jobs are the things that are running around deleting files that customers no longer need, like if they age out due to lifecycle rules, etc.<p>The only exceptions to our datacenters having dedicated staff working 7 days a week are if a particular datacenter is small or just coming online.  In that case we lean on &quot;remote hands&quot; to replace drives on weekends.  That&#x27;s more expensive per drive, but it isn&#x27;t worth employing datacenter technicians that are just hanging out all day Saturday and Sunday bored out of their minds - instead we just pay the bill for remote hands.')
