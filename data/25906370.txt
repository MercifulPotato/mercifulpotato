Continue the search until you narrow down the memory address to just one. Then you can use that address to query the ammo for a 3rd party program that alerts you that you&#x27;re low on ammo or even write to the memory address to give yourself more ammo..<p>Obviously the brain isn&#x27;t as discrete but I feel like if I could play around with a BCI I could find fun signals for when I&#x27;m thinking about &#x27;apples&#x27; vs &#x27;oranges&#x27; and slowly build up an interface.<p>Have you been able to use a BCI to detect when you&#x27;re thinking about something specific?')
