They seem to almost universally fail, and in the process destroy people&#x27;s lives.  What kind of a penalty are we going to leverage to scare porch pirates?  What&#x27;s the highest penalty you feel is reasonable for a single instance of theft?  I think the reality is going to be a revolving door in and out of jail for short sentences.<p>Of course, better yet would be to reduce the incentive people have to steal these.')
