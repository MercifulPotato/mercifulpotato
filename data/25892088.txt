I read and really enjoyed this book, and even follow a mild version of intermittent fasting for a while. (only ate 12pm-8pm for a while).<p>Then a few months ago I started following some fitness YouTuber&#x27;s advice, which mostly boils down to &quot;count calories and consume less calories than your body uses&quot;. I started a basic course of counting calories and eating at a deficit, and dropped ~7kg in a few months (and hopefully am still going).<p>It wasn&#x27;t even that hard - mostly counting everything and cutting out some of the stuff that is really high in calories. I still ate fairly well, e.g. I&#x27;d eat my favorite hamburger - just would skip the fries to be under the calorie count.<p>Of course I&#x27;ve only done this for a few months and it&#x27;s hard to say if my body will eventually force me to expend less energy.<p>I take comfort in the fact that a lot of bodybuilders go to extreme lengths to drop down in body fat, so they&#x27;ve done anecdotal research on this area a <i>lot</i>. And most of them are not following intermittent fasting, or keto, or anything like that - they&#x27;re just reducing calorie intake when needed, and going up and down in weight fairly consistently.')
