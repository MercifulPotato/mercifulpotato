I have pretrained models packaged for translating between English and Arabic, Chinese, French, Russian, and Spanish. Argos Translate also manages &quot;pivoting&quot; through English to for example translate between French and Arabic. It can be installed with pip from PyPI and is available on the Snap Store for Linux pre-packaged with translations between English and French.<p>The main translation is done using OpenNMT with SentencePiece for tokenization, and Stanza for sentence boundary detection.')
