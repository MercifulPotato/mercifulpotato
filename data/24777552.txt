Those in power say they are in power by a majority but that&#x27;s false. They aren&#x27;t. Senators in majority represent minority of voters. A President is in the White House who received less votes than the challenger. This so called majority make laws and claims they can do so because they represent the majority of voices in this country, that is completely false.')
