It makes no sense to hire someone who only produces $10&#x2F;hr of value if you have to pay them $15&#x2F;hr. This makes it harder for people with little experience or training to find any job at all. A better solution would be to eliminate the minimum wage and make up the difference with income redistribution, such as a negative income tax for those in the lowest bracket.')
