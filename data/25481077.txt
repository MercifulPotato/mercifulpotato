I think they&#x27;re a bit better now but they still lack confidence in their health system.<p>Here, nearby in NSW our public health system is really good.  We&#x27;re currently dealing with out third significant outbreak - seems to be an escape from an overseas arrival - but we can justifiably be confident that we are able to stamp these things out without too much disruption (relatively speaking).')
