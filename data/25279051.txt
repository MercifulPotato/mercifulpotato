The ability to do it &#x27;online&#x27; was an enterprise only feature (that would have cost about $700k on our hardware), so we were unable to do any index changes on our tables, since it would take 10-12 hours to rebuild some key tables, and we couldn&#x27;t block all our transactions for that long.  SQL server also makes that an enterprise only feature.<p>PostgreSQL has the native ability to do that.  There are lots of other benefits, but that is the first that comes to mind.<p>When they come out with Babelfish for Oracle, then stuff is going to get crazy.  EnterpriseDB has some limits to its functionality, and its cost is pretty high.')
