For folks reading along, there is an entire discipline around this stuff, it is call vulnerability analysis and surety systems. There are a lot of good papers published by Sandia National Laboratory on these topics. They were responsible for developing the US surety system around access to nuclear weapons[1]. When I worked at Sun they gave a talk at an e-comerce payment processing forum that Sun was participating in to discuss how you approach the problem of securing something in presence of known and unknown bad actors.<p>In particular they discussed the systems around banking which prevent your bank from stealing your money from you. A topic that I found quite interesting.<p>But one of the things that has always stuck with me was the discussion of the trade-off between the &quot;cost of effort&quot; to &quot;actualize&quot; a vulnerability. It is the difference between having something that could be done in theory versus having doing it having a high enough payoff to actually do it. When you look at things like dye packs in money and silent alarms and time locked safes, those are parts of a system that minimize the amount of money you can expect to make off with in a bank robbery. They are part of a surety system that is protecting the money in the bank. And they don&#x27;t make it impossible to rob the bank, they make the likely-hood that you&#x27;ll have enough profit from it to risk it low enough that people don&#x27;t do it.<p>[1] They are designed, in part, to prevent anyone from detonating a US nuclear device without specific authorization from the President.')
