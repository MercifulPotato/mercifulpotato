If you use *.local for local domain names DoH will never be triggered<p>I don&#x27;t think PFsense + Unbound supports appending .local to every hostname automatically, so I&#x27;d have to change every last one of my hostnames to whatever.local and that seems like a real pain.

Given that Firefox is using Cloudflare by default, the fact that you can change it also doesn&#x27;t really help anything, since after all the thing I&#x27;m specifically complaining about is that stuff randomly breaks for any of your guests using Firefox.')
