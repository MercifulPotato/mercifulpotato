If I&#x27;m trying to follow the main branch only to a certain point the graph is polluted with all the &quot;WIP&quot; side branch commits between head and the commit I end up getting to.<p>It also defaults to causing the main to have a ton of commits with &quot;Merged from XXXX branch&quot; as the summary lines when that&#x27;s not nearly descriptive enough to quickly find what type of commit I may be looking for.')
