Item(by='wahern', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607033930, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25292142, text='&gt; I think the problem with the prohibition was that alcohol was widely used already and regarded as ok by most of the general public.<p>Prohibition was enacted via constitutional amendment, a process which requires supermajorities. The 18th Amendment was ratified via state legislatures rather than constitutional convention, but most states had already instituted prohibition by popular mandate.<p>The real issue AFAIU is that as originally understood the language of the 18th Amendment would only permit national prohibition of hard alcohol--&quot;intoxicating liquors&quot;--much like most existing state laws. But the enabling legislation ended up prohibiting wine and beer and the Supreme Court upheld that interpretation. Ironically, the court took a much stricter stance on what &quot;manufacture&quot; meant, protecting even distillation for private use, but that allowance hardly mitigated the effect of their earlier interpretation of &quot;intoxicating liquors&quot;.<p>TL;DR: most Americans at least nominally supported prohibition of liquor, but not beer and wine. Alcoholism had been a major public health and social issue for generations, far greater than today, but it mostly regarded the obscene quantities of hard liquor Americans consumed. What they got was something much more strict than they bargained for.')
