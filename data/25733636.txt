If you were following the various platforms that these groups were organising on it was very clear that they were inciting lawless action on the 6th- which of course was demonstrated on the 6th. It&#x27;s also important to understand this didn&#x27;t stop on the 6th, those same people are now talking about the 20th with similar suggestions.<p>Brandenburg seems to protect basically idle talk - but that&#x27;s very clearly not what&#x27;s happening here.')
