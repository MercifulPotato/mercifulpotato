When you have a data structure containing some elements, and you keep a reference to the structure, because you need some data from it, but you let it grow, then you have a leak, GC or no GC. If anything, GC encourages memory leaks by making freeing memory implicit, something a programmer normally doesn&#x27;t think about. And yet a resize&#x2F;push operation on a vector (sic!) is just another malloc. One that will get ignored by a GC.<p>GC protects you against double-free and use-after-free, but memory leaks? Nope.')
