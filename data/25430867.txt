I want something to do that takes me away from screens regularly and I think it must be possible to become reasonable if not great with a few years of practicing every day.<p>So I have a few questions on this:<p>1) Which piano should I get - I&#x27;d like one with as close to real piano keys as possible and a nice piano sound, looking at Yamaha P125, Kawai ES110 (sounds best) and Korg D1 (which IMO feels the best).<p>2) What techniques&#x2F;apps&#x2F;schedule did you use to learn piano? How good can you become when a bit older?<p>3) Is there anything else I need to know when learning piano? Should I get a teacher or just do my own learning&#x2F;apps?<p>Thanks Hacker News!')
