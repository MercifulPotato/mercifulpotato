Every machine has a different purpose.<p>My telephone is for phone calls, texting, extremely light emailing, checking weather, using it as a GPS, occasionally taking a photo or a quick video.<p>My Surface Book 3 is for actual on-the-road document work, programming, light gaming, and digital painting.<p>My Ryzen Threadripper &#x2F; RTX 3090 workstation at home is for no-shit, actual income-generating work and super-heavy-duty gaming.<p>My Panasonic Lumix DC-S1H is for videography, but my Canon EOS R5 is for highest-quality stills, and my Sony A7C is for travelling.<p>Every one of those cameras has different purposes, different use cases. Just like the rest of my hardware. There is no &quot;one size fits all&quot; anywhere, for anything.<p>&gt; More memory and faster CPUs make yesterday’s challenges trivial for today’s developers.<p>Today&#x27;s developers are by-and-large utter shit at designing software.
