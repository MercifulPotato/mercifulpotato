I don&#x27;t think most people comprehend how much crap is going on in the background.<p>For <i>most</i> container purposes, host networking and the default process namespace is absolutely fine, and reduces a lot of problems with interacting with containerized apps. 95% of the use case of containers is effectively just a chroot wrapper. If you <i>need</i> more features, this should be optional. This would also make rootless federated containerized apps just work. But nobody wants to go back to incremental features if Docker gives them everything at once.')
