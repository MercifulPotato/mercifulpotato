Firefox + NoScript + uBlock Origin, and default deny everything.  Then simply whitelist what is strictly required to get sites you care about to work.  You can combine this to great effect as well with using similar policies for your system firewall.  I run a local firewall on all of my devices and default deny all inbound and outbound traffic, whitelisting only specific ports (and in some cases IPs), and layer an application firewall on top of that to only allow specific applications to make calls on specific portions to specific endpoints.<p>The combination results in a situation in which I have control as a user over what my computer is doing, and I can interact with online services without being in complete submission to the current heinous model.  It&#x27;s not perfect, and it doesn&#x27;t make you impossible to track or anything of the sort.  But it definitely cuts down on the crap you deal with and drastically reduces your risks of being infected by malicious software.')
