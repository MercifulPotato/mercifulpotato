This is not an &quot;it&#x27;s a problem only for some people&quot; problem. It&#x27;s also problematic for activists who may face different kinds of threats and real harm. Anonymity or pseudo anonymity can help people express themselves more openly without a constant worry of being shamed and&#x2F;or banished and&#x2F;or harmed. On this front, Facebook still stands out as a big abuser where one can easily shutdown someone else&#x27;s account by reporting it as a fake account. Facebook will then deactivate the account, force the user to provide a government identity document, and in many cases, automatically change the name on the account to the one in the document without asking for consent. Edited to add: Facebook&#x27;s policies also require that each person create only one account for themselves.')
