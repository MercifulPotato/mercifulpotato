You have the opportunity to get a very well-paying job on Wall Street (finance or whatever).  You reckon that you would optimize your good-output by working more rather than helping directly (you donâ€™t have the skills or know-how to help directly, you also reckon).  So you get a well-paying job, work 60 hours a week in order to earn more money and advance your career, live frugally and donate 70% of your income to charity.  At this point you are spent: you cannot do more good than working those hours without burning out and thus hurting your career long-term.<p>Now you are alienated from your charity: your work in finance indirectly helps other people, but you have no way of experiencing or connecting to that other than looking at statistics and numbers; the lifeworld of your charitable work is just some numbers that you get every quarter from the various charities that you donate to.  You have no direct involvement in them.')
