Item(by='neogodless', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609425120, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25592599, text='&gt; Shame can only be seen as useful by someone completely preoccupied with it.<p>I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s accurate at all! You can easily realize there are other filters and motivators while also recognizing the usefulness of shame. They are variables, and you can apply them in different measures depending on the needs of a scenario. As you said &quot;<i>all</i> these emotions shape our participation in society.&quot;<p>I also don&#x27;t believe the parent comment said &quot;some single emotion is human&#x27;s only motivator.&quot; What they said was that it was working as the last or final limitation of behaviors for a large portion of (implied: American) people and that it was removed by high profile person acting without shame. Without it, obviously they are motivated by fear (of The Other), desire (to feel superior and unfettered), pride (of being in the superior group, whether it be political party, race, gender, religion, etc.), caring (in this case, only for their own but not other humans) and so forth. These emotions can be applied in small and large amounts, and for good or evil, depending on your perspective. Are you a patriot because you believe your country is a force for good, or because you believe being a part of it entitles you to the highest standard of living in the world?')
