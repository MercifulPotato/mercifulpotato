Then when confronted with unmapped data the net can measure similarities to previously known examples, and use them to translate via similarity measures.<p>I&#x27;m not entirely sure if this is the approach taken (I haven&#x27;t read their paper) but my impression is that the &quot;turn it into a symbolic program&quot; means that the symbolic program itself is a traditional solver (whether it be a theorem solver or something like Prolog&#x2F;Datalog is unclear)')
