If you buy the premise, it&#x27;s one of the most precise bets you can make on it.<p>In contrast, GM or Hyundai or Volkswagen are inherently hedged.  If petrol drops to twelve cents per litre, they&#x27;ll pivot back to V8 boats and Tesla goes bust.  But that means they&#x27;ll pay out less if the future is electric-- they wasted resources and time that could have been in retrospect better spent going whole hog on electric vehicles.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if this is part of the reason firms like Nikola can still get market traction with way more vaporous fundamentals: they&#x27;re also positioned as a pure bet on that proposition.<p>(Disclaimer: long TSLA)')
