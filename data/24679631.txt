Especially since the market has been heavily invested in Android devices due to the pricing disparity, it&#x27;s a big jump and likely not one that can be alleviated simply by waiving some of the extra costs by manufacturing locally.<p>The most popular phones sold in India are low-midrange devices in the USD $80-400 range.
