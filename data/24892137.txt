Also means more expensive&#x2F;new devices.<p>Lat&#x2F;long would give you a good idea of the 3-9 most likely roads involved, but it won&#x27;t necessarily prove which road exactly... so humans would still need to review the entered road to lat&#x2F;long and find the right road to plug in.<p>Alternatively, and perhaps this is what you were thinking... GPS-assisted drop downs (or scroll-able list of selections) might provide an easier user interface... Cop hits the &quot;street&quot; button, and the GPS provides a selection of the most likely suspects. It won&#x27;t be perfect, since a manual entry field should still be provided, but it probably would stop fat-fingering.<p>But we&#x27;re solving a problem to make data analytics and the lives of cops easier... The city wont make money, it&#x27;ll probably cost them hundreds of thousands (or millions). So the incentive is very small. You or I, as lovers of accurate data, might like this. In court, however, a judge or lawyer will see &quot;Lke Shore&quot;, see the cop meant &quot;Lake Shore&quot;, and the conflict is resolved in milliseconds.')
