After lots of crashes and problems connecting a monitor throught a DP to USB-C cable, I bought the TS3+ and this works much better. So far not a single crash, and everything works fine for me (Mac OS Catalina, MBP 16&quot;). I use Gigabit Ethernet, displayport (4K monitor), some USB3 devices, and somewhere in the neighborhood of a bajillion USB2 devices connected via additional hubs.')
