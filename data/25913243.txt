When I think about what kind of features I&#x27;d want in my messaging app, there are really only two things I can think of that iMessage doesn&#x27;t have: encryption, and the ability to easily leave a group text.  Add those two things in, and I&#x27;m there for life.<p>On the other hand, both of these things are essentially limitations imposed by SMS, at least when one end of the conversation is not an iPhone.  Both can be fixed, at a small cost in complexity, and if they did that, I think it would hit a good balance between features, usability, and architectural complexity.')
