Item(by='andrewflnr', descendants=None, kids=[25383185], score=None, time=1607668934, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25382923, text='One of the more compelling arguments in my eyes is that wealth concentration is very difficult to separate from power concentration (which is the point of money in a way), so wealth inequality can have a direct effect on liberty. Think of the difference between being able to afford lawyers or not, or make political campaign contributions (i.e. buying political influence), to say nothing of outright bribes and other, more cinematic ways of turning money into power.<p>The argument about standard of living kind of misses the point. Yes, standard of living is increasing, but it could be even better, so why aren&#x27;t we doing that? That question at least deserves an answer (though to be clear I don&#x27;t think a &quot;wealth tax&quot; is likely to be that answer).<p>I do think that leftist political theorists are too fond of dealing with abstractions rather than concrete details, a bit like corporate buzzword jargon (semi-useful for describing problems, if not solutions), or code that has been factored to FactoryBeanManager levels. They often have good arguments underneath it all, but I don&#x27;t know why they expect people not already on board with their agenda to take their terminology seriously.')
