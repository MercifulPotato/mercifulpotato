People have forgotten how to write. I cannot discern an overarching theme or point. This is the substack equivalent of a tweetstorm. It needs serious editing before it&#x27;s ready for others to read.<p>With that said, I think there&#x27;s a kernel of an interesting idea in point 7. The author mentions Marshall McLuhan but doesn&#x27;t really make a connection I thought would be made with the invocation, which is that McLuhan&#x27;s famous exhortation that &quot;The medium is the massage&quot; warned and foretold of the incredible psychic power of owning the means of media production. One could easily extend this into an examination of the manifold global power brokers who power the online dissident right, as well as the origins and applications of right-wing accelerationism.<p>But to do that, one would need to actually study the people that make them uncomfortable from their own eyes, rather than engaging in rote application of one&#x27;s pet theories and theorists. I hope the author eventually gets to that point.')
