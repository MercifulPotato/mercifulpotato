Feta is a type of cheese that has the whole of Greece as the terroir. It’s also made with sheep and goat milk and the cow-based cheese that resembles it (white cheese, salad cheese etc) just doesn’t compare taste wise.<p>With all that said, if you see (in the EU) something being called Feta, you immediately know what it’s made of and that it’s made in Greece.')
