Second..PALMOIL..that&#x27;s not something to brag about.<p>-We had a initiative, which in theory came thru, but was stopped (different theme). It was about Corporate responsibility (Swiss Corps are not allowed to break Swiss Laws even when they are not operating in Switzerland), and now imagine who made that Advertisement on YT against that initiative? F*cking NESTLE!!!<p>It&#x27;s like: Hy i&#x27;m your dear friend Assad and i am against regulations concerning ABC-Weapons.<p>BTW: Hey Nestle and Swissmem, if you need someone who filters your BS for the modern age before it goes online, write me an Email (it&#x27;s my username at protonmail...no pun intended)')
