Item(by='wombatmobile', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611152281, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25844049, text='&gt; Can anyone recommend some good, contemporary fiction for people that have forgotten how to read fiction?<p>[This is not a criticism, rather an exploration...] Why do you include the constraint &quot;contemporary&quot; fiction?<p>You said you want to stimulate your creative thinking, and &quot;switch off&quot;.  Might you be open to the possibility that fiction set in another place and time could help with your objectives?<p>I&#x27;m asking because I&#x27;ve felt similar to what you describe, and I know of some good books that did for me what you ask, but they are mostly set in different centuries to this one, and written by people who are dead.<p>I work in software engineering and marketing, which means most of what I do is conceptual rather than physical.  I find that doing physical jobs, like carpentry gives me a satisfaction and a feeling of escape.  After I&#x27;ve built something, I can sit back and just look at it... there&#x27;s no better feeling than making something come into existence.<p>Well, sometimes a good work of fiction can achieve a similar level of escape or transcendence, yes.')
