Humanity, less so. Humans take individual actions that help themselves. Humanity forms networks of perverse incentives that harm others. If we build a network of perverse incentives, and catastrophe befalls us, an interesting thing happens: no one wants to lose in the time of loss. This is when you get revolutions, invasions, fascism threatening where the imaginary border lines are drawn. It&#x27;s all merely loss aversion. Change is necessitated by material reality, in which the average person, fearing for their loss of wealth or for their loss of potential future life, are driven to extreme or violent actions. There needs to be one world currency, and it needs to be subject to entropy without human intervention (and something similar with material buildup and &#x27;property&#x27;); we will kill ourselves otherwise as that which nourished us in the past is today&#x27;s poison. Nothing is forever, why is wealth? Loss over time due to entropy as law needs to be more accounted for in our world economy as a whole. There is a level of individual wealth and capital advantage one may gain that literally destabilizes international peace (I&#x27;m looking at you global oil): why do we allow it? It&#x27;s like nations have become lame date-show suitors to international oligarchs, offering missiles as flowers, and it&#x27;s pathetic, and it&#x27;s weak.')
