Item(by='chipotle_coyote', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602647604, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24772360, text='The SF Bay Area as a whole has some great holes in the wall, and there&#x27;s even still some in San Francisco proper if you dig around, but in addition to being a bar in the Fairmont as others have noted, the Tonga Room is a world-famous tiki bar that opened in 1945, with two themed dining rooms that wrap around an artificial lagoon with a &quot;rainstorm&quot; every thirty minutes. That&#x27;s a <i>really weird</i> definition of hole-in-the-wall. :)<p>While I haven&#x27;t been up to SF proper for food and barhopping in a few years now, the Lark up in the financial district is much more of what I&#x27;d call a good cheap bar. I tend to bristle a bit at people dissing the SF food and drink scene, but I have to remind myself that with few exceptions my favorite places in the Bay Area aren&#x27;t actually in SF itself. The metro area <i>as a whole</i> has virtually everything you can imagine at a very wide range of price points. I suspect one could make a case that the most interesting stuff happening is in the East Bay and South Bay, though.')
