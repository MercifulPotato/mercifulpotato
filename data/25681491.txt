I had a similar issue with a different bank and in the reconcile feature you can pick the template (eg QBO, CSV, etc) and under CSV are the templates I made (along with stock templates for $BigBank). So I only made the template once with a little drag&#x2F;drop page and was done. All subsequent imports are &quot;one click&quot; easy')
