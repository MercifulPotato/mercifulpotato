That&#x27;s 8 YEARS old at this point (not even comparable to Intel&#x27;s 14++++ stack).<p>Third, this also seemed to be on the back of equipment purchased earlier. Moving forward, they can&#x27;t buy cutting-edge manufacturing devices. Instead, they have to create a whole industry to make the machines to make advanced chip fabs. I somehow doubt that the normal, rather loose Chinese tolerances are up for the job.<p>Fourth, they also need to build out an entire silicon refinery industry which is itself not an easy task to be accomplished within the next few years.<p>By the time all this is in place, the economic repercussions will have been extreme.<p>If Biden wins the election, he&#x27;s going to continue the same process, but I somehow doubt this same outlet will continue pumping out such dumb partisan pieces.')
