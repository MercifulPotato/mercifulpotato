FB are blocked from buying IG, so IG need to set up a sales team, an adevertising method and epxand globally. None of these things are cheap or trivial. There does exist a world where IG competes on a level-playing field independently, but I would argue that at least 80% of the time, this hypothetical leads to IG either under-performing or flaming out.<p>Both of these outcomes are speculative, but I&#x27;m not convinced about the 80% figure. I&#x27;m not sure that IG needed FB alone to get to a billion users. Many of those users aren&#x27;t necessarily people and are companies, organizations and other entities which use IG for engagement. It&#x27;s enough that people spend more time on IG than FB the app or website to convince those entities to engage on IG. Not sure what the proportions are exactly but just giving an example.<p>IG had less than 20mn users when acquired, literally nobody cared about it outside of the early-adopter crowd in SF. In general, value comes from execution rather than the idea, and I am definitely not convinced that IG would be anywhere near where it is today without Facebook, which leads me to believe that breaking it off at this point is pretty unfair.<p>Like, another way FB could have competed would have been to buy IG and let it die slowly. Given this anti-trust suit, that would appear to have been the smarter move, but it definitely wouldn&#x27;t be overall better.<p>Lets also note that FB became popular not just because it was good, but because it was good and always stayed up, regardless of user growth. That has probably been one of the major engines for IG growth.<p>Finally, the success of IG was also driven by the use of free advertising on FB, without that it would have taken a lot longer (and cost a lot more money) for them to reach the scale that they have now.<p>Again, thanks for replying. I&#x27;m still not convinced by your model of the cost of IG&#x2F;FB, but I appreciate that it&#x27;s reasonably well thought out.')
