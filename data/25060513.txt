Every few centuries, an earthquake shakes the East Coast and may destroy the highways. We have a plan to survive for 30 days isolated from the rest of the country&quot;.<p>They had a large stockpile of honey, water, etc. etc. They explained how their system would work without power. Their scenario was based on Hurricane Katrina (and how long it took for aid to arrive: over a month). Overall, a rational set of people.<p>They got low-scores from the show&#x27;s hosts because they didn&#x27;t have enough guns to survive, apparently.
