Toynbee, Hegel, etc) and the West was just rife for such a period. The people who experienced the negative outcomes of authoritarianism back in the 1940s died or entered nursing homes en masse in the 2010s.<p>• <i>Social networks</i>, and other internet phenomena, advantage sensationalism and division.<p>• <i>The actual state of the world</i> is bad enough that people stop voting for the status quo. By the &#x27;state of the world&#x27;, I mean things like the &#x27;forever wars&#x27;, terror attacks, the migrant crisis, the 2008 financial crisis, the rise of China, etc.<p>The more I think about it, though, the less I think <i>the actual state of the world</i> matters. My reasoning there is that the way people interpret both their own station in life, and the events of the world, depends largely on the zeitgeist. With a little effort, I could imagine a world where people interpreted the same political and economic situation in vastly different ways.<p>I should add a disclaimer that, when it comes to this subject, it&#x27;s possible I have no idea what I&#x27;m talking about. I&#x27;m not a real historian :)')
