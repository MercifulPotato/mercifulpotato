It&#x27;s frustrating because you know your capabilities, but you just can&#x27;t get there. Imagine running a 6 minute mile, and the next day you give it 100% and 8 minutes is a struggle.<p>I try to prioritize creative work, e.g. building something new, really hard problems, etc. for &quot;good days&quot;, and I focus on work that I&#x27;ve already begun and can see the completion path for on bad days.  I do occasionally have days where I&#x27;m totally useless, and if that happens I&#x27;ll just do mundane rote tasks that I&#x27;ve been putting off.')
