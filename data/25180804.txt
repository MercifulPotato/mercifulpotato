Hear me out. I totally agree that waiters get paid like shit and their jobs are tough. I have sympathy for them but this culture of &quot;oh poor waiters so we must tip&quot; is basically encouraging bad practices. I would rather pay more for a meal while the waiter gets paid well by their employer. Why is it my job as a customer to worry about the waiter&#x27;s financial well being ?<p>Lets do free market. Raise prices, charge more and pay your waiters more. If no one eats at your restaurant, you know your food was shitty. People pay big bucks for good food, always.')
