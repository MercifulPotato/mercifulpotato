He said he always had done this, and that basically all Americans knew this was what you were supposed to do. I enjoyed the trip more than previous trips because I now had this new superpower, I felt like an insider who no longer felt anxious. I would sort of casually and knowingly do the 20% thing, but sadly since it doesn&#x27;t happen in advance I suspect I was still treated as a foreign guy who wouldn&#x27;t know how much to tip :(')
