Don’t they want $400 back?<p>Many App Store customers literally do not know that they can request a refund, or how to request one. App Store does not even have a clear refund policy. You see a lot of reviews for scam apps that say &quot;I want a refund!&quot; They just don&#x27;t know.<p>App Store customers assume, naturally but unfortunately mistakenly, that app developers have the power to grant refunds. They have no idea Apple itself is the sole source of refunds. You would think that Apple would put a refund link in the ratings&#x2F;review area of the store, but nope.')
