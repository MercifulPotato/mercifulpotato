The conclusions I posted above come from a general understanding after having lived and worked in China for a significant period of time, plus some personal investigations into Weibo and other major Chinese social media services (e.g. Baidu Tieba, which was the top dog of a bygone age) after discussing such topics with Western friends in the past. I’m very confident in my conclusion that the death penalty is very welcome in China, random hearsay and conversation stoppers like “but social credit points” be damned (that’s a whole other topic I don’t want to get into).<p>With that out of way, I can objectively say that I’ve never seen cases of political dissent announced anywhere. If you ask me, I’d say such cases, if there are any, wouldn’t be publicized. Additionally, if there were to be such cases, I suspect (private) opinions would be more divided than murder cases but still tilt the “wrong” way. By my observations, people tend to sympathize with little guys adversely affected by corrupt officials or big corps, and you can see that kind of stories retweeted on social media, a lot, as people love to “spread the word to get the attention of higher-ups”; but “human rights activists” are usually met with sneer. The high profile activists tend to be the butt of jokes in my experience.')
