There is a limited demand for basically any good. Signal is clearly not at that level, so I am glad that they are growing, especially if they aren&#x27;t sacrificing much <i>just</i> for growth. (Although IM isn&#x27;t the best example either because more adoption makes the product better in a way that many products don&#x27;t).<p>However look at Apple. For a large part everyone in the US who wants an iPhone has one. Sure, there are some people who can&#x27;t afford the high price but that seems to be a small portion. However because Apple wants to grow they are working on making their devices less repairable and implementing trade-in programs so that people upgrade more often (and they can destroy the old ones). Is this growth evidence that they solved a problem? It seems that the problem they are really solving here is raising the stock price. And I will argue that raising Apple&#x27;s stock price doesn&#x27;t really help the world at all.<p>I think the initial growth of the iPhone was a sign of a good product. However I think this demand for continual growth is harmful to society overall.')
