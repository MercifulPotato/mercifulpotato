Odds are they will more than negate your cost savings, and again at a latency cost.<p>Let’s say you really want to save huge amounts of money though.  The easy answer is probably in moving to a spot instance targeted architecture where you can typically buy the same server from AWS for less than 20 percent of the on demand price.  You can always fall back to on demand when they are not available.')
