Base-1 indexing is more natural and less verbose. My suspicion is that base-0 indexing grew out of language implementers wanting to reduce their mental overhead rather than a first-principles approach. AKA machine code leaking out to the higher level languages.<p>2. You have to have <i>some</i> way of structuring syntax. Whether you have &quot;end&quot;, &quot;)&quot; or &quot;}&quot;. It is not inconsistent to start with something else, like a function signature with the corresponding keyword. Again Julia opts for natural readability.<p>Both of these complaints are rather superficial anyways. Julia is a marvelous piece of tech and has an interesting story to tell about type inference, multiple dispatch, performance, data-structures, general Lisp-yness and the merits of tailoring a language for a purpose&#x2F;domain (and its users) in contrast to trying to adhere to paradigms and programmer culture (cults?).')
