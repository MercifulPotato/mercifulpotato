There will be one commit per released version. [...] For the time being, we do not accept contributions via GitHub. [...] To report bugs and request new features, please contact the Threema support team through threema.ch&#x2F;support.<p>Commits are useless (one commit per release), issue tracker on GitHub is disabled, contributions not public, no public discussions. I like Threema and appreciate them open sourcing their apps, but this is not what I call open source development. I really hope they will reconsider this. Both Threema and the community could benefit from this, but dumping the source code here and then isn&#x27;t going to cut it when the competition is meanwhile doing real open source development. But at least we have reproducible builds now, this is still a great step forward.')
