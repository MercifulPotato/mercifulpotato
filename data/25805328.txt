It was taken offline by its cloud provider and its apps were removed. Google was even involved in the takedown. Nothing outlandish is being discussed here.<p>As for &quot;bad motives and awful consequences&quot;, what are you talking about? Is wanting to take parler.com offline an objectively &quot;bad motive&quot;? Is succeeding in that endeavor an &quot;awful consequence&quot;? This is the heart of the problem: Weighing consequences is hard when faced with real threats. So when the two consequences are &quot;parler.com becomes inaccessible&quot; and &quot;the integrity of the Google Safe Browsing URL list is slightly compromised&quot;, I think it&#x27;s <i>at least possible</i> that executives would decide to compromise the list.')
