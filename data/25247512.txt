We&#x27;ll have separate professionals in charge of making sure the structure&#x2F;rules of the committee are followed so that it&#x27;s fair, and of course we&#x27;ll have advocates well-versed in these rules on both sides, but maybe we&#x27;ll also have a panel of everyday people representing, well, everyone, so that decisions like this remain a public matter as well as professional opinion.<p>Think of it as something like the royal courts for important decisions of old.
