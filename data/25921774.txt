But it wouldn&#x27;t be vulnerable to this. &quot;<p>I think you&#x27;ll find in disagreeing with the comment on logic errors you just said the same thing the comment did about logic errors.<p>Also I think the generalization that rewriting an established bit of code in a new language in a secure language is a bit too general. clearly Firefox not only set out to make Rust for this purpose but it&#x27;s not had an explosion in vulnerabilities with the modules it has replaced. Quite the opposite actually. Nor has every tool or app rewritten become a security failure compared to the original. I do think it&#x27;s something that can easily be screwed up though, especially if someone rushes through by focusing on functionality duplication instead of building a more secure version of something.<p>Regardless, both &quot;using a memory safe language results in a more safe program&quot; and &quot;having a minimum attack sufrace results in a more safe program&quot; can be true. There is no need to make it a choice of A or B.')
