Dogs -- I disagree. Dogs are extremely aggressive to any human that isn&#x27;t approved by their owner. There are nearly 5 MILLION dog attacks per year in the US alone, some 30-40 of which are fatal, which is several orders of magnitude higher than any wildlife attacks even if you account for the density difference. You can count the yearly wolf attacks in North America on one hand. Wolf-human interactions are incredibly rare.<p>Wolves have evolved to optimize for their own survival, and although they are powerful predators, they are risk averse as well, and will not go after prey that they are unsure of -- you would be too if you had to use your strength to kill for every single meal or starve to death if injured.<p>Dogs have been bred to fearlessly protect and attack the owner at all costs, including putting their own survival on the line, which is very much NOT how wolves think.<p>I&#x27;d <i>much</i> rather be in wolf or coyote territory than a place with stray dogs.')
