We take all precautions to shield civilians where practical. I&#x27;m an infantryman and I&#x27;ve seen soldiers continue to take fire to protect Arab civilians from getting caught in the middle. I cannot tell you if by policy that is a result of every time the Israeli army so much as scratches an Arab civilian that it becomes international news, but it is ingrained in most soldiers personal moral beliefs as well.<p>There is no lack of counterexamples that you could google, but as policy and as most soldiers&#x27; morals, protecting civilians - from both sides - is as paramount to us as the Prime Directive is to Picard.<p>What nation do you represent that &quot;being a civilian doesn&#x27;t grant you special plot shield&quot;? I thought that was standard military procedure to avoid civilian casualties since at least the second world war.')
