Mind you, I was 10-12 years old at the time so my current opinion would be somewhat skewed for obvious reasons. That said, I think flash had a few very good things about it. First off the fact that it could spit out windows executables natively was brilliant. Second it was perfect for 2d games and in-browser games. Nothing comes even close to it even today. But from a developer prospective, I think it had one fundamental flaw(from my point of view today): it never made a clear distinction between developers and designers. And even though ActionScript was based on the abomination that is js, from what I remember of it, it was a significantly better thought out language.')
