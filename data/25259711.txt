Media outlets are free to singularly report the number of positive cases. I see it all over mainstream media (CNN being the worst offender), Twitter, etc.<p>What&#x27;s the issue with simply reversing that metric to show many people are COVID negative?<p>Final note, I&#x27;m happy to make updates based on additional data but public datasets are slim pickings. And I&#x27;m not in to tapping individual state&#x2F;county datasets.<p>NYT publishes daily case counts and death counts across the United States by county.<p>edit: COVID negative is unequivocally the incorrect term to use. That was a mental mistake on my part. The specific term I use is “did not get a positive COVID test”.')
