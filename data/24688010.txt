I can somewhat get by when playing mostly-mouse turned-based strategies; I put a table next to my bike and use the mouse on that. But it&#x27;s not good to keep my shoulder at that angle for so long, and I&#x27;d like to also play games that require active use of the mouse + keyboard.<p>So far I haven&#x27;t found a good match on the market. I could build one myself, but TBH I&#x27;d rather not spend the time right now to iterate on the design.')
