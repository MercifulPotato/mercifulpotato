Those high earning COBOL jobs don&#x27;t pay so well because the programmers are hyper intelligent, they pay well because there&#x27;s not that many people left that have experience running mainframes. If you&#x27;ve only just mastered COBOL, you&#x27;ll probably be last in line for any good COBOL job out there.<p>With a portfolio like that, you might want to look at why you can&#x27;t get a job.
