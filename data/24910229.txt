But the Brzozowski derivative (as it is now known) was generalized to handle all CFGs (instead of only REs) in the 2011 Might et al paper titled &quot;Parsing with Derivatives&quot;. This work was then refined this year with &quot;Parsing with Zippers&quot;, which generalizes Huet&#x27;s Zipper data structure to represent CFGs (instead of acyclical, deterministic tree structures) and uses that to re-build the 2011 algorithm with a better representation, achieving greater performance with a small algorithm.')
