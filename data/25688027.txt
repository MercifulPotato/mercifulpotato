It&#x27;s not about quotes and verbage as much as meaning and intent.<p>That being said, his incitement Wednesday was actually pretty explicit. From the Times: Trump said &quot;If you don’t fight like hell, you’re not going to have a country anymore&quot; before urging supporters to go to the capital. Sounds like a pretty powerful incitement from a sitting President.')
