I can also zip up your images &#x2F; themes etc. for you, so there&#x27;s no lock-in. Even the domain will continue to be your own nameservers, you&#x27;ll just point your custom domain to abcd1234.ghosting.dev.<p>And no, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll need to limit the number of domains that point to your installation, but of course you&#x27;ll want to do that yourself for SEO reasons.<p>The official Ghost.org do seem high, but I empathize because  it does pay the salaries of an international team. But they&#x27;re so high as to be inaccessible to normal people and companies. An individual writing a blog (especially outside a developed country) or a small company wanting to start a team blog isn&#x27;t going to pay that much.<p>Would want to give a portion of revenue to the Ghost non-profit and support development as soon as I get ramen profitable, though, which will probably be happen at 100 to 150 customers.')
