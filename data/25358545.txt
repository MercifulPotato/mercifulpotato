On CentOS and other distros this is not the case and the user has to start the service after the installation. I prefer the latter behavior as not everything I install is going to be a 24&#x2F;7 service. I&#x27;d prefer not to mask some service because stopping and disabling leads to the service randomly starting after a package upgrade.')
