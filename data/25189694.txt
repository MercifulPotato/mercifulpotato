It makes sense to me where there&#x27;s inherently a limited supply and over time the available number of items for sale falls and hence price gets higher.<p>In content I think it&#x27;s just the opposite. At the start nobody has it and it makes sense that the price is higher. Then as early birds get it they may share it with others and so it gets more and more available.<p>At least that&#x27;s my armchair economics thinking. I&#x27;m sure the pricing model works for the OP. I just found it interesting.')
