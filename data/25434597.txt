I lived in Dresden(Germany), while Obama visited the city. It was total madness for a day, with major roads closed etc. \nBut it probably was only half on US orders, but on local politicians who wanted to impress the &quot;yes we can&quot; president.\nWho cares for the actual local residents, when theres great politics going on?<p>(in TV I only heard local people praise that day, but from people I met during the day, not so much)')
