Sorry for the whataboutism. Deaths are deaths.<p>Fixing a misbehaving car manufacturer is easier than fixing decades of forest mismanagement. Once the VW thing is over they can concentrate on that (unfortunately they still don&#x27;t). The forest fire problems are also unique to California. Car emissions are a problem everywhere.')
