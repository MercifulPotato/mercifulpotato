By the same token, the press is also free to do whatever it wants - like, optimize for profits, like a good private sector entity does. Some good ways for an ad-funded news publisher to optimize profits are:<p>- writing things that get people to read&#x2F;watch the content (and thus, ads), regardless of whether these things are true, accurate, or appropriate in a civilized society;<p>- getting paid for delivering more ads, e.g. as sponsored (officially or not) content;<p>- ensuring ongoing access to freshest news by not burning the sources, particularly government or corporate ones, by e.g. publishing things said sources don&#x27;t want to see published<p>This way, a fully free press walks into censorship and bias anyway, of its own volition[0].<p>Freedom of press is important, but I think we talk too much about ideas and principles, and too little about actual system dynamics in play.<p>--<p>[0] - Well, as much volition as you can have in a highly competitive industry, where if you don&#x27;t sacrifice your values, your competitor will, and then you&#x27;ll run out of money and die.')
