Conventional fuels are very convenient, and if you produce them synthetically without extracting resources from underground deposits, there&#x27;s a lot less climate impact. It wouldn&#x27;t eliminate tailpipe emissions, but it might significantly reduce sulfur emissions for example.<p>Long distance transportation is always going to be a challenge for EVs, that synthetic fuels could handle if they&#x27;re economical to produce and sell.')
