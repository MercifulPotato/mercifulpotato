The company did not mention any pricing details in the filing, but the offering is valued up to $1 billion. Airbnb intends to list its shares on the Nasdaq under the symbol ABNB.<p>&gt;The underwriters for the offering are Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Allen, BofA Securities, Barclays, Citigroup, BNP Paribas, Mizuho, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Jefferies, Wells Fargo, Baird, Canaccord Genuity, Cowen, D.A. Davidson, JMP Securities, KeyBanc Capital Markets, Needham, Oppenheimer, Piper Sandler, Raymond James, Stifel, Wedbush, William Blair, Academy, Blaylock Van, CastleOak, C.L. King, Guzman, Loop Capital Markets, MFR Securities, Mischler Financial Group, Ramirez, Siebert Williams Shank, Telsey Advisory Group and Tigress Financial Partners.<p>These are the Wall Street investors who are going to take the company public by purchasing huge amounts of shares from the private investors (like YC) and equity owners (like founders &amp; early employees) who held the private corporate shares until then.<p>They will negotiate an issue price of the IPO which is what they will be paying the earlier private shareholders who cash in.  This is like the wholesale price.  It determines&#x2F;is-deterined-by the overall company valuation at this point.<p>After that the shares will trade publicly on the exchange which the underwriters represent.<p>Any broker on that exchange can get shares for you at market prices after the market exists, and sell them to you at retail markup above that or not depending on your account terms.<p>If you want to actually participate in the IPO you may ideally have an account with one of the underwriters who is a dealer, such as Raymond, James &amp; Assoc. listed above, and agree in advance to their mark-up above the issue price, to purchase for your account upon issue.<p>In this case that would have been a way to acquire at a price well below the market&#x27;s opening price.')
