The military aesthetic is exhausting, I almost want to move to more  liberal state just to tilt the balance a bit - subarus and prius with dutch bro stickers are preferable to military-esque trucks with chimneys up the back and black and white american flag Punisher skulls. Between those and the people with the brass knuckles MMA stickers, the prevailing outward sentiment on the road here is &quot;I&#x27;m happy to shoot or beat you.&quot; That demographic isn&#x27;t interested in purple from my observations. Everyone else seems fine accepting a plain colors. I had to wait a couple extra days to get my car in the color I wanted - wasn&#x27;t even a &quot;fun&quot; color, just a more interesting shade of blue. I heard another lady told about the wait and she just took white. I suspect that happens quite a bit. You can get fun colors, but you need to wait.')
