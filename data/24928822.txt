They are fundamentally inhumane.<p>(You find zero tolerance in schools too. It&#x27;s heartbreaking to see children doing innocuous things and responsible adults completely vacating any kind of responsibility or accountability.)<p>If you get a group of people together, everyone&#x27;s going to have to put in at least a little effort to get along. If the code of conduct doesn&#x27;t enshrine this then it&#x27;s almost inevitably going to cause issues.<p>You may be able to argue that it&#x27;s not a case of bullying in this narrow instance, but if the policies lead to a one-sided situation with no recourse, then it&#x27;s bullying at a structural level.')
