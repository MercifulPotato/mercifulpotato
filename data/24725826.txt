Once I&#x27;d done all that it wasn&#x27;t much effort to throw in support for pass phrases and classic line-noise passwords, so those are in here too.  I am also using zxcvbn to evaluate password strength (since with certain options you can end up making a fairly weak password).<p>There are plenty of offline tools that have all these features but I haven&#x27;t found many online ones, and from what I&#x27;ve found my approach produces more convincing fake English words than others I&#x27;ve tried.')
