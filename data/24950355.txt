In East Germany it was illegal to watch Western TV, but it was possible because the West deliberately had strong transmitters aimed at the East.  There was a tradition that the evening news began by showing a big clock ticking for a few seconds with a chime on the hour that started the broadcast.  People used to set their wall clocks and watches to this.  On the West&#x27;s channel this clock was round, on the East&#x27;s it was square.  So in East Germany they asked children in school to draw the clock they saw on television, and if it was the wrong shape their family would get a visit from the Stasi.')
