I can&#x27;t help but read this as a dogwhistle to people who don&#x27;t like regular taxis because they&#x27;re often driven by immigrants with facial hair.<p>Incidentally I happen to believe uber&#x27;s initial rise to popularity exploited this as well.  Lots of people talking about how great it was that uber&#x27;s drivers were <i>&#x27;just regular guys&#x27;</i>, as if other taxi drivers are in some way &#x27;irregular.&#x27;  The only difference I ever saw was the relative proportion of immigrant drivers (a gap which, to Uber&#x27;s credit, narrowed a lot over the subsequent years.)')
