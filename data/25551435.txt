I think the two main reasons replacing experts is so hard is (1) it&#x27;s inherently difficult to understand another&#x27;s work you haven&#x27;t built from yourself and (2) it&#x27;s nearly impossible to find someone as enthusiastic for taking on a system and giving it the TLC it needs to keep it going smoothly to the extent that it matches the passion that the original creator poured into it. I find this most acutely whenever the original expert refers to it as &quot;their baby&quot;.')
