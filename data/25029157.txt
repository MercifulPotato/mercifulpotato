Given a language model which can generate a choice of multiple possible next-symbols given what has already been written, use bytes from the cypher text to choose between the available options.<p>For example, using the predictive text options on my iPhone, and treating 0=left 1=right, the cypher text 011100 and the starting symbol “Hi”, I get:<p>“Hi I have heard from the other”<p>(Note: I’m fairly sure the iPhone predictive text system is personalised and therefore time-variable, but the general idea still applies if you are in full control of the system).<p>3. If the other party knows the model and the initial word, they can use an equivalent process to  recover the cypher text and put that into the normal decryption routine.')
