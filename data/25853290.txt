People in my circles say things like &quot;I did a lot of research and this new mRNA vaccine is dangerous.&quot;<p>And there&#x27;s absolutely no way to disagree with that, because they can&#x27;t present the research and you can&#x27;t read for yourself what it was. You can&#x27;t critique the author&#x2F;organization, you can&#x27;t dispute any &quot;facts&quot; in the article, etc.<p>I think in-person can be good for very high level arguments, like &quot;I believe in personal responsibility,&quot; and figuring out &quot;I like this person even though I disagree with them.&quot; And terrible for intricate arguments like &quot;gun restrictions will save lives,&quot; covid policy, etc etc.<p>I would like to see a shift back to previous times, where nobody was outing their political beliefs, and everyone didn&#x27;t pretend to be an expert on domestic policies, covid, foreign policy, minimum wage, inflation, and everything else that they feel inclined to chime in about.<p>My grandmother (RIP) said in her youth (1930s), they didn&#x27;t know how their neighbor voted, how their teachers voted, and they might not even know how their spouse voted. I like that.')
