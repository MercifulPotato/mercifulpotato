That one can not get there by pure reason alone is a non-sequitur, as that applies equally to theologically-motivated ethics.<p>Furthermore, let&#x27;s suppose a theologian - for the sake of example, let&#x27;s say a christian one - insists that I am really a christian, on account of my ethical positions. Well, OK, but if that so, then it follows that being a christian does not involve believing in the Trinity, or that Christ is the son of God, or that God created the universe... in fact, that it does not involve <i>anything</i>  beyond holding certain ethical positions, and that christianity is identical with secular humanism!<p>Of course, it is rare to find an avowed christian who follows this line of thinking to its logical conclusion. Motte-and-bailey argumentation [1] is rampant in theological thinking.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Motte-and-bailey_fallacy" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Motte-and-bailey_fallacy</a>')
