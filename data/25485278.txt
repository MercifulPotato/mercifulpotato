This factory is near the outskirts of the city. Bangalore is one of the more expensive places to stay in India. The government mandated minimum pay for any contracted job is roughly 300 rupees a day or 7500 per month. This in itself is extremely low and hard to survive on. To give you an example, income tax  start at 50000 rupees a month. Anything below is considered low income by today&#x27;s standards. If this company was actually paying 500 rupees a month to its employees, it is not just cruel but downright illegal. Their management should be in jail for labor law violations.')
