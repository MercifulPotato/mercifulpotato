Item(by='rc-1140', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604605415, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25001040, text='&gt; You can make or troubleshoot software elsewhere than &#x27;software companies&#x27;. Banks, energy companies, telecoms, government, and practically every organization relies on software one way or another.<p>Unfortunately I&#x27;m unwanted there as well. I&#x27;ve been ghosted or rejected at the resume stage by every bank, energy company, postal company, etc. I&#x27;ve applied to. Government contracts always end with the recruiter saying that people are interviewing for the position and I have to wait and see (it never pans out).<p>&gt; Have you looked into freelancing just to make a living right now and get your basic needs taken care of?<p>Freelancing is a foreign-dominated market and I currently need a position that&#x27;s safe and consistent in terms of pay, as I have a dependent parent. I&#x27;ve been living off of emergency savings and unemployment so I need something that can rebuild that fund, and I can&#x27;t risk my sole source of income being denied because I was underbid by someone from China or India.<p>&gt; Have you tried applying at startups or small shops?<p>Yes for small shops, same results. Early on in my search, one particular small shop sent me a code screen before they would talk to me, I got the question right, and I was still rejected without even speaking to anybody. I try to avoid startups for similar reasons I list for freelancing.')
