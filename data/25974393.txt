Its about a year out and I already miss my podcasts, the walk from parking to the office and meetings around the table.<p>I think managers want people in the office (generally) because that&#x27;s easier to manage (traditionally). So once vaccines become The Norm, it&#x27;ll be a move back towards that. I think that companies that have done remote can&#x27;t go back 100% in office though (with exceptions) and won&#x27;t stay 100% remote (again, with exceptions).<p>I don&#x27;t see my company staying 100% remote but we have done real well with remote (and a switch to agile&#x2F;scrum, coincidentally, at the same time).')
