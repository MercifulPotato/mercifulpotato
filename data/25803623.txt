It&#x27;s a constant reminder at how crappy the development experience is and it&#x27;s also not long enough to do something else while it completes so you&#x27;re stuck wasting your life away on a tool.<p>Is anyone really happy when they need to wait 10 seconds to see a change when developing a web app?<p>I think the web context is important because you can relate to it from past experiences. In 2001 there was a near instant feedback loop with making a change to a PHP page and reloading the browser. Anything less than that 20 years later seems like a direct downgrade, especially considering computers are probably 1,000x faster today.')
