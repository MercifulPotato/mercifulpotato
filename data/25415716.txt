Assuming no updates, it is written once. Mocks are written 47 times, inconsistently, while focusing primarily on other tasks. If there are updates needed, better to fix them in one place than chasing 47 test code locations with inconsistent usages.<p>Furthermore, these are external dependencies that can&#x27;t be run in-process. If a dependency <i>can</i> be run in-process (aka library), there is no justification to ever mock it. I&#x27;ve even seen codebases that mock their own class B in order to test class A. Run the production code already. Ban mocking libraries.')
