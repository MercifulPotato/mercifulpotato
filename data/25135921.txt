Generally speaking I think these are nitpicking, but given the reach and audience of DaringFireball I do wish he made it a little clearer. You will definitely see some Apple Fans running around on the Internet suggesting Apple doesn&#x27;t do GC, they do Reference Counting.<p>The same thing happened with AirPod when he claims AirPod were likely sold at cost [1]<p>&gt;<i>At $159, I think the margins on AirPods are very low. Maybe even break-even territory.</i><p>This had a lot of people believing AirPod are really low margin, but they are not. They are extremely high margin, as with any Audio Product. And It is extremely profitable for Apple for the volume they are selling, where demand has been outpacing Supply for nearly 6 months after the initial AirPod launch.<p>&gt;The Fan, I presume it has engaged at times when Iâ€™ve taxed the system. Again, the Cinebench multi-core CPU benchmark taxes every available CPU core for 10 minutes.<p>I have yet to see any one actually running Mac Fan Control to test it. But the numbers are in System Report. Generally speaking Macbook, or even iMac dont turn the Fan up until it is 80C+. Steve Jobs <i>hate</i> Fan noise. And this tradition has been kept. So even when they have it installed they dont kick in until very late. In normal circumstance the Fan runs at ~1200 RPM, and is literally unheard-able. Then there were unconfirmed report where 11.01 allows the MacBook Pro and Mac Mini to run closet to 3.2Ghz peak where previously it was closer to 3Ghz, as it was on MacBook Air.<p>&gt;So what gives? Well, these M1 systems are replacing Intel-based Macs that never had more than 16 GB of RAM.<p>The memory Apple is using and support; LPDDR4X only allows up to 16GB in Dual Channel config. As it was the case in previous Intel gen laptop, Apple later had to switch to DDR4 memory for 32GB &#x2F; 64GB MacBook Pro. Apple could upgrade to LPDDR5, which gives them 32GB in Dual Channel Config and 64GB in Quad Channel Config. Or Apple could go with High Bandwidth Memory. The first will be cheaper and lower power, but doesn&#x27;t quite fit the usage of iMac, the second is expensive and could be expanded towards Desktop usage. It will be interesting to see how this play out next year. ( Rumours, or more like Industry sources from Supply Chain are currently pointing to 14&quot; &#x2F; 16&quot; Redesigned MacBook Pro mid next year &#x2F; WWDC )<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;daringfireball.net&#x2F;linked&#x2F;2016&#x2F;09&#x2F;29&#x2F;airpod-survey" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;daringfireball.net&#x2F;linked&#x2F;2016&#x2F;09&#x2F;29&#x2F;airpod-survey</a>')
