They&#x27;ve never pulled a Mr. Robot (3rd party advertisement integration) or a Pocket (forced 3rd party extension integration) on me like Mozilla has. There are way more eyeballs on Google, so if they do something that I don&#x27;t like - I&#x27;ll know about it and how to fix it or work around it. I also don&#x27;t like Mozilla&#x27;s culture of political ideology at all. Finally, they had the swing vote for getting rid of WebSQL and they pushed that freaking piece of crap IndexedDB instead (among other bad decisions).<p>Beyond that, there are lots of things about Firefox that just annoy me. Off the top of my head - The search box being on the bottom and taking up the whole horizontal width of the view box, the inconsistent menus (context menu sub-menus fly out on hover, the program menu sub-menus do not), the boxy design and the native title bar which results in less vertical space. They only thing I&#x27;d want from Firefox would be containers - but I just use separate Chrome profiles to get the same effect.<p>I&#x27;m also a developer and I vastly prefer to use, test with and develop against something from the Chromium&#x2F;Blink&#x2F;WebKit lineage over Gecko. I want a mono-culture and to that end, I basically only test with Chrome and Safari. Everybody else can either keep up or die (or fork Chromium, customize it and maintain that). There&#x27;s absolutely no problem with every Linux distro using the Linux kernel mono-culture, so why would there be a problem with a common browser engine&#x2F;infrastructure mono-culture?<p>If I have to switch, I&#x27;d much rather go with something like Vivaldi or Brave. I doubt it will come to that though as I will probably only have to pause Chrome updates for a brief time while new extensions come out to keep blocking ads. The Manifest v3 limitation is in the number of rules (30k per extension) so I bet that each filter-list will just be it&#x27;s own extension. There is no limitation on cosmetic filtering via injected JS.')
