I don&#x27;t really have a preference there.<p>But for &quot;fun&quot; 16:9 is better since with 16:10 you have black bars in most media, no matter if it&#x27;s a movie or conference talk or whatever. And fun is important use case for a laptop - I wanna watch movies on a plane or train, and even at home since it&#x27;s mobile. Having big TV in living room is nice, but being able to watch cooking video right in the kitchen, or tinkering video in garage is great.<p>I&#x27;m actually kinda bummed that Dell went to 16:10 on XPS 13, since I was eyeing that as my next laptop.')
