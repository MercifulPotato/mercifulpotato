If the US becomes a failed state like you describe, turning into a totalitarian wasteland where not even the pretense of democracy is maintained, do you really think the secret police are going to let you buy things with gold?<p>The fed introducing a cryptocurrency will not cause the US to become a failed state, and if the US is on the path to becoming a failed state, then the federal reserve not introducing a cryptocurrency isn&#x27;t going to change anything. You cant eat gold. Buy productive assets. If you think society is going to collapse like that into a totalitarian state, then, I dunno, move to some country that you think is not on the path to giving up democracy, or go full prepper and buy land and guns and stuff. Good luck holding off the US military though. Might be better to defect when you have the chance.')
