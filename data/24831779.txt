I&#x27;m hopeful that you&#x27;ll succeed. Currently my group maintains a discord community that helps us find players and connect with vetted DMs.<p>Can you please un-SPA your site? It&#x27;s really hard to use and the current use pattern is to find a DM and move the discussion off your site as quickly as possible.<p>- The infinite scroll feature makes it really hard and slow to find DMs. \n- The site doesn&#x27;t let you open a DM&#x27;s profile in a separate tab which forces you to lose your place whenever you visit a DM&#x27;s profile\n- The profile summaries are unhelpfully inconsistent&#x2F;dishonest (Professional for 80 years, Hosted over 1M games, etc.) The profiles can&#x27;t be true and make any sorting&#x2F;filtering impossible.\n- The DM&#x27;s platforms and supported games aren&#x27;t on the find a DM page.\n- The DM profiles lack structure and rich content features. Please add a native video embed so that we can see videos&#x2F;clips. Most DM&#x27;s offer that by linking to their twitch&#x2F;youtube properties. Make the profile fields less generic.\n  -- DNDBeyond content share?\n  -- Roll20 content share?\n  -- Audio provider? Discord&#x2F;Roll20&#x2F;Zoom\n  -- vtt supported? Roll20&#x2F;FantasyGrounds&#x2F;etc<p>Looking forward to seeing where you go and excited for your success.')
