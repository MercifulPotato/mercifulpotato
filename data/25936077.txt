You can quickly cobble together something solid from geerlingguy.  It might need a day or two to hash up some basic yml - not long.  Or... you could just ssh on your server and configure it manually, and cross your fingers - even quicker.<p>Even if you start with k8s and you want to scale, at some point you&#x27;ll want to configure your images in a predictable way with something like Ansible.  Whether you do that for the images you deploy, or your configure it in situ for a single-node, it&#x27;s still the same complexity cost.')
