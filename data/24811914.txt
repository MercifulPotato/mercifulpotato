You are exposed to the dominant economic and cultural ecosystems easier and much earlier. You may lack some ability to switch context and reframe things for different cultures, but it&#x27;s not generally a practical necessity in life.<p>On the other hand, you <i>may</i> sometimes be harder to understand for non-native speakers, especially if you speak some non-mainstream dialect or pronunciation. (Even standard British, in normal speech, is probably harder for me to process than American: depends on what you&#x27;ve been exposed to.) Coming from some other Latin script language, you&#x27;d probably have a better feel for oddities in English pronunciation (like &#x27;thumb&#x27;, or &#x27;pseudo&#x27;, etc.) and can easier adapt some more consistent &#x27;euro&#x27; way of pronouncing as needed. Sometimes people won&#x27;t understand you otherwise.')
