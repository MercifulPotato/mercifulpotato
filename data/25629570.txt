I&#x27;ve been blogging for quite some time already; more as a relaxing activity than anything; I do like sharing what I learn about.<p>I do try to monetize what I write, but it won&#x27;t make me rich anyways ^^.<p>The book doesn&#x27;t distract me from the startup project; it&#x27;s just another project, to which I dedicate two evenings a week and a few hours during the week-end.<p>It&#x27;s important to me for other reasons; mostly the will to share what I do know about, and the need to think about something else.<p>I couldn&#x27;t work on the startup project also during those evenings&#x2F;week-ends. I don&#x27;t want to be in burnout state just because I was able to pour in more hours each week.<p>Question of equilibrium. Maybe I would&#x27;ve done that ten years ago, but not today.')
