Sorting huge, multinational, publicly traded companies in friends and enemies list is so obviously bogus and immature that it baffles me that this is so prevalent.<p>If that&#x27;s true, then why do brands exist?<p>For most companies, the best way to drive profit is to build a long term relationship of trust with their customers and suppliers.<p>Edit: this doesn&#x27;t mean I&#x27;m ready to join the Microsoft&#x2F;Apple&#x2F;Google&#x2F;Facebook&#x2F;Amazon fan club, but I can see that some companies regularly behave better than others, and I&#x27;m happy to act on that reputation.
