While blimps were a thing, the idea of an aircraft as pictured wasn&#x27;t something that existed (AFAIK).  You can see some of that with the fact that everyone just had wings and nothing else.  However, there were a few propeller airplanes in the mix which somewhat surprised me.<p>The other part I find fascinating is what they thought you COULD easily automate with mechanical means (like a barber, lol!)<p>Some of it they hit right on the mark (like farming) others were way off on how easily they&#x27;d be automated.<p>I also thought the automated band was simply funny.
