I have man boobs and a muffin top. While I’m rarely the fattest person around anymore, I’m very clearly still overweight.<p>In college a classmate used the term &quot;skinny fat&quot; to describe himself, same body type you describe. He was within the healthy weight range for his height and frame, but because of poor diet and exercise (primarily exercise) he had a rather high body fat percentage. It&#x27;s easy to hit that point if you have a halfway decent diet (at least by calorie count) but a sedentary lifestyle (like us at the time, and perhaps more now, living on our computers playing video games and programming). The rest of us were just &quot;fat fat&quot; since our diets (especially sodas, he never drank any and some of us were only hydrated because of them) were much worse than his and we were similarly sedentary.')
