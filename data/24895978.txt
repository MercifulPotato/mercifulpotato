What’ll happen to speeding tickets when every car is autonomous&#x2F;self-driving and could just be programmed to not go over the limit? In <i>theory,</i> we could go one step further and <i>remove</i> speed limits from autonomous-only roads as the cars would be smart enough (<i>in theory</i>) to know what speed and distance is safe. But that last part is a pipe dream it seems.')
