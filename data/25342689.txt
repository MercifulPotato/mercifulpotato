It&#x27;s super easy now-days to swap in a local lightweight database like sqlite which is 99.9% compatible with your production database, and use this for even tiny unit tests.  Validating any single database call would definitely be a unit test in any of the codebases I&#x27;ve worked with.<p>&quot;Integration&quot; tests in my mind cover cross-service interfaces and infrastructure which is a PITA to access locally.  For example, interacting AWS infrastructure whose behavior you can&#x27;t reliably mock locally.')
