I&#x27;m not much of a car guy. But I just recently bought a new vehicle and I ruled out Tesla because of that story from last month. I was looking at cars when that story came out. I don&#x27;t know if stories like flying roofs, and the wood and the other stuff only make the news because they&#x27;re Tesla and maybe these things don&#x27;t happen all that often, but that  non-standard parts thing really made me steer clear of Tesla while shopping for cars last month. It seems like so many of these things just don&#x27;t happen to other cars?')
