In a way, these relationships are stronger because they can persist for years after you&#x27;ve finished working together -- making friends is a good way to find new work.<p>I also have made up for it in my personal life. I find that I don&#x27;t necessarily share the viewpoints of everybody that I&#x27;m working with, so it&#x27;s nice to spend more time with people that I&#x27;ve opted to spend time with instead.<p>So I think even from a relationships perspective I think I&#x27;ve made better friends with people that I meet while contracting (and choose to maintain relationships with) than I have when meeting people after being assigned to a certain team.')
