All the other maps are expert - hardcoded at about the % age of a classic minesweeper mine density.  Trade off is you get three lives, though most people (sigh, like me) just reset when they hit their first daisy.<p>Plan is to rebuild the menu hexagon with these options so you can set it however you like, but this is a side hobby so won&#x27;t be until next month that I&#x27;ll get to it.  If you spy on what&#x27;s sent via socket.io, you can override the density parameter in console and request new games ;)<p>My favorite part of the game doesn&#x27;t exist anymore, was actually the death screen animations but somewhere between code updates I tabled it and never reinstated it.  Random tiles would minimize into the distance and then rotate every few seconds and everything would blur out except the correct numbers, spitting in your face sort of.  Was eerie.')
