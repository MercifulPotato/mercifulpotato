I just wish that when I disable scripts for a website, it would still let my browser plugins that inject JS work. On Firefox, whatever browser plugin I use to block scripts does this out of the box. It makes more sense to do it this way, since I’m not saying “don’t run scripts on pages of this domain”, I’m saying “don’t run scripts originating from pages on this domain”.')
