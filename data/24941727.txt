That&#x27;s just the news making you feel that way.<p>I am not only looking at statistics to comfort myself. I am also looking at leadership and the direction of this ship, just like the way I would evaluate a potential employer.<p>Working a job at a sinking, chaotic ship with NO DESIRE to improve sucks. America&#x27;s leadership, government and 50% of the population who&#x27;d cheer the crazy captain at the expense of the ship are exactly that.<p>No amount of past statistics can change the present reality.')
