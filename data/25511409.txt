The thing that makes for a good web-cam is a great lens.  The sensor and body of the camera is mostly commodity and contributes at max $50-$100. A good lens with shallow depth of field will cost $500-$700. So the best case current solution would be $700+ for something that will look as good as a high-quality DSLR without the body complexity.<p>I designed a prototype of this type of camera and I think there&#x27;s a market but it&#x27;s difficult to defend.  You end up competing with Logitech or Canon, GoPro &amp; Apple enter the market.<p>It&#x27;s more likely that cell-phone quality cameras start being added to laptops and the shallow depth of field is done in software.')
