This kind of decline happened everywhere in the world, except maybe Japan. But the introduction of HSR in Japan was done by government railways and actually bankrupted them, forcing them to split the debts into a &quot;bad bank&quot; and privatize JR Group.<p>Railways were going to decline because we spent a half trillion dollars building a competing highway system, which had several distinct advantages:<p>- by and large highway travel in the US is not charged a toll, which makes the per-mile marginal cost much easier to deal with<p>- highways are not charged property tax and railways are. Many a railroad during the decline ripped out tracks and electrification to reduce the value of their property and to goose up their balance sheet before potential mergers.<p>- in addition to not paying tolls, the amount of subsidy for highways from the general funds is much higher; compare that to Amtrak, which is so poorly funded a lot of its trains don&#x27;t run more than once a day.<p>- minimum parking regulations are pretty much everywhere in the United States, and the requirements are generally much higher than what&#x27;s needed, so last-mile is not a problem for cars; you have to arrange a journey to and from the train station<p>The main difference between here and countries that survived a railway decline is the absolute lack of interest from the government in keeping it alive. Amtrak was founded by Nixon with the intention of letting it die.')
