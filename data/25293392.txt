(This is HN after all.) But I think this could be even more transformative in vehicle sales.<p>Example: I work for a boat manufacturer. We&#x27;ve wanted to sell boats online for many years, but it&#x27;s not the kind of product you charge to a credit card. (Most of our boats are in the $30k-80k range.)<p>So one of the biggest challenges to selling online is the financing. A service like this, once it opens up outside the US and for B2C, could solve that problem.<p>I could see this having a transformative (disruptive?) effect on boats, RVs, cars, trucks, ATVs, etc. Basically any big-ticket item that doesn&#x27;t require getting a lawyer involved.')
