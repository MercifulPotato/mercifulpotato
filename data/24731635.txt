A couple of months ago they were auto-suspending new accounts - create account, spend ~20 mins following people and looking around, then &quot;are you a robot&quot;, then a few minutes later &quot;give us your phone number&quot; else suspended.  They seem to think new users are going to get so hooked in 20 mins they&#x27;ll give up their phone number.  I returned to an auto-suspended account a couple of weeks ago and found that &quot;suspended&quot; had changed to mean read-only.  Bye-bye twitter.')
