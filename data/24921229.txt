Nor does it work on a laptop with a resolution that requires scaling (at least not the second you plug in another display).<p>It also takes a <i>hell</i> of a lot more configuration to reach that state.<p>It&#x27;s also not maintained.<p>So no disrespect, but it really sounds like your argument has boiled down to &quot;I won&#x27;t acknowledge issues unless they personally impact me and my daily workflow&quot;.<p>Now - I&#x27;m fine with that when you&#x27;re making an argument for the machine you should use personally (hell, I agree with you, if X works and you like, rock on).  But that&#x27;s a pretty disingenuous take to make while discussing the merits of the platform with other folks.')
