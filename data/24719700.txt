Which means once plastic has come into existence, it&#x27;s gonna be around pretty much forever. Considering the fact that forever is a long time and that we continue to make more plastic anyway, I don&#x27;t see how it matters that we use the same plastic once or some finite number of times.<p>We need to find a way to destroy plastic safely or just not produce plastic at all. I imagine the politics and the economics around plastic is more complicated than we appreciate. After all it&#x27;s related to oil.<p>Recyclable plastic is just a way to get us to buy more plastic while feeling a sense of satisfaction&#x2F;pride that we are doing our part to save the planet. That&#x27;s just ironic and, frankly, as consumers quite pathetic.')
