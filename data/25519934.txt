Where do you go for authoritative information on CSS that doesn&#x27;t involve digging through winding, terse technical specifications? That may be fine for developers making web browsers but becoming an &#x27;expert&#x27; in CSS shouldn&#x27;t be a requirement just to make a web page. Hell, even the experts struggle with it otherwise all web browsers would have consistent CSS rendering. A good example is centering an element in CSS. What&#x27;s the <i>right</i> way to do it? There&#x27;s a multitude of techniques with varying advantages and trade-offs. I first cut my teeth in web development in 2001 and we still don&#x27;t have a simple, straight forward, codified way to accomplish this seemingly simple task. Instead we have an ever changing standard coupled with a dizzying amount of opinions on the matter and inconsistent browser support on mobile devices. We can&#x27;t really blame the failure of tutorials when there&#x27;s no clear authoritative reference point to work from.')
