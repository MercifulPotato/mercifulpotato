But there is also no reason to assume that a protestor with no gun, bomb or ziptie is equivalent to one that has one.<p>Lone wolves and troublemakers out to get Congresspeople exist. There might be a few in the mob. But the mob itself isn&#x27;t made up of people like that. This is the same logic that was being applied to protestors all through 2020. It is hard to get away from the BLM protests being peaceful even with burning buildings in the background.')
