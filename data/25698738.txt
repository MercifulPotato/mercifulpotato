The only people I&#x27;ve ever seen claim it doesn&#x27;t are people that aren&#x27;t claiming they want to defund police but do want to side with those who do. &quot;They can&#x27;t really mean that, you must have misunderstood.&quot; - nope.<p>Just like when I say repeal 230, I&#x27;m seriously saying get rid of the thing or at least rework it so people aren&#x27;t being censored by non non govt but still very real monopolies on speech.')
