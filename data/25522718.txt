All computations should me &quot;marked&quot; as total or effectful with various possible effects (blocking, async, nondeterministic, possibly non-terminating etc etc).<p>Reasoning about your program is hard when each computation is a blackbox possibly containing any side-effects which could cause unpredictable changes in the control flow and result in a completely incomprehensible way.<p>Async&#x2F;await thing is indeed least sound and ergonomic way of doing this. Monads with monad transformers are a bit better. Algebraic effects are the best in terms of composability, ergonomics and mental overhead, but not here yet (though OCaml may be soon become the first industrial-grade language incorporating them [1])<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=z8SI7WBtlcA" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=z8SI7WBtlcA</a>')
