Item(by='walrus01', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611077799, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25835502, text='It&#x27;s actually quite hard to get the FCC to fine you, you have to do something very clearly illegal for a very long period of time, and ignore the warnings given...  Such as the WISP in UT some years back which continued to operate PtMP last mile 5 GHz stuff in the DFS radar bands, and got fined $25,000.<p>If you go through the notices of apparent liability issued by the FCC, which are all public, the individual persons getting fined are egregiously dumb, such as the guy who operated a multi band cellular jammer on his daily commute north&#x2F;south on the interstate freeway in Florida. Or you have to do something like operate a pirate FM radio station for many months at a time always from the same fixed location.<p>The FCC&#x27;s enforcement bureau does not have a great number of staff or resources to go chasing down everything.')
