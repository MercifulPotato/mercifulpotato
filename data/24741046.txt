As a teaching assistant a few years ago I spent a good chunk of my time in the lab showing otherwise brilliant computer science students things like basic terminal commands, how to read error messages, and just overall basic problem solving skills. Almost all of the students I worked with were much stronger than me in terms of theory and what I call “whiteboard computer science”, but many of those same students who aced written tests really struggled with basic roadblocks like learning language syntax to do practical assignments.<p>It sounds really silly, but some of the best instruction I gave was “Tab” to autocomplete a command and “Up Arrow” to re-run the last command. Whenever I would do a class demo on the projector someone would always stop me to ask how I was running commands so quickly and fluidly and how on Earth I could remember them all.')
