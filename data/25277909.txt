The response by ship builders was to build empty “torpedo bulges” on the sides of ships to trigger the torpedo early, preventing structural damage.<p>Modern torpedoes instead detonate <i>under</i> the ship. The explosion creates a massive bubble (most explosives being nothing more than a solid that’s itching to turn into a hot cloud of nitrogen). This bubble ends up under the ship, resulting in a ship that’s supported at the ends and not the middle. It turns out modern ships aren’t strong enough to support their own weight in this way, and the ship breaks in two.<p>Obviously this lacks the grinding mechanism described here, but the similarity is in the application of a huge amount of force in the middle of a ship to break it.')
