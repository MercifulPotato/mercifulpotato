That <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> mean that they do not prevent spreading the disease, only that we don&#x27;t <i>know</i> whether they do. Presumably the reason for this choice of endpoint is that we can detect sickness, but we can&#x27;t reliably detect transmission.<p>If I may pick another nit, it&#x27;s not <i>a</i>symptomatic but <i>pre</i>symptomatic that seem to be the major concern, from what I&#x27;ve heard: that is, people who spread the disease will eventually show symptoms (usually within a day or two). The balance of evidence seems to suggest that people with viral loads that never get high enough to cause illness are probably not enough to cause a significant number of transmissions, but we will have to wait for widespread vaccination to confirm it.')
