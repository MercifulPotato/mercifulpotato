They&#x27;re so cocooned in their bubble that they can&#x27;t process anything resembling a contradictory opinion; it sends them into emotional haywire and their only response is to cry victim.<p>When I hear someone talking about &quot;gaslighting&quot; it significantly lowers my inclination to take them seriously.')
