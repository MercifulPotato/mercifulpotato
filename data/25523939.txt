Item(by='lmm', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608769816, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25520795, text='Types (you don&#x27;t even need full dependent types) let you check your reasoning about why something is true, which is IME the core of the larger problem. Most of the time the bug doesn&#x27;t happen because everyone forgot that it&#x27;s possible for i2c to not respond, it&#x27;s because component a thought that it should pass the i2c response straight through to component b and component b would handle the i2c not responding, whereas component b thought that component a had already handled the case where the i2c didn&#x27;t respond (or rather, component b is a pass-through middleware that calls component c that wraps component d and component d thought that i2c not responding had already been handled). Types absolutely help with that.')
