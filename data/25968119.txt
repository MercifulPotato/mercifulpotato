Humans are becoming slaves of the tools they build, not vice versa. Our biological abilities fade away in the presence of technological progress. People may fantasy about some cyberpank future, but I have doubts about it. Simpler organisms can&#x27;t control what is superior to them. And I&#x27;m pretty sure general AI is a real thing, at least in the future. So, the confrontation between humans as biological species and tech progress is quite justifiable.')
