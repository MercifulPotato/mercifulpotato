The project was started as a Fuchsia fork, and we intend to continue working hard on getting that ready, but sadly a lack of access to compatible modern hardware forced our hand to temporarily switch over to Linux as the development platform, so our layers of project would not stagnate while we wait for more polishing on Google&#x27;s end.')
