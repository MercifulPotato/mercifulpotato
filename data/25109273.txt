There seems to be a standard for TCP over UDP [1].  But in general, I would assume that it does not help at all WRT any of the packet loss&#x2F;latency problems posed by satellite links.<p>TCP is designed for encapsulation in IP, this is why it is called TCP&#x2F;IP.  And UDP is very similar to IP, only difference is that UDP gives you source and destination port numbers and a payload checksum, where IP only gives you a protocol numbers and non-checksummed data.  None of these &quot;features&quot; is going to have any effect on how TCP is delivered.<p>So the only effect that use of TCP over UDP would have here is:<p>- increase the overhead used for headers, thereby decreasing the MSS (segment size)<p>- &quot;cloak&quot; the TCP traffic as UDP and thereby prevent any routers and&#x2F;or middleboxes [2] from applying special treatment to TCP (i.e. traffic shaping, buffering etc.)<p>Maybe the latter effect is what made a difference for the link in question.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tools.ietf.org&#x2F;id&#x2F;draft-baset-tsvwg-tcp-over-udp-01.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tools.ietf.org&#x2F;id&#x2F;draft-baset-tsvwg-tcp-over-udp-01....</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Middlebox" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Middlebox</a><p>edit: formatting')
