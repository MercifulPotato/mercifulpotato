By virtue of your existence, you would be there as little fish literally to be eaten by larger one&#x27;s.<p>For every time a large company trolls a smaller one, there are 100 times one company decides not to infringe on some other work.<p>For example, I work with a hardware company that has patents. We freely send our products to larger competitors. Why? Because they know we have good IP, and were they to copy our approach, it would be a straightforward infringement on us, and it would risk their entire business.<p>Admittedly, we are luckily that infringement in this case would be fairly clear because that&#x27;s not always the case.')
