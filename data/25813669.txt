It&#x27;s just complicated to set up, which is why (I think) nobody has done it.<p>&gt; But we have to trust that Moxie is running the server software he says he is.<p>I don&#x27;t understand what you&#x27;re suggesting instead. There&#x27;s no practical solution to this problem.<p>&gt; Signal doesn’t have a warrant canary<p>Warrant canaries are legally untested.<p>&gt; Truly secure systems don’t require trust.<p>Can you give an example of a truly secure system?
