Typically it is split depending on whether the person is more senior or junior. Since you mentioned college I’m going to assume you fall somewhere on the junior side of the scale.<p>For junior positions I am mostly looking to see that the person is eager to learn and has a good mentality. This means that the person doesn’t have a huge ego, talks passionately about projects, etc. red flags would be not knowing extreme basics like functions or variables. IMO for junior positions culture fit is way more important. I want someone that will learn and grow with the team.')
