Or std::unordered_map? Or std::string? These are all perfectly fine classes, banning them makes no sense at all.</i><p>Orthodox C++ bans exceptions, so if an allocation failure occurs within one of those classes, the only thing your program can do is abort.<p>That’s fine for some programs - Google’s C++ style guide takes this approach, as does LLVM. But for other programs, where aborting on allocation failure is not acceptable, there’s no way to use those classes without using exceptions.')
