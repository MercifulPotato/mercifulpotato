Software development is a job. There is nothing wrong with taking a job because of the paycheck. Many of the startups discussed on HN are not doing it for &quot;the art&quot; of software development, they are seeking money. The VCs that drive the startup world are doing it for money. Telling coders that they need to be in it for the craft of coding while everyone else around them is in it for the money... that is simply unreasonable.<p>I&#x27;m happy for you that you love the work so much to even have such a perspective. But it isn&#x27;t a fair perspective to everyone else.')
