In my experience it&#x27;s easier to get good at things you want to be doing, and it also keeps you from getting tricked into doing things that everyone else is doing or things that will make money but make you unhappy. If the thing you want to do tends to generate money (CS for example) then you&#x27;re all set, if it doesn&#x27;t (music for example) then figure out how to solve the problem of making money with that skill, otherwise you are more likely to be mediocre at multiple things because you&#x27;ll be forced to do something you don&#x27;t want to do to pay the bills.')
