Microsoft doesn&#x27;t really sell Windows upgrades anymore. They don&#x27;t need to convince the user to purchase a new version of Windows by saying it won&#x27;t break their programs. Now it&#x27;s all Windows 10.<p>Microsoft will update the operating system users use and if it breaks something, oh well. There is no real competition to Windows anymore.  Previously, the competition was staying on the previous version of Windows. macOS? This breaks programs even more often. Linux? Good luck getting an user to use that.')
