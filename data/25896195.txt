I don&#x27;t think any solutions require the acknowledgment that the group exists, officially. Discrimination can happen on a number of lines that are not in whatever survey the state creates so any effective solution has to address the tendency toward discrimination of all sorts. In the US, we don&#x27;t collect information (officially) on sexual orientation or religion yet we still take steps to protect people from discrimination on those avenues despite having no metrics.<p>I think collecting that data has a danger of creating a list of officially recognized groups which can be discriminated against (at the expense of those not tracked). This happens in the US with sexual orientation because it has not been in the list of things that it&#x27;s illegal to discriminate against innthe past. Instead of just making discrimination illegal, it&#x27;s only illegal to discriminate by race, religion or gender. If, instead, it were just illegal to discriminate, that wouldn&#x27;t be an issue.')
