My point was simply that I think there&#x27;s a lot of great music out there being made as we speak.<p>Does it sound similar to what was made 20 years ago? Certainly not everything, but that&#x27;s where I am with my tastes at the moment.<p>&gt; The fact you are giving me band camp links only strengthens the point im saying.<p>I gave Bandcamp links because that&#x27;s where I get all my music from, and because I think it&#x27;s better for the artists to share Bandcamp links than to say Spotify.<p>&gt; People arent going to go through everything on bandcamp to possibly find a gem.<p>That&#x27;s why they have Bandcamp Weekly[1] and such, but of course there&#x27;s lots of other ways.<p>&gt; Rock is not a major genre any more.<p>Major as in there&#x27;s not a lot of really big acts, ala say Kiss or Van Halen, then sure. Is that so surprising?<p>The affordability of audio recording and the internet means its much easier for smaller acts to find an audience. This leads to more variety, as people can make and find various niches.<p>Is that a bad thing?<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bandcamp.com&#x2F;?show=412" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bandcamp.com&#x2F;?show=412</a>')
