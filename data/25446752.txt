I studied computer science, and in 30 years, I&#x27;ve hardly used any of it. There were a few jobs where some of the statistics and math were helpful, but in my long career, I&#x27;ve seen very little overlap between computer science and working as a software engineer. Google and other big tech companies use these criteria to filter people out at the hiring stage, but the vast majority of work has nothing to do with any of this stuff.')
