WTF?<p>Agreed, in part, but if you only knew what a clusterfuck the underlying system is even with incredibly expensive employer based medical insurance was you&#x27;d probably be more open to seeing things like this take palce. And before you start with &#x27;but in my country...&#x27; just know I&#x27;ve lived in countries with socialized medicine, where having to wait months for appointments to see a specialist is the norm, years for a surgery is nearly guaranteed and even needing a Dr&#x27;s RX for aspirin (Germany!) is needed which is equally absurd to me as I got injured and ended up just drinking vodka to endure the pain instead of just having something available that is OTC in most countries.<p>None of these systems are what I would call &#x27;good,&#x27; and are all in need of massive reform. And while this does have a lot of sensationalism behind it that makes it look bad, I say just look at my earlier post and just focus at the results and what comparable rollout efforts look like before condemning them entirely.<p>The US is an experiment, and one that has been failing most people at large for several decades now because of entrenched bureaucratic power deterring or outright denying these kind of accelerated forms of disruption to their monopolies and business models. I now see COVID as an opportunity as much as I see it as catastrophic shock to the system now.')
