Item(by='yellowapple', descendants=None, kids=[25837411], score=None, time=1611079485, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25835806, text='&gt; There are no alternatives.<p>The alternative is to not use iOS-based devices, which seems like a pretty good idea all around from a transparency avenue (and like I&#x27;ve said before on this site, like the broken record I am: transparency is a dependency of trust).  That&#x27;s exactly Librem&#x27;s argument, and it&#x27;s a compelling one: you have no control over the device or visibility into the software running on it, so how can you trust it to be operating for your benefit instead of that of some third party?<p>Even Android devices typically allow sideloading, and quite a few even support custom ROMs.  That is: even devices with software maintained by a literal ad company are more transparent - and therefore more trustworthy, even if only marginally - than any iPhone or iPad.')
