In fact, they kept with their rapid-and-frequent-testing program, and while the rest of the state was going through an enormous spike in cases (about an order of magnitude higher than in Sept: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rosshartshorn.net&#x2F;stuffrossthinksabout&#x2F;covid_stuff&#x2F;Illinois.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rosshartshorn.net&#x2F;stuffrossthinksabout&#x2F;covid_stu...</a>), the frequency on campus was flat.  The initial spike on campmus lasted about two weeks, whereas the big spike in the rest of the state lasted through Dec and Jan and still isn&#x27;t back down to where it was in Sept.<p>It&#x27;s an odd way to write the story, to use that as your example of a failure, when it turned out to be a rare case of successfully keeping the lid on when the state around you is rocketing upwards.
