Several of my neighbors put distracting lights on their houses without considering color theory. I noticed some green and red decorations at the grocery store too, clashing with the usual white&#x2F;blue theme.<p>I had planned to spend Friday catching up on HN but after two minutes with these colors my eyes starting watering. Who decides to make these arbitrary changes?<p>I&#x27;m developing a hypothesis (which I will eventually describe in a Medium post) that these color changes and attempts at decoration coincide with certain days of the year, but I haven&#x27;t quite worked out the pattern yet.')
