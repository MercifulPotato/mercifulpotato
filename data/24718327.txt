Same as almost everyone can afford a VW Golf, Ford Focus, Toyota... whatever. What Boom wants to build is the equivalent of a Ferrari or Lamborghini - it does the same thing as a normal airliner, but faster and in a  more resource-consuming and therefore expensive way. And, like most people can&#x27;t afford a super sports car, most people won&#x27;t be able to afford a ticket for their supersonic airplanes (same as they couldn&#x27;t afford a ticket for Concorde).')
