It should not be the goal. I think the outcome for civilization would not be optimal if many more people were empathic right now, we still need a mix. But there are degrees of empathic ability. Only a very few people like me ( &lt; 0.01% ) get the emotions of everyone around them without trying.<p>I think the general population is comprised only less than 20% of people who are &quot;empathic&quot; to the extent whare if they try, or, are relationally close to someone they do feel their feels. Then, more than 85% of people are &quot;rationally compassionate&quot; in that they understand how others feel if they make an effort, yet around a 1&#x2F;3 of people do that automatically with no effort.<p>I think only around 10% of people are incapable of understanding how others feel at all. But if those people make some effort that number goes down to 1-2%. But while psychopaths are in that 10% they&#x27;re not really in that 1-2%. And those people who &quot;don&#x27;t have subjective emotions nor do feel anything themselves&quot; spread across all groups. The stronger statement, &quot;don&#x27;t have emotions nor feel anything themselves&quot; are not present in the extreme empaths like me who can pick up emotions from around them.<p>Finally, people are not &quot;set&quot; in a particular group. It is plastic, to an extent, but not in entirety.')
