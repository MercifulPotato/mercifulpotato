Astronomers complain that they lost the sight of the stars because of Starlink. Could it be somehow compensated by an array of moving, smaller radio telescopes in orbit?<p>Britannica: &#x27;The worldâ€™s most powerful radio telescope, in its combination of sensitivity, resolution, and versatility, is the Very Large Array (VLA) located on the plains of San Agustin near Socorro, in central New Mexico, U.S. The VLA consists of 27 parabolic antennas, each measuring 25 metres (82 feet) in diameter. The total collecting area is equivalent to a single 130-metre (430-foot) antenna.&#x27;<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scientific-computing.com&#x2F;analysis-opinion&#x2F;harvesting-data-large-radio-telescope-arrays" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scientific-computing.com&#x2F;analysis-opinion&#x2F;harves...</a>')
