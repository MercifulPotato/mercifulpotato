I have a science degree and firmly understand the logic of vaccines and I and my family are all vaccinated. However, I do NOT get flu shots, and I usually fare better yearly than those who do. Why?  Because I keep my immune system functioning as optimally as possible, vegan diet, exercise, healthy living. People these days are so pro-vaxx that they think they can live completely unhealthy lifestyles, and eat whatever crappy food and processed meat are available, and then the magical biopharmaceutical alchemists will release yearly drugs to defend against the viral outbreaks. Doing so you give them power, and those people are the same people who developed napalm, agent orange, mustard gas, and every other predatory chemical that exists. So yes the black magic pharam folks can produce good miracles to save you, but they also could be the ones actually DEVELOPING bio warfare agents like the covid-19 virus, and then it&#x27;s a vicious circle. All they need is for otherwise smart people to give up questioning the chemical components of the vaccines themselves, and they can develop wearables and social barriers that allow totalitarian rule.  It&#x27;s not binary, you can question the vaccine at any level, that&#x27;s what science is about, it&#x27;s not about anti-anit-vaxxing propaganda and insane dependency on predatory institutions that pretend to care about your well being.')
