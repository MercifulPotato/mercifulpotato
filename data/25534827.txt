Mkvtoolnix is popular for it. FFmpeg handles it generally. Mkv is far superior in that you can embed a lot of data like subtitles, multiple audio tracks, etc all in one file. It&#x27;s heavily standard in anime.<p>I&#x27;m not experienced in how you would programmicly impliment mkv, most of the time how I use it is simply take the base h265&#x2F;h265 file, audio file, subs, etc, and mux it together. Infact an open source Japanese tool called NVEnc does Nvidia hardware video encoding and supports mkv if I recall.')
