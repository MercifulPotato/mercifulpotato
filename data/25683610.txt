Item(by='Jochim', descendants=None, kids=[25684742], score=None, time=1610105496, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25680390, text='&gt; Now you&#x27;re making up a narrative that doesn&#x27;t fit the facts.<p>The point I was making was that the assertion of &quot;Winning the election&quot; was made first, only when it became apparent that in fact he had not won the election did people start looking for evidence of fraud. Evidence was only gathered with the intention of supporting that fact and was then presented as proof of something much more widespread than it suggested. This has lead to things that are absolutely not evidence of fraud being conflated with acts of fraud.<p>The website you posted was torn apart elsewhere in this thread. From the outside it looks like a desperate grasping at straws.<p>&gt; You have attempted to effect an air of condescension multiple times in this conversation. If you truly believe that half the country is living under Trump&#x27;s spell and needs to be freed, and you also believe that condescension is going to help win them over, then it is not your opponent who is in need of introspection.<p>You&#x27;ve repeatedly refused to accept any criticism of your arguments throughout the conversation. Your evidence has been evidence of a few isolated incidents and fraud that has been detected by the safeguards already put in place. It is not evidence at all of any kind of widespread fraud.<p>The Capitol building was raided by Trump supporters directed there by the man himself. Inspired by this &quot;stop the steal&quot; rhetoric and calling for Mike Pence of all people to be hanged, they are being lead into a very dangerous situation that is not designed for their benefit. They are very much in need of some introspection before more of them die from this.')
