Skepticism and critical thinking are in very short supply, that is true, and we should all try to verify as much as possible.<p>But really, most things cannot be verified by you, personally. We do stand on the shoulders of giants, and you will not be able to verify centuries of scientific progress all on your own, from first principles.<p>And this becomes even harder when you approach the softer parts of human knowledge such as economics or very recent discoveries that aren&#x27;t fully settled. Most people are easily tricked by politicians and other evil actors simply because most things cannot be known for sure (immigration? interest rates? carbon taxes?), and the best one can do is to have educated guesses. And educated guess require education, which most have not.<p>So I don&#x27;t see how you can live without trusting most of what you are said or living partially outside society. I guess a compromise between our point of views is the good old adage &quot;trust, but verify&quot;.')
