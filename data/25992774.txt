You had to get it past the DBA, and there were real resource constraints on the database system. With a document store the schema is entirely in the hands of the developer.<p>Also JSON became the standard way to ship data around, and RDBMs systems of the time couldn&#x27;t really handle JSON. So you either write a bunch of code to map complex nested JSON to relational tables, or just dump it into an un-indexible text column.<p>There was vendor hype, just like there was around Object databases in the pre-internet days.<p>If you were starting a new project you needed to decide if you were going to use a document store and an RDBMS or just on or the other. If it was just one you would choose a document store if you anticipated you would need to handle a lot of unstructured data.<p>Today the situation is revered. A document store only does documents well. A good hybrid database like postgres gives you the best of both worlds. Throw in hosted database services and resource constraints are much less of an issue. So people aren&#x27;t running back to an old school RDBMS. They are moving to a much superior and evolved data store.')
