Item(by='oefrha', descendants=None, kids=[25726004, 25726174], score=None, time=1610351191, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25725252, text='&gt; CMD - tab forced me to think ahead of time if I want to change to the last application or the last window of the same application. I.e. switching between two Safari instances takes a different key combination than switching between Safari and IntelliJ.<p>Thatâ€™s a feature, not a bug. I personally hate having to tab through a million browser windows to find the application I need, or having to tab through unrelated applications when looking for a browser window, which is what I have to put up with when using Windows.')
