Not a bat or a short police baton.<p>One challenge with all these examples is that they are used because they are handy not because they are efficient. The police baton is perfect example of something used to NOT kill (manifestations would be terribly bloody if the police was responding with swords or daggers), it&#x27;s better than nothing but you don&#x27;t want to go to battle with that.<p>If we&#x27;re talking medieval fighting the other party has significant padding if not a gambeson, and they&#x27;re not waiting idle to get your best hit. If training with wood weapons is any indication, the one with a stick variant loose everytime, they can hit but they get closed upon anyway and stabbed&#x2F;slashed.<p>If you make the (long) stick a spear, a tip that can cut and stab, it&#x27;s a great weapon. You&#x27;d certainly want to have a spear not just a long stick.')
