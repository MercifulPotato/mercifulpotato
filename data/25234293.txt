Item(by='slg', descendants=None, kids=[25234581], score=None, time=1606526866, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25234212, text='From the article:<p>&gt;Ms. Sawyerr said she had talked with four other Black employees about bringing a discrimination lawsuit against Coinbase, but the others backed out after being offered hefty severance payments in exchange for confidentiality agreements.<p>It never went to court because almost everyone involved was incentivized for it to not end up in court.  Going to court is often a difficult, expensive, and likely damaging path to pursue for victims of a variety of crimes.  The lack of a court case has nothing to do with the amount of evidence or the truthfulness of the accusations here.<p>&gt;For the law, intent is of utmost importance. For (social) media, just &quot;circumstantial evidence&quot; of exhibiting patterns of discrimination is enough to act. It is not enough to act, if you are a decent person.<p>Once again, you are factually wrong with this comment.  People can be thrown in jail based purely on an overwhelming amount of circumstantial evidence and companies can be punished for discriminatory behavior even if there is documented proof that there was no intent to discriminate.')
