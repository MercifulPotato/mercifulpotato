Ibuprofen has issues of its own, but IIRC it&#x27;s typically safe to take 2-4x the recommend dose on the bottle, which could be pushing it if you did the same with Tylenol over an extended period (especially if you&#x27;re a drinker). I&#x27;ve heard anecdotally that if Tylenol were invented today the FDA wouldn&#x27;t approve it because it&#x27;s relatively easy to OD.<p>Meanwhile, doctors I&#x27;ve been to offer out prescriptions for 800mg ibuprofen pretty freely and don&#x27;t seem too worried about side effects (IMO it&#x27;s easier to just take a bunch of the smaller ones instead of a single horsepill)')
