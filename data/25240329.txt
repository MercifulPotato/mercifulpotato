Gallicchio and Filippo Maria Bianchi (I assume his student) wrote a couple of interesting papers I haven&#x27;t totally absorbed yet, probing the critical ridge in various ways.<p>That said, it&#x27;s pretty marginal stuff. ESNs are weird. Cool weird anyway.<p>If I were looking at it in a serious way rather than reading the funny papers, I&#x27;d think about ways of applying topological ideas to ESNs. ESNs on the critical ridge probably have an interesting graph when projected onto a topological space.')
