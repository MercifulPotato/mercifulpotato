This self-interest will avoid a &quot;tragedy of the commons&quot;, provided the rules say that everyone has the same maximum power, forcing people to use their radiated power wisely.<p>That breaks down when you factor in that beamforming devices are expensive, so not all devices will opt to use it. The devices that don&#x27;t use them will still blaring at full power, causing interference to others.')
