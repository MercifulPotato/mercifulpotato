Teachers are systematically sexist: they give girls better test scores than boys and treat them differently. This effect is so strong it&#x27;s been studied and shows up statistically:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mitili.mit.edu&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;project-documents&#x2F;SEII-Discussion-Paper-2016.07-Terrier.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mitili.mit.edu&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;project-documents...</a><p><i>&quot;I use a combination of blind and non-blind test scores to show that middle school teachers favor girls when they grade.
