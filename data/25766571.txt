I often idly run a find-in-page for .NET&#x2F;C# on the Who&#x27;s Hiring threads just to monitor uptake in the start-up world and rarely get more than about 6 hits in 100s of posts.<p>I ended up in a C# role by chance coming from a non-software background and it can often feel like a separate world; so many discussions in the other ecosystems just feel less relevant since C# is so batteries included you rarely have to venture outside the confines of the officially mandated environment.<p>While there&#x27;s a lot of stuff in the corporate environment on Windows servers and old full-framework code there&#x27;s also a healthy and growing Linux first community using .NET.<p>I don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;d recommend it particularly from outside if not trying to start a .NET role specifically, I don&#x27;t think (based on the languages you list having experience with) it will help you learn anything particularly new, in the way that learning a functional language does for someone with an OOP background. Though LINQ is quite a nice way for people unfamiliar with functional programming to ease into it from an OOP environment.<p>With .NET 5 &#x2F; dotnet core the getting started is easier than it used to be (thanks to dotnet new <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dotnet.microsoft.com&#x2F;learn&#x2F;dotnet&#x2F;hello-world-tutorial&#x2F;create" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dotnet.microsoft.com&#x2F;learn&#x2F;dotnet&#x2F;hello-world-tutori...</a>) and a lot more like other languages&#x2F;frameworks, but without a specific aim I think it&#x27;s going to be hard to be motivated to get in-depth with the environment.<p>To be clear I wouldn&#x27;t want to work in any other language or framework (though React with functional components and TypeScript comes pretty close to the developer experience quality of C#&#x2F;.NET) but I&#x27;m just not sure how porous the ecosystem boundary is and how transferable the skills are.')
