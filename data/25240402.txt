People aren&#x27;t seeing their friends much due to the pandemic, so it&#x27;s unlikely that those who bought the new machines are broadly showing them off.<p>Lots of forum praise about M1 seems like it&#x27;s coming from people who have no hands-on experience with the new devices. I have no reason to believe that Apple pays people to stir up hype on the web, but I definitely sense that the vast majority of people hyping M1 haven&#x27;t purchased an M1 device. My sense is that they just read some blogs, ogle some benchmarks, and regurgitate what they see.<p>That&#x27;s not exactly a diversity of opinion. I can tell you I&#x27;ve been voted down a couple of times just for suggesting that there&#x27;s too much hype and not enough information.')
