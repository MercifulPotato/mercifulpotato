From the 8008&#x27;s perspective, it&#x27;s running on -14 volts. But the 8008&#x27;s Vcc (i.e ground) is connected to +5V, and the Vdd is connected to -9V. So when the 8008 outputs a 1 (high), the output is +5V (more or less), which is TTL-compatible. When the 8008 outputs a 0 (low), the output will be negative. Apparently, TTL is fine with negative input voltages, so this is acceptable.<p>The point is by shifting the 8008&#x27;s supply to +5V&#x2F;-9V and ignoring ground, the outputs automatically work with TTL.')
