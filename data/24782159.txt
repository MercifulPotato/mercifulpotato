Item(by='AaronFriel', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602712793, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24781880, text='I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s accurate that they would &quot;simply...&quot; but I think the consistent thing I&#x27;ve heard from my lawyer friends is that judges do not like to be deceived or misrepresented to or have their time wasted. You should not try to be &quot;clever&quot; with them, even if you think you&#x27;ve been clever with the law.<p>This approach combines all three of those things, it involves deceiving a judge or jury with language games, misrepresenting that these words or languages have hidden meanings, and wasting their time in deciphering what was really communicated.<p>This would be akin to everyone at Google typing in qwerty but using a keyboard setting that interprets the keypresses as dvorak, and also having an extension that substitutes characters viewed from fellow employees back to qwerty. How the message is stored or exchanged doesn&#x27;t change the material fact that one employee intended to write &quot;competitor&quot; and another employee read &quot;competitor&quot; and in depositions both would admit to those facts.')
