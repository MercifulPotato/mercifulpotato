It is a great distro to use the latest versions of everything, but it was too much disruption for me. I guess I&#x27;m getting old.<p>I&#x27;m currently on Debian stable, that comes with &quot;good enough&quot; versions of the software I need, and I can compile almost anything else. And it gives me plenty of time to do work without having to spend time on the OS.')
