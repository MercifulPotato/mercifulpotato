Item(by='theevilsharpie', descendants=None, kids=[25373168, 25373227], score=None, time=1607603692, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25372910, text='The &quot;betrayal&quot; sentiment comes from Red Hat reneging on their commitment to support CentOS 8 in particular.<p>Prior to this announcement, Red Hat promised to support CentOS 8 until 2029 (the same life cycle as RHEL 8), and I have no doubt that many organizations made the decision to invest in and deploy CentOS 8 based on that promised lifetime. With CentOS 8 effectively dead at the end of 2021, that leaves those organizations less than a year to find another solution. The fact that CentOS 7 will remain supported until 2024 (which was Red Hat&#x27;s initial commitment) makes this situation even more awkward for the engineers that advocated for CentOS 8.<p>Now, you could argue that these organizations have been free-loading off of Red Hat and got what they paid for, but it&#x27;s understandable why people are upset. If Red Hat had made this decision earlier (i.e., making CentOS 7 the last version), or made good on their promise to support CentOS 8, I doubt there would be anywhere near as much outrage.')
