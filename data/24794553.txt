He just happened to go viral on reddit once (actually a few times). He makes most of his money from his repair business, his sitting-in-a-chair videos (that aren&#x27;t about apple), and his bike videos are just him talking. I don&#x27;t really agree with a lot of what he says (esp. about NYC) but I don&#x27;t think he&#x27;s being biased in this video.')
