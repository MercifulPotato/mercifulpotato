I currently live in a country known for its historical banking secrecy and two different large banks I walked into were able to open an account for me with only one extra form that gives them consent to share my information with the IRS. There was at least one employee in both branches that knew exactly what to do, although not every employee did so I can understand some Americans trying to open accounts being turned away.<p>As an American that lives abroad, I naturally don&#x27;t support the extra taxation based on citizenship when I&#x27;m already taxed in my country of residence. There is paperwork to file to avoid double taxation, but hiring a lawyer to do it will probably cost me more than it saves at this stage in my life.')
