I don&#x27;t want to rebuild the wheel and write custom CSS every time I need a new component. I want to be able to plug in common components, with unsurprising and predictable props. If I&#x27;m already using React for dialog boxes, it may well as handle my click handlers as well. Then it can also grab data.<p>I agree with the spirit of avoiding more dependencies though and for this reason I try to avoid Redux. I find React absolutely invaluable for styling and reusable components however.')
