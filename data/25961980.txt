Item(by='tgbugs', descendants=None, kids=[25962317], score=None, time=1611952023, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25954921, text='Having received a flu shot is a discrete measure. What we care about at the individual level is their response to that shot, which is continuous, minimally something like P(got-flu | got-flu-shot). What we care about at the population level is the probability that someone actually got the shot given that the records says that they did and the probability that they did get a flu shot given that the records say they didn&#x27;t or that the records are absent.<p>The conceptual data model for vaccination in the US is a table with ~370 million rows and a column for each vaccine with the type being the date the individual last received that vaccine or a null. It is nearly impossible to construct this table with any reasonable level of data quality.<p>Even measurements of height are subject to error. The question is whether the error is larger than the level required for some particular use case. Thus it is not that height is somehow more discrete (height varies over the course of the day due to gravity), it is that our uses for it aren&#x27;t affected by the very low uncertainty that its measurements entail. However, if you are building a spacesuit for someone and use a measurement of height taken at the end of the day in a gravitation field, they will be extremely uncomfortable when they get taller in space.<p>Thus even when there are measurements which are nominally discrete, if the uncertainty is greater than that of the use case, then the fact that it is nominally discrete doesn&#x27;t matter.')
