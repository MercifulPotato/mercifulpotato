It&#x27;s so bad that it&#x27;s a borderline accessibility issue at this point. Would be interesting to know what public input there is when it comes to bandwidth optimization. There also isn&#x27;t a good quantitative metric for measuring call quality in a way that could spur competition between carriers. It seems to mostly be a race to the bottom.')
