Just a significant percentage of the IC engineering workforce. Especially the digital nomad types.<p>People with kids aren&#x27;t going to relocate their family internationally unless they already had family roots there.<p>Anecdotally, the people I personally know that love SE Asia and would seriously consider or already did WFH from there were all in the 20-30s age group and had no problem maintaining US working times. The biggest draw of SE Asia other than the super low COL is that its beautiful outside. The outdoors is best enjoyed during daylight, so the timezone offset is a plus for them.')
