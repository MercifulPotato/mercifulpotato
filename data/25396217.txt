Item(by='bird_monster', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607755571, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25395931, text='&gt; Compare to ~22000 dosed in trials; two of the vaccinated died from causes that don&#x27;t look related to the vaccine, and four of the placebo group died. This mostly lets us exclude a high death rate from the vaccine. Several in the placebo group ended up hospitalized from severe COVID; none in the vaccine group ended up hospitalized from COVID or vaccine related side effects.<p>How frequently are vaccine side effects measured 1-3 years out? How frequently do vaccines present side effects on the 1-3 year timeframe?<p>&gt; Indeed, the entire judgment call made in emergency use authorization is exactly that: the benefits of the vaccines appear to conclusively outweigh the risks.<p>Had that judgement call not been made in one of the least competent governments in US history, I think it might carry more weight, no?<p>&gt; the benefits of the vaccines appear to conclusively outweigh the risks.<p>I would challenge this statement in that I don&#x27;t believe it possible to fully understand the risks yet. Is 22000 over ~three months the normal amount of time a vaccine trial runs (I am asking somewhat rhetorically, in that we&#x27;ve heard time and time again that this is not the case)')
