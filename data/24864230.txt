I&#x27;m referring to the ability to change the Caddy config from an API that is itself proxied through Caddy. Here&#x27;s the issue which you very helpful in[0].<p>Ultimately I realized that most of what I needed from Caddy was really just certmagic, which has worked flawlessly since I got it set up. Plus I need the final product to compile into a single binary. Since my custom reverse proxy only took a few lines of code, I haven&#x27;t worried too much about it. But there are a few features which I&#x27;ll have to integrate eventually.<p>If I end up seeing myself headed down the path of making a full-fledged reverse proxy, I&#x27;ll reconsider trying to implement my project as a Caddy plugin.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;caddyserver&#x2F;caddy&#x2F;issues&#x2F;3754" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;caddyserver&#x2F;caddy&#x2F;issues&#x2F;3754</a>')
