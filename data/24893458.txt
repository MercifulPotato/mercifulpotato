Item(by='fn1', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603695387, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24892470, text='&gt; I wonder what &#x27;institutional complacencies&#x27; we have. Problems we assume are unsolvable but are actually very trivial to solve.<p>I spend a lot of time optimizing builds, because the effect is a multiplicator for everything else in development.<p>But it is not an easy task. One issue with performance-monitoring is that you have to carefully plan your work, or you will sit around and wait for results a lot:<p>Try the build: 40 minutes. Maybe add profiling statements, because you forgot them: another 40 minutes. Change something and try it out: no change, 40 minutes. Find another optimization which decreases time locally and try it out: 39.5 minutes, because on the build-server that optimization does not work that well. etc.<p>You just spent 160 minutes and shaved 0.5 minutes off the build.<p>I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s not worth it, but that line of work is not often rewarding.<p>On the flip-side I once took two hours to write a java-agent which caches File.exists for class-loading and managed to decrease local startup time by 500% because the corporate virus-scanner got active less often.')
