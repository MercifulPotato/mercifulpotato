Up to Apple black-balling Gizmodo from all events after Gizmodo got ahold of an unreleased iPhone an employee had lost. Even then the phone was disguised inside the shell of an older model.

Then they actually tried to get it back to Apple, and got blown off. That&#x27;s when they contacted Gizmodo. I think Apple was pissed that Gizmodo paid $5,000 to get it from the finder and didn&#x27;t return it immediately to Apple without question or inspection.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gizmodo.com&#x2F;how-apple-lost-the-iphone-4-5520438" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gizmodo.com&#x2F;how-apple-lost-the-iphone-4-5520438</a>')
