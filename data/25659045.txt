You can&#x27;t get 120,000 full time employees plus probably another 100,000 contractors to work together without establishing a clear hierarchy that everyone inside it understands. A smaller company can have different approaches because they will have a dense network of employee relationships, and can work together off of those relationships. However, at six figure employee scale by necessity you will end up with a very very sparse matrix of employee relationships, so you have to have something else to get results.')
