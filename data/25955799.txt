This is the contract. Formalising another contract would require legal fees. Is every user willing to pay a lawyer $200 to use FB? (and another $200 for Pinterest, $200 for Twitter, etc.) Is every user willing to pay AGAIN another $200 on the next &quot;T&amp;C Update&quot;? If you think $200 is too much, come up with anothe number, and then multiply it by every free service you&#x2F;someone uses (Twitter, free-Dropbox, free-Gmail, free-GoogleDocs, free-HN, free-Reddit, free-Viber, free-....).<p>FB, Twitter, Pinterest usage comes &quot;as-is&quot;. We&#x2F;you are the products. Since when does a super market have a contract with a potato? (I don&#x27;t mean to insult, but really..).<p>Unless they (FB, or any service provider - paid or free) clearly discriminates against someone (e.g. &quot;you are man&#x2F;woman&#x2F;black&#x2F;asian&#x2F;etc. and we don&#x27;t like people like you here&quot;) and then they kick out FB every man&#x2F;woman&#x2F;black&#x2F;asian&#x2F;etc. person, feel free to sue them (more legal fees.. I see a pattern here) :)<p>But if it&#x27;s not a discrimination issue, then please tell me ONE person that hasn&#x27;t dropped an f-bomb &quot;f... you&#x2F;this&#x2F;him&#x2F;her&#x2F;them&#x2F;..&quot; or some other profanity on a FB post, a FB comment, on FB-messenger message. In that spirit everyone is eligible to receive a red card, and it&#x27;s down to FB to kick someone out anytime they want or anytime they get provoked. E.g. HenryBemis is trashing us on HN.. HenryBemis wrote &quot;f... this &lt;name_of_politician&gt;&quot;, thus HenryBemis violated the policy about swearing, threatening violence, sexual content, yada-yada-yada.<p>A couple of days ago we saw a post on someone sending a &quot;accidentally, partial nude photo&quot; over messenger to a friend of his, and this got him expelled from FB. I clearly understand the capabilities of FB vs mine. I think more people should see these facts coldly.')
