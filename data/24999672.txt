Even if that actually is the intention, that is irrelevant, the actions are what matters.<p>&gt; A lot of fault must be put on Netflix for jacking up the controversy in their US marketing.<p>Nobody but the defenders of this even care about the marketing; it&#x27;s about the content, about the minute long close up shots of children &quot;grinding&quot;.<p>Regardless of the attempts to frame it that way, &quot;thinking of the children&quot; isn&#x27;t just a monopoly of hypocritical, puritan &quot;outrage&quot;, it&#x27;s also what any healthy adult does by default. Even (non-predator) animals in some cases treat the young of other species that way.')
