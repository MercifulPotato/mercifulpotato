You can&#x27;t launch things into the sun, you need to decelerate objects. The earth travels at 30 km &#x2F; s (70K MPH) around the sun, so you need to decelerate about that much the other way. And orbiting radioactive waste is just asking for trouble.<p>The total amount of radioactive waste on the earth is about the size of a swimming pool (or was that the total amount of gold? I forgot, either way in terms of quantity it&#x27;s not that much), burying it deep and forgetting about it for the next 100.000 years is the way to go I think.')
