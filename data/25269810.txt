And you also didn&#x27;t account for any traffic yet - that&#x27;s another 0.09$&#x2F;GB on top.<p>Taking the statistics from some old Ask HN thread [0] (which is probably an underestimate?) you would need to render your site in less than 2ms to stay below 1$ for that day. And serve less than 51kB of data per page view to stay in the free 1GB of traffic region (this part should be pretty doable if you don&#x27;t include any large images).<p>Of course assuming you don&#x27;t have any existing VM or web hosting you could reuse for that.<p>Edit: Ups.. Used per-second billing instead of per-ms by accident. So even up to &gt;1s per request it&#x27;s below 1$ for that actually. So only leaves significant more traffic and lots of bandwidth usage as possible sore points for tiny web services.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=8107658" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=8107658</a>')
