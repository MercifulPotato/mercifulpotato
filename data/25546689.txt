They are supercooled by liquid Helium, which then has it&#x27;s compression system cooled by a liquid Nitrogen compression system.<p>That said, I do recall reading about a fancy new higher temp superconductor which would allow for a much smaller torus to be made. This may be using that system.<p>I&#x27;m not completely up to date.')
