Lets say pandemic A kills 100 humans at 25% of life consumed versus pandemic B that kills 200h at 75% of life consumed. If only lives are counted then B is 100% worse. But if the human-years are measured then pandemic A is 50% worse. Given a zero-sum trolley car dilemma, is plain lives or YLL a better measure of utility?<p><i>For example, if a person dies at age 50, and life expectancy at age 50 is more 25 years, then the YLL is 25. In contrast, if a person dies at age 80 and life expectancy at 80 is 2 more years, then YLL is 2.</i><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;healthcostinstitute.org&#x2F;hcci-research&#x2F;the-impact-of-covid-19-on-years-of-life-lost" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;healthcostinstitute.org&#x2F;hcci-research&#x2F;the-impact-of-...</a><p>Stipulation: if the baseline life-length is 80 years and a ninety year old dies, then the YLL is 0 and not -10.')
