I have the exact same situation going on. We <i>had</i> to unplug our equipment because using our own would effectively mean a 35 dollar cost to use it, because they offer &quot;unlimited internet&quot; (the old non-data capped service that used to be standard) for a discount. So, 15 cable modem rental gives saves you 50 for &quot;unlimited&quot; â€” you just have to use their gear! The customer benefits!<p>It&#x27;s crazy making. I do NOT want them to know everything about how we use their service, what devices are connected, usage patterns, etc. But we can&#x27;t avoid it. We&#x27;re getting data farmed and we&#x27;re billed extra if we don&#x27;t allow it.<p>This bill does nothing to alleviate this situation for customers, and Comcast just announced that this data cap scheme is going to be rolling out across their network.')
