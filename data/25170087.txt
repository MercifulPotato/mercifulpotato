We&#x27;ve optimised our lives with these tradeoffs in mind. If the office we work at is very good maybe we&#x27;ve selected a smaller appartment in a trendier area with more things to do at night. If there&#x27;s now nothing to do at night because of lockdowns and the same appartment makes for a poor office during the day, misery ensues.<p>As companies make remote work a bigger possibility we&#x27;ll optimize differently and a lot of people will be better off after adjusting. This situation has also disproportionately benefited those that already leaned towards that way and left the others hanging. But that&#x27;s a shorter term issue.')
