The manufacturer provided a vehicle that included a risk of fatal accident. (Reducing this wrong and describing it as &#x27;lives saved&#x27; feels uncomfortable to me)<p>With an autonomous system, blame for fatalities can no longer be placed on a human driver: and yet, there is still a failure of responsibility (maybe this will be a more accurate placement of blame)')
