Of course a 32- or 64-core processor that costs 2x-3x than a Mac mini and draws 280 watts is faster than an M1.<p>The M1 peaks at 20-24 watts and doesn&#x27;t even require a fan in the MacBook Air.<p>It&#x27;s graphic blows away all integrated graphics and is comparable to many discrete GPUs. On CPU benchmarks, it&#x27;s faster than all but the latest Intel and AMD laptop CPUs, which are in laptops that run hotter, are louder and don&#x27;t have 18-20 battery life doing real world things.<p>x86 applications generally just work and often run faster on an M1 Mac than they did on Intel Macs.<p><i>Considering the broad swaths of essential business software that is simply incompatible with Apple OS, that&#x27;s not going to happen.</i><p>Depends on what business you&#x27;re in. If you&#x27;re in the content creation business, you&#x27;re good to go [1].<p>Microsoft Office is already in beta for running natively on M1 and so much other business software is web-based or Electron apps (like Slack) and those work fine.<p>[1]: &quot;Hollywood thinks new Mac mini &#x27;could be huge&#x27; for video editors&quot;—<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;appleinsider.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;20&#x2F;11&#x2F;12&#x2F;hollywood-thinks-new-mac-mini-could-be-huge-for-video-editors" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;appleinsider.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;20&#x2F;11&#x2F;12&#x2F;hollywood-thinks-...</a>')
