Without really good pin contact, the NES10 lockout chip wouldn’t authenticate the cart, and the flashing red light and blanking screen were the indicators for authentication failure. Using a game genie increased the stress on those pins due to its altered insertion angle for the cartridge. So it wasn’t your imagination: game genie really did “break” your NES.<p>As it turns out though, the pin array can be easily removed and serviced (just clean the pins and gently bend them back into shape) with next to zero risk of damaging the NES. Of course, none of us had the web to look any of this up back in the day, and we were left with schoolyard superstitions like blowing on the cartridge. Now though, it’s quite easy to get a “dead” NES working again. Or just get the revised NES model from 1993 that dumped the NES10 lockout chip and the failure prone front loading slot.')
