So if the algorithm was developed and used before computers it definitely isn&#x27;t machine learning<p>I think that it&#x27;s important to note here that this was the set of problems that computer science researchers didn&#x27;t know how to solve.<p>In the early days, they mostly ended up re-inventing statistical methods.<p>And to be fair, a neural net is just a bunch of linear models joined by a non-linearity. In that case, it&#x27;s essentially stacked logistic regression, which was invented before computers.')
