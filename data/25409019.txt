Imagine having to pay $7 a gallon for oil instead of $3.<p>There is another consequence. A lot of other countries will become &quot;rich&quot; all of a sudden. Which means they won&#x27;t use US dollar as a medium of exchange and America would have to &quot;earn&quot; by exporting. Which means people will have to work a lot more to produce more for exports without consuming ourselves.')
