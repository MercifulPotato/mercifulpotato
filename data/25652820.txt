They claimed they didn&#x27;t have the resources to make Linux run on it. (We later figured out all that was required were a few incredibly simple kernel patches)<p>- geohot found a somewhat unstable hardware glitch that, with some luck and a few tries, could escalate to hypervisor mode and enable e.g. 3D rendering from Linux. Their DRM was still untouched at this point and no one really cared.<p>- Sony released an update for the old PS3 models to disable Linux as well citing &quot;security concerns&quot;<p>After that more people started looking into the PS3 and marcan, me and others at fail0verflow eventually figured out their security wasn&#x27;t all that great. It was actually so bad that we could calculate their private keys. Then they sued us for that but that&#x27;s another story.')
