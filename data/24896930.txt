An employer is allowed to stop an employee from speaking about things, or can punish or fire them for their speech.  There isn&#x27;t some inalienable right to speech.  There is a constitutional right to the government not being able to forbid speech as a general rule.  But that has no affect legally on a company denying service to someone they disagree with.<p>Just to make sure I&#x27;ve covered all my bases here: If this was about denying services to a protected class, then you&#x27;d have a different response for a different reason -- businesses cannot discriminate on the basis of a protected class.  But political beliefs are not a protected class.<p>As for changing Section 230.  The Senate could certainly do all sorts of things to change the way this works.  It&#x27;s clearly an interstate commerce issue, so the federal government could pass all sorts of laws.  I don&#x27;t have an opinion one way or another about how they&#x27;d do it, since that&#x27;s more policy than law.<p>-JD&#x27;s opinion.')
