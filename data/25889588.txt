It has been one of the best things I have ever purchased.  Just the taste improvement alone makes it worth it.\nI first tried it at a friends house who used it for a aquarium and skipped the di stage for drinking water.\nI bought mine from air,water,ice.  These aquarium guys do not mess around, the units are much better than what you find in Home Depot and the refills are reasonably priced.  Most units come with a ‘turbo’ pump so you are not wasting water as pressure in the storage tank increases.')
