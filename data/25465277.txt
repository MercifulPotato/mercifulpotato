It takes more than a year, maybe 3-4, to degrade the battery enough for it to affect performance in any way.<p>2. There are many iPhone models at different price points, the cheapest one being $399.<p>3. If they didn&#x27;t cap the performance they would be making headlines for &quot;Older iPhones suddenly power off for no reason&quot; instead.<p>Their only mistake was to not communicate good enough to the users that performance would return back to normal after a battery replacement.')
