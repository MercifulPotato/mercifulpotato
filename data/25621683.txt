But they were also secure. Now everyone other docker tutorial explains containers as lightweight linux VMs, while in terms of security they are far from it.<p>I don&#x27;t like the idea of running my (internal, not meant to face the internet) containers so that they are publicly accessible or running their processes as root. Yet this seems to be the default with docker and I&#x27;m sure a lot of people don&#x27;t bother fixing that.<p>There is so much confusion regarding users and user namespaces. \nI think something needs to change in the way docker documents those things and also in the way defaults are chosen for various configuration options.')
