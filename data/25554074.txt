Wouldn&#x27;t you feel very bad when being forced to spend your money in order to not be punished with negative interest rates? Without cash you won&#x27;t even be able to escape. Negative interest rates are just one example. I&#x27;m sure that this is happening if we don&#x27;t act.<p>I can&#x27;t see why you consider such things vague rants.')
