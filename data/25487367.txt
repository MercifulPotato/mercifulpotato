Does it account for the opening night of a new show in the West End? I highly doubt it.<p>I don&#x27;t think Google maintain their own data for rail travel, and the data sources aren&#x27;t that good, so I doubt they&#x27;ll be accounting for engineering works unless either they are scheduled far in advance or they&#x27;ve been happening for a while.<p>In my experience it takes time equivalent to a bunch of people having a crap journey and Google collecting that data for Google&#x27;s instructions to change, they&#x27;re not pre-emptive based on expert knowledge, they&#x27;re reactive based on collected data.')
