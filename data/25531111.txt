Item(by='ChuckMcM', descendants=None, kids=[25532225, 25538536, 25535276], score=None, time=1608841693, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25526237, text='I like how this bug report captures how much we&#x27;ve lost :-).<p>Basically the bug is that VT220&#x27;s are not UTF-8 capable display devices. What is worse, when you send them UTF-8 sequences they interpret them as VT200 sequences and as a result oddness can and does occur. I haven&#x27;t tried fuzzing one of my VTxxx terminals but I suspect there are likely cases where you can hang the terminal with the right character sequences.<p>Of course, most people, perhaps &gt; 80%, working on open source maintenance have never actually touched a terminal. Many have lost any idea of what &quot;TERMCAP&quot; is, or the difference between &quot;Smart&quot; and &quot;dumb&quot; terminals, and what escape codes do what. For most, &quot;terminal&quot; is a program that runs and always responds in a way you would expect it to respond (which is typically a variant of ANSI terminal specs). Not that they have ever tried to get their shell to run on a Beehive or Hazeltine or Adds terminal either.<p>At one of the west coast vintage computer festivals I had a VT320 connected to a Linux box and the younger adults there who played around with it were appalled at both the lack of colors (&quot;How do you know what files are directories?&quot;) and the pitiful number of lines and columns (&quot;I feel like I am inside a coat closet!&quot;) It was funny, and sad. Sad because my memories of how great it was to have a terminal that could do line insert so when editing files over a 1200 baud modem it still felt fast, were now pitiable.')
