It&#x27;s an amazing piece of technology.<p>Before I went this route, I tried to make Akka Cluster work with RabbitMQ however I realized (like another poster here) that you&#x27;re essentially duplicating concerns since Akka itself is a message queue. There&#x27;s also a ton of logistics with Rabbit around binding queues, architecting your route patterns, etc that add extra cognitive overhead.<p>I&#x27;m creating a highly distributed chat application where each user has their own persistent actor and each chatroom has their own persistent actor. At this point, it doesn&#x27;t matter where the user or chatroom are in the cluster it literally &quot;just works&quot;.<p>All I need to do is emit a message to the cluster from a user to chatroom or vice versa, even in a cluster of hundreds of nodes, and things just work. Now there&#x27;s some extra care you need to take at the edge (split-brain via multi-az, multi-datacenter) but those are things you worry about at scale.<p>Akka is the real fucking deal and it&#x27;s one of the most pleasurable application frameworks I&#x27;ve ever had the pleasure of using in my career.<p>edit: The only reason I&#x27;d ever want to use Rabbit again is if I had external clients that needed to hook up to our message bus. If you&#x27;re creating an entirely internal system, Akka Cluster is absolutely the way to go.')
