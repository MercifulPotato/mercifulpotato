Things like how the earth might be round, and circle the sun.</i><p>Intresting trivia: heliocentrism didn&#x27;t show &quot;shining brightly as to be next to irrefutable&quot; - it was a fringe idea that could not be confirmed through observation at the time, required some pretty wild (for the time) assumptions - such as stars being very, <i>very</i> far away, to explain why there&#x27;s no visible parallax from Earth&#x27;s movements - and went against existing understanding of physics in general (such as, Earth is very big and heavy and bulky, so it&#x27;s not obvious how could it be moving in circles very fast). Also, IIRC, the predictions made by heliocentric model were less accurate than geocentric ones.<p>It took astronomical observations with early telescopes to provide data points favoring a mixed geo&#x2F;heliocentric model, and then further observations, work of Kepler and Newton&#x27;s theory of gravity for heliocentric model to finally start making sense.<p>This does serve as an example backing TFA&#x27;s thesis: some accepted theories, like (then) geocentric model, may be just local maxima - theoretical dead ends. A potential better theory will initially look bad in comparison, it needs work to develop past the accepted one.')
