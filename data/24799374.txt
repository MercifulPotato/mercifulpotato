I&#x27;m not British, so maybe I wasn&#x27;t paying as close attention as I should to see the decline in quality.<p>On a tangent, maybe worth it&#x27;s own thread - can you propose a good European news site, in English? There&#x27;s plenty of aggregators and crap-generators out there, but quality reporting is getting harder to find, and I&#x27;m grateful for any recommendation.')
