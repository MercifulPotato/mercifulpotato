I think the term &quot;tech company&quot; is very subjective so I won&#x27;t touch that, but Google is absolutely an advertising company with a bunch of side projects (hence why they always end up getting killed after a few years). It doesn&#x27;t change my feeling towards google, but it helps understand them and know what to expect from them. Your kooky phone anecdote is a great example.')
