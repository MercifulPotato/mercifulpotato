Different domain, but a topic that could be useful for most people, but isn’t interesting for most people.<p>Solution: don’t talk too much about it. Casually drop a sentence or two and then let them figure out the rest.<p>Your goal should be that someone hears of your important topic at all. Because it’s often just random chance whether or not we stumble over something that is interesting or good for us.<p>That’s why the randomness of HN is so appealing. 95% is useless for one specific person, but once in a while that person stumbles upon a gem that is exactly right for them.<p>And sometimes, it is the right info but not the right time and they might come back to you later to ask more, although this rarely happens.<p>Make a website for people that are already interested in the topic. The rest of your effort should be spend just mentioning the sheer existence of your topic. Don’t lecture anyone. That is enough.<p>OP talks for 10 minutes about SRS. Yes, nobody gives a shit. Instead say: I use Anki, because it helps me to learn XYZ a lot faster. Then change the topic. Not mentioning it at all is bad, because it robs the other person of the chance that this is the gem they actually need right now.')
