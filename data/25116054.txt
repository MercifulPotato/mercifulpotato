At least not after you&#x27;ve received any notification at all?<p>All the more surprising that a host would be willing to disagree with a claimant and say &quot;nah, we don&#x27;t think you&#x27;d win in court.&quot; they are definitely risking their own liability, not just the customers.<p>As you say, Microsoft can afford to do this cause Microsoft has deep pockets and the ability to counter-strike. All the more reason we should actually be grateful to the for USING that power to defend in this case, right?  (And ironically, that suggests that you will get the most protection hosted by a company that has the resources to stand up, which not all do. I am not a fan of that outcome either).<p>DMCA is still awful regardless of host of course.')
