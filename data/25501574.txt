Item(by='arcticbull', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608597588, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25501313, text='&gt; The way a market works is people find ways to serve people at a price they can afford. When you always force others to pay for the cadillac service for them, no one bothers to find cheap ways to provide healthcare.<p>How can you be so twisted up about this? Americas system is the expensive one, everyone else&#x27;s is cheap, and controlling costs better. Medicare may not be doing a perfect job but again it&#x27;s controlling costs better than the private sector. What you are saying is strictly and objectively false.<p>Healthcare <i>is</i> optimized and improved in single-payer states, because there&#x27;s still budgets.<p>You&#x27;re defending the worst system out there from a cost perspective, and not top 20 in outcomes. And you&#x27;re doing so by saying the system other countries are successfully using to control costs would fail to control costs, and using this to defend American&#x27;s failure to control costs? You&#x27;re telling me Canada is doing a bad job of controlling costs when it literally costs half as much per capita? Because their rate of cost growth is in line with their peers while America&#x27;s is way, way beyond?<p>Your mental gymnastics are giving me a headache.<p>&gt; Venezuela is just a difference of degree. The same effect is seen in everyone&#x27;s lack of R&amp;D spending outside the US.<p>And that? Also false. Venezuela is a difference of degree? What on earth are you talking about.<p>R&amp;D spending? Guess which healthcare companies spend the most on R&amp;D? It&#x27;s not the American ones. It&#x27;s all the European ones.  #1 is Switzerland&#x27;s Roche. #4 is Switzerland&#x27;s Novartis. #6 is France&#x27;s Sanofi. #9 is the UK&#x27;s AstraZeneca. #10 is the UK&#x27;s GlaxoSmithKlein. [1] This is yet another failed talking point.<p>Guess which country developed the first COVID vaccine? Germany. BioNTech&#x27;s vaccine was paid for by Germany&#x27;s government. Pfizer took $0 of US money and is productionizing a Turkish immigrant in Germany&#x27;s German government funded research work.<p>You&#x27;re just not right about this one, time to move on lol.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fiercebiotech.com&#x2F;special-report&#x2F;top-10-pharma-r-d-budgets-2019" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fiercebiotech.com&#x2F;special-report&#x2F;top-10-pharma-r...</a>')
