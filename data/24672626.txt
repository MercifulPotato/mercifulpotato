Item(by='Nextgrid', descendants=None, kids=[24672804, 24674282], score=None, time=1601738731, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24670370, text='The GDPR explicitly allows companies to verify the identity of the requestor for the purposes of fulfilling a data access&#x2F;erasure request.<p>The problem with the GDPR is that it was written with the assumption that companies are willing to abide by the regulation, and thus any data provided during the course of identity verification will not be used for any other purpose and so there aren&#x27;t any problems with companies requesting <i>more</i> PII for the purpose of deleting PII.<p>Of course in reality certain companies are not willing to abide by the regulation, and entire industries are built on top of not abiding by the regulation, so much so that they&#x27;re better off operating in breach and lasting for as long as possible (until investigations &amp; fines shut down the entire business) than complying early. We&#x27;re already seeing this with Google &amp; Facebook that <i>claim</i> to comply with the regulation despite being in breach in various ways (the recent Google GDPR consent prompt is absolutely not compliant) and they are betting on the fact that 1) enforcement will not happen for a long time and 2) when enforcement does happen, the consequences will be less than the profit they made in the meantime.<p>The same thing applies with for example Facebook (or similar) analytics and pixel tracking. They claim they respect the GDPR and will erase any data upon request (in this case the request will need to come from the data controller, ie the entity that runs the app which embeds the tracking SDK), but does anyone actually believe that they will delete anything and that data is not also used for other purposes (shadow profiles) in way that&#x27;s hard&#x2F;impossible to detect from the outside?')
