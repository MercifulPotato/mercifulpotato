In the meantime, trump has pardoned war criminals and several people who have done crimes on his behalf.  In pretty much everything I&#x27;ve read on the subject, that is not the average sort of offender who is granted leniency.<p>A lack of a large number of pardons is no surprise, really.  By all appearances, he&#x27;s pardoning his partners in crime and war criminals.  Traditionally, pardons are granted to folks who haven&#x27;t gotten a fair shake, or whose sentences are disproportionate to their crimes.  Contrast the number of pardons with the recent spree of executions -- this is all in line with the &quot;tough on crime&quot; narrative.  Forget about justice, the goal is brutality and death to the enemy.')
