Item(by='seph-reed', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608063141, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25433545, text='&gt; Reparations for slavery are about things that can&#x27;t be measured<p>If it can&#x27;t be measured, it should be omitted.  Nobody is suggesting making up random numbers based off feelings.<p>&gt; Should my dad, as a completely broke 25-year-old, have had to pay reparations to someone for his ancestors&#x27; wealth (which I&#x27;m sure was gained unfairly)?<p>First off, if your dad is actually 25, you are fantastically intelligent for your age (and props for that).  But also, there are ways to use math to make things fair.  For instance: progressive taxation based off wealth.  Lower income pay a small percentage (probably less than 1%) while higher income pays 1-2%.  And given that slavery lasted ~90 years, so too could the timeline for paying reparations.<p>There are solutions here.  Nobody is saying do it all at once and make people starve.  But there is a way to pay off -- if nothing else -- the debt of unpaid hours.<p>It&#x27;s better late than never, and if there is one thing the world respects about Germany, it&#x27;s that they owned up.  We can too.<p>Honestly, I&#x27;d be willing to say this could be one of the best cost vs benefit long-term PR investments the US could make on the world stage.  But only if it&#x27;s done right, and not as a punitive thing.')
