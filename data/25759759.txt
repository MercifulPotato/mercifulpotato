Arbitrary censorship is the larger issue.<p>If I do something illegal, it shouldn&#x27;t take down everyone I ever happened to chat with, or who read or liked something I wrote once... even the Godwin&#x27;s law protagonist had a few good ideas mixed in with his assured evil.<p>Free exchange of legal speech shouldn&#x27;t arbitrarily be squelched because some corporation decides their advertisers wouldn&#x27;t like it.<p>For example, a few years ago there was a great machining set of videos in which an M-16 lower receiver was machined out of a billet of Aluminum.  Youtube decided that anything like that had to go, not for legal reasons, just because of... you know... whim.<p>There was nothing wrong with the video series, it didn&#x27;t promote violence, it was just a well done documentation of all the tips and setups required to do a tricky bit of work.<p>The replacement that seems to be safe (for now) is to machine model steam engines and lathes from casting kits. Cool, but far less useful in learning the real thing.<p>[update] The idea of learning by watching is a lot less powerful when whole areas of study are excluded randomly, for &quot;reasons&quot; that are never fully explained.<p>If someone decided that hashtables and binary trees should be hidden from view, could you really teach computer science without them?<p>It&#x27;s a filter bubble of the worst sort. It keeps you from even learning what you don&#x27;t know, because it can&#x27;t be safely mentioned.')
