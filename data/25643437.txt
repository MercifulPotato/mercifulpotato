Quantization can be modelled by taking the difference between the originally continuous signal, and the resultant quantized image as &quot;quantization noise&quot;. The resultant noise has a spectrum that&#x27;s pretty &#x27;spiky&#x27;  due to its non-continuous nature, it has significant energy in its higher-frequency harmonics. By adding some noise before sending it off to be thresholded by the quantizer, the noise&#x27;s spectrum is made a lot flatter, thus making the quantized image look more like the original image, but with a higher noise floor.')
