The difference between SFTP and FTPS is just a debate over whether to use SSH as transport or TLS. Basically every SFTP server out there is also an SSH server which comes with its own issues while FTPS servers are more designed to operate on entirely virtual users coming from a DB instead of system accounts.<p>The reasons for moving away from FTP is because it’s unergonomic and the software support isn’t there anymore, not just because it’s old. And if you use IIS on Windows you’re pretty much stuck with FTPS.')
