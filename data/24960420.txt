I preferred other hosts tbh, but i was using Github mainly because it was a popular resume-oriented host for the projects i&#x27;d like to advertise as such.<p>However given that i work on some P2P services that <i>could</i> be argued scrape and&#x2F;or distribute, i&#x27;m heavily debating moving. A nice host for a potential employer to view is not worth being DMCA&#x27;d.<p>I hope this causes a lot of additional desire to decentralize these portions of the dev workflow stack. Potential solutions exist, but no one cares.. i hope we collectively start caring more, and adopting solutions.')
