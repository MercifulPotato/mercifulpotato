I gave it away to a father to give to his kid. A couple years later, I realized my mistake and asked to buy it back, but he&#x27;d thrown it in the trash :-(<p>I still have that Heathkit terminal, but I haven&#x27;t turned it on in 37 years or so, though it was in perfect working order at the time.<p>I soldered all three kits together, and it all worked perfectly the first time I turned it on. Those were great kits.<p>I also had a very expensive Diablo 630 daisywheel printer to go with it, built like a tank. But I couldn&#x27;t give it away, and finally it went to the dump around 10 years ago.<p>I did keep my original IBM PC, but the chips went bad in it while in storage and it won&#x27;t power up anymore.')
