They have to compete with large businesses.  And unlike the millionares who sit atop the ladder of large businesses, most small business owners have their livelihood tied in with their business.<p>Small businesses suffer much more from a minimum wage increase, so of course their owners are against it.  Meanwhile, large business owners benefit from a minimum wage increase thanks to the ensuing reduction in competition.<p>I&#x27;m not arguing for or against a higher minimum wage here, but saying small businesses owners &quot;rabidly vote against&quot; it simply because it &quot;might affect their lifestyle&quot; is disingenuous.  Both types of business owners have clear incentives which have nothing to do with altruism or avarice.')
