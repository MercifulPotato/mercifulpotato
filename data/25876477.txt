Scrape your site and transform some of the information to make a useful service? Yes. Scrape your whole site and just host its pages? No.<p>Maybe your site is a medical blog and over the years has written about pretty much every condition. If someone else were to scrape this, and make an interactive map of the human body, where if you click on a part, it lists links to the original blog, plus a pop-up summative snippet, very few people are going to scream &quot;You did nothing! This guy spent years writing medical articles, and you come along and make a fancy interactive body as a way to linking to his articles, and now you&#x27;re getting ad revenue and traffic!&quot; Obviously, if lots of people are using this new interactive service, it&#x27;s a value add.<p>But what if instead, I setup a site like WebMD, supposedly with expertly written medical content from the Web&#x27;s best medical bloggers, but I just scrape all their articles, and host those pages on my own site, as if they had written the articles as contributors to my site.<p>And you don&#x27;t think the latter should be downranked?<p>Do you think GPT-3 should somehow pay someone everytime it generates an answer? What if future search engines crawl the web and build giant transformer models which just answer questions by whole-sale authoring a new article from scratch, how do we compare that to a human being doing the same thing?<p>Scraping is how human beings learn and there&#x27;s a big difference between wholesale piracy, and transformation.')
