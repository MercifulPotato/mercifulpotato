BTW, I&#x27;m not saying this is <i>my</i> view on DS -- I have met many people with DS who seem to have rich or rewarding lives. But I think clearly some people think that way. Plus, I think parents who have a child with DS are headed down a road of having someone that needs a lot of care for the rest of their lives. I can&#x27;t blame someone for not wanting to take that on.')
