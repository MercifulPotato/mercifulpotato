As I alluded in my comment above, you can generate the thermal energy by any number of modes of energy transmission (electrical, chemical, RF radiation such as concentrated solar, nuclear, etc.).<p>The primary point of the above comment was that you need electrical energy to produce H2. That&#x27;s a false statement. Al+ can generate H2 without electricity.<p>The important point is that the energy efficiency of any cyclic energy carrier system (batteries&#x2F;chemical, mechanical, intertial, etc.) is only one, albeit important, factor. Other factors include mass and volumetric energy density, motion&#x2F;environmental stability, cost, and so forth. The importance of each of these factors is weighted differently based on the application (e.g. automobiles, ships, trains, aircraft, domestic use, etc.).')
