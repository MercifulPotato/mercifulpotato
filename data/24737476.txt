I would definitely compare the two because Trump will win hands down. You are wanting to compare the two Twitter accounts. Tweets don&#x27;t feed people. Tweets don&#x27;t solve issues. Tweets don&#x27;t make policies.<p>&gt; Inclusive language does not stop being inclusive just because it angers racists.<p>Since you wanted to compare the two let us start with funding of Historically Black Colleges. Because a &quot;racist&quot; President would never increase funds for HBCUs. Instead, he would ensure that the funding is reduced. Obama in the first two years: $1.43B. Trump in first two years of his office: $1.58B [1].<p>&quot;And even though we may not be able to fully trust numbers compiled by officials working under partisan directives, there are few budget outlines of any kind which suggest other than what too many of us fear; the guy we love to hate is showing historic love to historically black colleges.&quot;<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hbcudigest.com&#x2F;obama-vs-trump-who-did-more-for-hbcus-through-their-first-two-years&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hbcudigest.com&#x2F;obama-vs-trump-who-did-more-for-hbcus...</a><p>“Oh, man … yesterday was great and historic. I’ve been around a long time and I’ve never seen so many black folks gathered in the Oval Office,” said Haynes, who was part of that photo opportunity. He also helped bring together the Trump administration and congressional leaders to discuss areas of collaboration between HBCUs and the federal government.<p>“With this executive order, we will make HBCUs a priority in the White House — an absolute priority,” Trump said. “A lot of people are going to be angry that they’re not a priority, but that’s OK.”<p>[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;theundefeated.com&#x2F;features&#x2F;trump-signs-executive-order-on-hbcus&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;theundefeated.com&#x2F;features&#x2F;trump-signs-executive-ord...</a>')
