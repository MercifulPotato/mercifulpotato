But no HQs.<p>The Silicon Vally was where it was at.<p>Also - up until the 1990&#x27;s at least, the Valley was just a burb, mostly affordable, not outrageous except in some little spots.<p>In the 2000&#x27;s it started to get weird and 2010+ is when it got &#x27;bad bad&#x27; and SF became a true hub.<p>In the 1990&#x27;s regular folk could buy homes, Engineers could buy normal homes on normal terms.
