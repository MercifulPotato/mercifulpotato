So, instead of a strategy of using Quick Pick, you could use a strategy of starting with Quick Pick and discarding the result until it&#x27;s something other than 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, which you then use. That has a higher expected value than Quick Pick by itself. The number of people using this strategy is dwarfed by the number of people using the &quot;1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6&quot; strategy.<p>This could be expanded to avoiding months, birthdays, etc.')
