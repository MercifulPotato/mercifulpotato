All three of these countries aren&#x27;t democracies, so whistle-blowers have no incentive to speak up. Finally, if you are from those countries and send info to Wikileaks, you would be sending information to a foreign organization which risks much harsher punishment.<p>For all of these reasons, it is much much less likely for any leaker out of China, Russia or Iran to leak to Wikileaks instead of someone else.')
