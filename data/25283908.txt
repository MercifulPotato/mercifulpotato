Item(by='vosper', descendants=None, kids=[25284221], score=None, time=1606956900, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25283843, text='&gt; Would be nice if flaggers had to provide a short sentence of why...<p>Yes, and same for up and downvotes: I&#x27;d like to require a selection from a small set of required tags, and for the aggregates to be visible (perhaps with a delay). I&#x27;d actually like up and down values to be applied to individual tags - for example, I might add +1 to the &quot;correct&quot; score of a story, but -1 for &quot;rude &#x2F; unkind&quot; (we could bikeshed the names all day, but I don&#x27;t think any realistic set would be worse than the zero info you get today when your comment goes grey but no-one has taken the time to explain why)<p>I&#x27;m pretty sure this is what Slashdot used to do?')
