There are also web features that Safari notoriously does not implement that you&#x27;d have access to in Edge.<p>Webview2 on Windows is also going through a weird period where you can&#x27;t rely on it &quot;just working&quot; without the end user installing a runtime.<p>There is a thread, long ago here on HN, where the developer who made the Slack transition from native webviews per platform (which it was, originally, and everyone conveniently forgets) to Electron. He notes it was specifically because cross-platform issues become a pain in the ass to deal with, and Electron avoids that.<p>There&#x27;s a disconnect between the average HN commentator who builds a UI in HTML&#x2F;CSS&#x2F;JS, and the types of frontends that larger applications build in those languages. Cross platform stuff shows up, and it&#x27;s not a great use of time when there&#x27;s one runtime sitting there that does everything and looks the same everywhere.')
