Item(by='zby', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603785822, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24898373, text='I used to have a PersonalWiki (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;*&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;zby.aster.net.pl&#x2F;kwiki&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;*&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;zby.aster.net.pl&#x2F;kwiki&#x2F;</a>*) running off my desktop in my living room, but it was too cumbersome to keep my own server especially when I was working abroad. I switched it off, and then my backup drive failed - I have only what was saved in the Archive. Then I had a blog on Blogspot - but Google neglected it and I started to have problems with logging into the blog editor (even though I used gmail constantly) - it still is there: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;brudnopis.blogspot.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;brudnopis.blogspot.com&#x2F;</a> but I probably cannot access the editor. Then I started a blog at Medium: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@zby" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@zby</a> It kind of works - but I hate the fact that to be a fully supported author I have to put my blog behind their paywall. I understand the need for a business model - but this one does not work for people like me, who write because they have something to say and not because they try to make money directly from their writing. And I am afraid it is those amateurs who write the best blogs - now the core of Medium writers seem to be some aspiring professional writers who just compile &quot;10 things that ...&quot; or try to build a &quot;story&quot; out of any mediocre thought.<p>I also started a paper notepad with Zettelkasten method - I have some notes there, but I haven&#x27;t established an effective habit for it. I&#x27;ll see how that develops - but I still want to publish my thoughts.<p>I wish I stayed with my PersonalWiki - I feel a need to constantly add and modify the articles even after publishing them. But the ideal would be something that works like: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gwern.net&#x2F;About" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gwern.net&#x2F;About</a> - now I understand the need for a LongSite (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gwern.net&#x2F;About#long-site" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gwern.net&#x2F;About#long-site</a>) - automated and with a good business model.')
