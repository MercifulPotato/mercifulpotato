Unfortunately, it can&#x27;t always be followed without hamstringing one&#x27;s ability to say something meaningful and address more important issues than the tendency of the world to geegaw at me for existing.<p>I wasn&#x27;t asking for advice. Giving advice in a situation like this one tends to boil down to blaming the victim rather than trying to understand what they are saying about a larger social issue and patterns of behavior involving many people, not just themselves.')
