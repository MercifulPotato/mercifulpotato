Only at the sink does external state get mutated.<p>It helps because transformations can be closer to pure functions and you know there is no state changes until you&#x27;ve hit the sink&#x2F;loader.<p>Not sure yet, I haven&#x27;t concluded it&#x27;s the right way for me, as it has saved a few headaches here and there - but I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ve unknowingly caused more else where just yet unseen.<p>Also for the author, my favorite word of idempotent - given the same inputs - always get the same output.')
