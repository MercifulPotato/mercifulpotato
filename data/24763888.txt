Item(by='abainbridge', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602582364, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24751712, text='One reason is that programming languages generally try to provide backwards compatibility and doing so limits their ability to fix design problems.<p>There&#x27;s an interesting dynamic here; it is hard to see the design flaws of a language until it is widely used and common practices are established. Once that happens it is too late to change the design.<p>People occasionally try to fork languages to so they can break the backwards compatibility requirement, but I haven&#x27;t seen many of those gain wide adoption (maybe you could say Python 3 is an example?). Instead there seems to be more success for languages that attempt to create a better version of an existing language but move far enough away from it to be an obviously different beast. I&#x27;m not sure why.')
