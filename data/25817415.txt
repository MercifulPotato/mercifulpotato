It is desirable: there are big mansions by the river, several blocks of turn-of-the-century character homes, and then cookie cutter boxes from the 50&#x27;s for the last couple of blocks. We live in a cookie-cutter box.<p>It was a wonderful community and then once it hit 1,000 people, they divided it into six smaller groups. Suddenly, we were in this tiny &quot;sprout&quot; with no activity.<p>A lot of the complaints that spurred the split was that there was too much kids stuff clogging people&#x27;s news feeds. I don&#x27;t know why they couldn&#x27;t have just made a group for kid items and a group for the other stuff.<p>We ended up dropping out and it hasn&#x27;t really affected us. Now we just leave stuff we don&#x27;t want behind our garage (or on the boulevard for city-wide giveaway weekends on long weekends throughout the summer) and the stuff disappears in a few hours.')
