Was the pandemic bad luck or good luck for Airbnb? It instantly caused hundreds of millions of dollars of lost bookings, forcing staff layoffs and requiring an emergency $1b loan to keep the company alive. But now it’s reported their bookings are stronger than ever, due to people’s different living&#x2F;working arrangements in response to the pandemic. Maybe it would look like terrible luck if the company&#x2F;founders hadn’t been formidable and skilled enough to navigate through the initial shock in March-April, leading to the company collapsing. Thanks to getting through to the point where they now have higher-than-ever bookings, it looks like great luck.<p>Anyway, clearly the point of my sentence about luck was that good luck is necessary but not sufficient; any amount of luck, however you define&#x2F;measure it, is worthless without strong founders who can take full advantage of it.')
