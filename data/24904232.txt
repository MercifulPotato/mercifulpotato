Go libraries can only be used from Go, Rust libraries can only be used from Rust, and any nontrivial C library contains an arbitrary code execution vulnerability when built with a newer compiler. Java is a lowest-common-denominator language but it&#x27;s memory-safe, cross-platform (in a way that C# isn&#x27;t really yet), and there&#x27;s a decent range of languages that you can run on the JVM and use Java libraries from.')
