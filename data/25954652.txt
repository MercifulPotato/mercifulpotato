GameStop&#x27;s financials were and are pretty solid. There was no reason to short the stock so heavily, which is why they&#x27;re in the trouble that they&#x27;re in right now.<p>You should watch Roaring Kitty&#x27;s video from June 2019 I believe (maybe its 2020?) on YouTube about this. He goes into <i>great</i> detail, with something like an hour of analysis on why $GME is a reasonable investment.<p>Remember also, Dr. Michael Burry was buying into $GME (it was 5% of his fund in fact). Other big institutional investors like BlackRock, etc. had major positions as well.')
