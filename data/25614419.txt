Those expectations may be unrealistic, but there is actual growth and invention underlying the speculation.<p>Bitcoin doesn’t represent any such creative endeavor. It’s the very opposite: an artificial scarcity mindgame that burns fossil fuels to power useless random number generators. It’s a tragedy that intelligent people who could be doing something creative instead spend their energy on greedy speculation around such a dark project.')
