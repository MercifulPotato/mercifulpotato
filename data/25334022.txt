You can write a Stencil component and you can later use it in Angular or Vue or React or Elm or whatever. Or maybe even no framework at all -- just a templated server generated page with some Stencil components.<p>That&#x27;s pretty nice for a team that&#x27;s transitioning between one framework and another or uses two different frameworks on two different sites but would like to share components between the two.')
