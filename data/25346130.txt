In Travis case, whether it&#x27;s a &quot;bad thing&quot; or not, I think it&#x27;s a dishonest thing to be claiming you provide &quot;free service to open source projects&quot; while introducing criteria that would exclude the majority of open source projects â€” which you also used to <i>include</i> but have switched to exclude while claiming you&#x27;re doing the same as ever.<p>So it&#x27;s clearly their perogative to set whatever criteria they like, it may or not be a &quot;bad thing&quot;, but it is definitely a huge change from what they used to, and is only actually giving free service to a very small slice of open source projects, while publicly wanting to take credit for doing otherwise.')
