And sRGB content on an sRGB screen looks exactly the same as on a DCI-P3 panel if you&#x27;re using a color-managed workflow.<p>The only issue is that less than 15% of monitors today actually match the 95% sRGB, 300 nits, 8-bit panel specs which e.g. DisplayHDR 400 sets.<p>Just think about it, 85% of monitors can&#x27;t actually display all CSS colors, and that doesn&#x27;t even begin to handle issues like AdobeRGB, DCI-P3, and other WCG content.<p>On a true sRGB&#x2F;300nits&#x2F;8-bit screen #414141 on #dddddd contrast is actually fine (and meets WCAG guidelines, btw).<p>But if you display this same contrast on a 6-bit 150nits ~70% sRGB panel (standard cheap monitor from 2014) you wonâ€™t be able to read it under most conditions.')
