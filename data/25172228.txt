Item(by='newacct583', descendants=None, kids=[25172698], score=None, time=1605987733, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25172139, text='&gt; Seriously HN, why is this on the front-page?<p>It was flagged rapidly, so it&#x27;s not.  But in general my experience is that there are a lot of reactionary conservatives on HN who really, really want to discuss political content.  Flagging seems to be the immune response to keep the unsavory stuff from getting an audience.  But it can get a little scary in the cases where that doesn&#x27;t happen.<p>As far as whether the coup works: you&#x27;re right, it&#x27;s not going to work.  But they&#x27;re absolutely trying it, and you&#x27;re actually behind on the strategy.  The current thinking and pressure is aimed at getting republican election administrators and legislatures to &quot;reject&quot; the results of the election and select Trump electors directly.  And while it&#x27;s not working (yet) they&#x27;ve absolutely had some success with persuading a few.  If they get more, then it&#x27;s a coup.<p>The Wayne county election commissioners didn&#x27;t &quot;summarily dismiss&quot; the conspiracy theory, they&#x27;re on board (though after &quot;accidentally&quot; certifying the result, I guess).  The Michigan GOP leaders didn&#x27;t &quot;summarily dismiss&quot; the idea of selecting electors, they literally flew to Washington yesterday to meet directly with Trump (though afterwards they issued a statement saying that they &quot;saw no need&quot; to take that action).<p>That&#x27;s not a coup being summarily dismissed.  It&#x27;s a bunch of republicans dancing on the edge to make sure they don&#x27;t end up on the wrong side.  If the whole party buys in, then democracy dies.  And we need to be screaming about it, not whining about whether it belongs on the front page.')
