Source Code<p>The program must include source code, and must allow distribution in source code as well as compiled form. Where some form of a product is not distributed with source code, there must be a well-publicized means of obtaining the source code for no more than a reasonable reproduction cost, preferably downloading via the Internet without charge. <i>The source code must be the preferred form in which a programmer would modify the program.</i> Deliberately obfuscated source code is not allowed. <i>Intermediate forms such as the output of a preprocessor or translator are not allowed.</i><p>(emphasis mine)')
