If it didn&#x27;t than the huffing and puffing about the Russians stealing the election is just as false as Trump&#x27;s current claims<p>3) Trump supporters can equally point to affidavits and &quot;evidence&quot; about vote tampering.  Whether you believe that evidence or not is another story.<p>My point was not about trump or biden stealing the election, it was that institutional trust is low. People no longer believe what the government or the media put out. No doubt some of this is driven by the &quot;narrative approach&quot; to truth, where everything tells a story that aligns to a group&#x27;s ideology.')
