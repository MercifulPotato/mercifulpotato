So before you print something, you have to remember how many pages you have printed this month, plus the rolled over pages from last month and how long before they expire, and if you are going to go over, you have to change your plan instead of just going over because the overage rate is absurd (like, more expensive than going to a print shop). How is anyone supposed to get work done when printing is this complicated?<p>Given that I am not that heavy of a print user, I recently opted for the $300 Canon G7020 refillable inkjet over a color laser. The EPSON EcoTanks also looked good, but I think the G7020 included two extra, full bottles of black ink, plus the initial set of CMYB. The initial bottles are full-size, however, about 1&#x2F;6 of the ink disappears on setup as it fills the tubing and print heads inside the printer.<p>The only catch I have heard with this printer is that apparently the waste ink absorber (non-replaceable) can fill after a few years of use, shortening lifespan. However, the print heads are replaceable which is nice compared to the EcoTank line. (In a refillable, the print heads look like cartridges, but instead of ink, they have a port that connects to the tanks). The setup (AirPrint) works great and the only issue I have had is that the old-school LCD screen is impossible to read without a lot of lighting.')
