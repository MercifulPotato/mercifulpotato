The Des Moines, Iowa poll has been pretty close.<p>The national polling firms are only getting airplay if they give the &quot;right&quot; result, the few groups that have been pretty accurate in 2016, 2018, and 2020 got very little media coverage due to not being close to the high profile ones and not having the results that CNN, ABC, NBC, etc. wanted to broadcast.<p>That coupled with comments from some prominent Democratic politicians that they want to make lists of Trump supporters presumably to punish them for their actions, has a significant chilling effect on people being willing to vocalize their support for Trump to non-friendly or unknown people.')
