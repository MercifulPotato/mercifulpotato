That&#x27;s not their role in government. That&#x27;s not their job.<p>Don&#x27;t think about whether you agree that the content is false, or whether people should or should not have access to it. That&#x27;s also a distraction.<p>The important part, that I wish every American regardless of party would understand deeply in their bones, is that once it&#x27;s OK for &quot;our guys&quot; to do this illegal, rights-trampling thing, then it becomes OK for &quot;their guys&quot; to do it. Someday, a group of senators will ask the platform-du-jour to take down something that you agree with and think is important for people to know. Perhaps about actual election fraud, on a candidate you like.<p>American complacency in the face of &quot;our guys can use this new awesome power for good, so it&#x27;s OK&quot; is how we have secret Presidential assassination lists (Disposition Matrix), secret courts where the accused cannot see the evidence against them (FISA courts), gag orders on civilians, and so forth<p>Do not applaud senators using the weight of the government to suppress speech that you do not like, even if you believe that speech is false. It&#x27;s about protecting <i>your</i> rights.')
