Usually it remembered my login but sometimes I need to login again. If I then type my password, it says: &quot;type the code we emailed to continue&quot;.<p>So if I wouldn&#x27;t have access to that email account, I couldn&#x27;t login and lose the Steam account, even when knowing the password.<p>Although, some of the methods from the link would still work, so that&#x27;s solved, I guess.')
