People in the West don&#x27;t understand how much of an advantage social media has been in countries where media was always controlled by corrupt businessmen or politicians.<p>The fact that information about government&#x27;s actions can spread to a large number of people, without any control from authorities is a first time in history for many. Organising protests without government censorship. Publishing investigations. Alerting the entire country to corruption as it happens.<p>It&#x27;s really life-changing and unfortunately I don&#x27;t think it will last. It&#x27;s already routine when civil unrest happens to shut down internet. Facebook is a good one to censor but other networks take its place so creating Great Firewalls is next for many (somewhat rich) governments.')
