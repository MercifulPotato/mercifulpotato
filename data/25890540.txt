It’s not fair to the original author since the conversation can get sidetracked from his project to the project being linked.<p>It’s like jumping the queue. Actually I am not blameless here, I inadvertently did the same until I realized what I was doing was wrong —- it’s not something I think comes readily to the mind of the normal reader, but for any of those looking to promote it becomes obvious.<p>Again it’s a fine line. It’s an issue with HN having a large audience, no ads and a relatively cheap (well basically free) way to advertise ones work. Same thing happens with reddit; and now I have heard that some of moderators there are taking kickbacks by allowing &#x2F; disallowing certain posts.')
