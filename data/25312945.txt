Maybe 1 in 3 or 4 MEPs speak some English. It&#x27;s very hard to watch. And mind you, in most EU countries regular people would have trouble following the English translation too, they&#x27;d need to find one in their language.<p>I&#x27;m not questioning what you said about those working in EU institutions, I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s true. But that&#x27;s irrelevant, that&#x27;s not what drives politics.')
