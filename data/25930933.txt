Like I said, Roddenberry changed personally a lot between TOS and TNG. The show was most explicitly communist when he was in charge, so, TNG and shows very similar to it like Voyager. DS9 did develop more plausible story lines in which the Federation was presented differently and they deserve credit for that, but they had to violate some of Roddenberry&#x27;s rules and vision for the show in order to do so. Their escape clause was that DS9 heavily featured non-Federation races.<p>TNG was definitely the peak of this. The crew of the Enterprise in that show don&#x27;t turn on each other, make mistakes or do dumb stuff. This was an explicit rule by Roddenberry: in his utopia Federation officials never fought each other. The writers called it &quot;Roddenberry&#x27;s Box&quot; because it was such a limiting rule, and the Box is why so many episodes feature mind-controlling aliens of various kinds.<p><i>Any post-scarcity society will look like communism&#x2F;anarchism unless it is intentionally keeping part of its population poor for no good reason</i><p>I don&#x27;t think this is true, see my other comments on this thread. Trek-style post scarcity where <i>material</i> things are non-scarce still doesn&#x27;t cover anything non-replicable like people&#x27;s time and attention, and by implication, service industries.<p>Until there is sci-fi that explains how a society eliminates scarcity of non-physical things like status, power and attention, the future will remain capitalist by default.')
