As a Canadian living in the UK for nearly 20 years. In both the UK and Canada, I can vote without a ID let alone photo ID.<p>We bring in our poll cards and they let you vote. Then they cross your name and address off a list so you can&#x27;t come in to vote again. The polling stations coverage is very good and you can only vote in your designated station, which is usually within walkable distance unless you live on a farm.<p>We also trialed photo ID for voting here in the UK. It was a massive failure.<p>I can also get a postal ballot with no problems.<p>Whatever the problem in the US is, it can be fixed without photo ID.')
