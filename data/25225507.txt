Item(by='nixgeek', descendants=None, kids=[25225771, 25225750], score=None, time=1606450628, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25225142, text='I’ve had an unacceptably high AFR with all LIFX bulbs, although I’ll concede their support is fantastic at shipping replacements to me. We’ve had about 20-22% failure rate  of bulbs within 2 years of ownership, seen across ~60 of them. In addition to that about another 20% have needed factory resetting once or twice in the same period, because they stopped interacting with WiFi and the first-party application in ways that just turning off and on again at the light switch didn’t fix.<p>In contrast to this we’ve had exactly one Philips Hue fail on us. Also cheerfully replaced for us. None of them have needed resetting and we have about the same # of light fixtures deployed. Probably the most annoying problem is Hue Play’s are prone to coil whine at 100% brightness on on certain scene colors, particularly those involving blue-white (6000K). Resolvable by going &lt; 5000K or dropping to 90% brightness, I haven’t attempted to get warranty replacement for this issue but about 16&#x2F;22 of my Hue Play’s are affected by the issue.<p>Integrated with Google Home it’s also common that some % of LIFX bulbs won’t respond to a “turn off all the lights” command, whereas Philips is very good at on&#x2F;off even when the command involves large numbers of bulbs...')
