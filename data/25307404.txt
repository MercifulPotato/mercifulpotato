Acting on that data in a way that could be constituted as &quot;stalking&quot; definitely is real stalking though and should count as a crime.<p>For example, if someone&#x27;s ex (who was explicitly warned that he was unwelcome) continues showing up at the doorsteps because they remembered your address from a long time ago, then it is stalking. Them knowing the address isn&#x27;t.<p>In light of this, I don&#x27;t see how it matters whether they remembered the address from past experiences or just found it  through a website that aggregates publicly available info. As long as the data was obtained legally and without breaking any other harassment clauses, why would just the knowledge of something be a crime?<p>I see it just like firearms. Having a firearm (in a lot of US jurisdictions) is not a crime, as long as it was obtained legally. Doing harmful actions with it (such as threatening people or shooting someone who didn&#x27;t pose a threat to your life) is a crime. Having a firearm feels like just having data, in this scenario. As long as you don&#x27;t use that data for criminal actions, why would just the potential of you being able to do something criminal with that data is a crime?')
