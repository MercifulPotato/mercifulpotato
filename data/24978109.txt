We use it for dozens of services on Kubernetes and AWS.<p>While we did have to write some of our own tooling to reduce the boilerplate over different services, Pulumi has been by far the best tool we&#x27;ve found to do the deployments. Being able to automatically provision a resource in AWS, then use results from that in a Kubernetes service (env var) in the same deployment, is not something I ever expected to be able to automate.<p>We haven&#x27;t had any issues with module availability (I think it uses&#x2F;adapts Terraform modules to a large extent).\nThe config as code feels way more approachable and reusable than any other tool I&#x27;ve seen.<p>I&#x27;ve never had any production issues because of Pulumi. It also allows you to preview changes before applying them, giving a nice confidence boost in the changes.')
