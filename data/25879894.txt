The &quot;developer&quot; unit leaves them unblown.<p>If they&#x27;re selling 10M &quot;regular&quot; units per year, and 5000 &quot;developer&quot; models over the product lifetime, you have to amortize the cost of special-casing the production line for a short run, and stocking and supporting a second SKU, over a relatively small sales volume.  It could well be more expensive than the few cents of electricity per unit to blow the fuses in a standard unit.')
