We are based in central Pennsylvania but are hiring remote (US only, no sponsorship) as long as you can operate during our core hours of 9am - 3pm Eastern.<p>Current projects include beta testing a greenfield application that recently completed beta development, transitioning an older .NET Framework application to a handful of services, and experimenting with Docker&#x2F;Traefik (see tech stack info below). Future projects include additional service development, at least one additional greenfield application, and a couple possible ML use cases.<p>Most of us are full-stack but there is opportunity to specialize in one thing over others (UI design, reporting, interfaces, etc.) if you want to. The team is extremely low turnover, no resignations&#x2F;reassignments&#x2F;terminations in the two years I&#x27;ve been here or several years prior, and the team has grown from 3 to 8 during my time. Great work&#x2F;life balance, PTO allowance, and benefits. I can count on one hand the number of weeks I&#x27;ve worked more than 40 hours and it&#x27;s always been by choice because I&#x27;m trying to solve some interesting puzzle :)<p>Direct hire preferred but can do a short-term contract as well. My contact info is in my profile if this sounds interesting to you, please include your HN username!<p>Backend: .NET Core, .NET Framework, C#, SQL Server, MongoDB<p>Frontend: Vue JS, .NET Razor (MVC)<p>Other: RabbitMQ, Docker, Traefik, gRPC, Azure, SSRS, Tableau')
