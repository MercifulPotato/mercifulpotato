Then good news: you&#x27;re reporting geoquery data for your users to them simply by using their API, with that API by definition being in service of someone&#x27;s behavioural pattern.<p>Is that tracking on your end? It is not.<p>Is that tracking on _their_ end? Neither I nor you have any way to actually know, even if they claim no data gets stored in a way that allows behavioural mining. So claiming there is no tracking is wilfully ignoring the entirely possible case that there might be, even if you personally have no reason to believe there is. Geodata is incredibly fingerprinty.')
