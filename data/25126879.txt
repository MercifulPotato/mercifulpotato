My take is that Apple doesn&#x27;t want to continue to invest in Boot Camp, especially since Microsoft apparently isn&#x27;t willing to license ARM Windows for this use case.<p>It&#x27;s not clear to me that the new Macs won&#x27;t allow booting Linux if the Linux community can figure out how to do it. The number of folks booting Linux on Mac via Boot Camp has to be really tiny.')
