This comes from Rust&#x27;s nature of being a low-level PL, and it is really awesome to be able to abstract those minute details so that one can write Rust and &quot;look, it&#x27;s not that different from JavaScript&quot;<p>Another analogy would be `gerund` in English. English has the `gerund` feature for its speakers to nounify a verb. Other languages don&#x27;t have that, some even use the same symbols for both the verb and the noun form.<p>Both Rust&#x27;s &quot;difficult syntax&quot; and English&#x27;s gerund needs only one-time learning session. Once you&#x27;re fluent on it the sentences come out on their own.')
