But again, in the video, whatever it&#x27;s faults, you do see a car hit a barrier and <i>not</i> go crunch, yeah?<p>&gt; why didn&#x27;t they just do it in a controlled environment?<p>Well, there is more than one video.  The one we&#x27;re talking about is obviously a public demonstration and not a scientific test.  (There was one video that seems to have been removed now that showed a very good and clear demo of the ramp&#x2F;glass being done at some trade show or convention.  that video or others might still be on YT somewhere.)<p>What about that ramp&#x2F;glass demo?  A glass shatters when the little car thingy hits it, and then another glass doesn&#x27;t shatter when the flywheel device is active.<p>And really, I haven&#x27;t dug into this particular tech too deeply, it could well be a hoax.<p>But my point still stands, there are lots of interesting and useful ideas that work and get ignored or neglected.  Magnus effect rotors, the Tesla turbine, desalinizing batteries, &quot;Aircrete&quot;, etc...<p>I could literally go on all day, just listing the <i>less &quot;woo-woo&quot;</i> stuff off of Rex Research.')
