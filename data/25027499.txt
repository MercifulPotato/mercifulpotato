Part of the historical argument that you&#x27;re dismissing is a very persistent Dunning-Kreuger effect: very smart software developers don&#x27;t know how much there is to know about crypto, and since RSA is &quot;simple&quot; it&#x27;s easy to delude yourself into thinking that you can do it right.<p>And, yes.  Expect ECC to be broken.  It was initially developed by Miller at the NSA, who only released that information when Koblitz discovered the cryptosystem independently.  So they&#x27;ve been trying to crack it for a very long time, and you can be certain that they know of unpublished breaks.  It&#x27;s almost certain that they can break certain parameter classes, but the discrete log problem itself keeps getting weaker and weaker.<p>If moving away from weak crypto on a regular basis sounds like an undue burden, get out of the game, don&#x27;t roll your own, leave it to the experts or you&#x27;ll be doing yourself and your users a disservice.<p>I&#x27;m not a number theorist, but I did a lot of crypto and rubbed elbows with several NSA-employed cryptologists in my undergrad.  I&#x27;m a decent developer, too, but I know far too much to think that I&#x27;m qualified to roll my own.')
