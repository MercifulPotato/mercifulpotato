However the logic works like this:<p>Tyrone is a internet stereotype of a thuggish blackman. The stereotype of Tyrone is considered by some to be racist (probably quite rightly). Karen is a stereotypical entitled white woman. So if calling someone a Tyrone is racist, therefore calling a woman a Karen is also racist.<p>Not saying I agree with any of it. But that is my understanding of how the logic works.')
