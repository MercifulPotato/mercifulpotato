I would argue things are <i></i>considerably<i></i> worse for the average American since then. It&#x27;s not the wealth, it&#x27;s the level of inequality that the wealth is indicative of. If every American had healthcare and access to quality education, housing, and food, it would not matter to me how wealthy Jeff Bezos gets. It&#x27;s about the floor, not the ceiling, but the floor comes first.<p>&gt; Oh, so anyone with more power than you is bad? What about people that don&#x27;t even have the privilege of arguing on HN?<p><i></i>Snore<i></i>. If you really want to reduce things to personal jabs, that&#x27;s cool I guess. I was using myself as a stand-in for an average person - feel free to substitute any name that makes your heart warm.<p>&gt; I would probably agree there&#x27;s limits that should be imposed so that anyone can&#x27;t just push around whatever law they want but at the same time, how else would you suggest these things work?<p>Sever the links between money and political power. Limit private ownership of news organizations. Take away the tools that are being abused.<p>&gt; Since we&#x27;re talking about taxes... I checked out the section called &quot;Tax Policy&quot;<p>Social Security taxes and Medicare Taxes; and most New Deal programs were financed by the Revenue Act of 1932 [1] passed in the year FDR was campaigning on the New Deal. Again, I didn&#x27;t realize you were going to be a pendant, otherwise I would have linked more specifically. My b.<p>&gt; How do you reason all these things are &quot;caused by concentrated wealth&quot;?<p>Slavery was propagated by the concentrated wealth of the southern aristocracy. They rebelled when they felt that their wealth was threatened. Similarly, in Europe, World War 1 was a war of prestige and conquest fought between a bunch of wealthy (largely related) families who had built huge empires.<p>&gt; The big picture is made up of individual policies... that is actually my entire point. I gave you clear example of what happens when one fails to remember the big picture.<p>You mocked me a bit and told me I should have the answers, but I didn&#x27;t see any clear examples. You are wrong about the first point - you can nitpick implementations and individual policies all day. I&#x27;m not claiming that 100% of policies that tax the wealthy are good, or will succeed. The big picture is important <i></i>because<i></i> it abstracts those smaller points away - the bigger picture is that inequality is driving our societal issues, and taxing the wealthy is an obvious, primary way to help remedy that. Talking about a Swedish wealth tax from 1990 is a joke.<p>[1] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Revenue_Act_of_1932" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Revenue_Act_of_1932</a>')
