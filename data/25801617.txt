I think if it looked at the url instead of the title then it would miss when there are articles from other sites on the same topic so there is a bit of a tradeoff. If it looked at both, Algolia treats it as an &#x27;and&#x27; so it would also not return the older submission. An &#x27;or&#x27; would probably work well for this use case but not sure if it is supported.')
