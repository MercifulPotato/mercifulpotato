After you take hostages, then you decide what kind of ransom you want.<p>Just like Apple.<p>Fuck all of these companies. The DOJ needs to split them at the seams.<p>Edit: damn these downvotes. I typed out an essay as a response to someone asking about the <i>Great Filter</i> in another thread, and now HN is blocking me for posting due to getting so many downvotes.<p>I hate the Apple users censoring everyone that disagrees with them or points out negative things about their company. It&#x27;s a huge problem.<p>The perfect analogy for Apple is the CCP. Developers have to behave exactly like Apple wants to distribute software, or they&#x27;re toast. And Apple users rush to defend this. They&#x27;re <i>&quot;protected&quot;</i> by big Papa Bear Apple. They don&#x27;t see this as a reduction of freedoms or strong arming. They got what they wanted and they&#x27;re fervent about it, and they don&#x27;t see the bigger picture.<p>Apple isn&#x27;t even protecting people. They&#x27;re protecting their market lead. Apple users mean shit to them. They&#x27;d let us repair and install on our own if otherwise. The brand goes to people&#x27;s heads just like other luxury brands (BMW, Dior, Gucci, etc.) - it&#x27;s <i>a lifestyle</i> that needs to be signaled and defended.<p>Isn&#x27;t it obvious that they&#x27;re bad for the world?<p>Liberty or death. When did we forget that?<p>I really like Nintendo. I grew up with them. Zelda is the best thing ever. It&#x27;s the Miyazaki of gaming. But you know what? They&#x27;re fucking assholes to fans. They take down artistic endeavors that companies like Square Enix and Sega encourage. They&#x27;re shutting down the vibrant Melee tournament scene. And for that, they&#x27;ve earned my scorn.<p>You can like something your favorite company makes but also hate their actions.<p>Apple isn&#x27;t a loving mother. It&#x27;s an enterprise and we&#x27;re just users. They shouldn&#x27;t have such power at their disposal. It&#x27;s bad for all of us.<p>The computing sector shouldn&#x27;t be Apple&#x27;s own private fiefdom.<p>Exit since I still can&#x27;t post responses:<p>I&#x27;m taking this up with Lucy McBath (D-GA) instead. I hope that everyone else that sees the incredible harm Apple is doing takes an hour to write their legislators as well. Spell out the problem so they can understand it. Arguing with people online isn&#x27;t as effective as getting the DOJ to address the problem.')
