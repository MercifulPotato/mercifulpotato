Traffic kept growing and I was getting pretty excited.<p>My other (and current) business was growing more so I focused on that. After a few months I checked back in and the other site had actually broken in an update of Wordpress and been getting zero traffic for months and didnâ€™t ever recover once fixed.<p>While I would like to say that the point of failure was the site breaking, the actual point of failure was me not being able to focus on it like I should have.<p>Related, but had I given it the focus it deserved, my other business might not have been as successful and my life would likely look incredibly different now.')
