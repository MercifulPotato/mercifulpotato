Companies don&#x27;t have an incentive to ramp up production ASAP because they know as soon as everybody is vaccinated demand will tank. There&#x27;s plenty more profitable things to spend their time and resources on.<p>However, for everyone besides the drug companies it&#x27;s advantageous to manufacture doses as quickly as possible.<p>It&#x27;s the same reason DPA is used in wars. It would be vastly more profitable to produce scarce luxury items but not in the best interest of society.<p>The interests of drug companies and society are not completely aligned here and DPA would force them to apply all their resources to the problem, rather than maximum profitability.')
