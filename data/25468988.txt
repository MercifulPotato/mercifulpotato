Item(by='web007', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608310508, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25467520, text='I would assume &quot;in formation&quot; would be more advanced than &quot;kinda jumbled near each other&quot; given the degree of coordination required. The sample video of real-life drones shows them crossing each other&#x27;s paths (drone on R goes past both on the L) which doesn&#x27;t seem terribly useful. The fact that the simulation had the drones move in an hourglass shape seems to show the same problem, they&#x27;re not maintaining any kind of order for the flight, only spread out at the start and end.<p>I don&#x27;t see how this is more advanced than each drone getting a start and end point and attempting to maintain a line. Is staying close to each other that significant of a challenge that I&#x27;m missing something?<p>Edit: The article is trash, the actual project is just navigating multiple drones in a highly-obstructed environment, nothing about maintaining formation. That&#x27;s the impressive part, and this seems pretty damn good.')
