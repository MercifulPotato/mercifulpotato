The center monitors are 23&quot; and the side monitors are actually 1440x900 in portrait mode. The middle 23&#x27;s are yard sale monitors, the &quot;wing&quot; monitors were from a friend whose employer was disposing of them. My biggest expense was a second video card, since they are DVI&#x2F;VGA, and that was only $50. Other than that, the monitor stand was about $40.')
