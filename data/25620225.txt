I am not expert, but the way Grid works, you cannot simply pick the wind farm, you have to have a systems view of the wind farm and how its back-up (likely NG generator) interact as a whole and does wind blow during the high demand etc. Wind at right places is excellent but outside of those geographic areas its a dead end. Also, windy places tend to be farther from where the demand is and you have to include transmission related expenditure. I think 500 mile distance is more or less rule of thumb considered not good, economically or environmentally.<p>A metaphor if I may engage, is you cannot get a six pack with pure calorie counting, you have to have a bit more sophisticated system in nutrition and work outs for that. Same thing applies for The Grid, a wind mill of same specification at two different locations will give different yields, at different time of day and have completely different  effect on system as a whole.')
