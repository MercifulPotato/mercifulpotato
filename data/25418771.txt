It has proved far more costly than it would have been to protect wild habitats and biodiversity in the first place to avoid such zoonotic spillover.&quot;<p>Actually, if you look compared to the past, this pandemic was much less lethal than those of the past. In addition, we have had much better treatment options. Finally, it was modern development that allowed a vaccine to be made in around 1 year.<p>It seems pandemics are more devastating on people with higher natural capital. Take for example the Native Americans exposed to the European diseases. Also, diseases such as malaria and dengue fever, affect nations with more natural capital than more developed nations.')
