CEOs work hard, and hard to work hard to get there. Long hours are common. In one &quot;work life balance&quot; class we finished the section on personal goals and everyone was ready for the break when the instructor said something like &quot;I can tell you are low level employees, when I give this section to executives they get mad as they realize that their personal goals are to spend more time with family and they are instead preparing for another long international trip&quot; I&#x27;d love their pay, but I&#x27;m not willing to give up that much family time.<p>I have worked construction jobs. The body is exhausted at the end of the day, but it is always satisfing at the end of the day to look back on what you have done. However because anyone can do it there isn&#x27;t as much value in it and so it doesn&#x27;t pay as well. What hard work you do is more important than how hard you work. However once you have picked the area to work hard work is a second key to getting more.<p>Of course eventually you need to decide how much is enough.
