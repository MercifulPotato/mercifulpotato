I&#x27;m curious if market product fit is there, you are trying to sell an app to people who are looking to travel cheaply.<p>Does your app offer some kind of incentive for use. Perhaps utilize data from other users to suggest how much certain city&#x2F;trip should cost. If you need data for that, it might be a good idea to offer the app for free&#x2F;freemium. Perhaps for free you can do planning but with premium you get further insight for average cost of a specific trip or even suggestions for trips of various types&#x2F;cost.')
