COBRA alone would eat up most of the severance.<p>Either people managed to get through a _whole interview process_ in a week, or they&#x27;re fine with the idea of being jobless during the worst economy in 12 years, or they price the benefit of not being there fairly high.<p>Which then leads us to how the whole argument is blinkered. It reduces decisions to a cost benefit analysis where a significant part of the benefit doesn&#x27;t have a market price.  Then, it questions if the benefit was too large, but by definition the arguer is still at the company and thus believes the unpricable part of the benefit isn&#x27;t worth enough enough to leave.')
