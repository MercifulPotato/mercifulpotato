Embedded system code is meant for deploying on Microcontrollers and usually written in a low level language like C. The dependency on state machine was excessive to a point that they made a tool for designing state machines which perfectly made business sense.<p>As a engineer, I liked the uselfulness and lightweight nature of the tool but it crashed often and was not maintained. After sometime they discontiued the tool and purchased Enterprise Architect which helps in designing state machines but originally meant for doing other things. Unlike the previous tool, the code generated by Enterprise Architect was not clean enough and not used.<p>I researched and picked up the core idea of the tool created a better version of it with FsmPro. I made sure it is cross-platform so that it could reach most users. It is available as a free download and comes with all the features to support development and codification of state machines.<p>Please try and let me know what you think.')
