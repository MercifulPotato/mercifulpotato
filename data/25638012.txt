Cancel culture et al is effectively the beginning of the same outcome. Censorship starts with chilling effects<p>I suggest checking the US history, both somewhat recent and not recent at all. Cancel culture is just the continuation of the old tradition of &quot;naming and shaming&quot;, it isn&#x27;t something new.<p>First there was &quot;tarring and feathering&quot;, then there were the witch hunts in MA, then, more recently, there was the red scare.
