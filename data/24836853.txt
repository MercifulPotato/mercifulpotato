Item(by='tcgv', descendants=None, kids=[24837474], score=None, time=1603199448, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24836478, text='&gt; old ideas are bad until theyâ€™re suddenly very good<p>Sure, for an idea to become suddenly very good you either have to rely on technology advancements &#x2F; innovation, as in the case for cannons that before Napoleon were unreliable and dangerous, or you have to make a controlled bet to test your hypothesis, as in the case of Venture Capital that invests in hundreds of startups (selected according to their investment model) estimating that a small percentage of them will turn out successful.<p>So my key point is, if an idea becomes very good (i.e. through innovation) it&#x27;ll be harder to invalidate it, and if you invest in an idea that you aren&#x27;t comfortable with yet (i.e. venture capital) there&#x27;ll be a higher risk attached to it.')
