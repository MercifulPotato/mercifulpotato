You could see each little bobblehead on the map, either in their office, in a conference room, in a break room, with our without their headset on.<p>You clicked your guy into the room to conference with people in that room. If you didn&#x27;t want to be bothered, you put your bobblehead into your office and closed the door, maybe took your headset off.<p>You could see who was in meetings and with whom. You could see them flashing as they talked in turn. You wanted to interrupt somebody, you could knock on their door. They could &#x27;let your in&#x27; or chat &#x27;give me a minute&#x27; or whatever.<p>It included chat tools in the rooms, so you could have text side-conversations while the talking was going on.<p>It was very, very useful. The company that made it, had employees on 3 continents and 7 states. I didn&#x27;t actually know where my coworkers lived, unless they told me. Yet I could communicate <i>without friction</i>.<p>I miss the old Sococo.')
