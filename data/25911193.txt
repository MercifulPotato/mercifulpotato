[2]<p>- When critical vulnerabilities were found (arising from poor code quality in user-facing protocols, and an old operating system), they were fixed, but the fix introduced another major issue into the product in question. [1]<p>- Reliance on out-of-support RTOS in products, and no alignment of own product lifespans to external support lifespans, and no identification of this issue by themselves. [1]<p>- Previously, 70 full copies of 4 different OpenSSL versions were found in products (and 304 partial copies), some of which dated back to 2006 with multiple disclosed vulnerabilities in each, showing no dependency management at all, and no management of vulnerabilities in dependencies.
