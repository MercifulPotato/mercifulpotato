PyPy seems like a great solution for the highly-numerical algorithms that these contests tend to lead to.<p>So I would not call this &quot;scientific computing&quot;.  Personally I consider competitive programming to be it&#x27;s own use case.<p>And as much as we want to improve scientific computing in Python, it&#x27;s very hard since the work is done in C.  Our current hope is to help mixed workloads, such as doing a decent amount of data-preprocessing in Python before handing off to C code.')
