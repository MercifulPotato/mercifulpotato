It&#x27;s called NLWP, which I assume is short for Number of LightWeight Processes.<p>As for my own UI suggestions, I would hide threads by default, and stop displaying anything in all the columns of a thread where it&#x27;s impossible for the cell to be different to its parent.<p>Maybe in tree mode, have all of a process&#x27;s threads grouped under an expandable [threads] pseudo-process as well.')
