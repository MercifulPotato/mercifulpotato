If you pick up a particular spammer, with the toolset they have, who either has a personal reason to attack you, or who notices that you have a lot more Google juice than you realize, or even just misidentifies you as a large site for whatever reason, obviously they&#x27;ll blow right through something as trivial as this. It is far from solid protection.<p>However, it does quite often work for extended periods of time, and for someone running a small site, it&#x27;s worth it to try this out before going to something crazier because there&#x27;s a decent chance it&#x27;ll work. There are sites I frequent where such simple things have been working for years. It&#x27;s so easy, that if it doesn&#x27;t work, there isn&#x27;t much time wasted. Very good bang for the buck, even if it is not even remotely a guaranteed solution for everybody.')
