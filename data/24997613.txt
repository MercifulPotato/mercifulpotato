That means &quot;object-oriented&quot; is a gerunded adjective and &quot;object-orientated&quot; is an compounded adjectival noun. Since the usage is as a gerunded adjective, &quot;object-orientated&quot; is just grammatically awkward. But I&#x27;m not a grammatical prescriptivist, so you guys do you.')
