Trump has repeatedly implied that he would not accept the results of the election, and has laid groundwork to say that the election was rigged and illegitimate. Hillary Clinton has <i>publicly</i> stated that in no way should Biden concede the election, and Harris last night in the debates implied that they would fight if needed.<p>All this during an extremely severe economic crash leaving millions of people unemployed, with each side blaming the other for the downturn. There have already been violent protests for months. When Trump&#x27;s &quot;poll watchers&quot; end up in conflicts, I think that&#x27;s when we&#x27;ll see things escalate quickly.<p>Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, and everyone else seems to be doing their best to control the narrative in an attempt to prevent this escalation, but it really seems like it&#x27;s too late. There seems to be institutional momentum behind these forces at this point.')
