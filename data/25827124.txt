Being <i>used to</i> using your phone for everything, doesn&#x27;t mean you <i>cannot</i> do something else. It&#x27;s inconvenient, and not impossible, to go to a library[0] instead of Google and BabyCenter.com for answers to your questions. It&#x27;s inconvenient, and not impossible, to momentarily disappoint your kids to protect their data forever (which is the kind of long-term concern that you understand and they don&#x27;t, because you&#x27;re the adult, which in turn is why you, and not they, are in charge).<p>[0] RE libraries &amp; books, that&#x27;s the method most people used up to and past the 80s when PCs started appearing in many homes. That&#x27;s the method by which enough knowledge was transmitted through millennia to enable the invention of smartphones. You don&#x27;t even have to borrow the book; you can read it on-premises. But if you need to borrow it, you should still real-quick make sure the library isn&#x27;t selling you out to anybody either. Most libraries have enough money and are pretty popular when it comes time to levy a tax or issue a bond. But some are just strapped enough that they &quot;could really use the extra cash&quot; that comes from providing borrower data to somebody who has convinced them it will be &quot;anonymized.&quot;')
