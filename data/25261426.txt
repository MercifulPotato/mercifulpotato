If it&#x27;s chosen (or heavily influenced) by politicians, I suspect politicians can win some votes by saying they&#x27;ll improve safety by lowering speed limits (particularly around schools or other places where children might be); while they&#x27;d be less likely to win as many votes by saying they&#x27;ll raise the limits (exposing them to the risk of their opponents calling them reckless&#x2F;irresponsible).  If it&#x27;s chosen by non-elected officials, that&#x27;s less of an issue, but something like it may still be there; or it may be that raising the limit and then there being a fatal accident will damage your career, while lowering the limit and irritating everyone will not damage your career.')
