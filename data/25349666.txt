Then the itching would start, from my ankles and working its way up as my whole body broke out in hives. After the first attack, I took it crazy seriously (discovering I had this involved going to the ER at 2 AM not breathing!), so the most that happened during that year was that I got some hives and then slammed a double-dose of Benadryl, which knocked it back (and knocked me out). Fortunately once I knew I had it, I could mostly avoid it, so the only times I had reactions were when I missed something (e.g. get a burrito and they accidentally slip a piece of beef in with the chicken). I carried an epi-pen for emergencies and a sheet of Benadryl tablets; never had to use the epi-pen (thank goodness!). No medications to take in the meantime, just dietary changes.<p>The protein that causes this is only produced by mammals, so chicken and fish were totally safe. Weirdly, primates don&#x27;t produce it either, so my allergist joked that if I were into eating monkeys or cannibalism, I&#x27;d be totally fine!<p>They still don&#x27;t know why it clears up in some people and not others--in some, it goes away in a matter of weeks, some people it can take a year or multiple years, and in others it never disappears at all. And having had it, I&#x27;m apparently susceptible to getting it again, so if I get another tick bite it could come back again.')
