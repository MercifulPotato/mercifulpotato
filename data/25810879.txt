I have claimed that we are using it for things it was not meant for, creating major inefficiencies.<p>Can we agree that modern web-based UIs can often be slow or just CPU-intensive? If so, then why is that?<p>Your claim is effectively that HTML has no impact on the problem. Purely perfomance-wise, yes, modern browsers are plenty capable of doing DOM mutations super fast. No problem there. But since we are using an ecosystem that wasn&#x27;t meant for interactive UIs, we need to create inefficient layers on top of it. Why do we need to create those layers? Because the underlying abstractions (HTML&#x2F;CSS&#x2F;JS) are not suitable.<p>I am not sure how else to make you understand. How come in 2021 there is no easy way to build a performant interactive UI on the web? If the ecosystem were suitable for it, surely we would have a reasonable solution by now. Considering how DOM changes are done plenty fast, JS is plenty fast and that we have major tech companies (Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Apple) working on the web, we should not have any issues.<p>In any case, it seems we are not going to be able to convince eachother. I am a believer in fundamentals. Get them right, and the rest follows. HTML was and is great for documents, but for interactive UIs, we can do better.')
