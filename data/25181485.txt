The sine function obviously doesn&#x27;t have a technical inverse on any interval where it has two values. The notation does make me forget this sometimes.<p>Of course, the situation is different from many other functions without inverses, because the set of all valid inversions can be trivially generated from one solution. Just put a mirror at pi&#x2F;2 and -pi&#x2F;2.')
