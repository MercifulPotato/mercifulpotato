So as you recurse, even if you carry over the events by passing them back, you&#x27;ll need to have a part where you block and wait on external input from the user, and that is inherently an impure operation.<p>You can keep extracting the IO out, but you can&#x27;t get rid of it. So Haskell or Elm would basically do the &quot;dirty impure&quot; IO on your behalf, so in your code it wouldn&#x27;t even seem like you&#x27;re doing impure IO, but your running program still will, just it&#x27;ll be done by the Haskell&#x2F;Elm runtime on your behalf. Or if you&#x27;re not using those languages, the best you can do is extract it to your top level function.')
