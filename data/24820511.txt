There&#x27;s a fairly narrow scope where it is a good idea - particularly when there&#x27;s an understanding on both sides of mentor&#x2F;mentee. In other cases, it sometimes works, and sometimes goes south.<p>I&#x27;ve noticed that it&#x27;s fairly common for people to resent the Socratic approach being used on them. Probably they think that you&#x27;re assuming a teacher&#x2F;mentor role (and this may not be your intention), and they want to keep it as a &quot;colleague&quot; role.<p>Whatever people&#x27;s intentions&#x2F;interpretations, the Socratic method backfires a lot. Every one I know at work who is heavy on it has a number of colleagues who refer to him as &quot;arrogant&quot; behind his back. I remember the first time this happened, I was quite taken aback because I knew the person quite well, and he was anything but arrogant. But by using the Socratic method, people felt he was assuming a superior role.')
