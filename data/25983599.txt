If you restrict your focus to countries where higher education is expensive, it definitely is one of many ways in which parental wealth translates into an advantage for offspring. To say it&#x27;s free or cheap in some countries is just missing their point.<p>There are also ways in which parental wealth is a disadvantage. It can weaken that grit, ambition, and drive to accomplish things.<p>While I worry about the implications as much as you do (Gattaca was a great, thought provoking movie) I think the grandparent comment is completely correct that there may be no way to prevent it. If we outlaw it our country, other countries may not. It only takes one group from now until the end of the human race to pursue this for that bifurcation of the human race to be possible.<p>Maybe it&#x27;s not such a bad thing. If we don&#x27;t make ourselves better, whatever the cost, we may find ourselves replaced by artificial life one day.')
