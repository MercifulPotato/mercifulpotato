What determines performance and cost? Primary answer: number of cores. If you care about performance, you care if the CPU has 2 or 20 cores. If you care about cost, you care if the CPU has 2 or 20 cores. You might not articulate your concerns in this way, but they are intimately bound together.<p>If you only care about &quot;good enough&quot; performance and &quot;in my range&quot; cost, then your concerns are still bound up with core count.<p>So what&#x27;s your apparently more correct understanding of some of those words?')
