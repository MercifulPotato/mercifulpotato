I&#x27;m vegetarian, so they never involve calorie-dense ingredients such as guanciale or pancetta. (I know, I know, what am I missing and so on... :D)<p>For me pasta means less ingredients as possible, at the highest possible quality.<p>Examples: Fresh Tomato-Basil Spaghetti. \nI use only spaghetti from selected Italian brands such as  De Cecco - low end but extremely good in my opinion - Rummo or Gentile, organic Tomatoes from a fresh food store, my own home-grown basil, extra virgin olive oil from Calabria, chili also from Calabria, extra-fine tomato extract from Mutti.<p>Fettucelle burro e limone: Fettuccelle DeCecco, Irish butter, Bio shallots, Phu Quoc black pepper, organic Lemons (from Sorrento when in Italy, just bio when here in Germany) for the juice and the zest.<p>Fusilli or Rigatoni alla Norma. Organic tomato sauce from Mutti with pieces of tomatoes, organic aubergines from Italy, same olive oil from Calabria, same chili from calabria, my own basil...<p>And so on: Aglio e Olio e Peperoncino, Arrabbiata, Puttanesca, Pasta all&#x27;aglione, ecc.. The sauce is never heavy, and the pasta itself can shine. \nAs you can see I also never cook pasta as an afterthought. This way, you can definitely control how much you eat.<p>Habits subjected to radically change when I visit mamma e babbo back in Italy.')
