That&#x27;s the hell I spent a good chunk of the last few years untangling on the C# front. Let&#x27;s model this correctly! Oh no someone said fuck it, lets just use a bunch of generic data types!<p>Dictionary&lt;List&lt;Dictionary&lt;string, object&gt;&gt;&gt;, SortedSet&lt;Dictionary&lt;int, string&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<p>Several thousand out of bounds, missing keys, null reference exceptions, hash collisions and the hair starts to get thin on top.
