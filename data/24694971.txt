Item(by='Dylan16807', descendants=None, kids=[24696791, 24695228], score=None, time=1601961973, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24689613, text='&gt; A car you can drive drunk is the only meaningful definition of a self-driving car, imo.<p>That&#x27;s kind of a messy definition.  A drunk person might start messing with the controls, and a car that is perfectly able to drive itself might not be able to handle <i>that</i>.  You could fix that with a breathalyzer but it would be ridiculous if the difference between self-driving and not-self-driving is the presence of a breathalyzer.<p>So I would say something more like &quot;drive from the passenger seat&quot; or &quot;drive while asleep&quot;.')
