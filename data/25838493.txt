I&#x27;m more talking about the trademark issue, did they legally get the right to use the Linux trademark in some way that Amazon Elasticsearch didn&#x27;t? Just curious if there is any substance to what Elastic is claiming here or if it&#x27;s purely a PR stunt.<p>Edit: based on the Linux Foundation link in another comment, it seems they have a clear process for sublicensing the trademark. So I guess Elastic is claiming AWS just launched their ES service without their legal team ever having bothered looking into the trademark? That seems very strange for such a large company.')
