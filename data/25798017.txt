There might be backlashes if there is consensus that giving these people the vaccine was incautious. As an example (and without linking the safety of these two vaccines), the Norwegian government has paid about 350 MNOK (about 40 million USD) to people with problems after the Pandemrix vaccine.<p>That doesn’t really mean that it will affect the ones who made these decisions though. So in that manner, the current government is probably completely safe.')
