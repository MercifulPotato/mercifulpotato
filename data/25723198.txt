In fact arguably the engineering mind worked great there. The file open dialog in Windows is just a repurposed Windows Explorer view which means you can access all the things you can from explorer when opening and saving including things like unzipping a zip file, renaming some existing file that&#x27;s in the way (like file.txt -&gt; file-old.txt and then saving the current file as file.txt), moving files (create a folder &quot;old&quot;, drag file.txt info old, save the new file as file.txt where the old file.txt was.<p>Basically you can actually do the things you often need to do. Conversely on MacOS if you need to do any of those things your only option is to use Finder which really sucks because you then have navigate to wherever you were in the app<p>And of course you can set the icon size in Windows file dialogs, something you can&#x27;t do in MacOS file open&#x2F;save dialog<p>So in this case, thank god the engineering mindset won out in Windows, at least for this particular feature. Whatever UX designer on MacOS decided to neuter the file dialogs failed UX class apparently and chose based on some random airfairy idea then users actually getting work done.')
