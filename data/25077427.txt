I thought we were talking about the immediate user-visible bug here, where some third-party apps could not be opened on some Macs for some period of time today.<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; these problems are extremely rare, they don&#x27;t last very long, and they tend to have fairly simple workarounds.<p>This is about Apple controlling what software you can run on your computer, for all third parties, and in a way that if the system&#x2F;service is malfunctioning or shut down there&#x27;s a chance it blocks all non Apple software.<p>You can either choose to accept that Apple is a good steward of this because they haven&#x27;t screwed up too much yet, and that you&#x27;re okay with it because you have no or little need for third party software it might affect (or are willing to deal with it), or you can view this as an erosion of your rights to control the hardware you bought, which while only slightly inconveniencing now are still fundamentally the same as what could be used egregiously in the future.<p>You either vigorously defend the rights (or what you want to be a right) now, or you watch it erode slowly.  That&#x27;s how the system works.  You want privacy or believe it&#x27;s important?  Protect it now and even if you don&#x27;t have anything to hide.  You want the ability to control your own computer and run your own software, and not be beholden to some companies deprecation schedule affecting things they didn&#x27;t write, or at least believe it&#x27;s important for a possible future?  Then defend it now.<p>Given how iOS functions, and how Apple is moving to their own silicon for their other products, do people seriously doubt that a future where you actually <i>can&#x27;t</i> run anything on MacOS except what you get through their store isn&#x27;t at least a <i>possible</i> future?  If that&#x27;s something we care about, it&#x27;s something we should be vocal about <i>now</i>.')
