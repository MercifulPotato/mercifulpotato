For <i>first diagnoses</i>, the numbers are significantly smaller (Table 2; 5.8% for covid, vs. 2.8% for influenza controls). So while the paper has some ~possibly interesting things to say about relative risk (with the caveats I stated above), the headline is simply clickbait.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thelancet.com&#x2F;journals&#x2F;lanpsy&#x2F;article&#x2F;PIIS2215-0366(20)30462-4&#x2F;fulltext" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thelancet.com&#x2F;journals&#x2F;lanpsy&#x2F;article&#x2F;PIIS2215-0...</a>')
