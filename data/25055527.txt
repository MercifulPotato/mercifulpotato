NYT has grown into a media empire and is pumping out more content in more areas than ever before. Why not just create a new &quot;woke&quot; section, where progressives are given more reign over what to publish and in what tenor?<p>The erosion of journalistic standards in Newsroom and Opinion will ultimately bring about its downfall. Those standards are the reason why so many people subscribe. If the standards fall away, eventually some other outlet will come along upholding those standards and siphon away the subscriber base.')
