Violence over racial justice has happened before and it will happen again. And of course, people will try to use it as an excuse to delegitimize real grievances. I don’t think this country has ever seen a president whip his 74M person base into a frenzy over a completely false narrative, with the specific purpose of overthrowing democracy. A huge chunk of people losing faith in democracy will lead us down a scary path, if we’ve learned anything from history.')
