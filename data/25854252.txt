Dataflow programing would seem to hold great promise in making programs more understandable. But there would seem to be limits as to where it can be applied (for-if) etc. It is not a universal model for practical programming, I assume.<p>It&#x27;s a bit like &quot;pure functional programming&quot;. We can&#x27;t really do that in practice because we need IO. The best we can do is to divide the program into two parts, purely functional, and imperative. Similarly I assume we could (and should try to) divide programs into &quot;data-flow-part&quot; and  &quot;synchronous-part&quot;.')
