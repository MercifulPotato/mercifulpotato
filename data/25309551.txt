One is if the bootloader is open, which it is.<p>The second is if there&#x27;s linux port for that hardware, which it isn&#x27;t.   There&#x27;s a project underway, seems likely that the CPU (which is still AARCH64) will work, and likely networking.  However to make a usable desktop you&#x27;ll need a GPU which is much harder.')
