The only reason to want more than two SSDs is if you&#x27;re re-using at least one old tiny SSD in a new machine. SATA ports will stick around in desktops only for the sake of hard drives. There may be a few niches left where using several SATA SSDs in a workstation still makes some kind of sense, and obviously not all server platforms have migrated to NVMe yet. But as far as influencing the direction and design of consumer systems, SATA SSDs have only slightly more relevance than optical disc drives.')
