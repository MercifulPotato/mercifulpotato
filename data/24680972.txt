Sonos speakers access the net and your streaming music accounts by themselves without using your phone and you can demonstrate this by turning off the phone while they&#x27;re playing. Logically, therefore, the cloud service on which this relies must keep that personal info about you. Location is used to find the speakers around you when you&#x27;re using the phone app.<p>I&#x27;m very against unnecessary data collection and even more opposed to companies selling my data, but I&#x27;m very happy with my Sonos and I don&#x27;t see any evidence that they&#x27;re doing either of those things.')
