The roles that you&#x27;ve looked at vary a lot and some are easier to transition into.<p>- Data engineering? Could be easy to switch to but to some people it would look like taking a step back. (I don&#x27;t think so personally)<p>- Signal processing? Depending on the type of data science work you&#x27;ve been doing, it could be almost indistinguishable from your experince so far and very easy to transition into.<p>- Systems engineering? Probably the most difficult one out of your list and it will take a lot of additional effort and studying.<p>- Project management? It&#x27;s a completely different career direction but you can probably gain some experience with it while you&#x27;re at your current job and slowly make the transition if that&#x27;s really what you want to do.<p>- Architecture? It helps to have a lot of experience as an individual contributor.<p>Pick something and make a plan for getting there, instead of applying to a random mix of jobs just so you can get out as quickly as possible.<p>It&#x27;s also good to be honest with yourself about the reasons for wanting to leave data science. Depending on those reasons it&#x27;s possible that you just need to change your employer instead of your field of work, especially since data science can mean so many different things in different companies. If this is your first data science job, don&#x27;t assume that the field is limited to whatever your current employer happens to label as data science. I can think of more than a handful of jobs that are very distinct from each other, all of which can have the title data scientist.')
