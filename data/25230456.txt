It&#x27;s called stereotyping or bigotry. I am not one of those &quot;kind of people.&quot; I don&#x27;t happen to live in the south of Spain, or even in Europe. In this case, your stereotyping happened to be off-base. I don&#x27;t even drink wine or eat fancy cheese, so i have no dogs in this race.<p>My experience is that all &quot;kind of people&quot; are right about some things, wrong about others, and you&#x27;re better off engaging critically issue-by-issue, rather than discounting an argument based on &quot;the kind of people&quot; who happen to make that particular type of argument.<p>You&#x27;re also better off not imputing meaning. There&#x27;s a pathway to sensible actions:<p>* Understanding facts (objective reality -- we should all be able to agree)<p>* Understanding viewpoints on problems (which comes down to values and opinions -- and we definitely won&#x27;t all agree)<p>* Coming up with plans (which come down to figuring out how to meet the needs of as many people as possible).<p>If you short-circuit the top ones because you think it will lead the wrong course of action, you&#x27;re promoting polarization and standing in the way of meaningful civic discourse. You&#x27;re also willfully ignorant, since you learn the most engaging with people you disagree with, rather than discounting them (as we do in two halves of America) as liberal snowflakes or racist redneck hicks.')
