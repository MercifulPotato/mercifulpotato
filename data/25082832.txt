I wouldn&#x27;t trust your background checking abilities...<p>But I get it, you made a choice and you tried to find a justification for that choice. I saw this speech and Q&amp;A with Yanis Varoufakis the other day, and at one point he reiterated the &quot;Fuck you, establishment!&quot; motivations of Trump and Brexit-voters: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=gGeevtdp1WQ&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=3293" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=gGeevtdp1WQ&amp;feature=youtu.be...</a> .<p>Voting for Hillary would have meant a continuation of Obama, out of anger or desperation of how shitty their lives had been, many in the electorate  thought &quot;Let&#x27;s just vote for change, it might be shit, or it might be good, at least we know it&#x27;ll be change.&quot;.
