I think the issue is that for a platform like this to survive it will need community developers. Idk how much purism software they use or what they lend from pureOS but Pine64 has distros and projects like kde throwing themselves behind the idea with their mobile variants and probably contributing upstream. They also all help advertise. This is great especially when in the early stages it generally isn&#x27;t purchased to replace a main phone.<p>Pinephone&#x27;s pricepoint allows for people to get it on the side to tinker with, develop for it, etc and people that get it at that price don&#x27;t really care too much bout the occasional bit of lag or glitch.<p>Additionally something like a better camera on the librem to account for the price doesn&#x27;t appeal to a lot of people if they have to wait for drivers for it.<p>I also think pine64 has more people working remotely from all over the place and is registered in hong kong or malaysia since recently whilst purism with lots of remote stuff going on also has staff in san francisco and pays more taxes there? Correct me if i&#x27;m wrong tho.')
