We&#x27;re trying to avoid hellfire here, and we&#x27;re banning accounts that feed it. Please don&#x27;t feed it.<p>&gt; HN is not for all types of discussion. It is specifically for <i>curious conversation</i>. Here&#x27;s a test you can apply: curiosity is <i>equally open to what&#x27;s true, false, or interesting about anything</i>. If your position is <i>that your side is right about everything while the opposing side is wrong about everything, you have left the spectrum of curiosity gratification and are functioning in the spectrum of political battle</i>. Those do not overlap.<p>My ongoing issue, the &quot;axe I grind&quot;, the &quot;dead horse I beat&quot; (refer to my history), is this very thing: the constant <i>and obvious</i> degradation of the quality of discourse on HN when it comes to Culture War topics.  Most specifically: the homogeneous culture of <i>refusal</i> to even consider <i>what is actually true</i>.  Not only is there little interest in what is true, but the very notion seems to be considered highly inappropriate for discussion, and anyone who dares mention it is considered an immoral heretic.<p>This trait has been sweeping through Western culture for years, if not decades - like a virus of the mind. HN was an outlier for quite some time, but as you know the infection has spread to here, and is flourishing.<p>From my perspective, there are at least two noteworthy issues in play:<p>1. The orderliness of HN forums.<p>2. The orderliness of the USA, and in turn the entire planet.<p>I imagine you may be less concerned about #2 than I am, but I happen to subscribe to the theory that &quot;with great power, comes great responsibility&quot;.  What if there was an approach that could plausibly &quot;solve&quot; (to a worthwhile degree) #1, and possibly also contribute to the solving of #2?<p>And if no one does anything different, where is the world going to be 5, 10, 20 years from now?  Where would the world be today if it wasn&#x27;t for the actions of a few key individuals at key points in history?')
