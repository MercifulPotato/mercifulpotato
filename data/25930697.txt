Both i7. So far, so good. Yesterday, I bought a Tiger Lake i5 laptop; I would have been happy to buy a Zen 4 laptop but I couldn&#x27;t find any at the price point I needed.<p>I heard on the AMD earnings call yesterday that there was some tightness in the lower end of the Ryzen laptop lineup due to AMD under-anticipating the demand. Here&#x27;s a quote:<p><i>So certainly, when I look at the semiconductor environment in 2020, it was very strong. So we saw a strong revenue ramp in our business, as well as across some of our peers. It&#x27;s fair to say that the overall demand exceeded our planning.<p>And as a result, we did have some supply constraints as we ended the year. Those were primarily I would say in the PC market, the low end of the PC market, and in the gaming markets. That being said, I think we&#x27;re getting great support from our manufacturing partners. The industry does need to increase the overall capacity levels.<p>And so we do see some tightness through the first half of the year, but there&#x27;s added capacity in the second half.</i><p>So I anticipate that Intel is going to keep the pricing pressure on, to recapture market share. We already see this in the desktop processors, where AMD now sells at a premium versus Intel (admittedly, for good reason).')
