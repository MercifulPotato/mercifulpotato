I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever seen it in real life.<p>Consider for example what it would sound like if you made a wild grammatical mistake in your native language, or completely misused some word. You wouldn&#x27;t sound like a foreign speaker, but sloppy, tired, or maybe like you were making some sort of joke. I wouldn&#x27;t even know where to start in order to get to that level in a second language.')
