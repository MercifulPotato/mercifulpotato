Item(by='zinekeller', descendants=None, kids=[25080306], score=None, time=1605256140, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25080086, text='&gt; However, the bulk of the DMCA seems to be leveled at the marketing of ytdl as a circumvention tool, citing unit tests containing metadata referencing RIAA-owned content (unit tests, apparently, are now part of &#x27;marketing,&#x27; I guess.)<p>This is definitely untested in court but I won&#x27;t be surprised if it is indeed part of marketing. The problem with the tests is that they do download the video, even if it is a small amount and since ytdl does not reject the video for downloading at all it is technically infrigment, probably without a valid fair use defense. If ytdl has actively rejected that (for example if the test units are specifically to prevent downloading those types of videos), they may have a stonger defense against RIAA claims.')
