A sufficient amount of cleverness often allows you to say in a few lines what would otherwise be said in 100s of lines - for example switch statements or numerous ifs going through each possibility with not much difference in how each branching is handled. I find the verbose listing of each possibility gives me physical pain, so I support cleverness in such situations.')
