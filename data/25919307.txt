Republicans think its fraud to let party functionaries go register and collect ballots with out any ID or signature matching.  You&#x27;ve just decided the former is fact and the later is wrong.<p>The insane conspiracy theories peddled by Trump associates like Guiliani, Woods, and Powell are far beyond what mainstream democrats said (but not really that different from what fringe democrats said about ROVIAN DIEBOLD MACHINES STEALING OHIO in 2004).  While Kerry didn&#x27;t push these theories, 31 house members and Barbera Boxer in the Senate voted to reject the Ohio votes based on the same sort of conspiracy theories.<p>And again in 2016, while not lead by Clinton, there was a concerted effort to flip electoral votes--the so called hamilton electors.  At least one actually did change their vote.<p>I&#x27;ll agree the GOP took it to a new level. But some democrats had previously taken it to new levels in prior elections.')
