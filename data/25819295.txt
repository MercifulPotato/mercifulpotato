I had ulcerative colitis for 20 years and all symptoms was gone within 6 months, also verified with a rectoscopy. \nI also had great improvements in mood and motivation by taking vitamin-d and for cramps&#x2F;sleep by taking ZMA (Zinc for testosterone, Magnesium for cramps).\nCan recommend the books Deep Nutrition and Genius Foods, the latter is probably more accessible.\nAlso recommend following @Mangan150 on twitter.')
