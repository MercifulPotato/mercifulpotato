And there&#x27;s no direct evidence that those people are getting &#x27;rich.&#x27; Outside of the few whales that are profiting off the (somehow?) legal pump and dump scheme that is WallStreetBets.<p>Rich is having a high networth. It&#x27;s a lot more dependent on what social class in which you were raised (and therefore what networks you can access, and what role models you have) than your IQ.*<p>My IQ puts me easily in the 95th precentile of tested individuals, but I grew up poor to two alcoholic high-school dropouts.<p>On the other hand, I have a friend who grew up with CEO father who sits on boards of major public companies. This friend spent college (at a lower-to-mid tier school) as a D1 athlete pounding beers while dealing and using massive amounts of cocaine. This friend will tell you I&#x27;m the smartest person he&#x27;s ever met. He&#x27;s said it to multiple of his contacts while in my presence.<p>He pulls in hundreds of thousands of dollars a month due to his daddy&#x27;s connections, while I scratched and clawed my way to rise above my station and get hired by a FAANG.<p>*This is completely ignoring that IQ is based off an extremely  biased, standardized test and a horrible proxy for intelligence.')
