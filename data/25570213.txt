The youtube reviews keep bringing up overclocking, cooling methods and motherboards. You might think half PC owners do it. But I see relatively little overclocking discussion on HN, mostly like speedrunners, for sport. Such and such overclocked a new CPU or GPU to X or Y.<p>My impression is that for the trouble you get buying better coolers and motherboards and finding stable configurations by trial and error you may as well spend that extra money on a more powerful CPU or GPU and run it at stock speeds. You gain a couple of percent, and while your CPU might not die before you replace it it does increase power consumption (so: money) a lot. So, a sneaky option if you aren&#x27;t the one paying the electricity bills. And your computer might crash more often. When I buy PC parts, I tend to stick to certain power ranges, for example 65W CPU. Also, not all faults are fatal for hardware and silent faults might cause data corruption.<p>Do you overclock any of your home computer components? What are your reasons?<p>Do any of you overclock workplace computers?')
