Irrational is unfair, I feel.<p>We, anyone who knows what an article titled &quot;Protocols, Not Platforms&quot; is probably about... our discussions have failed to have enough impact outside of niche. People see there is a problem. &quot;Marketplace of ideas&quot; is somewhat of a hard sell . As you say... mismanaged cesspits, but also monopolies. Also, &quot;marketplace&quot; is more euphemism than metaphor when referring to a handful of click-optimizing algorithms.<p>I&#x27;m on the fence, but don&#x27;t tend to think whatever the current politics does give more power to those companies who fucked up the system in the first place.<p>Facebook and Twitter were already in an uncanny valley of free speech. It has been, Free speech at their discretion all along, and this wasn&#x27;t a theoretical problem. At least now it is clear what we are looking at.<p>In any case, this post in on point. It&#x27;s disheartening that decades into this discussion we have not had enough impact that politicians even know what the hell we are talking about. Twitter doesn&#x27;t need to be regulated. It just needs to die. Twitter does not need to be a company. It&#x27;s already basically a protocol. Free the protocol. Discard the company. They are not needed.')
