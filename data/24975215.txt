(Even when I had an account and subscriptions.)<p>But I think my point stands - recommendations don&#x27;t actually need any network effect, or to be done by YouTube itself. You could have a third-party&#x2F;OSS recommender, it&#x27;s just pretty niche and probably doesn&#x27;t exist.<p>IMO YouTube can be used as a dumb content store. It&#x27;s on the creator side that it has the &#x27;network effect&#x27; handcuffs - it&#x27;s the content store everyone goes to, so if you make content, it&#x27;s where you need to store ità¥¤')
