I had sworn off Samsung due to bad experiences with their phones and other products, but there were enough positive reviews of the TV that I made an exception.<p>Huge mistake. Terrible software, hardware bugs, issues with motion interpolation (even basic things like 24fps over 30hz judder reduction), audio sync issues with sound bar, etc.<p>I&#x27;ll get an LG soon.')
