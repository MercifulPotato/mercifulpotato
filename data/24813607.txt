Item(by='mpweiher', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602970775, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24811553, text='&gt; Well, the syntax is same<p>Exactly.  Which is why I wrote &quot;they adopted the syntax&quot;, not &quot;they adopted the ideas&quot;.  It would have been really wonderful had they adopted the ideas, and it would also have made their marketing slogan &quot;Objective-C without the C&quot; actually truthful.<p>&gt; the ideas are different<p>Yes, and that&#x27;s the problem.<p>&gt; Trailing closure syntax is basically &#x27;you can remove the parens if there are trailing closures&#x27;<p>Not really, no.  The parens are still all there, you just move one (original trailing closure syntax) or more (new keyword trailing closure syntax) of the parameters outside the parens.<p>Which is horribly inconsistent just by itself.  I mean, the point of the parens is that they delimit the arguments.  If you have parens, then the arguments go <i>inside</i> the parens.  Except for this one...did I say one, I meant these two special cases where the arguments do not go inside the parens.<p>If you are going to have <i>some</i> of the arguments be outside the parens, why not just go all in and have <i>all</i> of them &quot;outside&quot; by just getting rid of the parens and be (a) consistent and (b) dramatically simpler and (c) readable?<p>&gt; which was inspired by Objective-C, which was inspired by Smalltalk.<p>&gt; I don&#x27;t think Smalltalk influenced that syntax any more ...<p>Which is it?<p>Anyway, the point of the article wasn&#x27;t that they <i>consciously</i> decided to adopt Smalltalk syntax.  The point is that they bungled this so badly that they <i>ended up</i> adopting the very Smalltalk syntax that they initially rejected, and the reason they ended up adopting it was that they couldn&#x27;t make things work reasonably any other way.  Except that had they done this from the beginning, they would have not run into any of these problems.')
