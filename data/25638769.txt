There&#x27;s only an abstract. I don&#x27;t see the actual one on Sci-Hub or anywhere. I can read it.<p>&gt; <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thelancet.com&#x2F;action&#x2F;showPdf?pii=S0140-6736%2820%2932034-1" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thelancet.com&#x2F;action&#x2F;showPdf?pii=S0140-6736%2820...</a><p>The full text of the 2nd paper is literally only two pages and only appears to look at regions in France and not other countries. There are literally no graphs, no detailed explanation of the methodology and the very next article is literally &quot;Is COVID-19 being used as a weapon against Indigenous Peoples in Brazil?&quot; which speaks of this very weird identity politics finding its way into major academic journals. There are references to an Appendix that I can&#x27;t seem to find the full-text of, but it bothers me the paper itself doesn&#x27;t seem to have a detail methodology section, risk analysis and also lists some pretty big financial incentives&#x2F;interests.<p>The 3rd study is the only really detailed source provided, yet it only covers data up to May 5th. It also has this interesting quote:<p>&gt;  In addition, it is claimed that, besides the positive aspects of the lockdown, people who comply with this restriction cause a weakened immune system. The main reason for this is that there is too much food consumption and limited mobility. The effect of the lockdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic on human health may be the subject of future work<p>It also tries to look at environmental impacts and mentions the inconsistency of lock-downs across all areas. I&#x27;m also having a hard time understand the &quot;Transformed data&quot; as it doesn&#x27;t seem to correlate to either of the two preceding graphs at all. Also keep in mind, correlational near r=1 shows that Ice Cream sales can lead to Polio:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;external-content.duckduckgo.com&#x2F;iu&#x2F;?u=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.springernature.com%2Foriginal%2Fspringer-static%2Fimage%2Fchp%3A10.1007%252F978-3-319-93224-8_15%2FMediaObjects%2F430194_1_En_15_Fig4_HTML.png&amp;f=1&amp;nofb=1" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;external-content.duckduckgo.com&#x2F;iu&#x2F;?u=https%3A%2F%2F...</a><p>That combined with the limited window and inconsistent lock-downs should at least throw question on this study.')
