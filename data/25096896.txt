Related to meal size, yoga (via a book by The Yoga Institute) says at the end of a meal, your stomach contents should be one half food, one quarter water and one quarter air, for good digestion, which seems to make sense, intuitively, because if it was all food, it would be a tight fit, so would not move around and through the digestive system easily, and the same (though less so) if full with only food and water, hence the air bit too.<p>The Yoga Institute may be the oldest commercial yoga center in the world.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;theyogainstitute.org" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;theyogainstitute.org</a>')
