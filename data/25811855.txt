It would need a break in current trends.<p>60 years is the interval between Zuse&#x27;s first Turing-complete relay computer and the popping of the dotcom bubble. Or between the Wright flyer and Project Gemini. Outer space has ridiculously more resources available than Earth surface, making it economically irresistible. Powerful economics plus 60 years of development can equal... a lot, as I said to start this subthread. Mars itself is not very attractive, but if space happens bigtime then even a sideshow can also happen.<p>100% self-sustaining would be unlikely (there&#x27;s no real point in the last increment towards that), but colonies on Earth always had trade too.')
