And populations aren’t forced to use Facebook, China chose not to.<p>What are you advocating for here? An international cloud platform with different standards in every country? How is that supposed to work online? What exactly would Facebook do differently ... while obeying the laws of the countries it operates in?<p>Doesn’t it make some sense, liability-wise, for Facebook to apply the union of all (or most... many are similar globally) free speech exceptions globally across the entire platform, and therefore subject Europeans to US limitations and vice-versa?<p>You didn’t answer the core question: <i>why</i> should Facebook not be able to apply their own rules? That goes against the grain of the idea of private companies. Are you suggesting that Facebook is too large to be private? Or are you suggesting that no private companies should censor any speech, regardless of company standards? Or that there shouldn’t be private companies? I don’t understand.')
