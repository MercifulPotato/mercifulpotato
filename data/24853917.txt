I have a question a bit before UDP is landed on the NIC, assuming the NICs on the edge servers is connected to multiple transit providers for incoming and outgoing traffic. This mean from the VM perspective, you can have incoming&#x2F;outgoing tap&#x2F;tun inside the VMs able to receive packets from difference transits or outbound, did you do anything with this aspect? and if so do you also deal with ECMP inbound in such that you can have the same virtual IP receiving UDP on multiple edge servers?')
