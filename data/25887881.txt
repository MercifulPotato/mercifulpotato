It&#x27;s getting harder every day. Why are low sugar alternatives to basic snacks (e.g. Keto friendly) like 3-10x more expensive?<p>Why does EVERYTHING have sugar in it? Why don&#x27;t we have cheap and healthy fast food that seems to be common in so many other countries?<p>We could solve this problem if we actually subsidized and demanded better food standards. If we helped people make the right choices. But hey, we decided that fat is the enemy and everyone should have hundreds of grams of carbs per day.<p>When I lived in Iran it was so much easier to maintain a proper weight.
