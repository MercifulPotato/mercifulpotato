Item(by='kelnos', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602631740, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24764409, text='&gt; <i>I generally default to MIT&#x2F;Apache2 unless I have a reason to do otherwise, out of consideration for employees at Google or other corps who may want to participate in my project.</i><p>That&#x27;s kinda a sad state of affairs that you&#x27;re allowing corporate policy (of companies that you don&#x27;t work for) to effectively dictate your licensing strategy.  Not saying you&#x27;re wrong to do so (it&#x27;s your project; you know best), but the overall gist of it feels a little dystopian.<p>Ultimately Google is applying pressure -- even if unintentionally -- to the community at large: &quot;use a license we&#x27;re happy with, or you&#x27;ll have a smaller pool of contributors&quot;[0].<p>If AGPL was a majority license for projects like these, then Google would likely have no choice but to allow contributions to AGPL projects.<p>[0] Note that that&#x27;s different from an <i>individual</i> deciding (for whatever reason) that they don&#x27;t want to contribute to projects that use certain licenses (which is fine!).  Google&#x27;s policy forces an unreasonable restriction on their employees that their employees may not agree with, but can&#x27;t argue with because of the employer-employee power imbalance.')
