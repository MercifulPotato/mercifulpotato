They do and I specifically address this in the long form blog post I linked.<p>They’re not comparable because the western companies are <i>not</i> doing this due to the threat of  retaliation from their own government.<p>There’s more nuance here (which I address in that blog post). I wrote that so I wouldn’t have to rewrite the same stuff every time this issue comes up.<p>The reason I said it’s not comparable to companies operating in western democratic countries is because otherwise the first reply every time I write something like this is a false equivalence about how the “&lt;insert western country here&gt; is the same if not worse...” which is just not true.')
