Java for example has the MonthDay class (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.oracle.com&#x2F;javase&#x2F;8&#x2F;docs&#x2F;api&#x2F;java&#x2F;time&#x2F;MonthDay.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.oracle.com&#x2F;javase&#x2F;8&#x2F;docs&#x2F;api&#x2F;java&#x2F;time&#x2F;MonthDay...</a>) which can be converted into a local date when the additional information is available. If your users want to refer to that as a date then that should be handled in the UI but should not lead to ambiguity in the internal representation.')
