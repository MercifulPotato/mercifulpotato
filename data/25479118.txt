Using a simplistic model of their contributions that Bezos is irreplaceable and each worker is fungible, you&#x27;d get Shapley values for the whole organization along the lines of Bezos getting half and the workers splitting the rest. In terms of profits before wages the workers are getting far more than half, and even in terms of revenue before expenses they&#x27;re only getting a few times less than half. As a crude ballpark, compensation doesn&#x27;t seem to be disproportionate.<p>Valid counter-arguments include Shapley values not being an appropriate way to allocate payment (which necessitates choosing which one (or more) of their payout properties you&#x27;d like violated, e.g. symmetry among equivalent workers or that payment should depend on value added), my model being so simplistic that it can&#x27;t possibly be right even to an order of magnitude, declaring that even a factor of 2 is actually important in examining Bezos&#x27;s income, etc. Appealing to a gut reaction based on numbers that are &quot;obviously&quot; too big is misleading at best.')
