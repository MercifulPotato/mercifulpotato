Using paper towels seems so wasteful now.  I can clean anything by scrubbing it lightly with a soapy brush wand, wiping away the soap with a towel, and tossing the towel in the laundry.  This even works for the bathroom mirror.  I no longer spray glass cleaner which releases toxic VOCs (ammonia) into my home.  I no longer use sponges, which are unhygienic and wasteful.  Every home needs a tall stack of towels and a couple of brush wands.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;OXO-3203200-SteeL-Bottle-Brush&#x2F;dp&#x2F;B0028EAA60" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;OXO-3203200-SteeL-Bottle-Brush&#x2F;dp&#x2F;B00...</a>')
