The Greeks and Roman are a good example of that. The entire back and forth history of the Silk Road (the real one). Even the Crusades had cultural dumps back and forth. Um, Japan is also considered the modern day &quot;Rome&quot; when it comes to taking other inventions and improving on it beyond their creator&#x27;s imaginations. Like, are we going to yell cultural appropriation against the Japanese for building the Mitsubishi Zero (I don&#x27;t know enough about sushi to talk about it beyond the california roll being a fucking abomination)? They didn&#x27;t invent the airplane, but I dare you to find a history nut who isn&#x27;t going to talk kindly about the engineering and general marvel that plane was for its time, along with how it forced the USA to adapt their learning and counter maneuvers to combat it. It was a super important plane to both military and aviation history, even though it&#x27;s technically a piece of cultural appropriation.<p>Ever think the whole thing is just making a mountain out of a mole hill since it&#x27;s never the &quot;offended culture&quot; that&#x27;s ever offended, but some random person in San Fran or Los Angeles without a real job?')
