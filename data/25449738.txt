So, I have to come up with changes to the memorized opening on the spot.<p>This is a good way to put it. I don&#x27;t yet understand what makes an opening such a personality. Like, what the &quot;attitude&quot; of an opening is beyond &quot;white tries to dominate the center with a fiancetto from the king-side and crush the opponents defenses through pressure on f7&quot; (this is like how every Wikipedia entry on openings is written). Great, thanks! I think this is probably one of the things that separates enthusiasts from naturals, because while I get the basic point of the sentence, I don&#x27;t see how that plays out for 10 moves. Or maybe I&#x27;m overthinking it. I keep waiting for it to &quot;click&quot; one day.<p>But yes, seeing someone deviate from a memorized opening doesn&#x27;t help me win either!')
