It was not particularly well received, but also was not stopped, and they were by no means blackballed. It was regarded as a silly story, albeit clearly with some satirical bite.<p>One of the brothers wrote about the experience and the climate at the time[2], and their notes were published along with a recent &#x27;Masters of SF&#x27; edition that was published.<p>It&#x27;s an enjoyable book. To be clear, it is not critical of &#x27;communism&#x27;, it&#x27;s critical of some ideas that (as I understand it) formed part of the conventional wisdom of how Soviet communists were expected to see history, as a largely unflappable progression toward communism -- one take on the point of the Strugastkys was that all it takes is a certain kind of selfish brute to slip any society down toward fascism, regardless of where they were on their journey through history. If it could happen early (which they investigate in the book), it could also happen late.<p>1 - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Hard_to_Be_a_God" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Hard_to_Be_a_God</a><p>2 - <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rusf.ru&#x2F;abs&#x2F;books&#x2F;bns-03.htm" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rusf.ru&#x2F;abs&#x2F;books&#x2F;bns-03.htm</a> (comments by Boris Strugastky in Russian, but google&#x27;s autotranslate makes it quite readable. Very interesting perspective from an intellectual and author who was somewhat openly critical at the time of the more reactionary and traditional elements of the state, and just about their process!)')
