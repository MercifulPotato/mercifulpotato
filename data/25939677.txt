The leaders therefore chose to support other OSS where possible, including Jitsi. Less than 25 people attend regularly, but hopefully it can grow (not many people travelling these days, it&#x27;s nice to hear first-hand about life in Singapore, China, Korea, Germany, Italy). If we have Jitsi-related issues, I&#x27;ll try to let you know! And you&#x27;re all welcome to drop in and find out more :)')
