This was one of the Route 128 companies. But, based on some recruiting conversations I had over time, the Bay Area salaries weren&#x27;t really a lot higher and housing was more expensive. That&#x27;s one reason I never moved out West. I think I was paying similar in rent initially but it was a bigger 2BR townhouse.<p>Housing has gotten relatively more expensive but it hasn&#x27;t been cheap in much of the Bay Area for a very long time and tech salaries didn&#x27;t used to be anything special.')
