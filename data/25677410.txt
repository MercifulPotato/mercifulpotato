Item(by='tetrometal', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610053296, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25673632, text='No.<p>First, you&#x27;ve got me confused with someone you imagine me to be. I don&#x27;t WANT there to have been fraud. I want there to have NOT been fraud, for two reasons:<p>1. Who the hell would hope for fraud?\n2. The election ship has sailed. If extensive fraud is discovered now, that would be a nightmare that could easily destroy the nation.<p>It&#x27;s easy for the winning side to trot out a bunch of people that support their position (and if you try suggesting R&#x27;s are on the same side as Trump supporters, then you&#x27;re more divorced from reality than I feared). Trump supporters don&#x27;t care. They want specific concerns addressed.<p>And frankly, they should be. Every election in a bona fide democracy should be characterized by the winning side steel manning the losing side&#x27;s objections and addressing them one-by-one until the fraction of the population continuing to object is minuscule enough to ignore.<p>That didn&#x27;t happen. Instead objectors got people they didn&#x27;t trust (I literally can&#x27;t believe you thought &quot;the media&quot; is a class of people they would trust) trotted out before them declaring &quot;There&#x27;s NO evidence of election fraud&quot; (demonstrably false, there&#x27;s evidence of election fraud in every election), stonewalling, and running out the clock.<p>They should have steel-manned and addressed in a very public and forthcoming, unspun manner the more compelling arguments presented. Matt Braynard&#x27;s [1] work, for example, should have been litigated to hell and back.<p>Undergoing these challenges is critical to maintaining democracy, but the left was hell-bent on painting a narrative that pursuing election transparency in 2020 (not 2016, mind you; they had quite a different take then when they were mucking with the electoral college themselves [2]) was somehow antidemocratic because all questions had been settled by the people only they were permitted to declare trustworthy.<p>So what we have now is a huge fraction of the population that feel the election has been stolen:<p>&quot;Sixty-one percent (61%) of Republicans say it’s Very Likely the Democrats stole the election, but just as many Democrats (61%) say it’s Not At All Likely. Among unaffiliateds, 29% feel it’s a stolen election; 45% do not.&quot; [3]<p>I don&#x27;t have much of a dog in this fight. I&#x27;m about as pure a libertarian&#x2F;ancap as you can find. I leaned slightly Trump because I despise war, but I would have been just as happy with Biden and a republican senate. I&#x27;m telling you with open eyes (the same eyes I use to attempt to discredit the Q and Lin Wood madness on the right) that you have bought into a false narrative sold to you by the leftist media. You are nowhere in the vicinity of &quot;woke&quot;. You are stuck in a bubble that decries other bubbles and you don&#x27;t even realize it. Worse, it&#x27;s the most powerful bubble that is causing the most damage to society. It is YOUR bubble that is causing the most damage to democracy in this country.<p>So, no, I will not &quot;shut the fuck up&quot;. I will keep speaking for as long as necessary for all sides of this shit show to wake up.<p>Good DAY.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.americanthinker.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;matt_braynards_data_analytics_have_paid_off.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.americanthinker.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;matt_braynards_...</a>\n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dailysignal.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;17&#x2F;how-democrats-attempted-a-2016-electoral-college-coup&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dailysignal.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;17&#x2F;how-democrats-attempt...</a>\n[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rasmussenreports.com&#x2F;public_content&#x2F;politics&#x2F;elections&#x2F;election_2020&#x2F;61_think_trump_should_concede_to_biden" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rasmussenreports.com&#x2F;public_content&#x2F;politics&#x2F;ele...</a>')
