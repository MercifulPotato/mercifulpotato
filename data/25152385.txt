Ammonium nitrate is not as powerful as TNT (Trinitrotoluene); therefore you require more of it for the same effect.<p>Edit: The second link is probably misquoted and is also an estimation in terms of TNT. This is common; nuclear weapon yields are also stated in terms of TNT for example, despite not containing any.')
