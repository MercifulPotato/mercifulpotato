There are many reasons that make them less effective at this than their ideal.<p>In particular, costs are high, litigation to protect is expensive, and so your average student wouldn&#x27;t be able to afford this. The fact that software is typically shipped virtually means that borders are practically non-existent, and wide patents are often needed, or a company needs to give up on defending their patent outside their primary market.<p>To patent an idea will probably be around $10-100k per market. To cover US, EU, and large Asian markets, you&#x27;re looking at $500k-1m, and thats just to get the patent. Then you&#x27;ll need to defend it, which can be hard to do against entities based in non-compliant countries such as China.<p>This all means that unless you&#x27;re defending the very core of your entire business proposition, you probably need to be a &gt;$100m before it&#x27;s worth pursuing patents, and even for the core of your business you probably need to have several million in funding.')
