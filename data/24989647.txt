Do video calls from your phone and put it in a soundproof&#x2F;wireless transmission proof box.<p>If a nation state is able to get to your laptop they&#x27;re going to figure out pretty quickly that you&#x27;re &quot;feeding something pre-recorded&quot; into the mic and camera every time you have a meeting.  Ignoring the insane effort you&#x27;d have to put out to feed that in and make it even semi-believable.  For starters they are presumably tracking who you&#x27;re meeting with - are you going to have a meeting before your meeting to pre-record?  Hope they don&#x27;t figure out that you&#x27;re saying the exact same thing in two different meetings?  Somehow have root on your laptop but aren&#x27;t bright enough to figure out you&#x27;re feeding data from a local file into your mic and camera?')
