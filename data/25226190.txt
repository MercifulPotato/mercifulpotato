I&#x27;m not a huge fan of Java (as I suppose the joke already demonstrated), but I also notice how many places start out with PHP or Ruby or Python and end up moving to, if not Java, a language running on the JVM. So I still appreciate it. :)<p>To give PHP its due, it can be very fast -- although the more you use it &quot;the modern, right way,&quot; the slower it seems to get. I can&#x27;t help but wonder how much of that is an impedance mismatch between &quot;your program starts over from scratch with every HTTP request&quot; and &quot;structure your program so that by the time every class is instantiated and interface is implemented, ten thousand lines of code have been processed with each request.&quot; No matter how great its optimization and caching may be, a Laravel or Symfony app just has a whole lot of overhead relative to any framework in another language that <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> have PHP&#x27;s zero-state approach.')
