It only happens if it&#x27;s rewarded, and they&#x27;ve set up what seems to be a strong culture that motivates people to not work too much.<p>It seems like their current culture consists of people who don&#x27;t want to be defined by their work. The post notes this explicitly.<p>If the employees will overwork, I suspect it will be on their side projects, and more power to them')
