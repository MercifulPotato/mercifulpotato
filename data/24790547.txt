Their job is to experiment and publish, maintainable bug free(unless it effects their code) doesn&#x27;t get rewarded.<p>With that being said there are tons of high quality open source scientific computing projects e.g. lammps, abinit, dakota, Deal.II which are open source, ran by people at government research labs and universities and funded by e.g. NSF which work really nicely and are (I assume) quality software products.  I will note that the Europeans seem to be better and producing these kinds of works than the Yankees.')
