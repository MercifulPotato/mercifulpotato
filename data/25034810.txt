Even in a <i>close</i> state like PA, we&#x27;re going to end up talking about 45k+ votes. In MI, 100k+ votes, WI 20k+ votes, etc... All these states have mixes of R&#x2F;Ds running things, and any fraud claims quickly ends up in grand conspiracy fallacy territory.<p>This is not some 1000 vote situation like FL in 2000 (which was actually much more complicated than everyone paints it out to be).')
