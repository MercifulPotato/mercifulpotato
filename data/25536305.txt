The latest version of macOS has already crippled application firewalls, allowing Apple authorised code special privileges to bypass any firewall &#x2F; VPN to access the internet, even if the user wants to block them. Apple ARM processors further limit what OS you can run on it, even with virtualisation, without needing Apple&#x27;s permission.<p>All these criticisms are genuine and valid - that it aims to turn the macOS platform into a more closed system like ios.')
