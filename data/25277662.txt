Maybe, yes, plastics have made many things easier, but, if we can all come to the conclusion that plastics are more bad than good, then we can all get rid of it.<p>It is also likely that an alternative to plastic will come up one day(maybe it already exists). It is also likely that people figure out a way to effectively reuse used plastic(maybe it already exists). But, what about the harm that has already been done? For that, not only do we have to go out and collect thrown away plastic scrap but also figure out what to do with it. We also want people to properly segregate plastic wastes at their sources as well.')
