I&#x27;m not defending political advertising or saying it&#x27;s a good thing. Just that it exists, and people will pay Facebook for the privilege of reaching your eyeballs even if they don&#x27;t think they can get money out of you directly, if they think they can get something else out of you, like a vote. So even you&#x27;re poor financially you are still useful to advertisers because you have something to give.<p>I agree that most of the time that&#x27;s a bad thing, although it&#x27;s possible it can be used by good people trying to convince you to be good, or raise awareness of an important cause.  Probably much less frequently, but evaluating good and bad views is very subjective so I&#x27;m not going there.<p>Now perhaps all or advertising is manipulative , dishonest, and immoral. Doesn&#x27;t detractfrom my point.')
