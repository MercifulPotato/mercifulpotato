Item(by='dkersten', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608313211, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25469201, text='15 years ago, when I was in Uni, I smoked a bunch of weed and because I was smoking it and had contacts, friends who wanted some would ask me. I only ever charged them the cost price, I did not make any money from drugs, ever, but, technically, that would count as dealing at least by the laws in my country. I&#x27;d typically only have a small amount on me, but on occasion I did pick up enough for ~5 people. In aggregate, definitely enough that the police would have claimed it was far too much for personal use (nevermind that their &quot;personal use&quot; amount is always super low compared to what a moderate to heavy smoker would go through).\nEvery single one of my friends that I did this for is now an upstanding member of society, in well paying jobs paying over the average amount of taxes, some with children now. Point is, that I provided them with weed every so often had no negative effect on their lives or on society. Yet the law says it was a crime and if I had been caught it would have fucked up my life. I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s particularly fair.<p>I know that&#x27;s weed and the commenter mentioned cocaine, I&#x27;ve got friends who were in similar situation as me but with cocaine and would provide -- at no extra cost -- to friends who wanted it for parties and such. I don&#x27;t think these people were any worse than I was. Distributing to friends really shouldn&#x27;t be a big deal in my opinion.')
