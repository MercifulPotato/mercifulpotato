I&#x27;m pro-CCP on policies I agree with and anti-CCP on policies I don&#x27;t. You know... the kind of nuance reasonable people reserve for their own governments, but can&#x27;t seem to generalize outside their tribe.<p>Sino&#x27;s an unfortunate echochamber because 50k pro-China voices can&#x27;t withstand brigading of vastly numerous anti-China voices. It&#x27;s understandable to adopt siege mentality, plenty of other places soft&#x2F;hard ban pro-China opinion. Also you list a bunch of pro China views that are consistent with pro-China interests like... that&#x27;s a problem? Regardless, I don&#x27;t care much for Sino, at minimum they do good counter-propaganda work. I&#x27;m more partial to china_irl which is gated by Chinese fluency.')
