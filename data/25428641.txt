The ten men were all security guards, who were deployed to work at the Saudi Arabian embassy in Norway, according to Dagbladetâ€™s sources. But Saudi Arabia wanted the security guards to be registered as diplomats in Norway. This would give them extended room for manoeuvring in Norway.<p>This sounds like they&#x27;re amateurs, sending 10 at once. Other nations do that probably one by one to stay under the radar.')
