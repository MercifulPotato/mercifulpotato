And that being it which we part with whensoever we die, it doth manifestly appear, that it can be but a moment of time, that we then part with. For as for that which is either past or to come, a man cannot be said properly to part with it. For how should a man part with that which he hath not? ...  that life which any the longest liver, or the shortest liver parts with, is for length and duration the very same, for that only which is present, is that, which either of them can lose, as being that only which they have; for that which he hath not, no man can truly be said to lose.<p>-- Marcus Aurelius, <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;gutenberg.org&#x2F;files&#x2F;2680&#x2F;2680-h&#x2F;2680-h.htm#link2H_4_0031" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;gutenberg.org&#x2F;files&#x2F;2680&#x2F;2680-h&#x2F;2680-h.htm#link2H_4_0...</a><p>&quot;XorNot&quot; is a title inhabited by many different people over time: the person that held that title this time last year is not you, and the &quot;XorNot&quot; of today will give way tomorrow to yet another person.
