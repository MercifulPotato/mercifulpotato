If someone incorporates code I&#x27;ve open sourced into a commercial product, that takes nothing away from me or anyone else. The only permission I ever gave was for others to use some code I wrote for their own purposes. That doesn&#x27;t change if someone incorporates it into a closed source product. It&#x27;s not like someone else choosing not to open source their additions causes the original software license on the original code to disappear in a puff of smoke.')
