Check out a bunch of their articles on various topics, the more controversial the better. That way you can kind of gauge which way they lean.<p>2. Find some other source, preferably several, check out their biases they same way.<p>3. Then compare some articles about the same thing, from all these sources.<p>Look for stuff like references, sources, lack of weasel words or outrage inducing phrasing, aggrandizing vocabulary, etc. The more boring an article sounds, the more likely it is that the reporting is solid.<p>Yes, it&#x27;s a lot of work, but you don&#x27;t have to do it for every article, you do it maybe once every few years, to re-evaluate the options.')
