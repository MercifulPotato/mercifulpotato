Deep mysteries are fine and all but doing so in -1 deg celcius on an empty stomach lays out the reality of existence with exacting clarity&quot;.<p>It was more about questioning the relevance (and authenticity) of &quot;deep mysteries&quot; and &quot;existence&quot; etc. It was not about whether or not human beings can train themselves to endure such difficulties. Which they can, apparently.<p>When you said &quot;it would be a cake walk for an ascetic&quot; I thought that by ascetic you meant one who is into meditation and all such &quot;deep realities&quot;. Not Wim Hof.<p>Nevertherless, I personally don&#x27;t see any virtue in being hungry in -1 degree celsius, if I have food and a warm home. Except in case someone is making money out of it, like Wim.')
