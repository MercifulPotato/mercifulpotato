I do a lot of reporting in the Noto repo&#x27;s and it has been a mess with so many scripts fighting for attention, this new structure will surely help surface bugs and fixes in smaller scripts.<p>Google has not always given the Noto team enough resources the last few years but they have been working hard to keep up with things and hopefully this investment in the structure of the project will give it more chance of staying alive for years to come!')
