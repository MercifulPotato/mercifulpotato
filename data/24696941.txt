I did find that I sometimes got confused about where the insertion point was supposed to be, especially when backing up and correcting mistakes.  Having the letter ahead of the point highlighted in was inducing a lot of off-by-one errors in my head.  I&#x27;d prefer a normal insertion-point cursor between characters, with the correctly typed letters bolded and only the errors highlighted.<p>Besides that, it&#x27;s pretty good fun!')
