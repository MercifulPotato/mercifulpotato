I have one question: how does it work on bare metal? I tried to look for an explanation in the documentation but I couldn&#x27;t find anything. The specific questions I have are:<p>1) How does this interact with a boot loader like GRUB? Or does it come with its own boot loader? But in this case, shouldn&#x27;t this go in a specific location on the boot disk?<p>2) How does it handle io in bare metal mode? Specifically: sockets.')
