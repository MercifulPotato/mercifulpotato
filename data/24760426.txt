I strongly recommend &quot;Refactoring UI&quot; to get some fast training.<p>2. Not everybody does user testing where you sit down with new users and watch them use it. Until you&#x27;ve done that multiple times, you won&#x27;t develop a good intuition for how people approach new software. I recommend this to everyone, just do it. It&#x27;s an essential training tool as well as an essential product-development process.<p>3. Every project is driven by competing feature ideas, often in an exploratory way. Everyone has feature requests, and engineers often think in terms of exposing knobs to adjust because they want to expose the underlying power of the system. The problem is, humans have a very limited budget of concepts they can take in from a UI, and the information architecture of a UI is holistic. &quot;Just one more feature&quot; can throw the entire thing out of balance. This factor alone makes it easy to make bad UIs.')
