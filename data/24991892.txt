Item(by='fao_', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604516221, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24990564, text='&gt; Perhaps use school records with documented evidence of bullying by a third party or something.<p>That&#x27;s actually less likely to be an accurate source, because it depends on the school documenting everything, which to be quite honest, a lot of schools do not do -- I remember when I was bullied it was a literal uphill battle with the school to get them to recognize it in the first place, let alone do anything about it.<p>How much of the bullying you saw in school, was documented by a third party? I would wager zero, but I&#x27;m up for being surprised.<p>Psychology has a bag of tools, questionnaires are useful tools that fit a specific purpose and objective. They are relatively simple to create, perform, and get a lot of reasonably accurate data from them.<p>And after all, what they&#x27;re trying to assess here is the <i>impact</i> of bullying, so it doesn&#x27;t actually matter what the exact bullying act is, in this case. They&#x27;re simply trying to find a causal link between being bullied and negative behaviour.<p>I think it&#x27;s always amusing when people on hacker news think they know more about fields than, you know, people who have spent decades studying and working in that field. It says a lot about this website that it attracts folk who have no respect for other professions.')
