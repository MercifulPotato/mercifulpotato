I later used it with Expect to write a basic automated integration testing suite for the network equipment&#x27;s CLI.<p>I really disliked TCL at first because the syntax seemed so arbitrary compared to other languages.  It&#x27;s only when you realize that TCL is actually more pure than other languages that you begin to appreciate its beauty.  When the man page starts with &quot;The following [12] rules define the syntax and semantics of the Tcl language:&quot;, they mean it.  Those are the 12 rules.  They are followed exactly and in order every time.  Beyond those 12 rules, the rest is really DSL to make it look more like a normal programming language.  It&#x27;s very easy to code an entire TCL interpreter in 1000 lines of code.  By coding in such a pure style, it made me appreciate how much the quirks of other languages are fundamentally designed to help programmers and not create frustration, which is how I always experienced all the &quot;gotchas&quot; I had to debug.')
