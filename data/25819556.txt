Good!<p>Aaaand we are replacing that immediately with a similarly reductionist view (see title) with questionable backed evidence (one study by a start-up, not randomized) easily misrepresented by nutrition gurus (title image of the blog is the author) to sell his two books? Incredible!<p>We still don&#x27;t even really understand where the &quot;hungry&quot; feeling comes from, entirely. Nutrition is <i>incredibly</i> complex. It is a function of culture, genetics, neurology, society, healthcare system, medical education, funding, corporate culture, advertising, cognition, organ function, sports, mental health, environment, climate, industry regulations and probably fifty more. It would be nice if at least the scientific community move away from the idea that we just have to find <i>the</i> &quot;10 diet rules to change your life&quot; and then we win - that&#x27;s as embarrassing as it is prevalent.')
