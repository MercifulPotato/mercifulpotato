Regardless of how manufacturers sell their &quot;fully self driving cars&quot;, they are all still a &quot;hotdog&#x2F;not hotdog&quot; type intelligence and the tech is there just to <i>assist</i> the driver, not replace.<p>I don&#x27;t believe we&#x27;ll solve autonomous driving too soon without adapting the infrastructure to it rather than the other way around. At this rate we&#x27;ll have truly self driving cars (not &quot;straight line, follow the highway lane self driving&quot;) right around the time everyone starts taking most personal cars off the road to replace them with something more efficient that better suits cities of millions. But right now too many people and manufacturers are lying to themselves that self driving cars are right around the corner, and even that they&#x27;re mostly here.<p>The solution would be to fix the disinformation surrounding self driving tech and fining the hell out of any manufacturer that doesn&#x27;t make it painfully clear on every channel that the tech is very limited, mentioning also the limits of the system (e.g. types of traffic it was tested on, how many road signs it can recognize out of the total, how much of the regular driving experience do those conditions cover, how well did it do compared to an average human driver). All in &quot;human&quot; language.')
