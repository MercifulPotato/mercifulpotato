But I&#x27;ve found that just talking over the phone to be much less taxing than zoom. The fatigue is real! To the point where me and a few co-workers can just be conferenced in over the phone, and sometimes not talking for minutes at a time while working, but then collaborate at a seconds notice as if we were sharing an office again. (not that i&#x27;m advocating doing this for hours on end)<p>Also, I don&#x27;t know if this is in my head or just speaker or mic quality, or on phone&#x2F;network noise cancellation, or what, but I&#x27;ve found landline calls to be much more clear and easy to converse than zoom or cell phone calls. I think that may be where some of the fatigue comes from.')
