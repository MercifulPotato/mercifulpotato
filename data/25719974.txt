I don&#x27;t think anyone sets out to use misleading names, but it&#x27;s easy for name and code to diverge, and it&#x27;s crippling to readability.<p>However, often when refactoring&#x2F;updating such data scientist code (or even understanding), I need to break apart the long method chains, and this is much, much more annoying than dealing with crummy names.<p>At least I can print the values associated with the names, which is not easily possible in the really long method chain.')
