Especially the basic two-layer network outlined here.<p>However at least for visual perception, there is some scientific basis for convolutional neural networks having some properties to biological visual perception.  The work of Hubel and Wiesel demonstrated visual cortex activations that look very similar to the first layers of CNN kernels.<p>ref: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;knowingneurons.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;10&#x2F;29&#x2F;hubel-and-wiesel-the-neural-basis-of-visual-perception&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;knowingneurons.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;10&#x2F;29&#x2F;hubel-and-wiesel-the-n...</a>')
