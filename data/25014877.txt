It&#x27;s nice to see some validation for the idea on HN.<p>I&#x27;ve attacked the problem from a different angle though - I&#x27;ve tried to automate the service a lot more. Automatically looking for the unsubscribe button and filling out any HTML forms that appear etc. It doesn&#x27;t always work but it&#x27;s been fun trying to work out ways to automate the different steps etc.<p>If anyone is interested in a similar product with a slightly different way of doing things, different pricing and a web UI, please check out:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.stopthat.email&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.stopthat.email&#x2F;</a><p>Hopefully you don&#x27;t mind the health competition ryanmjacobs.')
