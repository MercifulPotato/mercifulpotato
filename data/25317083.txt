In the science world, there doesn&#x27;t seem to be any abstraction between backend and frotnend -- the whole thing is one intertwined mess.<p>Scientists don&#x27;t always write great software; they write scripts that get the job done quickly in a very specific way. Pair that with the lack of time that they have to wrap things in a GUI and you get a Tkinter&#x2F;Qt app that is unmaintanable.<p>I&#x27;m currently volunteering with the NZ Department of Conservation. Here is a tiny preview [0] of an app that I have just started making for them. It&#x27;s purpose is to aid scientists with processing camera trap images using machine learning. I&#x27;m building the UI using ElectronJS and Svelte, whilst the backend is a separate Python project.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;streamable.com&#x2F;0ji1ii" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;streamable.com&#x2F;0ji1ii</a>')
