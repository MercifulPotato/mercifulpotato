The economy has had trajectory altering damage. Our younger generations (aka our future and the people who will prop up our economy and nation as we get too old to and eventually leave this earth) suffer the most for something that doesn&#x27;t really endanger them statistically.<p>We&#x27;ve essentially seen a year of this now. I think I would either rather pile all the money lost from protecting &quot;democracy and freedom&quot; into inventively locking up our vulnerable in comfort and safety (e.g. commandeering the Isle of Wight or Cornwall for all I care) OR failing that, go full authoritarian akin to China to eradicate the virus.<p>The UK is an island for crying out loud...<p>This halfway house is disastrous for everyone, and we will feel the effects of it for decades, long after most the vulnerable we&#x27;re trying to protect will have passed away anyway. I&#x27;d love to believe we could pretend that we can behave like our civilised Scandinavian peers but the reality is that in the UK social trust is simply too low. During the summer and after, I knew more people breaking the rules than adhering to them. Very few people actually stick to contact tracing and even fewer places will bar you from entry for not tracing. What a joke. The UK govt has made their bed but the population are equally to blame when essentially compliance with most measures are so low.')
