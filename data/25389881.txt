I was with an ex, and we rented a room in a home across from Golden Gate park.  We cleared with the resident that we would be back around 2am, and that it would be fine.<p>At 2am, they got mad at us for making so much noise.  THEN at 6am, they start blasting some ethnic music as they proceeded to fry food for hours and party.  Turns out they were VERY Jewish and were celebrating the Sabbath being over.  Surreal.')
