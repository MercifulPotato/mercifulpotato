But they managed to get it even better. If you ignore the extra options you just rotate the digital wheel that goes in 10s increments up to (I think) 3 minutes and then to higher increments. Then you press &quot;start&quot;.<p>And the grill&#x2F;convection plus a slightly larger size should allow me to use it instead of a regular oven, at least for my limited needs. Still to be tested.')
