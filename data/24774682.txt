Item(by='andix', descendants=None, kids=[24774769], score=None, time=1602666850, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24774611, text='You&#x27;re totally right.<p>But think about a blob storage class that has two methods, ReadOneFile(), ReadMultipleFiles().<p>You have one test that just mocks ReadOneFile(string fileName) and doesn&#x27;t mock the ReadMultipleFiles(). You now change the implementation of the System Under Test (SUT) to use once the ReadMultipleFile(string[] fileNames) call instead of three times the ReadOneFile(). Now your test fails, but the implementation of the SUT is perfectly valid. You need to rewrite your test.<p>If you would use a fake, the test would stay green, without changing. The test with the fake is less specific to the implementation, and helps you better with refactoring&#x2F;changing your code.<p>And additionally in this example ReadOneFile() is called three times, and is expected to return three different results. So even your mock needs some logic to handle that.')
