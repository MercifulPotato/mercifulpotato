They need a lot of cash to sign licensing deals with the sort of big ticket artists that attract the numbers of mainstream customers they need to have that amount of cash. They have carved themselves out a nice niche as an artist-friendly music store, but their path towards competing with companies like Apple for the mainstream is about as uphill as it gets. Bandcamp isn&#x27;t exactly a streaming service, but it&#x27;s the same battle to be fought.')
