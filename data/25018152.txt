The rest I filled in with Sugru I believe. I really don&#x27;t remember if that was before or after I saw someone on Geekhack do the same. Those were terrific keyboards, I still have at least one (modified, but in a different way) in storage.<p>The Matias has volume keys, but they are on the F10, F11, and F12 keys when pressed with the Fn key. But the new version of the Matias can be reprogrammed, so the otherwise useless Undo&#x2F;Cut&#x2F;Copy&#x2F;Paste keys can be made into volume keys.')
