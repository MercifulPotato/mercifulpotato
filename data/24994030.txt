Twitter is packed with people apparently saying that it&#x27;s impossible for PA to swing from Trump to Biden just by counting the postal votes, or that counting postal votes after the polls close is cheating, or that the postal votes were made up, or that the polling station votes are untrustworthy because there&#x27;s no need to prove ID, or that polling stations were closed, or that the whole system is illegitimate if voting is not a public holiday, or not mandatory, or not proportional representation and no electoral college.<p>Again, whichever outcome, USA is going to have half a country that doesn&#x27;t like or trust the election results. Not the voting booth ones, not the mail-in ones, not the popular vote, not the official result or the &quot;official&quot; result.<p>Seems to me that if people trust the leadership, they would trust the voting system endorsed by the leadership, not the other way round.')
