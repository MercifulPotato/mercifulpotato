Item(by='mrtksn', descendants=None, kids=[25960798], score=None, time=1611945683, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25960469, text='5.4.<p><i>manufacturing sites</i>.\nAstraZeneca shall use its Best Reasonable Efforts to manufacture the Vaccine at manufacturing sites located within EU(which, for the purpose of this Section 5.4 only shall include the United Kingodm) and may manufacture the Vaccine in non-EU facilities if appropriate, to accelerate supply of the Vaccine  in  Europe; provided,  that  AstraZeneca  shall  provide  prior  written  notice  of such  non-EU  manufacturing  facilities  to  the  Commission  which  shall  include  an explanation   for   such   determination   to   use   non-EU   manufacturing   facilities.      If AstraZeneca  is  unable  to  deliver  on  its  intention  to  manufacture  the  Initial  Europe Doses and&#x2F;or Optional Doses  under this Agreement in the EU, the Commission or the Participating Member States may present to AstraZeneca, CMOs within the EU capable of  manufacturing  the  Vaccine  Doses,  and  AstraZeneca  shall  use  its  Best  Reasonable Efforts  to  contract  with  such  proposed  CMOs  to  increase  the  available  manufacturing capacity within the EU. The manufacturing site planning is set out in Schedule A.<p>Probably needs a lawyer specialised in this stuff and the jurisdiction where the contract is signed, but it seems like this is the part that EU says the contract included the UK facilities.<p>Anyway, whatever happens people of Europe wont forget this, even if it was purely EU&#x27;s fault. You don&#x27;t say you belong to a team, omit the vaccines of China and Russia and then be let to die off  because the rest of the team says you should have signed better contract. Next time something important comes up, EU should think beyond the UK&#x2F;USA.')
