(If something is wrong with your service they&#x27;ll likely blame your equipment)<p>Doesn&#x27;t cost any more to turn off data metering on your own modem, it&#x27;s just an incentive to kill the market of people having their own (often better) modems which otherwise would cost less in the long term.<p>I suspect it&#x27;s just so they have a higher chance of padding their &quot;xfinitywifi&quot; network spamming more than anything.')
