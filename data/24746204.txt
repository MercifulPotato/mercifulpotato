It&#x27;s like &quot;what about the roads&quot; but for firearms policy.  I&#x27;ve actually thought pretty hard about it, but no, I don&#x27;t think so, and I believe my reason is consistent with the ideology I expressed above.  The issue with nukes is that it&#x27;s simply not possible to detonate one without causing collateral damage.  Fallout, radiation poisoning, etc.  So the government can in fact act to keep these externalities from harming others.')
