Ford, GM, Chrysler&#x2F;Mitsubishi set up. From that we got a local industry and poor quality, expensive cars. Tariff barriers were removed, GM shut down local production. Is that a good thing now Toyotas are cheaper? Opinions vary. Were the jobs working for GM that were lost made up elsewhere as s result of the end of the tariffs? You guessed it, opinions vary.<p>Google don&#x27;t pay meaningful tax in Australia so it&#x27;s hard to like them here.')
