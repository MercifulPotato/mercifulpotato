Businesses see that sort of thing as normal and expect you&#x27;ll just call the registrar and have it sorted it out.<p>I absolutely cringe at how easy it&#x27;s always been for me, but I likewise think anything like you&#x27;ve described would be just end up with an awful lot of businesses locked out of their domains.')
