Item(by='BadInformatics', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607795338, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25399490, text='I used to, but switched to <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;asvetliakov&#x2F;vscode-neovim" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;asvetliakov&#x2F;vscode-neovim</a>. It&#x27;s much faster, doesn&#x27;t lag the editor at all and has less of an impedance mismatch because it uses Neovim under the hood instead of trying to emulate functionality from scratch.<p>There are a few reasons why I use a vim plugin instead of vim proper for most day-day work:<p>1. I do plenty of data science-y stuff that requires support for good visuals. Vim&#x27;s support here is pretty lackluster and Jupyter&#x27;s Vim mode sucks. VS Code has a great interactive mode with full autocomplete and a dedicated window that records plots&#x2F;output history.<p>2. Language servers and LSP plugins are so much easier to manage. I rarely if ever have to babysit updates and I don&#x27;t have to install a bunch of system-wide dependencies to get certain ones to build.<p>3. Making the above (and all other fancy VS Code functionality) work on multiple remote machines is a breeze. The normal Vim workflow would require cloning dotfiles (not a big deal), running setup with something like GNU Stow (almost never installed) and then futzing around with LSP plugins as in 2).<p>4. Built-in rendering of rich docstrings&#x2F;doc pages (think Markdown, Sphinx RST). I want to say certain extensions&#x2F;languages support LaTeX as well, which would be a bear to read in Vim.')
