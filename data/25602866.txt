As for Apple, you do it a lot.  I&#x27;d rather take rare and abysmal interactions than constant, annoying ones.<p>I&#x27;ve had numerous app rejections because of reviewers simply incapable of reading instructions, and it&#x27;s immensely frustrating. Especially when important hotfixes etc. is put on hold for days for no reason whatsoever.<p>Instruction: Do NOT tap button X to log in, instead use method Z.<p>Rejection: Tapped button X, could not log in. Your app is broken.<p>Welp, time to resubmit and wait for a couple of days to possibly get the same rejection again.<p>EDIT: To clarify, the login procedure is different and simplified for test accounts, such as the ones reviewers are using. Real users need to identify with real ID for (valid) reasons.')
