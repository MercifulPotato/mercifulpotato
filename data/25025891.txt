I wouldn&#x27;t like it if someone applying to our company showed us their current&#x2F;previous employer&#x27;s IP. That would be like someone showing nudes of their current&#x2F;former partners to &quot;prsospective&quot; partners. It just does not compute, unless if the context were precisely about that. A lot of this is based on trust in my opinion.<p>&gt;<i>Another example would be a current malicious employee who posts code snippets of your super custom trading algo to github as part of his next job search or while trying to land a contracting deal?</i><p>Ask them not to. Also, non disclosure agreements and contract clauses. Most people just don&#x27;t do that.<p>You&#x27;re listing some of the worst behavior that is not &quot;normal&quot; or &quot;typical&quot;. NDAs and contracts. It helps to hire better, improve work conditions, and be a better organizations [not doing unethical stuff that pushes employees to rationalize doing this, and others to think you deserve it].')
