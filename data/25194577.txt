A M.2 PCIe SSD that only uses two PCIe lanes will fit into any socket designed for M.2 SATA or M.2 PCIe SSDs, without damage.<p>The only way to run into trouble is to force a M.2 PCIe SSD keyed for four lanes of PCIe into a M.2 socket keyed for SATA only with no PCIe lanes. Forcing this requires you to install the drive upside down and overcome the 0.5mm misalignment of the 1.2mm wide notch in the drive (meant to be filled by a 1.1mm key in the slot).<p>If you merely install a SATA SSD in a slot only wired for PCIe, or a PCIe x2 SSD into a slot only wired for SATA, the drive will fail to work but nothing will be damaged.<p>(You could theoretically also end up in trouble by forcing a SATA or PCIe x2 M.2 SSD into an appropriate slot, but upside down. However, this requires considerably more stupidity on the part of the user because in this scenario the SSD has two notches in the connector, so it is fairly obvious that any mechanical difficulty with installation could be due to having the card upside down. When installing a drive with only one notch, it&#x27;s less obvious that the difficulty arises from a fundamental and intentional incompatibility.)')
