There&#x27;s the input data and there&#x27;s the model generated from input data.<p>If you are looking for a model that is expected to represent a property intrinsic to a specific community then you use data collected from that community to generate that model.  That&#x27;s it.<p>Models generalize, and reflect the norm.  They are like that by design.  That&#x27;s their point.<p>If your plan is to have a model that does not reflect the input data but instead forces your biases regardless of the input data then your goal is not to model reality but to distort it to comply with your personal goals.')
