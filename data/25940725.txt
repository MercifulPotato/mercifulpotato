You get people to invest in a stock that is expected by the industry to go belly up.<p>A lot of the people involved aren&#x27;t just buying and holding. They&#x27;re specifically buying&#x2F;selling short dated out of the money options in order to move the price. Some understand the market microstructure and the various levers they have to make the price move using what is effectively leverage.<p>&gt; Seriously. It&#x27;s that easy. It&#x27;s not illegal.<p>Finance is highly regulated and arbitrarily so. If you think the lawmakers and regulators will throw their hands up and say geez, it&#x27;s technically legal, carry on, you&#x27;re sorely mistaken.<p>Ideally finance is meant to be about allocation of capital. If a market is allocating capital to a dying company just because meme, then the market isn&#x27;t serving its purpose. I don&#x27;t see how this is different than what is constantly being criticized such as flash crashes, contagion and large moves based on rumors, other than the group benefiting (fiscally irresponsible internet strangers vs fiscally irresponsible professionals)<p>I know, hedge funds bad, and they do this crap all the time. That may be true, but this isn&#x27;t going to end well for the average consumer. My prediction is reddit will shutdown wsb because that&#x27;s what reddit does. And there will be more laws made targeting individuals engaging in this sort of activity (basically coordinating with groups of people). This may hurt newsletters and other financial venues. The large hedge funds will be fine, we might see a few bailouts, and life will go on.')
