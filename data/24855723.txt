America used to stand for quality and ingenuity - american tools, cars, or even just methods of work and production were world class and many countries strived to copy them, import them, buy them. Nowadays America has turned into a playground for the rich, with American products generally considered sub-par, with systems and methods being studied as how to &quot;not&quot; do things, and generally settling into a position of a global player who only has to be respected because it&#x27;s wealthy, not because it is actually a leader in anything other than wealth extraction.<p>To put it in a different way - America is falling down in almost every metric that measures quality of life globally. But yeah, they built Facebook and Apple, and Apple is one of it not the wealthiest companies in the world, so that counts for something, yeah?')
