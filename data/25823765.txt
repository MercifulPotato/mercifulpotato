I was honestly hoping it was gone forever. I&#x27;ve never eaten so healthily in my life. It&#x27;s really easy to not eat garbage when everything tastes the same anyways. The sadness of not being able to taste cheeseburgers again was completely offset by the lack of desire to eat cheeseburgers anymore. If anything, the biggest issue is that b&#x2F;c eating felt like a chore, the first few days I grossly under-ate (&lt; 1000 calories).<p>Strangely enough I could still smell, and as the author points out, smell is an important danger indicator, so I would definitely be more frustrated losing that.')
