I’m not sure what’s new about this one.<p>In general these processes are energy intensive because they involve temperatures high enough to melt rock. On the Earth that is difficult to achieve because you need to keep the furnace hot. On the Moon with its hard vacuum, a large chunk of rock moved onto insulating material doesn’t radiate much heat. So all you’d need, really, is a large parabolic mirror. The Sun is your power source.')
