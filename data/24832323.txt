Item(by='bigiain', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603150769, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24831485, text='&gt; Many of the security design flaws in signal have had little to no direct impact on usability.<p>By far the biggest complaint I read about Signal is &quot;It uses phone numbers, and I don&#x27;t like that&quot;. While I agree that I&#x27;d prefer to be able to make up my own unique&#x2F;random identifier, there&#x27;s absolutely no doubt in my mind that the downside of phone numbers was far far outweighed by the benefits of usability. Most of my friends use Signal, I seriously doubt I&#x27;d have been able to help make that come true if the contact discovery features - along with their  side channel privacy leaks - didn&#x27;t work as well as they do. In retrospect, if I were trying to kickstart a global-scale network of secure messenger users - I&#x27;d make exactly the same choice today as Moxie did back then.<p>&gt; users aren&#x27;t effectively notified that the contacts keys have changed<p>That&#x27;s just not true. Its become a running joke amongst my friends that Signal Safety Numbers changing is how we know when people broke or upgraded their phones.')
