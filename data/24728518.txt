Especially in East Germany. That&#x27;s not the reason why they teared the wall down.<p>I beg you thing otherwise. I spent my first 5 years of life, 1990-1995, with my mother shuttling in between a country which I would rather not name, and Russia, where my father lived until she was able to secure Russian citizenship, and a Russian birth certificate for me.<p>People in early nineties Russia were going crazy from all novelties they saw for the first time in their lives. Either in 1995, or in 1996, the first Western (actually South Korean) supermarket in the town was JAMPACKED with people for months after opening despite it being quite a huge \nwarehouse store style supermarket, and very far away from the city. People were making reservations to get into it.<p>On the other hand, people previously in position of social prominence, affluence, and power were in a such deep shock for years on end, that some very literally died from starvation because they didn&#x27;t know how the money are supposed to be earned from something that is not a government.')
