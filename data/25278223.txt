That said, I suspect I just burned heavily on the xhmtl fiasco.  Combined with how much has been added to CSS, I would more expect that pages made years ago would just violate so many current best practices that are practically required practices.<p>I also favor more direct use of fixed positioning.  The rube goldberg machine people make in order to get their squares where they want is borderline crazy.<p>Edit: And, I should say that I agree on the tooling point.  I don&#x27;t see any technical reason it should be hard to make a web page.  Getting my kids to create 3 files to get started, though, is less than promising. :D')
