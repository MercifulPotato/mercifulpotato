It would be naive to believe even those that value truth highest are without bias, but it would not be naive to conclude that we are better off trying to combat polarization, and avoid simplifying our labels into &quot;us vs. them&quot;, &quot;right vs. wrong&quot;, &quot;fact vs. fiction&quot; because these labels are too simple, too broad, and ultimately inaccurate.<p>I do believe that the arguing, the battle... it&#x27;s a distraction, in a sense. It&#x27;s an amplifier. It&#x27;s a self-reinforcing polarization engine.<p>Maybe I&#x27;m just saying what you said, but I think it&#x27;s important to break down the concept of &quot;two sides&quot; if you want to have any hope of finding common ground.<p>How many of you (in the U.S. if not abroad) want the best for the United States? Who among us want it to be a strong nation full of employed, educated, healthy citizens? Who wants to revisit the tenants of our founding fathers, learn lessons from the past while being willing to try new things and accept changes? Who wants this stark divide to be behind us?<p>Who wants to deescalate from violent rhetoric and focus on proven methods of finding and sharing truth?')
