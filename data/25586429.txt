Instead of having one employee who goes where the truck goes, you&#x27;d have employees who reside in or near shipping destinations and meet up with the trucks for loading&#x2F;unloading&#x2F;fueling&#x2F;maintenance&#x2F;etc. On the one hand a given number of employees could service many more trucks along a single route, decreasing labor requirements, but at the same time covering large numbers of routes may take more people, or companies may focus on a narrower set of routes, offering more opportunities for smaller shipping companies. Odds are the number of people doing truck-driving related work would stay roughly the same, but the total volume of shipping would go up.')
