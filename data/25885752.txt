Kavanaugh was fairly and democratically appointed. The number of participants in that riot was more than double this recent one. There was no justification for it.<p>Your claims about biased policing are also false - the allegations of bias in police killing doesn’t normalize for the amount of crime perpetrated by each group, which obviously means that those criminals place themselves at increased risk because they are more likely to engage with the police. It doesn’t adjust for the fact that almost all people killed by the police were engaging in a crime actively at the time, refusing police orders, and placing the police in danger. It doesn’t account for those who resist arrest versus those who don’t. There are exceptions, and actual incidents of unjust or incorrect policing, but they are incredibly rare. This entire narrative is built on hyperbole and lies like “Hands up Don’t Shoot” (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;blogs&#x2F;post-partisan&#x2F;wp&#x2F;2015&#x2F;03&#x2F;16&#x2F;lesson-learned-from-the-shooting-of-michael-brown&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;blogs&#x2F;post-partisan&#x2F;wp&#x2F;2015&#x2F;0...</a>).<p>You’re explicitly arguing for different laws for different people even though they are all breaking the law as it is written. You believe your causes are completely just and the other side’s causes are unjust - in other words you believe you’re above the law. This unequal application of laws amounts to not believing in the rule of law, fundamentally. And if that’s what you believe in why bother having one country? Why should the political center or political right be part of a “union” that denies them basic justice?')
