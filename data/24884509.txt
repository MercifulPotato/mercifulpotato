Item(by='bsder', descendants=None, kids=[24884549], score=None, time=1603611484, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24884457, text='Recurrent infection is rare, but you <i>cannot</i> make that jump from the rarity to say 100%.<p>1) Reinfection rarity decreases with time and we are barely 6 months into this mess--that&#x27;s much less than a &quot;cold season&quot; which is known to reinfect.  You are betting against a known Bayesian prior (other coronavirii families reinfect with a small but not irrelevant percentage) with <i>no evidence to support your statement</i>.<p>2) &quot;Confirmed reinfection&quot; has to pass an incredibly high bar.  You have to have two symptomatic infection events, <i>AND</i> both infections have to have been sequenced <i>AND</i> the sequences have to be sufficiently different to differentiate from never having cleared the virus.  Reinfection would normally be with a virus that is almost exactly the same.<p>So, reinfection being rare could be that it&#x27;s amazingly rare.  <i>OR</i> it could be that it&#x27;s only somewhat uncommon but we don&#x27;t have enough events with sequencing data to confirm.<p>The low Bayesian prior of rareness means we shouldn&#x27;t panic about reinfection, but it doesn&#x27;t imply that we can just ignore it, either.')
