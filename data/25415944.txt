As we recruit activists with quality in mind, the main intention of this activism is not to persuade large sections of the population to join us but rather to ensure they have a positive image of the Resistance Movement and National Socialism so they will vote for us or support us on the day we lay claim to power in the Nordics.</i><p>LOL!')
