There&#x27;s no notion of transmitting negative rank because of course that would be horribly abused by competitors trying to sink each others sites.<p>I think the web is pretty good as a decentralised systems for ideas. A lot of basic stuff isn&#x27;t exploited though. For instance a simple way to set up networks of caching proxies and point browsers towards them, so sites can survive ddos attacks and be fully anonymised would be good. CDNs like cloudflare provide that today but tools for smaller scale equivalents would be great.')
