Item(by='AnimalMuppet', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604356034, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24973260, text='&gt; An engineer might make more or less than someone else on their team, but they both make multitudes more than the people assembling beams for an apartment building.<p>That is, an engineer produces more <i>of what society values</i> than an assembler does.<p>And why does society value it more?  Scarcity.  More people can assemble beams than can do solid engineering.<p>You can say that society isn&#x27;t valuing the right things.  That might be a defensible position.  But in general, attempts to &quot;fix&quot; that problem run into the problem that the fixers don&#x27;t know enough.  The results are sub-optimal - not just theoretically, but in very concrete ways.<p>But even if you put everyone on roughly equivalent wages... the people who enter YC aren&#x27;t doing it because the wages are higher.  They&#x27;re trying, with a very small number of people, to build something useful to many people.  That&#x27;s productivity.  Why do they do it?  Somewhat because they believe in what they&#x27;re trying to do, but also because they see it as a chance to make a lot of money.  They&#x27;re not doing it by owning property.  They&#x27;re not inheriting it.  They&#x27;re making it by building something.<p>Now, are you going to let them become inequal?  Or not?')
