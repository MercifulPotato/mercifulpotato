Yes, he didn&#x27;t really try to make a working device (WTF is that obsession with gears? Notice only the last 3 designs have anything to do with molecular construction? Somewhere on his site he explains those 3 came from a student, while he was focusing on the gears.) and was much more prolific as a sci-fi author than a scientist. That doesn&#x27;t mean that the idea can not be implemented.')
