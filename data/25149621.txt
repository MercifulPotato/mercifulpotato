I&#x27;m curious why they would be making moves to avoid an anti-trust lawsuit on the one hand with its scaling back of using AMP; while on the other hand, they seem to be actively using their monopoly with YT to generate ad revenue by forcing it on the content creators.<p>This puts a lot of people in a bad situation. There&#x27;s no real recourse because the platform has so many users dependent on it, and its not easy to simply yank all of your content and go to another platform.
