Item(by='claudiawerner', descendants=None, kids=[25561851], score=None, time=1609170299, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25559566, text='&gt;No, it isn&#x27;t the &quot;curation process&quot;. As always, the labor theory of value is complete bunk. The same process used to collect samples on Earth will not create the same value in the samples.<p>This has nothing to do with the labour theory of value (since asteroid material is very much a one-off item, and certainly not a reproducible commodity sold in a capitalist market), but even if it did, you&#x27;re misunderstanding it. The theory does not state that any item with human labour taken to produce it gives it a price corresponding to that value. Instead, the theory states that this is the case if and only if the good is also a bearer of a use-value - i.e. it is of some use to the market.')
