In other words, that means that in your example, you hadn&#x27;t merely declined to say it works in a car, but you had in fact already said &quot;I guarantee NOTHING about this oil filter; it comes with absolutely NO WARRANTIES&quot;, and yet someone would&#x27;ve <i>still</i> called you up and said &quot;<i>despite all your disclaimers</i> you <i>still</i> have an implied warranty because you didn&#x27;t disclaim it explicitly&quot;... which is far less obvious than what you wrote.')
