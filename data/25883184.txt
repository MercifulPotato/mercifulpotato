By the time I respond to your &quot;hi&quot;, you might now be in a meeting (or it might be before your working hours, the next day). Finally you ask the question, and I respond the next time I&#x27;m available. This could easily cause a question that takes 30 seconds to answer to have 24 hours of latency.<p>Or I might be busy doing something else or talking to someone else. Waiting for me to respond to &quot;hi&quot; is basically demanding real-time access to my focus. I don&#x27;t have the capacity to always have live conversations with everyone who wants one. Just posting a (complete, thought-out) question allows me to devote just a short window of focus, and do so only when I have that focus to spare.')
