We can predictably flip an object to the other side with a light toss, not to mention flip a pancake.<p>If you flip a coin through the air so that it rapidly rotates (say more than 15-20 times) before being caught, that seems like it would erase the bias.<p>If there isn&#x27;t decent spin, then &quot;all bets are off&quot; (quite literally).<p>As a matter of procedure, there should be a rule: the coin tosser must place the coin onto index finger, which is coiled around the thumb, such that just the edge of the coin is struck from below by the thumbnail, when the thumb is flicked, sending the coin upward in rapid rotation. There should be additional rules that the coin should attain a height of at least one head height above the top of the tosser&#x27;s head, or something of the sort.')
