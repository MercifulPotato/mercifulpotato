All of GAAFM rely on ML at scale at this point for a large subset of their products.<p>It&#x27;s just that these results are also EXTREMELY unevenly distributed - and good luck breaking into anything that can use applied ML and not get crushed by GAAFM.<p>However I agree with your point here:<p>&gt;If an executive or similar is talking about &quot;AI&quot; or &quot;Machine Learning&quot; without the ability to identify specific use cases that they&#x27;re hoping to implement, then that is a huge red flag.<p>So it&#x27;s not as simple as &quot;AI is Hype&quot; - it&#x27;s not hype - it&#x27;s just that most organizations will struggle to actually implement it because all the data&#x2F;talent&#x2F;compute etc... sits in GAAFM.')
