You seem very familiar with asian languages deeper than just a native speaker&#x2F;hobbyist might be.<p>I thought recording 6 was vaguely mandarin sounding, if you squinted you could more or less guess what was being said. Agreed that the rest are hard to understand but I don&#x27;t think it takes native mandarin speakers much effort to get to a point where they can get proficient in another dialect. IMO learning Shanghainese from Mandarin will be easier than learning Portuguese if you speak Spanish')
