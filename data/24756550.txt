The only way these IP addresses are getting efficiently used (now) is there is an actual value and market for IPv4.<p>AWS charges $1&#x2F;month or $12&#x2F;year to sit on an IP address unused. This price &#x2F; value pressure has freed up a TON of address space and pushed down pricing signals on a lot of ipv4 usage (ie, you can say is it worth $300M to buy a class A or maybe we should spend $200M to get IPv6 going.')
