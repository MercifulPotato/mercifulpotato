But no one should be forced to write&#x2F;design&#x2F;create something which they don&#x27;t want to.<p>I agree with this distinction (no compelled creative labor), but note that this leaves stuff like file hosting, DNS services and data centers squarely on the &quot;off the shelf&quot; side. And you would still be forced to bake a cake for an out-and-loud Nazi. Just not decorate it with an artful &quot;1488 blaze it&quot;.')
