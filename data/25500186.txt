Take a look at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.snebu.com&#x2F;tarcrypt.html for a description of how the tar based encryption filter is implemented.  Current release of Snebu is 1.1pre1, since this has also had a major refactoring (clean up) of the code.  Therefore will need to perform additional volume testing before marking the release as final.')
