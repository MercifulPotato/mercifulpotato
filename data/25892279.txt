It sometimes seems like a good idea to have this &quot;magic&quot; component which automates everything and takes care of all the hard stuff, but in practice it creates a whole host of problems.<p>For instance, maybe it works at first, and then your requirements change in a way that doesn&#x27;t fit the abstraction.  Now you can&#x27;t make local changes, you&#x27;ve got to change this super complicated abstraction layer, and suddenly it requires changes all over the place in completely unrelated components, because you had to add an argument to `super_general_magic_function_that_is_used_everywhere()`.<p>Also things like this tend to make code super hard to trace.  Instead of stepping through your functions, now all your tasks are running through some generic scheduler or something, which is there because somebody had the idea that if you ever need to run your code on a Hadoop cluster this would help, even though your code has only ever been run on a Raspberry Pi.')
