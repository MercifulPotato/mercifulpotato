It will just become even more of a luxury than it already is.<p>When autonomous vehicles halve the cost of an Uber&#x2F;Lyft journey, many more people will weigh up the costs&#x2F;benefits of private vehicle ownership and decide it’s not for them.<p>Different services will compete based in part on the luxuriousness of the interiors and the frequency at which they are cleaned.<p>As private vehicle ownership becomes rarer, so to will parking, particularly on-street parking. People will look back and think it odd that we dedicated vast public spaces to the storage of private property.<p>Finally, as private vehicle owners become a minority group, they will become an easy target for  even more punitive taxation and regulations which will see the group shrink even further still.')
