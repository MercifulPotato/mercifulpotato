Tons of officials made in hindsight ridiculous claims like masks being more effective than vaccines, as well as many statements along the lines that if only more people wore masks, that&#x27;d be enough to put an end to the pandemic.<p>Promoting Vitamin D now would likely result in a mixture of unwarranted hype over its effectiveness, angry questions as to why this wasn&#x27;t recommended sooner, and people pointing out how counterproductive stay-at-home orders were in terms of getting Vitamin D from the sun. It&#x27;s a big political risk to take.<p>&gt; It makes me skeptical and quite cynical of their competency.<p>I don&#x27;t mean to either agree with or question you. But I hope the above adds context.')
