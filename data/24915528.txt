Isn&#x27;t this just a lot of scheduled CPU work trying to run concurrently when it would be faster if queued? Fast NVMe IO, or the fact that the queries are a few ms each, are just factors that makes the workload more CPU intensive (vs IO bound), the scenario would be more plausible if you had slow disks :)<p>I guess being bottlenecked by the network can be one scenario if your DB and app aren&#x27;t close and&#x2F;or your queries involve bulk data like GIS shapes...')
