But must runs of the game of life are not oscillators or spaceships, just like most proteins are useless.<p>That&#x27;s why the &quot;initial condition&quot; is so important, and why DNA is so important: without a good &quot;start state&quot;, you get useless resultsâ€”just like in the game of life.<p>What we are trying to find is not Conway&#x27;s rules for the game of life, but this: how do we produce useful <i>starting states</i> (DNA) with a physical system? And more importantly, <i>how do we create those starting states preferentially</i> (i.e. non-randomly)?<p>We still need a model for how <i>useful</i> DNA (which corresponds to the &quot;initial state&quot; in the game of life) gets created. And we have no model for that right now, other than assuming unique random initial states are continually occurring and letting the law of large numbers eventually &quot;find&quot; winners.')
