Most things Tesla does are extremely polarizing and to no ones surprise yoke steering wheel is no exception. Most ridiculous part of the situation is that we have 0 information on how that thing works. All we have to go off are looks. Some people love them and others make a bunch of assumptions so they can criticize it. Given Tesla&#x27;s track record I will remain cautiously optimistic, but in absolute worst case scenario we are putting racing steering wheels on highest end sport cars... sounds absolutely dreadful doesn&#x27;t it?<p>edit: typoed.')
