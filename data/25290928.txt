That&#x27;s why we had bank runs: people thought their money would be safer under their mattress, and preferred to own physical currency rather than numbers in a bank&#x27;s ledger.  The only reason holding USD is a bad investment is because inflation is basically guaranteed: you <i>know</i> that a dollar will be worth less tomorrow than it will be today, because the authorities that control the dollar say so.  Not so with Bitcoin: the total supply is fixed at 21M, forever, and there&#x27;s no central authority with the power to change that.')
