[1]<p>Basically, the judge sentenced him for a crime that he wasn&#x27;t convicted of (murder-for-hire): &#x27;When she [the judge] gave him double life plus 40 years, she said the &quot;murders significantly justified the life sentence.&quot;&#x27;<p>The most heartbreaking part of the story is the letter Ross read to the judge before sentencing:<p>&quot;If you find my conviction warrants a sentence that allows for my eventual release, I will not lose my love for humanity during my years of imprisonment, . . .<p>I will do what I can to make up for not being there for the people I love, and to make the world a better place.<p>Even now I understand what a terrible mistake I made...\nI know you must take away my middle years, but please leave me my old age. Please leave a small light at the end of the tunnel ... a chance to redeem myself in the free world before I meet my maker.&quot;<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;jchervinsky&#x2F;status&#x2F;1025008589080080384" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;jchervinsky&#x2F;status&#x2F;1025008589080080384</a>')
