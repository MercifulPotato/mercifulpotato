Item(by='xeeeeeeeeeeenu', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606409267, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25221206, text='&gt;Perl will go about it the exact same way.<p>No, Perl is completely different and IMO it&#x27;s the only mainstream dynamically typed language that has sane comparison operators.<p>Perl has two sets of operators, numeric (==, +, *, &lt;, &gt;, &lt;=&gt; etc.) and stringwise (eq, ., lt, gt, cmp etc.). You can think of them as explicit (but concise) casts. For example, Perl&#x27;s $foo eq $bar is roughly equivalent to Python&#x27;s str(foo) == str(bar).<p>It is true that &quot;foobar&quot; == 0 returns true in Perl but, as I showed above, it does that for a completely different reason.')
