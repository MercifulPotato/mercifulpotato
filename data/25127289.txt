When traveling to a new place, I don&#x27;t know what to look up to find whole-place rentals in the area and Airbnb is a default to finding what&#x27;s in the area. In that way, Airbnb&#x27;s value is in its listing&#x2F;&quot;aggregation&quot; platform, not necessarily the listings themselves. After all, there&#x27;s very little to stop a competitor from cloning Airbnb&#x27;s model (and those clones <i>do</i> exist).<p>Personally, while I default to Airbnb&#x27;s for finding stays when I travel, I&#x27;ve found myself gravitating back towards hotels as of late because they were generally better value propositions for what I was looking for.')
