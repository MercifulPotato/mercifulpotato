People will surely try and no doubt some will succeed, but the argument approach is more likely to cause them to strengthen their anti-vaccination position than to change it.<p>The only way to reliably win is not to argue. Be clear that it matters to you, politely refuse to respond to barbs and baits, walk away rather than settle for their presence, deny them participation in your life, and ask them if their position has changed on a regular basis.<p>If you can construct a rational&#x2F;logical argument method that is generally and widely effective, you can cure anti-vaxxers and anti-maxxers, and a whole lot of other societal ills. I support any such effort but after a couple decades Iâ€™ve gotten nowhere.')
