I bought a DVD set on how to do modeling and texturing in 3D Studio Max from the Gnomon School. It was amazing. Film level quality secrets and techniques. I got pretty good. This lead me down a rabbit hole of how do I take this and apply it towards games. 3D modeling and texturing for games. Then I started working on coding and realized that OpenGL&#x2F;DirectX used similar concepts to what I learned in 3D studio max. Thereâ€™s a scene, a camera, a mesh, a light, materials, textures, shaders (SM1.0), and all these things combined give you your lit scene using some advanced but cookie-cutter math.')
