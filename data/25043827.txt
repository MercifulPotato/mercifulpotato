I&#x27;ve slaughtered plenty of animals myself (though never a cow, to be honest).<p>I&#x27;m not looking away and pretending it doesn&#x27;t exist. I&#x27;m staring at it and saying &quot;yes I approve of that because I like to eat animals&quot;.<p>If your argument is that intensive farming is less than ideal, sure, I agree. If your argument is that the solution to that is to stop eating meat, that&#x27;s where you lose me.')
