Government controlled or moderated media would be devoid of agenda? I also don&#x27;t see how capitalism is to blame, we are already seeing new social media platforms emerge pandering to the other side of the partisan spectrum. At the end of the day, YouTube and their ilk have executive decision making over the content they surface. I don&#x27;t believe they should be beholden to some &#x27;higher&#x27; journalistic ideals around objectivity. As a consumer if I&#x27;m not happy with their policies (extending well beyond content moderation), I&#x27;m obliged to go elsewhere. Whether this drives further polarisation or results in the creation of fringe or radicalised groups is actually besides the point.')
