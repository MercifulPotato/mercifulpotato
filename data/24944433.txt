I always feel bad for Hardware startups who go through crowdfunding services like Kickstarter. They almost always underestimate the cost of development of the final product, while at the same time giving (deep) discounts on that final product to early backers. In this way, they build up a huge amount liability because they burn through the Kickstarter cash real quick.')
