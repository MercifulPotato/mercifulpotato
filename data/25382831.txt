Could the rich vocabulary of the Inuit inspire us to redefine our relationship with nature?</i><p>No, it doesn&#x27;t work that way, because the strong version of the hypothesis is essentially disproven (in geek terms, all natural languages are &quot;Turing-complete&quot; and can be used to express anything) and evidence even for the weak version is, well, weak.  Correlation does not imply causation, and Western culture won&#x27;t change if we import a few more Inuit words into it.')
