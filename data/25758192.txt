It was PACKED. The park is absolutely beautiful and everyone should check it out sometime. It&#x27;s an almost alien landscape.<p>My hotel was full as well in Palm Springs. The only thin open late and popping was the Indian casino. They did check temps and make sure people had masks, but otherwise it felt like Vegas on a normal busy weekend.')
