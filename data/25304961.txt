Directors can&#x27;t even touch the lights without an Official Light Mover Union member doing it. If they do, all union people will just walk off set and that&#x27;s the end of it.<p>In most European countries unions are more about collectively agreeing to some basic rules like wage, hours worked and other compensations.')
