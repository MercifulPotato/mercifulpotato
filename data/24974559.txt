In order to hire people remotely across Europe we need to adapt compensation rates based on where you&#x27;re located. However, if you apply from Switzerland you&#x27;re probably competing with candidates from countries where the asking rate is lower, so that may be a disadvantage if everything else is &quot;equal&quot;.<p>Please email us at careers@fr24.com if you want to clarify your individual situation before applying. Alternatively you can apply via the link and put this question in the &quot;cover letter&quot;.<p>Regarding the financial number that you reference it&#x27;s unfortunately not quite accurate. The employee count in the annual report only includes employees in our Swedish company. Remote staff in other countries work with us as invoicing contractors and do not get counted as employees within the context of an annual report.')
