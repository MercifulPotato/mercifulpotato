We shouldn&#x27;t have &quot;under water basket weaving&quot; type courses because there is no market for that.  There is some need for art, but only in the context of art is useful to make better marketing materials, so the degree should be offered by the business school in context of marketing courses. History is useful to make you a well rounded critical thinker, but if you are going for a history degree it should be sponsored by the school that will eventually give you tenure as a professor.<p>If you just want to make yourself better: art is very interesting as a subject. Have fun learning it. Likewise history is interesting even if there are no job prospects.  However because these are no job prospects (this generalization is of course false - but true enough for discussion) you shouldn&#x27;t be getting such a degree if you cannot self finance it from your current job.<p>Both of the above arguments makes for a worse world in my opinion.')
