This is not child pornography.  We don&#x27;t have to worry about Zuckerberg appointing himself the arbiter of child pornography because we have actual laws, arrived at via a democratic process, that define what that is. See how that works? We didn&#x27;t just leave it up to companies to call something &quot;child pornography&quot; whenever it suits their interests to do so.<p>This is not fire in a crowded theater either. Bannon made a clearly hyperbolic statement about something he would do in some hypothetical fantasy scenario where he is in the White House and it is some kind of alternate reality where putting someone&#x27;s head on a pike is a real thing that could actually happen.<p>Bannon is not in the White House. It is very unlikely that he will ever again be in the White House. Trump fired him over two years ago. Even if he <i>were</i> in the White House, I can&#x27;t believe I have to explain this, putting someone&#x27;s head on a pike out in front of the White House is not a real thing that even has the slightest, remotest possibility of happening. Even if Bannon were President, that is not something he could do. Do you understand that? He may as well have said &quot;I&#x27;d incinerate Fauci with laser blasts from my eyes&quot; that is about as realistic.<p>Fauci is a highly visible figure in the midst of a global crisis. It is unfortunate, but not surprising, that he needs security. Even minor celebrities get stalkers and death threats. At some point you become known by enough people that it is a statistical certainty that some of them will have a form of mental illness that may cause them to unhealthily fixate on you. That will happen regardless of anything Bannon says.')
