The problems I run into are not squeezing every last ms of performance, since it&#x27;s vastly cheaper to just add more instances.  The problems I care about is that some script I wrote suddenly doesn&#x27;t work in production because of BSDisms, or Python incompatibilities, or old packages in brew, etc.  Would be nice if Apple waved a magic wand and replaced its BSD subsystem with Centos* but I won&#x27;t be holding my breath :)<p>* yes I know Centos is done, substitute as needed.')
