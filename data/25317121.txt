Nothing else I&#x27;ve found comes close. I believe it reads NTFS metadata directly rather than going through the OS, which is why it needs admin access, but it&#x27;s breathtakingly faster than WinDirStat etc.<p>The speed difference is less important when you have fewer files, but for people with packrat volumes that include a decade of personal documents, photos, and bits of defunct Windows installs that you need to prune, it&#x27;s an absolute lifesaver.<p>Ed: on my 3 terabytes of poorly organized files, Diskitude takes about 5 minutes to index. WizTree finishes in 10 seconds. I can&#x27;t say which is more accurate, but I know the tree view in WinDirStat is much more useful, it lets you search by filename, it colors by filetype, it exports to CSV, etc. It&#x27;s better in every way that matters to me.')
