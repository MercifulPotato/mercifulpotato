I needed to replace my iPhone 8 and bought an SE2 instead of the Mini because they still haven&#x27;t brought back TouchID.  I was really expecting TouchID to come back in the 12 line-up, especially after the iPad refresh brought it back, but I think COVID messed up their plans and it got cut.  We&#x27;ll see what next year brings, all I know is no TouchID and I&#x27;m not buying it, and I&#x27;m not the only person I know who feels this way.')
