What percent that is depends on a lot of factors, including the rate of infection (R0), the length of contagion, etc. Nevertheless, herd immunity will be reached at less than 100% infected with Covid-19. I&#x27;m not saying that it will be as low as 60%. I highly doubt that. I&#x27;d say closer to 80-85%, as a guess based on my simplistic math. I&#x27;m no epidemiologist. Then again, neither are you, I&#x27;m guessing. :)<p>Months ago there was a fascinating link on HN that had models you could play with to adjust all the variables in a simple model. You should find it and play around. I&#x27;ll try to find a link when I can come back to this later.')
