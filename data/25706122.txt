It is 2021 and we don&#x27;t actually have those robots. We have cheap workers.<p>It is also stretch - not making robots did not mean you are not able to imagine them. It means they are not necessary for story. Asimov was not too good with humans, which would be fine. But the idea that it must be robots is weakness of his critique.')
