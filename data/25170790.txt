It is just a measure of how unique the message is.  If everybody in the internet submits the same 1TB of data, but you transmit a single byte, then you are transmitting a lot of information, but everybody else is transmitting almost nothing.<p>I don&#x27;t see how your reasoning about sending more or fewer headers fits into this; but anyhow the conclusion won&#x27;t depend at all on the amount or the length of the headers, but on how many people are sending the same headers as you.  It is impossible to know how much information are you sending by only looking at the bytes you send.  You need to know the worldwide distribution of headers to measure that.')
