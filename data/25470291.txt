Few companies are investing in managing their communities and communicating with them, setting standards and so on. Those that do actually see results.<p>A great case study is Final Fantasy 14 VS World of Warcraft. 2 pretty similar MMOs, vastly different communities. If you dig a little, it&#x27;s immediately visible that the difference is not coming from game design, but from explicit community management and standards of conduct. The FF14 mods police the community with an iron fist, and are very explicit about what kind of behavior is toxic and off-limits - and the results are visible whether you play the game or look at the reddit.<p>Most companies though just don&#x27;t want to invest in that, even to the minimum extent of setting clear guidelines and enforcing them when violations reported.')
