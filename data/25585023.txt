Jumped through many distros over time (Mandrake, Xandros, Ubuntu through Ubuntu&#x2F;Kubuntu&#x2F;Xubuntu) until I bought a Macbook in 2011. Still ran Ubuntu on my desktop PC for a few years. I slowly just switched to Mac OS almost fully and I feel kinda bad that when I try to switch back to Linux, I just end up missing something from Mac that keeps me back.')
