Disengage.&quot;<p>To<p>&quot;Keep women in your friends circle&quot;<p>Without mentioning how to get from A to B. I mean, how to actually befriending them in the first place, which is probably one of the biggest hurdles and stumbling blocks for most people here who have the same problem.<p>I.e. Women who are single, available and are my friends are represented by the empty set.<p>Asking your non-single friends to introduce you to single friends doesn&#x27;t  accomplish anything, since they might talk about doing that, but it&#x27;ll never happen (I&#x27;ve seen it multiple times)<p>That was the case even when I was going out regularly, before the pandemic... Since unfortunately most of my social interactions are in groups heavily biased towards male representation.<p>The only way around that, as I recognize... Is to get different hobbies. But it&#x27;s not that simple to get yourself to start liking a new thing (and spend multiple hours every week on that!) If you have<p>1 - A job draining most of your energy<p>2 - already happily spending time on hobbies that you enjoy.<p>&quot;Thankfully&quot; the pandemic solved the gender bias problem regarding the friends that I regularly meet...
