For any individual action the corresponding code path is small. Most code in these sites is easy to write and easy to debug in vanilla JS. Typescript adds boilerplate and compiler times for type safety the development team was doing fine without.<p>However there are some sites, usually very complex SPAs, that are necessarily &quot;deep&quot;. Even small user actions absolutely must cause &gt;10k lines of code to run. Type systems are often <i>very</i> valuable for the development of such sites.<p>It&#x27;s my experience that some developers who&#x27;ve only ever worked on &quot;broad and shallow&quot; sites fail to appreciate what a time saver a type system can be for the right &quot;deep&quot; website.')
