Even just a cheap one is an improvement, but the more vertical the tilt, the better. The one I use now is the one that&#x27;s rebranded by half a dozen suppliers on Amazon.<p>The thing that&#x27;s hard to remember with a vertical mouse (and mice in general) is that you&#x27;re supposed to move your arm, not your wrist. Getting used to that was more of an issue than the orientation of the mouse.')
