If you are using this to tag people of interest, isn&#x27;t it beneficial to use another method anyway once you reach 5k, that will let you annotate and categorize them (such as lists or some non-Twitter method)?<p>The follow function is intended to get people&#x27;s tweets into your feed. I can&#x27;t imagine your feed stays usable when 5k people are posting into it, so it seems to me you are just putting stress on Twitter pub&#x2F;sub platform to subscribe to more messages than you can possibly consume anyway.<p>Why does anyone really need that many follows? I limit myself to a few hundreds, removing old connections not to stay under some technical limit but just so that I don&#x27;t get drowned in noise. I guess everyone consumes social media differently, and some people might want to get everything remotely interesting in their feed (and read a random sample) rather than the stuff they actually intend to read, but once you hit a technical limit why not take the hint?')
