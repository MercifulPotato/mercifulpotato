(At bed time mostly) For articles I save them them to Pocket, and then every so often I&#x27;ll edit the list.<p>I make a zine called <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;WaldenPond.press" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;WaldenPond.press</a> that I get delivered once a month. Then I leave my phone inside and read for 20 minutes or so on the balcony while I have a coffee in the morning.<p>It doesn&#x27;t sound like much, but I&#x27;m consistently getting through the 4 hour edition in about 2 weeks. Then I switch to just reading my fiction book in the morning as well as at night.')
