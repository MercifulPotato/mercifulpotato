Item(by='gspr', descendants=None, kids=[25079463], score=None, time=1605173214, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25064965, text='&gt; Debian&#x27;s patches to cdrecord introduced so many bugs that they eventually ended up driving the original author away from open source.<p>That&#x27;s not how I remember it. I remember distros (Debian and others) patching cdrecord, which resulted in the upstream author getting furious and re-licensing cdrecord under a non-free license to stop them. Of course the software was then forked, and the author indeed ragequit free software development. People can read more of the story here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Cdrtools#License_compatibility_controversy" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Cdrtools#License_compatibility...</a><p>There&#x27;s a reason stuff like this is named after Schilling: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mako.cc&#x2F;copyrighteous&#x2F;award" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mako.cc&#x2F;copyrighteous&#x2F;award</a><p>&gt; I think I remember something about the python 2 -&gt; 3 transition being harder on Debian because of changes they&#x27;ve made?<p>No? There was no transition. 2 and 3 coexisted, 2 was recently removed.<p>&gt; The packaged Tomcat on Debian is so different that every time I&#x27;ve seen someone running Tomcat they&#x27;ve installed it manually instead.<p>Different as in file layout?<p>&gt; Debian has essentially given up on packaging Hadoop. Some of their criticisms of its build process are certainly valid, but others seem to be an unreasonable expectation that everything will build exactly the way Debian expects. E.g. if I&#x27;m understanding correctly, they essentially take the position that they won&#x27;t package anything built with Maven, on frankly spurious grounds.<p>Hadoop is not buildable with non-bundled dependencies, as far as I understand. This violates Policy. We were discussing reliability â€“ am I missing something here?<p>&gt; Debian tends to end up with very outdated versions of anything from an ecosystem that uses large numbers of small libraries, or, basically, anything that isn&#x27;t written in C or Perl. E.g. Python libraries are typically a long way out of date (even compared to other distributions),<p>Can you show some examples?<p>&gt; and Debian&#x27;s package management tends to be less compatible with Python&#x27;s built-in tools like pip<p>This is just not true.<p>&gt; than other distributions (e.g. Debian is more likely to rename a Python library, in my experience, which then breaks reverse-dependencies on that library or leads to having two incompatible copies of it installed)<p>The <i>package names</i> are often renamed, but not the Python modules.<p>&gt; You could say that Debian offers a reliable platform and it&#x27;s the users&#x27; fault for installing these unreliable things on top of it. But an OS exists to run applications, not the other way around<p>Python libraries are hardly <i>applications</i>.<p>&gt; Put it this way: the &quot;add-on repository&quot; culture is a lot stronger in Debian&#x2F;Ubuntu than in other distributions, and I think that&#x27;s actually a weakness rather than a strength.<p>Add-on repos are frowned upon in Debian.')
