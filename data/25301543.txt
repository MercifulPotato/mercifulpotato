I&#x27;m not dyslexic, but I did get extra help as a kid. In theory spellcheckers should be great for me. But in reality I seem to make spelling mistakes that leave some checkers unable to make useful suggestions. I can be just one or two vowel substitutions away from the correct spelling, but they will fail to suggest the right answer.<p>I should start keeping notes when that happens as I&#x27;d really like to understand what I&#x27;m doing that causes them issues, it might help me when I&#x27;m struggling to spell a word and get stuck.')
