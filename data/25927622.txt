This was in my bachelor years, and I still hadn&#x27;t decided whether to pursue a career in academia or elsewhere.<p>While the experience day to day was definitely fun, it destroyed any desire I had of entering the field. A lot of politics, a lot of statistically suspect stuff (even to me, in my third year of a bachelor), and a lot of busiwork.<p>After that experience I went into web development (full-stack). What I like about it is that even though there IS politics, even though there IS taking shortcuts, and god forgive me for some of the code I delivered, in the end whatever I work on has to actually do the thing it&#x27;s supposed to do. It doesn&#x27;t remove the aforementioned problems, but it grounds everything in a way that is mostly acceptable to me.<p>As frustrating as it can be to build some convoluted web app that feels like it&#x27;s held together by scotch tape, it&#x27;s nice to know that it eventually has to do whatever the client asks for, however flawed.')
