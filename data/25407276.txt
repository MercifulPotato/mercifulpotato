Simply because they refuse to admit any of its mistakes ( Especially on the Mac ). And refuse to fix any of its hardware. Literally all repair cost in Apple Store are there to show how it would be better if you just buy a new one. Hence the repair rate ( from Apple&#x27;s perspective ) are exceptionally low, and the 3rd party repairing industry has been thriving because of it.')
