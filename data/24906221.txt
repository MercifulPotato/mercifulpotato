You learn arithmetic in elementary school, and it might only be after an additional decade or more of schooling that you actually learn the logical underpinnings which make the basic arithmetic operations work.  If you actually started with boolean logic and tried to build up all of mathematics from there without at some point tying it back to a tangible example which can be understood in terms of the real world I&#x27;m not sure anyone could successfully learn it.')
