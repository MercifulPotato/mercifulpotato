I think this is because a lot of the curriculum comes from academics, people with a consulting background, and people with a finance background.  For many of those careers managing lots of people is not a number one priority.<p>When I got my MBA there was a case study(it&#x27;s like a lesson chapter) I read about a top performer who didn&#x27;t get along with a team.  We never got to that one and it probably wasn&#x27;t a favorite of the professor.  But we did do a lot of cases about reallocating assets across a conglomerate or relaunching a fifty year old product or what have you.  In retrospect, any insight in how to handle that troublesome high performer would have been really helpful, particularly at the start of my career.')
