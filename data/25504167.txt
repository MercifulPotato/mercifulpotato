Item(by='marcan_42', descendants=None, kids=[25505251], score=None, time=1608625401, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25502823, text='I&#x27;d be somewhat surprised if literally nobody knew about Ghost in the Shell, but I bet you didn&#x27;t use the Japanese title (攻殻機動隊, Koukaku Kidoutai). However, only big anime fans around here would have heard of that title (of which you&#x27;re likely to find a bunch at Sony, though, but certainly not everyone).<p>The US puts late night anime on a pedestal, stuff that fans focus on. That&#x27;s a big market in Japan, but not ubiquitous by any stretch if the imagination - and the names that become popular in the US are often very different to the names popular here, and often only after they&#x27;ve fallen out in Japan. Takeda-san doesn&#x27;t know about FLCL.<p>Anime <i>is</i> part of daily culture in Japan and everyone knows about it, but for household names you need to go to long-running, popular shows that run in kid-friendly slots. Stuff like Pokemon, Precure, Detective Conan, etc. It is those long-running shows that become part of the collective consciousness, because everyone watched some of that when they were kids. Same with Ghibli movies and anything by Shinkai Makoto (Your Name, Weathering with You, etc). That, and truly impactful stuff like Evangelion, the Gundam franchise, Naruto, etc.<p>Then there&#x27;s the fads. Everyone in Japan knows about Kimetsu no Yaiba (Demon Slayer) right <i>now</i> because they&#x27;re doing tie-ups with seemingly every shop and business under the sun. Walk into any convenience store and they&#x27;ll have branded snacks. Whether that series will survive to become something that people remember or not, time will tell.')
