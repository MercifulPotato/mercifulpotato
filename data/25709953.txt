Who remembers Knew Knowledge faking Russian bots to smear a candidate as being backed by Russia? [1]<p>I write this as a muslim American. In my youth having a seasonal job in a well-known resort. I had a local guy come to me, called me a &quot;camel jockey&quot;, &quot;towel head&quot; and told me if he sees me in the parking lot he&#x27;ll take out his 357 and put one in my head. So I have faced some nasty racism. That said, I don&#x27;t agree with Amazon removing Parler on the basis of these flimsy evidence.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;siliconangle.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;12&#x2F;26&#x2F;reid-hoffman-apologizes-funding-fake-russian-bot-campaign-alabama-election&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;siliconangle.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;12&#x2F;26&#x2F;reid-hoffman-apologizes-...</a>')
