This accommodates people with limited time, handles emergencies well, and enables quick learners to accelerate their path without any special permissions required.<p>The platform should be as &#x27;hands off&#x27; as possible, providing only the connections between the creators, tutors, certifiers, students, and recruiters.<p>It should have no admissions process, and ideally be free. Traditional colleges do a lot of gatekeeping. Education should be accessible to anyone. Let students pursue education, regardless of their presumed &#x27;chance of success&#x27;, or financial status.')
