I said everyone feels like they&#x27;ve won. Those aren&#x27;t the same.<p>If I have to split $2,000,000 between you and me, but you don&#x27;t know how much money there is, then you might be happy with me giving you $400,000. That&#x27;s $400,000 you didn&#x27;t have before. Hell yeah, $400k! That&#x27;s loads. The fact we&#x27;re both going away happy doesn&#x27;t make it <i>right</i> though. There&#x27;s a big disparity there. If you found out that I&#x27;d kept 4* what you got you&#x27;d have every reason to be pissed about it.<p>That&#x27;s what I&#x27;m suggesting FAANG companies <i>might</i> be doing - giving developers $400k, which makes them very happy, while keeping a far greater amount for themselves that could have been distributed between the workers at the company had those workers negotiated better by having greater knowledge of the system.<p>I don&#x27;t even know if that&#x27;s really a bad thing if that&#x27;s what&#x27;s going on. The line that I originally quoted (&quot;<i>Tech workers are in so much demand that they don&#x27;t really suffer such a disparity of negotiating power</i>&quot;) just made me wonder if it&#x27;s actually true that demand for tech workers has really driven wages to a natural equilibrium, or whether we just think that&#x27;s true because $400k sounds like a lot.')
