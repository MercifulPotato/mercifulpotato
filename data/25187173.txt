I had assumed that CS:GO was an incredibly steady cash cow. IIRC, CS:GO pioneered the digital collectibles + loot box market, and has somewhere between 600k to 1.1M+ active players during any given day. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;steamcharts.com&#x2F;app&#x2F;730" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;steamcharts.com&#x2F;app&#x2F;730</a><p>The trading market also seems particularly active and Valve takes a cut of each transaction of their digital goods. It&#x27;s an attractive model. There are dedicated companies that have sprung up around it and seem to prosper.<p>Other indirect indicators seem to be green as well. Back when it was a phenomenon, it sold at least 25M+ units before it was made free-to-play. This is on par with Minecraft. The installed player base is in the hundreds of millions. It&#x27;s essentially a giant social network with multiple monetization opportunities.<p>I am struggling to see how this wouldn&#x27;t be profitable.<p>Surely, Valve must make enough in a month to hire 50+ people and give them 18 to 24 months to re-write the engine?')
