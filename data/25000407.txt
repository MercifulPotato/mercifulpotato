And Look at Intel&#x27;s Roadmap ( Or Slides ).<p>2016 - 10nm - CannonLake - First Gen 10nm Process. Industry leading Density.<p>2017 - 10nm+ - Icelake - New Architecture.<p>2018 - 10nm++ - TigerLake - Optimisation[1].<p>2019 - 7nm  - Sapphire Rapids [2]<p>Most people would expect the ETA year to be +1. As 14nm itself was delayed.<p>TigerLake has around 15%+ IPC. That would put it ahead of Zen 3. The Intel 7nm is roughly between TSMC 5nm and 3nm. Had Intel shipped that in 19&#x2F;20, along with Sapphire Rapid. AMD wouldn&#x27;t even lead, they could barely compete.<p>So to answer your question. It wasn&#x27;t AMD did some magic. They have been executing, and shipping their product on schedule. ( Although in tech, that in itself is pretty damn impressive ). All while Intel was.... um..... I dont know what they were doing.<p>10m fiasco has <i>lots</i> of other knock on effect as well. But I guess this is good enough for a ELI5 post :)<p>[1] This Process - uArch - Optimisation name came in later part. In 2014&#x2F;15 people were still talking about Tick Tock.<p>[2] Sapphire Rapid was always a Server Specific design on the roadmap. But things changes bit. Along with Intel&#x27;s plan of AVX512')
