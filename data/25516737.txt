From what I&#x27;ve read, the frequency of 5G doesn&#x27;t interfere with the C-band, as the C-band is 4-8 GHz. This is between the ranges used by the mid and high band spec of 5G.<p>So why do they auction off &quot;parts of the C-band&quot;, and how is it connected to 5G? I&#x27;m sure I got something wrong, just curious what it is.')
