For some specific examples: espresso was by far the most acidic and concentrated (which makes sense if you know how it works); the French press brought out the most bitterness; Chemex produced the least bitter and most consistent coffee regardless of the types of beans (for me this was a downside as I could barely taste the difference between beans, and all of them tasted more bland); and pour over was a nice middle ground (my favorite).<p>I admit that my test was not blind or scientific by any means, but I didn&#x27;t know much about the brewing methods back then, so at least I wasn&#x27;t swayed by any preconceived ideas of how they <i>should</i> taste. Also, it&#x27;s entirely possible that <i>most</i> people would fail this test, but IME most people also don&#x27;t particularly care how their coffee tastes. This is evidenced by the popularity of Starbucks, which trades flavor for consistency by over-roasting their coffee.')
