I grew up in the US (suburban NJ, and later semi-rural MD) in the 80s and 90s, and it was completely normal for me to just yell &quot;Mom, I&#x27;m going to Mike&#x27;s!&quot;, hop on my bike, and ride down the street.  When we lived in NJ I would walk to and from the school bus stop (maybe a half mile away) by myself every morning and afternoon.<p>Things took a turn for the weird by the time I was in college; one summer I wanted to take the bus up to NYC to visit a friend, and my mom (who, remember, had no problem with me just taking off on my bike when I was 8) was absolutely terrified that I&#x27;d be killed.  She gave me her cell phone for the trip and insisted that I call her any time I were to leave or arrive somewhere.  (This was all <i>before</i> 9&#x2F;11.)<p>I don&#x27;t remember any sharp change in her attitude toward this at any point, so I can only assume it was a gradual thing.')
