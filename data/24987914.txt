Especially the rendering isn&#x27;t &quot;immediate mode&quot;, the UI isn&#x27;t rendered while running the code that&#x27;s building the API. Instead Dear ImGui builds a &quot;deferred mode&quot; rendering command list which is actually very efficient in terms of required draw calls.<p>The main difference to traditional UI frameworks is that there are no different code paths for UI creation, UI updating, and handling input. Instead all those things are happening in the same sequential code flow.')
