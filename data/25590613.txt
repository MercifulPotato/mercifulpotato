If you ignore the tooling of Flash, very little about it is appealing.<p>The runtime and the tooling go together.  The reason why tooling doesn&#x27;t exist for HTML5, SVG, and Javascript is it&#x27;s just so damn complex and fiddly that it&#x27;s impossible to paper-over and abstract with a robust authoring tool.  Both sides of Flash were designed for the ease of this kind of development.<p>There hasn&#x27;t been a good high-level authoring tool for HTML in decades and the situation is getting worse, not better.')
