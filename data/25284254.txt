You couldn&#x27;t just use the OS provided means to distribute these roots, you had to use a Firefox specific way to add them. I guess this has similar implications for Chrome as well...<p>Overall I&#x27;m in favour of this change though. Especially on Linux, distros haven&#x27;t really proven to be good guardians of the root store.
