E.g if you&#x27;re from the West, China&#x27;s SCS is obvious or maybe even India&#x27;s Modi government and how it uses Aadhaar. (or more extreme how Facebook is used in Myanmar and other places by the junta).<p>they chose the worst possible example to make their point unfortunately. at least with this sentence it reads like British colonialists &quot;liberated&quot; Australian Aboriginals from totalitarianism:<p><i>&gt; There once was a society in which horizontal totalitarianism was so successful that, without any need for a State or institutions, simple social pressure from friends and neighbours was sufficient to conserve a culture and its customs, perhaps for over forty thousand years.</i><p>finally the kicker:<p><i>&gt; One could even speculate that if Captain James Cook had not disembarked in Australia it may have lasted even longer.</i><p>Aboriginals (the majority of) would have almost certainly been blind to this in the same way an insider is blind to their own immediate internal environmental circumstances. (maybe this is how &quot;liberating people&quot; is justified. as in - &quot;they don&#x27;t even know it&#x27;s bad for them so we&#x27;re doing them a favor by invading them and committing cultural genocide&quot; etc. This then is just another form of totalitarianism)')
