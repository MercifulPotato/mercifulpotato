It would have been risky not to try something new.<p>JavaScript revolutionized this, bringing the developer feedback loop time back down to a few seconds.  Andrew Paprocki&#x27;s 2011 JSConf talk demonstrates this.  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=ODgs0eWAIKc" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=ODgs0eWAIKc</a><p>The main competing technology at the time was Lua which would probably have been a fine alternative.  JS won.  Four years later Node was released which took server-side JS to a mainstream audience and helped validate the choice.  Ten years later saw the ES6 renaissance and the rise of JS as a credible language for application development.  Now TypeScript takes it to the next level, enabling large robust systems to be efficiently built using JS.<p>I&#x27;m pleased we bet on JS.')
