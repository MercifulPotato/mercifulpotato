Item(by='Krasnol', descendants=None, kids=[25678485], score=None, time=1610053543, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25677089, text='&gt; I&#x27;m not deciding anything for you. I can only recommend. You either share your data or you don&#x27;t. It&#x27;s your decision.<p>I may decide because I know how ad-blockers work (and even there it drips through as you must know best) but most out there don&#x27;t decide. They are being robbed along the way without even knowing it. You rob them of their data, their attention and divert it afterwards for your profit. You&#x27;re being paid to make this crime work.<p>&gt; Of course they can do so. Except the times when they want to maximize their ad revenue, so they sell the ad slot to other companies.<p>And how is the fishing shop becoming an ad reseller something that would make your point above valid? Your attention rape has nothing to do anymore with me getting fishing stuff which I&#x27;ve been looking for. The purpose completely switched over to third parties. Meaning your employee and the shop proprietor sharing the profits of this crime. Completely unrelated to the products the shop sells.')
