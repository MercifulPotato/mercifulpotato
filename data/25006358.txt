Item(by='rev_d', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604655401, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25005942, text='Some of the registrars are pretty picky about their rules.<p>I have a .es (Spanish) domain, and it wasn&#x27;t until quite recently that they stopped asking you to include your passport number or SSN in the WHOIS entry.<p>A number of registrars wouldn&#x27;t let you buy the domain without residence in Spain either... Ended up going with a horrible registrar, and I transferred to Namecheap the moment they supported .es domains.')
