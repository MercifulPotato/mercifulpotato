Subreddit communities are heavily influenced by fotm, everyone repeating the same thing(there&#x27;s a word for this and i cant think of it...) Dissenting opinions to what ever is main stream gets downvoted. Reddit communities are also heavy on beginners. Those beginners often don&#x27;t realize how much depth of knowledge they are missing.<p>It might be a place to bounce ideas off, but I would only go there after doing some of my own research. It should only be one tool of many.<p>In areas I consider myself knowledgeable, I see terrible advice given out. Often parroted by beginners. Like people in the headphone subreddit can give recommendations without listening to them. cscareerquestions is the blind leading the blind more often then not. There&#x27;s no way to differentiate experience with someone fishing for upvotes or think they&#x27;re being helpful by repeating someone else&#x27;s advice.<p>I also think there&#x27;s some astroturfing going on sometimes')
