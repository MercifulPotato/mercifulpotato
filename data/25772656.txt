I didn&#x27;t allow ANYONE to secure the backend. 4 years later, their database gets leaked and they get &quot;acquired&quot; for an &quot;undisclosed amount&quot; which usually means they sold themselves at a huge discount pending lawsuits.<p>I don&#x27;t know, the act of confessing that it was done in bad faith?<p>I have kept myself up late at night and in the early hours of the morning hoping that I made the right decisions in trade offs to protect my users, their data, and the company I worked for. I&#x27;ve worked for some companies that treated me pretty shitty. I&#x27;ve experienced racism, gas lighting, overworking, and being underpaid in my career. Never once did it occur to me to turn that hurt and frustration on the company or my users.<p>This is possibly one of the strongest possible cases I have seen to professionalize software engineering. Holy smokes.')
