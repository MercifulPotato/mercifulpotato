I&#x27;d be interested to know which of the dozens of IRC clients you were using that was so horrible.<p>We ... did try that.  <i></i>Of course.<i></i> :(<p>A failure of IRC&#x27;s ecosystem is a failure of IRC.  Ultimately it doesn&#x27;t matter what part of the big chain of interconnected pieces is actually the culprit, unless you&#x27;re the rare individual in a position of leverage to fix it.  A failure of implementors to correctly adhere to the protocol, or ISPs to send it, or anything - is still a consequence of decisions made by the designer who released it into the wild.<p>An analogy to draw is the web - the web isn&#x27;t just browsers; it&#x27;s webpages, it&#x27;s servers, it&#x27;s scripting languages, and all of these add up to an experience that can be judged as a whole.  We&#x27;ve had many mistakes on the web - every time flash crashed on someone was a direct consequence of the quick-and-dirty netscape plugin api getting rushed to market.  Decisions =&gt; consequences.  But any time something&#x27;s bad?  It&#x27;s &quot;the web&quot;&#x27;s fault as a whole.<p>And if it gets bad enough, people look for alternatives for particular tasks.<p>&gt; I do largely agree with most of your points aside from reliability. In my experience large IRC networks with many servers are essentially immune to downtime.<p>Fwiw, we weren&#x27;t talking about downtime.  These issues may have actually not been caused by network outages at all.<p>To explain this for your benefit:<p>Consider that this was <i>invisible</i> failure.  It took quite a few years before I was able to realize that &quot;awkward silences&quot; in the conversation were actual failures-to-send-messages.  Not netsplits.  The messages never got through, rather than being delayed.  Just, every day or two, chunks of conversations would completely fail to send - just a couple sentences here and there.  No rhyme or reason.  <i>And so intermittently, we wouldn&#x27;t notice it.</i><p>It just felt like the other person was rudely not replying, so I figured they were afk, but when they came back, it was genuinely like they hadn&#x27;t seen it.  And once you&#x27;re friends with someone and you really know their personality, you can tell that this just ... isn&#x27;t like them at all to forget things like that.  Or not read the backscroll.  Finally I started to wonder.  What tipped me off was a bouncer I had coming in from a different ISP.  The bouncer got the messages, and my local never did, even days later.  After that, I compared logs between myself and friends, and ... they were <i>mostly</i> ... similar.<p><i>But not identical</i>.   There were holes.  And this had been going on for a decade.<p>And maybe the same thing happens to you - because really:  <i>How can you even tell?</i>')
