Furthermore, implying that a woman is doing the clerical work here perpetutates centuries of female opression and abuse against womxn, especially womxn of color. Please use &quot;they&quot; in the future to avoid this situation. Since it&#x27;s a quote, &quot;[they] give you the certificate&quot; would be a good way to revise it.')
