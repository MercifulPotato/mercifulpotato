Of course, that&#x27;s decided at the Capitol, so it may change after he directed violence toward it.<p>No, it&#x27;s decided in the White House Cabinet Room (well, metaphorically; by the VP and Cabinet, wherever they are located) initially, under the 25th Amendment; Congress isn&#x27;t involved until he says he&#x27;s all better <i>after</i> he&#x27;s been temporarily removed, where if the Cabinet disagrees Congress resolves the dispute.<p>Whether he is too criminal to continue in office is decided in the Capitol, through the impeachment process, though.')
