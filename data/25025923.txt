Two, actually.  The first is &quot;It is reasonable to expect to need to defend yourself with lethal force, and a gun is a reasonable tool for doing so.&quot;  The second is &quot;Feeling the need to defend yourself such that it is a day-to-day concern is a reasonable social position.&quot;<p>People will vote on fear before they&#x27;ll vote on the abject failure of social policy that creates situations where that fear might be justified. That&#x27;s just how humans are wired: we&#x27;re not rational.  It shouldn&#x27;t be a matter of taking someone&#x27;s means of defense, it&#x27;s trying to address why they feel they need it in the first place. But even then, guns just aren&#x27;t a particularly good investment if what you want to do is successfully defend yourself from crime.  The stats just don&#x27;t bear it out.  So again, who is telling people that they should have one?  Who does it suit for large amounts of people to believe that this specific form of mitigation makes sense?<p>Unfortunately, gun control is such a hot-button issue that it&#x27;s actually outside the Overton window for an entire political faction. If you bring it up <i>at all</i>, even if you&#x27;re talking about meta-issues like this, the conversation tends to shut down instantly.  This is why the response is <i>always</i> &quot;the Dems need to understand&quot; not &quot;the Republicans need to propose.&quot; The fear it represents, and the self-image that any conversation around it challenges, are so fundamental that attempting to approach it from any direction is seen as a personal attack.  Again, this is not accidental; it is worth understanding when and how this happened, and who was involved in it.')
