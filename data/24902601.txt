The reason people are so exploitable is because those in power, who have intelligence and access to good information, seemingly despise the masses. At the very least dismiss them with contempt and ignore them.<p>The correct answer is to treat everyone as a worthy person, regardless of their intellectual prowess.  The current left, with their self professed mission for the underdog, are the worst about this.  The contempt a person must have for their fellow man in order to deem them as unworthy of free speech, is gut wrenching.  Instead, we should be finding ways to make socially responsible ideas more accessible and inclusive for _everyone_.')
