First, it is important to remember that science always had unethical behaviour, intrigue and politics. In the end the best science always won, but it might have taken significant time. One could also say that by the very nature of us speaking about it, it can&#x27;t be an existential crisis.<p>Finally, I would argue that the large problem stems not from within science, but from how &quot;science administratio&#x2F;funding&quot; has changed. Essentially, the idea of making science more (a)countable&#x2F;measurable has lead to a state where scientists spend large fractions (&gt;30%) of their time applying for funding. Also the funding is very much tied to some measurable outcomes, so there is just no time left to dedicade to reproducing results, because you can&#x27;t get funding for it.<p>I believe we as society need to come back to a view of seeing science as a general good, without the need to produce some immediate measurable outcomes (in fact this is true for many aspects of society) . Unfortunately the MBAs are running the show almost everywhere so I don&#x27;t see this happening anytime soon.')
