I&#x27;m not sure these have really been changing though, when has FreeBSD&#x27;s documentation not exceeded that of the Mac?<p>Personally, if I touch the trackpad and it doesn&#x27;t do what I expect, that would be enough to disqualify a system from daily use. I use the gestures constantly, it&#x27;s the main way of interacting with the system for me. So I need a system which does this correctly (in my view). Which limits my options to, well, one. Getting riled up about documentation is just really really far from the set of things I care about day-to-day.')
