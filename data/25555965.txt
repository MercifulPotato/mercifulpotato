Item(by='Xixi', descendants=None, kids=[25558323, 25556289], score=None, time=1609120003, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25551950, text='Slightly off topic, but I need to vent: most services are still being built web first, without any kind of API.<p>From January 1st to send international small packets &quot;it has become obligatory to transmit data, such as the sender&#x27;s name and address and names of the contents, to the destination postal service in advance converted into an electronic format called Electronic Advance Data (EAD).&quot; By and in itself this is a good thing.<p>So the Japanese post (JP Post) has put up a website to do this: problem, there is no API... Everything has to be done by clicking and confirming. It&#x27;s not even possible to register shipments in bulk, they have to be done one by one. About 10 actions per customer per shipment.<p>I run a (very) small tea business [1], similar to and inspired by Bemmu&#x27;s Candy Japan [2] after I met him at a Hacker News meetup in Osaka. It&#x27;s tiny, 100 to 150 shipments per month, but registering a hundred shipments by hand is not something I want to do. One unsatisfactory answer is of course to reach for good old Selenium. And it works, but I hope JP Post will not update its website too often... (unless it is to add an API, of course).<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tomotcha.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tomotcha.com</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.candyjapan.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.candyjapan.com</a>')
