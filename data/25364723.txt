MDMA is a psychedelic at a rave and a medicine on a therapist&#x27;s couch. By all reports, there&#x27;s no possible way to abuse ayahuasca.<p>You will have more mileage with someone experienced, and more still with a professional, just like you would with other therapy practices that you can teach yourself, like meditation and yoga.<p>AFAIK addiction is mostly about a person&#x27;s life, and not the things they ingest. That&#x27;s why rehab clinic success is so heavily dependent on the support network (or lack thereof) the person returns to. You have to have something to avoid in the first place to turn to substances to avoid them.')
