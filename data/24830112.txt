I have limited investment to spend in outrage. I&#x27;m not spending it on every preliminary report that might show some correlation.<p>For instance, tiny cats (6lbs? 10?) that sleep on furniture for 8-10 hours a day show elevated flame retardant in an absorbent tag.<p>Do the cats respond in the same way as humans to these chemicals? (No)<p>Is the acceptable dose for a 10lb cat different from a 100lb person? (Yes)<p>Was anything else measured in the experiment (No?)<p>Did the experiment seek out any other explanations? (No)<p>This reeks of a cherry-picked goal-directed experiment to create outrage. It seems the opposite of science.')
