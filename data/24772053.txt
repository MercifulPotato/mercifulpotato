It shows that the value gained by the employer is at least that of $200k+.  It is not arbitrary and it is not wholly derived by supply.  The cost of labor is set by the labor supply as well as the labor demand.<p>Not only does a an employee&#x27;s location not change the employers&#x27; demand, the moving also does not change the supply available to employer.  Moving or not, the employer could always find a new employee abroad if supply was indeed plentiful.<p>A less abstract way to look at things is this.  The cost of living boost is just a bait to work somewhere.  There&#x27;s no magic to it.  Just because you took one deal doesn&#x27;t mean you should so easily take the opposite deal.')
