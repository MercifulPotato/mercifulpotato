And yes, I do consider distrusting the owner&#x27;s software installation preferences to be a flaw, especially when Apple is certainly capable of maintaining a robust and safe third-party distribution ecosystem on macOS. The Mac isn&#x27;t demonstrably less secure because you have a sanctioned way to install Steam onto it. Likewise, Apple doesn&#x27;t lose the ability to maintain the quality of the Mac App Store because people might get their apps on Steam.<p>&quot;Safer for kids&quot; isn&#x27;t a factor here; Apple already provides tools for parents to lock down their children&#x27;s devices should that be necessary. This would also presumably have an option (or default) to disable third-party apps, in the same way parents can already disable specific App Store and built-in apps.')
