As a programmer, it definitely gave me a better understanding of the vaccine (or at least I believe so).<p>I was curious about a part that I haven&#x27;t found a lot of writing on so far - namely, what happens with the artificial spike protein after the cell assembled it.<p>Does it, like, keep floating around inside the cell? Does it attach to the cell membrane like it would to the viroid? Does it leave the cell and enter the bloodstream or does it something altogether different?<p>I figure it can&#x27;t really stay inside the cell as it has to interact with the immune system at some point.<p>However, if it attaches to the cell wall, wouldn&#x27;t this cause risk that the immune system considers the whole cell a pathogen and attacks it? After all, teaching the immune system to destroy anything the spike is attached to is sort of the whole point of the exercise.<p>Finally, if the spike enters the bloodstream, could it wreak havoc with ACE2 receptors?')
