Veteran of Russian Spetsnaz. Kaggle Grandmaster.<p>&gt; When I sit in front of the computer in San Francisco, the only thing that comes to my mind is to build a Face Recognition system and check the burglarâ€™s face in it. Something similar to Clearview. Machine Learning is my expertise; creating such a system is straightforward but will take some time. Tempting. Thinking about it.<p>Two considerations, after reading this story.<p>1) It&#x27;s not a good idea to mess with an ex-Spetsnaz. Plus a PhD in Physics! I wouldn&#x27;t want to be the burglar. Your days are numbered.<p>2) I would hire this guy in a heartbeat. Wouldn&#x27;t even do a single interview.')
