An empty office often isn&#x27;t any better than WFH for many folk. So if in your company you&#x27;re in the minority then you might need to get a new job.<p>There&#x27;s also the effect of the industry. While flexible working is great (I could already role out of bed and decide to WFH whenever before covid) there&#x27;s a chance companies might cut back on offices or force bullshit like hot desking.<p>In the long run I think this&#x27;ll turn out for the best and the OP is right to be optimistic. But in the short run there may be a lot of turmoil.')
