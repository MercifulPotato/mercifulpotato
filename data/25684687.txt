Meanwhile I once spent minutes trying to find a\nsyntax error in intelliJ because while it did indicate with a\nred box that it found an error there was no indicator for its\nlocation...but I sure was glad it marked all warnings and\napparently incorrect spelling in comments right beside the\ntaskbar.<p>Vim respects my time and attention and has virtually no\nlimitation when it comes to defining keyboard shortcuts. No, it\ndoesn&#x27;t have a bulk replace that&#x27;s actually semantically aware,\nbut it took me not more than a day to write a &quot;close enough&quot;\nreplacement in Vimscript.<p>Or, to quote Jonathan Blow&#x27;s excitement while using VS: &quot;Is\nthere a setting to fire the people who designed this UI?&quot;')
