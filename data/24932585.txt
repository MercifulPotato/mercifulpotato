To get to the position where they could have done something to earn them a peerage, <i>their</i> ancestors would have worked a job for payment, and so on.<p>The only difference is the timescale. The 16th Duke of Hamilton is 400 years from someone who had to work for a living. A highly privileged modern investor whose only job was a sinecure at Daddy&#x27;s company might have parents or grandparents who worked an upper-middle class job.<p>&gt; The modern day equivalent to nobility would be government employees<p>That is a ridiculous snark. Government employees work for a wage, just as commercial and third sector employees do. If they stop working, they end up destitute same as any other employee.  You do realise that Ron Swanson is a fictional character, don&#x27;t you?')
