Digital ocean is great but it&#x27;s still bill by your bandwidth usage, probably not ideal to host video contents that can rack up a lot of bandwidth usage.<p>As for the application itself, just use ffmpeg to convert hls&#x2F;dash and just dump it behind nginx, no need for fancy stuff imo.<p>Cloudflare stream is also a relatively cheap alternative to host your video if you do a lot of video embedding on your site. I heard that some school networks block it, but other than that it&#x27;s been working great and I&#x27;ve been using for one of my client to host their private lecture videos.<p>Vimeo is also a great alternative and relatively cheap too. My only gripes is it&#x27;s blocked in certain countries, but otherwise it&#x27;s fine if you don&#x27;t care to serve visitors from those countries.')
