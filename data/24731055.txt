At one point, even memory safety wasn&#x27;t a big deal. I&#x27;m just waiting for a software package to have a security vulnerability when an attacker is able to trigger an untested Rust unwind path and put some Rust daemon into a state it didn&#x27;t expect.<p>There are many good parts of Rust, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m ever going to convinced that the error handling wasn&#x27;t a huge and unfixable mistake. It&#x27;s <i>because</i> error handling is such a big mistake that Rust has grown layers of syntactic sugar --- try!, !, etc. --- to paper over the ugly spot in the language.')
