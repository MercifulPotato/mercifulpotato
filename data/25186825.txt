You link it with your repo and it shows you what people have knowledge across which parts of code[0].<p>Then you can identify parts that share too few contributors and encourage people to work on them together. You might also find parts where the knowledge is already lost, since everyone who worked on it already left the company. In that case some team can volunteer to take ownership of the code and take time to make some sense of it.<p>Of course, easier said than done.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;codescene.io&#x2F;projects&#x2F;167&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;55946&#x2F;results&#x2F;social&#x2F;knowledge&#x2F;individuals" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;codescene.io&#x2F;projects&#x2F;167&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;55946&#x2F;results&#x2F;social&#x2F;...</a>')
