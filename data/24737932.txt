Ask a few questions when creating an account, are you ok seeing naked human body? Are you ok seeing death, blood and traumas? Are you ok seing people engaged in reproductive activities? Are you ok seeing violence? Then blur the images or text which happen to be categorised as nude, gore or porn. Require action to unblur them. Nobody is offended, nothing is censored.<p>I can understand some people may want to avoid nipples, like some people may find images of guns or knives disturbing. But things like that are a personal preference.<p>In this day and age information delivery is already personalized. There is no excuse to censor content or ads based on what &quot;most users don&#x27;t want&quot;.')
