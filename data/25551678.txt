Subscribed to your podcast.<p>My two cents...<p>Due to this pandemic, I&#x27;m finally eating the way I&#x27;ve always intended to. Beans, legumes, brown rices, chilis, stews, novel flours, baking.<p>I&#x27;ve dropped 30lbs, now close to my ideal weight. I&#x27;m also eating non-stop, so it&#x27;s not due calorie restriction.<p>To maximize social distancing, and maybe reduce risk of food shortages, I&#x27;ve been buying bulk as much as possible.<p>Another unexpected benefit is my food waste is now super low.')
