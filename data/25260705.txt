For example lets say you are editing a very large 8K stream and you tell the app, hey load this video into RAM. You could put the part that is in the current edit window in the on chip RAM and feed the rest of the video into that RAM as the editor moves forward from the 2nd level RAM. There are some interesting possibilities here.<p>Also from the ASIC yield view it allows for some interesting binning of chips. Let&#x27;s say the M2 has 32MB on chip plus an off chip memory controller. They could use the ones that pass in the high end, then once that fail a memory test as 16MB on a laptop, etc. Part of keeping ASIC cost down is building the exact same thing and binning the chips in to devices based on yield.')
