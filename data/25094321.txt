Item(by='Moodles', descendants=None, kids=[25094465], score=None, time=1605378245, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25094233, text='Because there are actually two goals, not one:<p>1. To have enough money to survive an emergency no matter what.<p>2. To maximize long-term net worth on average.<p>I was only talking about 1. You are talking about 2. But, to address your point: yes, stocks can indeed go down, but on average they go up. Sometimes your emergency will coincide with a good stock market. You&#x27;re literally choosing the worst possible situation and then saying &quot;see, this strategy doesn&#x27;t work!&quot;. But I&#x27;m actually being very careful with my words here. I am saying: mathematically, backtesting with real data and with monte carlo simulations, you will maximize your long-term net worth on average if you forgo the EF after a certain net worth level.<p>Consider also the original comment I replied to talked about investing on margin while simultaneously having an EF. Which, if you&#x27;re against me forgoing an EF, you must really be against investing on margin while having an EF: That&#x27;s kind of the same to what I&#x27;m currently doing, only paying interest for it!')
