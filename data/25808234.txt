(Probably so as to not push anyone away from church, they dont suck people in and have growing memberships like some other denominations ).  I have friends and extended family in those “newer hyper Christian” churches, and they all somehow manage to attach way more identity into their church life than any catholics I know.  As well as pushing their beliefs on other people.  Whereas the catholic view as I have experienced it is “you&#x27;re different? Thats cool, lets be nice”. Theyre still super pro life, but i havent heard anything that makes me think the overarching catholic political stance is a one issue vote.')
