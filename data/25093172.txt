For example:<p>&gt; Risks of global aggregate impacts are moderate for additional warming between 1–2°C, reflecting impacts to both Earth’s biodiversity and the overall global economy (<i>medium confidence</i>). Extensive biodiversity loss with associated loss of ecosystem goods and services results in high risks around 3°C additional warming (<i>high confidence</i>). Aggregate economic damages accelerate with increasing temperature (<i>limited evidence, high agreement</i>), but few quantitative estimates have been completed for additional warming around 3°C or above.
