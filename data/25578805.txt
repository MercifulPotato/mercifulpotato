This is why it ought to be treated as a religion.<p>The reason it ties back to the worldview I mentioned is if you believe that all human experience is merely an expression of oppressive forces and cultural constructs then &quot;lived experience&quot; <i>ought to</i> be the primary determinant of truth, since the scientific method itself is one such cultural construct, and likely a tool of oppression at that given its Euro-centric origins, and hence deeply flawed and broken in comparison to the &quot;truth&quot; of the collective experiences of diverse people.')
