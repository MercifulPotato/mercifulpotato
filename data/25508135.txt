I don&#x27;t believe Thai&#x27;s fail to check their blind spot because of laziness. It&#x27;s ignorance.<p>Not long after my then gf, now wife and I came to Thailand, we went somewhere with her mother. I had a Intl. drivers permit and she asked if I wanted to drive, so fuck it why not. Within a few minutes, she asked my gf &quot;why is he turning his had, can&#x27;t he see in the mirrors?&quot;.<p>She is a retired <i>school teacher</i>, and she had zero clue about the <i>concept</i> of a blind spot in a car. I can count the number of times I&#x27;ve seen her wear a seat belt, on my fingers (in 8 years).')
