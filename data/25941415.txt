But, in communicating with them, it turned out they didn&#x27;t just want a free calculator. They wanted me to drive an hour out of town to drop it off at their house, and to spend time teaching them how to use it, and to share my phone number so that they could call me if they had any questions. And, when I tried to set some boundaries and say, &quot;Look, I&#x27;m just giving away a calculator, that is all,&quot; they started getting abusive.<p>When I put stuff up on GitHub, it&#x27;s like that. I&#x27;m just trying to share some code. I&#x27;m really not interested in doing much beyond that, and I&#x27;m definitely not interested in people assuming that, just because I&#x27;ve decided to share some code, I&#x27;m also giving away product and project management services, or training, or anything like that.')
