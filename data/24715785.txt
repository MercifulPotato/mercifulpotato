I personally utilise a standard container size and wash and reuse it for my own purposes to avoid kitchen bags and such. But the lids crack as they get brittle after repeated washing and the plastic itself scuffs and looses its transparency and surface. It may actually be problematic to have scratched surfaces for bacteria and cleaning and the containers wouldn&#x27;t look the same in the store even after one wash and refill.<p>Plastic just isn&#x27;t good for reuse, it is not robust.')
