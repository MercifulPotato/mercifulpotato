The only way for the runtime to know for certain it&#x27;s safe to delete the object is to effectively run the GC anyway. The alternative is that the object gets deleted without any checks and any references to it will now (probably) cause a crash - and it&#x27;ll be a hard native crash rather than a .net exception since it&#x27;s outright accessing invalid memory rather than just a &quot;managed&quot; null pointer.<p>There&#x27;s probably something to be said for allowing such a thing in explicitly &quot;unsafe&quot; code, but not in the normal runtime. In fact, it might even be possible now by leveraging some of the existing unsafe bits in .net.')
