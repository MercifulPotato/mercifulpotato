Item(by='Trasmatta', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609457799, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25590000, text='&gt; But most of people I know don&#x27;t care enough to stop their life completely for something without an expiry date.<p>Except there is an expiry date, the date you get the vaccine (or at least, a week or two after you get the second dose). And for most people, that should happen by this summer. If there were no vaccine on the horizon, then yeah, things would need to be different. It doesn&#x27;t make rational sense to be taking any unnecessary risks when people are getting vaccinated as we speak. In 10 years, will you regret being extra careful for a few more months? No, but there&#x27;s the potential that you could regret <i>not</i> being careful for the rest of your life.<p>&gt; And your assumption that things will go back to normal is not true<p>I didn&#x27;t say anything about normality on my post. All I talked about was the vaccine.')
