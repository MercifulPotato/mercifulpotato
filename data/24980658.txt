There&#x27;s a ton of other things that don&#x27;t work, e.g. paper jams. With the multi-function devices this gets even worse.<p>Not using a device all the time should be a use-case that is accounted for. Imagine having to service a car every time it stands still for a few weeks, nobody living in a city would have a car.<p>Of course, there&#x27;s a lot of complexity and moving parts involved, but it just seems like a problem that could have been fixed by now. The rise of home office makes it very annoying, before that most people I know would just print everything at the office where someone manages the printer, also some places have a 7&#x2F;11 around the corner with one of those big printers, so that really helps.<p>It would be nice if someone could make a &quot;fair printer&quot; at a reasonable premium, with good (open source) drivers, cartridges for different use-cases, replaceable and easy to clean parts and thinking of the biggest problems, e.g., an easy way to understand and fix paper jams. I doubt the way financing or corporations work we&#x27;ll see that happening.')
