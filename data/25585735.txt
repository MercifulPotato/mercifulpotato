No nonsense, &quot;here is what it costs, here is what your insurance pays, here is what you owe us.&quot;<p>I can have a <i>little</i> of of sympathy for insurance cos though, I once had a podiatrist bill my insurance $2000 for work that he obviously didn&#x27;t do, and another doctor I visited recently either accidentally or purposefully submitted what was plainly the wrong billing code to the insurance company.<p>Veterinary service is interesting, pretty much the exact same medical technology, but the billing is up front, and they even offer package discounts on tests!')
