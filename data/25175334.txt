The mother carried it around for several days before laying it to rest.<p>Our zoo has a special area for apes that is built in with research mind. Scientists from the Max Planck institute can hide and observe and have access to rooms where they can do experiments. (e.g. shell games, etc)<p>There even is documentary soap on TV since 2003 with over 900 episodes aired till today, looking behind the scenes [0].
