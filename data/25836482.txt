Item(by='DyslexicAtheist', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611079431, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25835436, text='thanks, I am horrified by what happened especially in the Vorayuth Yoovidhaya case. But I wasn&#x27;t shocked, because as your fiance might know is just the tip of the iceberg. If we look at what shameful things our people in power get away with in the West, it&#x27;s not hard to imagine what the situation looks like in a developing systems&#x2F;states. If you look at what happened in some of the elections around the world and the dismantling of institutions for profit by kleptocrats and rent-seeking billionaires, it seems these days Western nations are often on par with some developing countries.<p>Also I don&#x27;t want to paint the past better than the present by insinuating our Western way of punishing crime is &quot;correct&quot; while their traditional way was in any form more &quot;pure&quot; and better fitting for them. Foucault does a good job on how we came to our system in the West <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Discipline_and_Punish" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Discipline_and_Punish</a><p>But also I&#x27;m not a missionary who wants to go to visit the Jawari to &quot;bring them god&quot;.<p>Unfortunately I don&#x27;t have an answer because if you drill down to the roots of power then it&#x27;s all violent no matter how well dressed up it is with language. And &quot;justice&quot; is an incredibly slippery and ambiguous word meaning 5 different things to 2 people.<p>For Thailand what I see as a bigger problem than the monarchy is the military. It doesn&#x27;t matter what case people &quot;legally&quot; have against an army general (and by extension any professional soldier in Thailand). They&#x27;re normally off-limit to law enforcement and cases usually don&#x27;t become public. They&#x27;re also the gatekeepers to big business. Both things are problematic. I think trying to navigate and make sense of power there is not difficult as long as people keep in mind the history of its stakeholders.<p>I&#x27;m optimistic seeing how younger generations understand and question these power structures (better informed because of the Internet). I&#x27;m worried about violence and revolution since anyone can do a coup but the question is what will they do the next day. In the end any type of system will never just pack up and agree that it&#x27;s time to make room for a replacement. (or it takes generations not years) New ideas on top of the toxic base we know well enough from Tech, but replacing a base is a trade off so hard it&#x27;s ofc always a crime within the existing structure.')
