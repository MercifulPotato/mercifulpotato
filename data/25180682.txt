Item(by='enriquto', descendants=None, kids=[25180711, 25182031], score=None, time=1606076408, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25180242, text='&gt; ...have killed brick and mortar retail.<p>There&#x27;s still a lot of brick and mortar retail, and it does not seem to be disappearing, but it is not really about re-distributing the goods anymore, but mostly about paid support.  For instance, a lot of bike shops in my area are turning into repair and assembly workshops, where you are welcome to bring the bike that you bought cheaply from an online retailer and they help you assemble and adjust it.  I guess the earnings for that usage are much larger than for re-distribution, since 100% of what the client pays is directly for the shop.<p>EDIT: also, I have issue on the fact that you call buying cheapest goods a &quot;loophole&quot;.  There&#x27;s nothing wrong about it in an efficient market.')
