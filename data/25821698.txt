As it stands, I already pay a lot more for products I need, especially since I don’t have any government assistance. It’s what I like to call the “blind tax“. not everyone can afford to pay it. As such, it’s better to wait for general consumer devices with accessibility features like the iPhone, which is far more affordable than a braille note taker, for example. The potential market that could afford something like this, is pretty small.<p>I hope technology like this eventually becomes available for those of us living in developing countries.')
