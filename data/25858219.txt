Item(by='xorcist', descendants=None, kids=[25859517], score=None, time=1611232568, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25853911, text='&gt; Matrix ensures that there is only ever one way of doing a given operation<p>That&#x27;s not entirely true though. Press voice call in a client and you may end up with an embedded jitsi, some WebRTC thing, or nothing at all. That&#x27;s exactly how xmpp clients started to diversify.<p>&gt; I&#x27;m not trying to spread FUD about XMPP<p>Yeah, the tone could certainly be improved. Every time Matrix comes up, someone mentions xmpp and immediately the flinging starts about how broken it is and how those developers let it slide into obscurity.<p>Which there may be some truth to, but it really leaves a bitter taste. Especially since much of xmpp lives on in Matrix in bridges to other networks. Matrix really got a flying start there, and that&#x27;s a good thing! Software <i>should</i> be shared and built on.<p>What worries me a little is that the same problems xmpp had, with protocol verbosity and problematic integration with smartphone platforms, is bascially the same in Matrix. The protocol is at least as verbose, and battery management is at least as hard. As a successor to xmpp, one might have expected to learn more from its problems. I&#x27;m certainly not complaining however, the more software the better, and the web client is very nice.')
