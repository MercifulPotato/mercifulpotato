These days <i>practitioners</i> (the ones I run into anyway) are quite conscious of process overhead. It helps that many are into Lean as well.<p>FWIW, shitty agile consultants have had plenty of pushback too, with comedy sites like <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.halfarsedagilemanifesto.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.halfarsedagilemanifesto.org&#x2F;</a> being set up to point out their buffoonery. I do suggest laughing in their faces when they pull out tripe like that. Sometimes their excuse is, &#x27;well, we don&#x27;t work for a startup, we&#x27;re a \n regulated business&#x27; -- well, it&#x27;s still tripe, there are plenty of regulated businesses with lightweight agile processes.<p>My favourite piece of writing on this, in fact, comes from the US Defense Innovation Board, and is called &quot;Detecting Agile BS&quot;[1]. Their recommendations may not 100% work for your organization, and that&#x27;s okay -- tailor it with an eye to outcomes for your team.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;media.defense.gov&#x2F;2018&#x2F;Oct&#x2F;09&#x2F;2002049591&#x2F;-1&#x2F;-1&#x2F;0&#x2F;DIB_DETECTING_AGILE_BS_2018.10.05.PDF" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;media.defense.gov&#x2F;2018&#x2F;Oct&#x2F;09&#x2F;2002049591&#x2F;-1&#x2F;-1&#x2F;0&#x2F;DIB...</a>')
