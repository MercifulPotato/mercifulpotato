Item(by='deadbunny', descendants=None, kids=[25399796], score=None, time=1607792542, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25398914, text='&gt; IPv6 is fundamentally much more secure than IPv4 (no scanning, etc.)<p>The same was true for ipv4 until about a decade ago.<p>&gt; opt-out is bad for innovation, especially since the cheap default ISP router firewall software is likely to not even allow opt-out for any other protocols than TCP and UDP. (Heck, these days on IPv4 even anything different than HTTPS can be problematic...)<p>I can&#x27;t wait for conficker6 to innovate it&#x27;s way around the ipv6 net.<p>&gt; reliance on router firewalls is bad because they incentivize sloppy device security - the manufacturers should be instead liable when they are at fault for screwing it up (also, how many of these &quot;insecure IoT devices running ancient software&quot; are even able to run IPv6 ?)<p>Sounds like an excellent reason for an opt-out by standard. 99% of the world&#x27;s internet users wouldn&#x27;t have a clue how to manage a firewall. Directly connecting all their devices to the internet is an awful idea for 99% of the world.<p>Your 50&#x2F;50 example is hugely biased, first it&#x27;s on a Telco discussion forum so that clearly selects for technical users, then it&#x27;s on ipv6 which is going to further select for technical people.<p>Go canvas 100 random people outside a supermarket if they want to have to manually manage a firewall for every device they connect to their network. If they don&#x27;t give you a blank stare at that question remind them that includes everything from lightbulbs, washing machines, &quot;smart&quot; speakers, to their computers&#x2F;phones (likely the only thing they think of as being connected to the internet). If you find more than 1 I&#x27;ll eat my hat<i>.<p></i> I don&#x27;t own a hat.')
