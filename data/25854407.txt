This is a meaningless point as <i>today</i> states like Wyoming are not self sufficient. I&#x27;m sure a state like Texas would figure out self-sufficiency much faster than Wyoming. Why do large states have to give up power to small states given that both would probably be screwed without the other, but small states would be likely screwed even more?  The idea that large states must cede representative power in order to access resources is absurd - after all they are <i>already paying</i> them via federal budgets; surely there is no reason to double pay? The &quot;they provide resources&quot; argument is bullshit.<p>Secondly, coming back to senate representation &amp; electoral power - there are vastly more people in rural California and conservative districts like Bakersfield than there are in Wyoming. <i>Those</i> voters have effectively 0 senate representation. Again, I don&#x27;t care if they vote red or blue, but Wyoming gets outsized power. Why?<p>I don&#x27;t naively believe that once California has more representative power that the whole country would turn into San Francisco. I believe states like Wyoming and other sparsely populated, deep red states, allows the Republican party to effectively ignore their voters in blue states as well. That&#x27;s the reason the current system is upheld - it allows the GOP to effectively never have to answer to it&#x27;s voters. It cuts both ways, the current system is bad for Americans; red &amp; blue. There are more registered republicans in California than most other states have people and the state itself was solidly red until 1992; yet those voters don&#x27;t have much of a voice.<p>The party affiliations do not matter - the notion that a Wyoming democrat has 4x the voice than a California republican just isn&#x27;t right.')
