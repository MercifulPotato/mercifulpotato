Generally speaking, if the net benefits of leaving are greater than staying, that&#x27;s enough justification to leave, even if society is still largely functioning and even if you could realistically make a difference(tm).<p>The idea that one is morally obligated to be responsible for change in their communities is just one aspect of the larger discussion of ethics vs distance: e.g. is it sensible to expect a sub-saharan african to deal w&#x2F; the ramifications of civil war while &quot;doing one&#x27;s part&quot; consists of merely advocating for the homeless in California?<p>What, then, of africans who go to CA for a better life, and what of those who aren&#x27;t willing to leave CA to get their hands dirty on the more pressing humanitarian issues in Africa?<p>There are many wildly different opinions on this dilemma, but IMHO when push comes to shove, individuals will first and foremost look after themselves - Philanthropy comes second to that.<p>Sometimes this means abandoning one local cause for a better &quot;deal&quot; (in terms of what a foreign society can provide in return for the value brought in by their immigration and their labor); the bigness of the local problem often doesn&#x27;t even factor into the equation, as by definition, social problems can&#x27;t be easily solved by one individual&#x27;s actions alone.')
