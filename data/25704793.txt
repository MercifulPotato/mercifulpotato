Once they&#x27;re done, a message is sent back to the Discord channel with the possible play dates, and potential players vote by reacting to the message with the emojis which represent the available dates.<p>The DM can &quot;lock&quot; the votes and choose the date by reacting with another emoji on a &quot;summary&quot; message.<p>It works, but the match-the-emoji-with-the-date interface is annoying, since you have to keep track of which emoji means what. I&#x27;m going to eventually rewrite it to send multiple messages, one per date, but I got stuck when trying to add React to the project (for no good fucking reason.)')
