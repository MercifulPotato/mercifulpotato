Item(by='jariel', descendants=None, kids=[25535049], score=None, time=1608869742, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25534024, text='I didn&#x27;t portray it as &#x27;having no downsides&#x27;.<p>Every trade deal &#x2F; national-merger has upsides and downsides.<p>The challenge is to see them clearly.<p>There is quite a lot of scary rhetoric about &#x27;trade failure&#x27; about Brexit that is frankly politicized, because outside of some temporary disruption, trade will go on. Caveats - yes. Failure - no.<p>Moroever, nobody seems to look at longstanding deals that work at least in some ways, particularly NAFTA&#x2F;USMCA.<p>In particular, I find it really problematic that the notion of sovereignty is portrayed as &#x27;xenophobic&#x27; in the case of Brexit, but &#x27;idealized&#x27; in the case of Scottish indyref. And of course more theoretically, the notion of &#x27;Canada joining the USA&#x27; (which is not as outrageous at it seems, it almost happened a few times only a few generations ago!) - would be find stupendous outrage among Canadians. Not known for their over nationalism, Canadians would give you a <i>serious</i> earful about that ... and nobody would bat an eye or think there&#x27;s something wrong with it. The UK is not Scotland and is not Canada, of course, but the hyperbole about the issue is unwarranted.<p>Underneath the outrage again, lays bare the fact that the EU is mostly a &#x27;really good economic deal&#x27; whereas the rest of it is fuzzy.<p>Perhaps the most &#x27;personally impactful issue&#x27; - movement - could easily be achieved with a simple work program. NAFTA&#x2F;USMCA allows anyone with specific accreditation to work across the border for 6 years with a stamp at the border - easy peasy. Something along those lines could have been achievable by the EEC without having to go full EU. I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s ideal, or even one way is better than the other, rather, that the issue is overly politicized in the press, and the EU-specific union is too oft presented as &#x27;the only solution&#x27; , when really, it&#x27;s not. There are other ways.<p>In fact, given a post COVID world, and that we now have true real-time digitization ... it may be possible to even move away from the Euro and go to &#x27;National Euros&#x27; - basically to give back the power of monetary policy to individual nations (which is a <i>huge</i> constraint right now, probably the #1 problem that even pro-EU nations have) while at the same time achieving a pan-European financial policy. This would be one example of a truly modern approach to currency, but it can&#x27;t happen if 1&#x2F;2 of the political forces are pushing for integrated political union.')
