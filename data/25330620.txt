If only one container falls off the boat, all entities who were shipping things on that boat are required to chip in proportionally to the amount of containers they were shipping, to make the owner of that container whole.<p>The idea being that otherwise it&#x27;s not fair to the owners of the top level containers, which have a higher chance of falling off than the bottom level containers. Everyone&#x27;s share of the boat is equal.<p>For this reason you always want to take the insurance that is offered against this, just in case that one container contained something worth a few million, and suddenly you&#x27;re on the hook to pay an amount that is a multiple of what you were shipping in the first place.')
