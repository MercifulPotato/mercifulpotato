Extremely low level stuff. Even without using any SIMD abstractions library.\nI don&#x27;t expect any problems for all my higher level work. aarch64 is much nicer than power, s390, mips or sparc (oh the horror)<p>It&#x27;s extremely nice to offload heavy computations to all your phones in parallel btw. They are faster than my Macbook Air. I have now a little phone cloud via GNU parallel and ssh. Comes more handy than the heavy x86 machines.')
