Normal is a section of the bellcurve and fitting into that curve isn&#x27;t supposed to be a goal, it&#x27;s just descriptive of a larger group.<p>The question should really be &quot;does X behavior cause any problems in my life?&quot; If it doesn&#x27;t cause you problems then you&#x27;re good, and if it does, then you should look to alleviate those problems (whether that&#x27;s modifying the behavior or the situation). If playing out social situations does alleviate the anxiety and your only downside is sometimes the people in your house give you funny looks - well that&#x27;s probably a worthwhile tradeoff. On the other hand, if the behavior is aggravating social anxiety, then it&#x27;s worth talking to someone about.<p>Social anxiety falls under the generalized anxiety tree, and most people do feel some anxiety in social situations - but if it&#x27;s disruptive to your life then it may be worth chatting with a therapist with. Most therapists are going to try and identify the specific causes and then give you tools to alleviate those feelings.')
