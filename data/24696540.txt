Obviously he&#x27;d entered the dates in whatever form he felt like at the time and Excel had parsed them in a variety of godawful ways not least of which was defaulting to American month&#x2F;day assumptions before UK day&#x2F;month.<p>I think it would have been far quicker to just manually write a new column interpreting the dates based on previous&#x2F;next etc.  Instead I spent God knows how long trying to be clever, failing, and being embarrassed that I could not solve this obviously trivial problem.')
