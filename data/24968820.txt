The differences seem to be rooted in psychology - strongly correlated with parenting - and perhaps through inherited brain structure.<p>I have a hard time believing this. my own two parents are on more or less opposite ends of the mainstream political spectrum. in my generation, it seems pretty common to find right-leaning (especially libertarian) men dating liberal women. the socially conscious girlfriend gently scolding her boyfriend for saying something non-PC is so common, it&#x27;s almost a trope at this point. the far-left progressives and full-on MAGA types seem incapable of coexisting in the same room for more than five minutes, but I don&#x27;t think there are nearly as many of either of these as you would conclude from watching the news and reading social media.<p>most people just want to live their lives and don&#x27;t see a compelling reason to scream their political positions out into the world. I think one of the likely outcomes in the next ten years is that we collectively realize the polarization of US culture was mostly an illusion.')
