Then got the iOS version and used Setapp’s Mac included version for V2.<p>I don’t have subscription fatigue yet however money is a bit tight. So I was on the fence since being native is so amazing. Seeing the latest change log mention Setapp inclusion coming was the best news for me. Can’t wait!<p>Loving the trial of Noteplan 3.')
