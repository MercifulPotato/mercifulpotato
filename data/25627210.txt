It often takes hours of research to actually get to the bottom of a story.  Nowhere is this more prevalent and hideous than in US politics.  Media outlets, under cover of constitutional protection lie with impunity, consequences be damned.  All they care about is hitting resonance and feeding it.  It is hard to estimate the damage they have caused this nation.<p>In some cases discovering the truth has a time element as well.  I remember a very specific case from the 2016 elections that drove this point home for me.<p>I was watching CNN.  They featured this story about a black church that had been burned down and the phrase “Vote Trump” spray painted on the side.  The network pounded on this story for a week or so.  They painted Trump as the racist instigator who inspired someone to do this.<p>None of this made sense for me.  Unless crazy, a supporter of any political candidate would know that burning down a church would not be a net positive for their candidate.  Something was wrong, yet it was impossible to discover at that time.<p>I was so puzzled that I set a calendar reminder to look into  the story a few months later.<p>Sure enough, three months later they arrested the guy who did it.  Who was he?  A member of the church.  Yes, a black man.  Why did he do it?  Because he had a problem with the pastor.  Why did he spray paint “Vote Trump”?  Because he thought that would send investigators in a different direction.<p>Do you think CNN devoted a week’s worth of 24&#x2F;7 coverage to correct the absolute falsehoods they spread?  Of course not!  They could not care less!  Millions of people walked away from a one week carpet bombing campaign across most of the media with lies upon lies pounded into their heads.<p>This one event truly changed my views.  I started to research everything.  I can say that in nearly 100% of the stories I look into the media lied with impunity.<p>While I don’t consider myself a Trump supporter, I started to understand what the man was dealing with.  He has had to endure this for four years.  This is a horrific violation of the trust and privileges granted to the media by the US constitution.<p>Some might be OK with this because they dislike Trump.  That is a terribly myopic position to adopt.  Today the media attacks those you dislike, yet nothing in life is constant.  Tomorrow, whenever that may be, the tables might change...sadly that’s when people finally realize that a principled unbiased position in favor of truth and justice is the only one that can protect everyone.')
