One feature uses the sentiment of user input.<p>So far, I&#x27;m doing it with an old, bulky neural network running as a process on the same web server. It works okay, but I think that will scale very poorly.<p>So I&#x27;m considering other options. I can use a small, fast naive sentiment classifier (like TextBlob), but it has really bad accuracy. Alternatively, I can use free credits on the Google Cloud sentiment API until I get a customer and can afford to set my own fast, accurate analysis server up. But I don&#x27;t know if I will have enough cloud credits to get me to that point, without getting squeezed.<p>So I&#x27;m not sure what to do. Do you have any ideas?')
