Seven is also often a sacred number. We also have precedent for cultures such as the Greeks and Arabs using double stars to test vision, namely Mizar and Alcor[1,2]. The typical limiting magnitude for unaided vision is about 6 under perfect conditions, but some people with exceptional vision can see to mag 7.<p>So it seems highly plausible that most people could only see six, but they knew there were about 7 because some sharp-eyed people could see them and would tell them so.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Mizar_and_Alcor#Test_of_eyesight" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Mizar_and_Alcor#Test_of_eyesig...</a>\n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.surveyophthalmol.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;S0039-6257(08)00119-7&#x2F;fulltext" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.surveyophthalmol.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;S0039-6257(08)00119...</a>')
