Those celebrities that you follow as they&#x27;re interesting &#x2F; exciting etc but may be completely uninformed on say green issues, which then have an undue influence on their followers. Worse, many of them are sponsored and corruptible that way - we&#x27;re talking about boiling frogs both for the influencer and followers basically.<p>The other issue is that a Web of trust has a tendency to echo chamber. I think the actual hardest thing to do is to cross-polinate networks in a voluntary way, that I don&#x27;t know how to do yet.')
