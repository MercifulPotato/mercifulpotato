I was pretty much forced to write code on an x86 machine and schlep it over via ssh to then run it.<p>Also, be real careful you don&#x27;t accidentally build for x86 when installing libraries or it all goes to shit. I got bitten by this by using iTerm (building it from source was fine though) and not realizing it was the x86 variant. That is to say, make sure your terminal is the system terminal or built for ARM-- otherwise when you install things using package managers they&#x27;ll be the x86 variant.<p>Like, I&#x27;m super stoked for the M1, but also just totally fucking irritated about the toolchain changes and MacOS in general... They&#x27;ve not been the best stewards of their software and developer communities as of late, and they&#x27;re pushing a totally proprietary architecture onto them expecting them to foot the bill (hours spent fixing&#x2F;debugging) to make their platform usable.<p>Truly, I get paid to write software that runs on Linux not on Macs. In fact, I&#x27;ve <i>never</i> gotten paid to write software <i>for</i> Macs, because no production systems use Macs. Now it is harder for me to do primary development on a Mac; because I must fix MacOS or live with MacOS only bugs... bugs which only exist on a platform I do not intend to deploy my code to... these aren&#x27;t just some config bugs either they&#x27;re going to be a fucking mess of irritating, show-stopping, moving targets with a negative ROI.<p>I still can&#x27;t believe they didn&#x27;t incorporate containers into the OS before switching platforms to keep developers around but that&#x27;s a totally different rant.')
