Item(by='jolmg', descendants=None, kids=[25648423], score=None, time=1609866170, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25645750, text='&gt; I have a PinePhone but it is not yet ready as a daily driver, and also the difference in hardware performance between my Android phone (which I bought this year) and PinePhone (or even Librem) is abismal.<p>I don&#x27;t know about it being so much a hardware performance issue, rather than a software optimization issue. Personally, I don&#x27;t think I need much performance, but I have had issues unlocking my Pinephone because the lockscreen seems to have a hard time keeping track of my finger as I slide it or press the keypad buttons. I&#x27;ve also had a number of kernel panics in the few times that I&#x27;ve used it (I got it just recently).<p>For the Pinephone to be my daily driver I just need to be able to run Whatsapp on it (so run an Android emulator with access to the SIM card, I imagine; haven&#x27;t tried) and take real 5MP images. That&#x27;s all I really need to switch the SIM card and leave my Android phone at home. It can even drop calls and I won&#x27;t really care (not that it does; I haven&#x27;t tried).<p>EDIT: I see I misread a bit and thought you meant its low performance prevented its use as a daily driver. I don&#x27;t think it makes sense for linux phones to be offered with more expensive hardware until the software catches up to enable their use as daily drivers for more people. I think we&#x27;re at a stage where the buyers are primarily people that are looking to possibly contribute to the software to get it to that point. Being a cheap phone is important for that.')
