Seems like it should be pretty easy to know if it&#x27;s going to the nearest star (or coming from one), and it&#x27;s not originated from or going to Alpha Centauri.<p>The next question is whether or not there is some other logical path that defines logical gravity assists to visit as many stars as possible - nothing like that has been put forward either.<p>Afaik, it&#x27;s coming from so far away that we have no idea what star it previously visited.')
