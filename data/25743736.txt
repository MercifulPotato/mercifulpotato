It was useless messaging. Ignore the quoted tweets and read the rest. Or read them as (poor) examples only.<p>There is zero way that the message from Twitter should be interpreted literally as &quot;these two tweets only are what caused Trump to be banned&quot;. Anyone who thinks that obviously doesn&#x27;t interpret their message in a charitable way.')
