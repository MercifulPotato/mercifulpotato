Item(by='altfredd', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602547201, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24760708, text='In my experience, descriptions of the so-called &quot;foot cannons&quot; within Git are exaggerated  by people, who don&#x27;t understand Git and didn&#x27;t use it much.<p>It is virtually impossible to lose data, committed to Git. Between reflog, lazy garbage collection and ability to grep history for strings there is literally no way to corner yourself. I have never lost anything after years of using Git. Meanwhile, I have lost data at least once with most conventional filesystems and storage mediums: f2fs, ext4, ntfs, hard drives, SSDs, CDs, VHS tapes...<p>Incidentally, when I tried to use Mercurial once (because the job demanded it) and immediately went for Mercurial Queues, the bug in implementation of Queues caused me to actually lose some data (an insignificant amount, but still!). Unstable internal storage format + implementing history editing via third-party tool = bad news.')
