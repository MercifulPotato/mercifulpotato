Save it.<p>As &quot;easy&quot; an exercise as it may be, I will guarantee you that OP learned a lot about Lisp, the host language, its build infrastructure, etc. The project is currently unlicensed (you should think about licensing it, OP!), but the source is available for others to study and learn from, too.<p>So, I say bravo!')
