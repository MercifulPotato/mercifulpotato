His work was impeccable. But once in a while, he got told, pretty harshly that this is a piece of shit. And he had to work 15 hours to fix a mistake. No, I am not talking about a typo which can be marked with a white marker. Hard-to-objectively-evaluate things like &quot;Dimensions are just not as readable as they can be. You could arrange them this way, look. It&#x27;s better.&quot; He told me to face criticisms, the harsher it is, the more passionate the criticizer is. Find out why they&#x27;re passionately criticizing it.<p>I feel like criticisms on HN, Product Hunt, r&#x2F;photography, r&#x2F;design, etc. - we are too soft to not offend people.<p>I personally would want to be criticized as harshly as possible. I&#x27;d like to face reality in all its glory without drinking the soft-mannerism bs. If the design is shit, say it. If its great, praise it. Tell people why its great. Be honest why it sucks.<p>It&#x27;s hard but if I am really interested in improving my skills, I don&#x27;t want to be given lipservice. It is worse than not seeking feedback because it leads to self-delusion. It goes the other way too, don&#x27;t be afraid to praise something passionately if you resonate with it and explain the reasons.<p>This is the society&#x27;s mechanism for improvement and filtering out noise. If we don&#x27;t do this, society becomes noisy and people who are really good at stuff are drowned in the noise.')
