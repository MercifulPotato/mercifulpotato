After two months with no paychecks, half truths about our funding, and the dev team quitting, he wanted me to start building up a crew of contractors.<p>After asking what he would change, he told me he had no time to look at the past and could only look ahead.<p>I learned if you have enough money and lawyers, the past doesn&#x27;t matter because you can enforce trust through litigation.
