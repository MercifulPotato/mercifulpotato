There&#x27;s lots of corruption in the world. Consistent and unrelenting corruption of American Unions contributed significantly to their downfall, whether or not other forms of corruption exist.<p>One of my first jobs was working part-time in a grocery store: collecting shopping carts, &quot;clean up in aisle 7&quot;, stocking shelves, etc. I was 16 and forced to pay dues to a union. The dues were deducted from my minimum-wage paycheck. I had NO opt-out option. I worked maybe 10 hours per week? I was a high school student. I got ZERO benefit by paying union dues.
