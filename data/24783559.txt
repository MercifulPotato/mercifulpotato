Item(by='rrrrrrrrrrrryan', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602723273, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24782707, text='Wow, this transformed into a weird microrant. I didn&#x27;t mean to offend - apologies if I have. To be clear - imperial units are awful. Everyone knows this. Americans know it, Brits know it, and while we might occasionally defend this system tongue-in-cheek, we know it&#x27;s objectively idiotic. We&#x27;re the ones that have to live with this thing every day.<p>&gt; b) industry (mainly heavy industrial&#x2F;machining) pulled too many strings in Congress saying the conversion would cost too much<p>This is real the only reason. The U.S. is somewhat unique because it had already heavily industrialized prior to the international push toward metric, and had basically no rebuilding to do after the war. It&#x27;s similar to the technical debt that affects most giant old companies, but on the nation-scale. An (arguably) poor early design choice in industry-building and nation-building.<p>In history, generally, the largest economic entity gets to use whatever units it wants, and force the rest of its trading partners to deal with it. The British Empire picked their units, which the USA inherited, and kept using due to inertia. If&#x2F;when either the E.U. or China eclipse the USA&#x27;s GDP, you can probably expect the USA to try again to shift to metric.<p>This is all unrelated to anything of course. I assume the writers of Quanta articles are scientifically literate, prefer Metric, but know where most of their readers are from, and have chosen to use their language. I have lived in both England and America, and to this day, I still don&#x27;t know what room temperature is in Celcius. I really don&#x27;t think this was written with misleading, malicious intent - it&#x27;s just an article that wasn&#x27;t written for you, but rather for (the tremendous amount of) people still living in a &quot;time warp&quot; like me.')
