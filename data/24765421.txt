With these additions, the company reached 80 cities in which it offers tours adapted to a pandemic world.<p>Questo helps tourists explore cities by solving clues to discover new places and local stories all with the help of a mobile app. You can play with friends or family, without an organized group, at any hour of the day or night, making these phone-guided tours safer than any other.<p>Questo&#x27;s platform helps anyone (from independent creators to businesses) create safe, contactless experiences post-COVID for both travelers and locals. The tours are sold on the Questo app and website, on TripAdvisor, GetYourGuide, Klook, Musement, and other partner platforms for prices ranging from 8 to 20 Euro. The revenue coming from the tours is then split between the platform and the partner.<p>Each route on the Questo platform is based on a specific theme, which can be inspired by a movie, a book, a historical fact, or just a local legend. Currently, tourists can use the app to explore on 5 continents in cities such as New York, Tokyo, Paris, Sydney, or Dubai.<p>As of today, the platform offers over 150 tours created by a growing network of local independent and business creators.')
