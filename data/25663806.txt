It&#x27;s pretty common for vaccines.<p>One mechanism: If you have a vaccine designed to deliver a spike protein (without a virus) surrounded by a carrier. The body learns to destroy the carrier. On future doses, the body recognizes the carrier, and the vaccine is destroyed before the body can react.<p>Of course, a vaccine with a different carrier won&#x27;t be affected by this mechanisms, but there are many other mechanisms as well. I&#x27;m not an expert, and I don&#x27;t know all of them. I&#x27;m not sure science knows all of them either, for that matter.<p>There have even been instances of vaccines making diseases worse too (actually, viruses not too dissimilar to COVID19). And there are a bunch of other possibilities.<p>I&#x27;d buy the basic premise of giving each person one dose for giving everyone imperfect immunity if not for these sorts of complications. I&#x27;d rather just wait a few more months than risk a small (but definitely non-zero) chance of something really, really bad.')
