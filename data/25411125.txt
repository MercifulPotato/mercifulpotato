If you asked them, they say, with absolute conviction, that I&#x27;m nuts. How might that happen? What if they&#x27;re right? What could I have missed?&quot;<p>Always spoken to a person as if they&#x27;re wrong. How about seeing this problem from yet a different view too? One in which the answer is, &quot;You first, show good faith before you&#x27;re critical of my views&quot;<p>You don&#x27;t go into a board room telling the CEO he&#x27;s a fuckwit and that you&#x27;re right without first getting how they understand something. You&#x27;re never going to change any mind with this program unless it&#x27;s compulsory and even then you&#x27;ll only drive people to be more certain of their views.<p>I swear HN is about as academic as reddit is, which is to say zero. There is no actual critical thinking about the hypotheticals. Immediately, without provocation, it&#x27;s that one side is right and wrong and feeling strongly is ultimately equivalent to being that wrong. I&#x27;m ashamed I even bother posting on here at all, not that anyone responds of course since this is a dead account.')
