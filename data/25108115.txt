Santa Fe, NM is also on the list. The fact that I live in what is the worlds 5th larger economy with a power grid that looks like a 3rd world nation is a huge part of the reason to leave. $2m home where I need to spend another $100k to sort for the fact that PG&amp;E mismanaged everything for the last 20 years, yet I have a $400 a month power bill... all LED lights, all low power everything..<p>State should just take control and setup CA wide power company who is managed to provide power to everyone all the time and focused on moving all line underground to prevent the fires.. but Newsom is more focused on seeing if he can power the state on the amount of human excrement now found on the streets of SF due to the housing issue for the homeless. We have such a rich state, but the common worker is just screwed by the house laws that keep us from building affordable housing.
