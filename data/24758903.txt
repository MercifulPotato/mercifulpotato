Bought a ~$3k old used car that is always there for me. I do use it more often, ever week or two, though.<p>It is even more shocking to me that people would buy a car on credit (except when it has a business purpose, i.e. you can comfortably cover interest payments with the increase in revenue). You&#x27;re not supposed to use credit for consumption!')
