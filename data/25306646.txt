I want to validate that all the call sites for function F are passing an int, as intended, as opposed to a string.<p>For statically typed languages, I already <i>know</i> that all call sites for F are passing an int.  So I want to unit test all small parts of the pipeline, in isolation, to make sure I easily spot which part doesn&#x27;t follow its contract.  If a function F uses a function G for something, I&#x27;m gonna unit test F and make sure it does behave correctly for all possible returns from G, and that&#x27;s it.')
