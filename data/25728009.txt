In my (subjective) view it has the best UX of all messengers. It also has APIs which should give a big plus on here and at least till now they are not doing censorship to my knowledge. \nWhat might be problematic is that its reception is generally to be the &quot;rebellish&quot; alternative to WhatsApp etc. and people tend to think that it is more secure and has a better encryption. \nAnother pro Telegram point would be that they at least don&#x27;t have an as big incentive as FB to capitalise on their users data.<p>What saddens me is that Signal seems to be the go to alternative. Which is obviously more secure but still centralised and has a terrible UX (e.g. drains the battery of my laptop very fast when I tried it the last time). Why not directly go for Matrix &#x2F; Element.io for a secure and decentralised (like eMail) approach? Do you really want to upload your contacts?')
