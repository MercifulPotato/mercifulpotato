Seeing homogeneity there, of any stripe, is neither unexpected nor problematic.<p>(A lot of the vaccine studies rolled up phase 1&#x2F;2 together because we already have a pretty good understanding of what these delivery mechanisms do to people, and so while you&#x27;d be cautious in administering to the initial study participants, it really didn&#x27;t merit a &quot;test it on five people and hold your breath&quot; approach.)')
