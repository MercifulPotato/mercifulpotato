Item(by='mmacedo_en', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612223681, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25995679, text='Hey everybody,<p>I&#x27;ve been working on Pleke for the last 18 months and using it daily for the last 6 months.<p>It is based on cashflow, so the budget is affected when money enters or leaves the accounts. Credit card purchases affect the budget on the month they appear on the credit card bill. It even shows the credit card bill based on transactions completed, planned or estimated.<p>I use cash flow projection to predict the future balance of accounts, to warn about lack of funds and avoid overdraft fees.<p>It&#x27;s very easy to reconcile as it has a running balance. Input is manual but very fast due to autocomplete and after input I show how the budget line item was affected.<p>Budget works like envelope budget, with detailed budget items. This way I can create transactions from budget, like car payment. With a detailed budget it can understand better which limits can be moved to cover overspending (for example in transportation can reduce gas limit but can not not reduce car payment).<p>Pleke has a local database with cloud backup, you can view and enter transactions when offline. There are apps for iPhone and Android.<p>Would love any feedback!')
