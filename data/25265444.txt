The reason you felt no threat was because you knew what you were doing,or at least knew good part of it. Sales people have one purpose in companies: to sell. There&#x27;s nothing else. So if,after 2,3,6 months they can&#x27;t do it, then of course nobody will keep them. Only shit companies hire&#x2F;fire sales people like there&#x27;s unlimited supply of them waiting to join,but even the good ones won&#x27;t keep them forever if they can&#x27;t do the job.')
