I appreciate the detailed explanation, but you really did sum it up well in the first sentence.<p>I have some frustrations with terminals, which I have always interpreted as being caused by their adherence to some old standards. After reading this comment, I think I can see how it&#x27;s more the terminal paradigm itself that is responsible for some of these things.<p>Now, in the future I will be able to look at these frustrations in a new light, and hopefully understand a little better why it makes sense to continue using the terminal paradigm despite them.<p>This is something I&#x27;ve struggled to understand for a long time, and your comment, obvious though it may seem to some, is one of the first helpful answers I&#x27;ve seen.')
