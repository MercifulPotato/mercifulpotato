The ROB is after instructions have been cracked into uops; the internal format and length of uops is &quot;whatever is easiest for the design&quot;, since it&#x27;s not visible to the outside world.<p>This argument does apply to the L1 cache, which sits before decode. (It does not apply to uop caches&#x2F;L0 caches, but is related to them anyway, as they are most useful for CISCy designs, with instructions that decode in complicated ways into many uops.)')
