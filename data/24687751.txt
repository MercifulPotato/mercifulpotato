Surely making costly things easier by then.<p>Inflation makes it impossible to know for sure anyway.<p>Mix and match these growing costs across citizenry which is not becoming more prosperous, and eventually there is no discretionary wealth except among the few who overcame the inflationary toll.<p>Taxing commerce instead of property allows revenue to grow at the rate of real prosperity unlimited.  With the risk that revenue will drop when prosperity drops, or the authority will go bankrupt at the same time as the general citizenry in such a case.<p>Not a realistic risk since the authority will have enough credit to delay its own bankruptcy until after the majority of the citizens are ruined.<p>I guess the point of view about what kind of tax could ideally fund infrastructure indefinitely depends on whether you are a lowly taxable subject or a high-born guv&#x27;nor.')
