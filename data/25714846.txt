Item(by='vsareto', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610288611, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25714468, text='It&#x27;s the same thing with leases and technology.<p>This apartment has smart home things (hub, A&#x2F;C, smart lock) that&#x27;s controlled through a mobile app. The lease <i>says</i> you&#x27;re responsible for supplying the internet for the devices and calling the company when the app or devices are not working, but the apartment complex insists they take care of it (they really do, they didn&#x27;t lie). But there were no solid answers on why this section was in the lease and it was completely false as I haven&#x27;t had to support or provide internet for any of the devices.<p>This led to: &quot;I don&#x27;t want to support it, I&#x27;d rather remove them and just use a physical key&quot; but they weren&#x27;t able to remove them, nor remove the section from the lease.<p>I get it, they aren&#x27;t lawyers, but it&#x27;s weird when you read it and realize how different things are in the real world compared to some of the agreements we all sign (completely the opposite, in this case). If it came to it, I have no doubt I&#x27;d still be held to the terms of the lease though.')
