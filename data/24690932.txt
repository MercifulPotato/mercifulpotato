Dogmatically pursuing such small commits will lead to a noisy commit history, and all for the meagre payoff for when such niche situations occur.<p>BTW if such a thing really does happen in production and you already squashed and merged, you can always fall back on on git reflog on the developer&#x27;s machine. Commits are never really destroyed in git, the branch simply shifts focus to another set of commits. The old commits are still there, dangling and not referenced by any other branch but they are still reachable.')
