Absolutely it has. It&#x27;s naive to think that censorship, propaganda and such never work. They&#x27;re not absolutes, certainly. But thinking of these as impotent and doomed is a dangerous naivety.<p>Chris Hitchens had a great piece about banned literature like Orwell in Czechoslovakia: More people seemed to have read it than in the west. There are plenty of examples where censorship fails.<p>That said, thinking that it always fails is dangerous. There&#x27;s a reason censorship exists by default unless it&#x27;s explicitly banned. There&#x27;s a reason why strong censorship (heresy bans) exists in all monotheistic religions. Not only have they had an effect, but it&#x27;s a defining feature of the religion and  (IMO) the reason why these have taken over the whole world.<p>It matters what the top papers print, top channels run, and what appears (or does not) on social media. It may not be a predictable and mechanical effect, but censorship is not inert.<p>That said, we tend to overuse the word &quot;censorship.&quot; The difference between an editor and a censor is reach. If the editor of newspaper X edits all newspapers, they are a censor.  Youtube is wading into the murky gray area of this dichotomy.')
