I care not even one teeny-tiny little bit about the same behaviour at a corporation that pays its CEO 300x the average worker, poisons tax policy with lobbying, and actively tries to outsource its workforce.<p>I care a lot about the small time dev who is forced into working unpaid OT. I don&#x27;t give any shits whatsoever about big boy contractor charging 500&#x2F;hour not getting paid for a week because of a dispute.<p>This is not a ledger issue, this is a power issue.')
