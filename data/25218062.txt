Our big blob of neurons has a completely different mode of operation compared with the silicon circuits in the computers we know.<p>However, if you go higher up the ladder of abstraction the story changes I think. Thinking in terms on software design and architecture you can start using a similar vocabulary.<p>We can talk about systems and sub-systems, foreground and background jobs, interfaces and telemetry, sequential and parallel processing, latency, efficiency versus accuracy, overfitting, etc.<p>The underlying implementation might be completely different there are similarities and thinking about them can be useful.')
