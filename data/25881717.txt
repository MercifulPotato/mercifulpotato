Some things do happen for a reason. Deductive and inductive logic helps us decide which is which. I greatly dislike this &quot;all conspiracies are false&quot; approach to understanding the world, as it feels like a &quot;logical safe space&quot; that is intellectually bankrupt, but especially given the state of public discourse and other events, there is such a stigma for being associated with any sort of belief in &quot;conspiracy&quot; that there seems to be a huge knee-jerk avoidance that just doesn&#x27;t stand up to the test of history.<p>Conspiracies are real, and are the breadstuffs of history. Failure to acknowledge this will leave one always a few feet off the mark when trying to understand the past, which means failure to understand the present and hence, is an obstacle in helping one to guide the future.')
