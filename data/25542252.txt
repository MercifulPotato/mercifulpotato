Last week we were all discussing how hospital administrators blamed &quot;the algorithm&quot; when vaccines were issued to admins rather than front line workers. People constantly say, &quot;well, the computer says...&quot; when the computer is obviously making a mistake.<p>More often, they say it to defect blame to the computer when it is precisely implementing the intended policy.<p>&gt; The TSA regularly screws up people&#x27;s travel because they make mistakes about the no fly list.<p>No, because the no fly list implementation is designed to do exactly what it does, with (among other features) extremely loose matching criteria applied. “Mistakes” are a cover for policy.')
