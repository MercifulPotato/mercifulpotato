They had previously announced (I can&#x27;t find it on their blog unfortunately) a flatpak based App Store which is hopefully soon to come.<p>What I miss: What is the developer story here? Their team , even though it had 2 additions recently, is not very big with 9 people who focus on software. Also they aren&#x27;t particularily open as to what already works and does not work, which – as the Librem 5 is not widely available yet, nor thoroughly reviewed (still waiting myself, having a PinePhone though) – is a problem.<p>If you want to have an overview about which apps already exist, I maintain a list at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;linmobapps.frama.io" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;linmobapps.frama.io</a>.<p>It&#x27;s not very good at monitoring the actual state of the apps and does not look to good. If you have ideas on how to (or want to help) improve it, please get in touch!')
