Patents aren&#x27;t useful to the public because they don&#x27;t describe enough to make a useful product when combined with public knowledge.  The monopoly granted is supposed to be in exchange for expanding the public knowledge after expiry, but if most of the knowledge is kept secret, then the patent system isn&#x27;t striking the bargain it was meant to strike.')
