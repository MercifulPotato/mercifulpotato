Item(by='zamfi', descendants=None, kids=[25936646], score=None, time=1611791518, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25933184, text='Almost everything you say is spot on, but unrelated to my claims about whether a mandated standard is preferable at this point in time in the US:<p>&gt; The thing is, Tesla wants to push their proprietary connector and have that be the dominant plug. Its their connector which will only be featured on Tesla cars.<p>Yes<p>&gt; You really think Tesla would be going along with retrofitting in Europe if it wasn&#x27;t for regulations? That they&#x27;d just willingly give up their market dominance position in charging network just because they feel like it and have some altruistic desire to embrace some future connector?<p>No, and no.<p>&gt; The industry standard answer to the Supercharger connector exists. Its available on multiple brands of cars today.<p>CCS1? CCS2? CHAdeMO?<p>&gt; The day for a single shared plug could be today if Elon says so.<p>Not exactly, but very close.<p>&gt; Retrofits for charging stations could start happening tomorrow. They could probably start cranking out CCS compatible cars for the US market within a quarter. But Tesla doesn&#x27;t want a single shared plug, they want to own the market for chargers.<p>Yes.<p>&gt; They want to use the wide spread proprietary connector as a selling point to sell their cars.<p>The connector is only loosely related to the network. Tesla prevents other cars from using Superchargers both by connector and software. But the connector is irrelevant, really: they could just as easily prevent non-Teslas from using Tesla Superchargers with just software, as they do (for now) in Europe.<p>Given that they have a proprietary network, why not use a nice plug designed for this purpose, instead of a garbage monstrosity with a bunch of extraneous pins? (This is mostly directed at CCS1 and CHAdeMo. CCS2 is slightly less terrible.)<p>&gt; Which is exactly the concept in my &quot;straw man&quot; post. Its not really a straw man when its literally the exact scenario that&#x27;s currently playing out in the market though, a car manufacturer using a dominant position in deploying chargers to push their cars.<p>Yes.<p>&gt; For evidence, see TFA. Do you think Tesla owners are installing J1772&#x2F;CCS chargers at their homes and using adapters<p>Yes.<p>&gt; or are they installing Tesla chargers?<p>Also yes. Anecdotally, in my neighborhood, I see a lot of both. More J1172&#x27;s though.<p>&gt; When someone sees an article like this, is that not convincing shoppers to look at Teslas first over other brands of electric cars? Seems less like a straw man and just taking a hard look at the objective reality of today.<p>Yes.<p>&gt; Buying Tesla is supporting vendor lock-in. Its obvious to you that a single, open connector is better for the market and yet you&#x27;ll continue to support a proprietary one.<p>Yes.<p>None of this has dissuaded me from the argument I made earlier, which is: other manufacturers, aside from Tesla in the US, need to care about charging networks in order for fast charging to become widespread, and for EV adoption to increase. Right now, they don&#x27;t, and so Tesla is eating their lunch on EV sales and charging.<p>Let&#x27;s be clear, the straw man argument you are arguing against is &quot;The world as-is with proprietary Tesla connectors is preferable to consumers, compared with a single shared standard&quot; -- and you are arguing &quot;if you don&#x27;t support mandated standards, that means you don&#x27;t care about standards, and if you don&#x27;t care about standards, you support a world of vendor lock-in that reduces competition and results in Tesla winning with their proprietary stuff.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s a straw man because no one is saying &quot;it&#x27;s preferable for consumers for Tesla to have a proprietary connector&quot;. And it&#x27;s not Tesla&#x27;s desire for a proprietary network to support its EV sales that causes fast charging to be a disaster in the US for non-Teslas.<p>Let&#x27;s be clear again why fast charging is a disaster in the US: it&#x27;s not because of Tesla&#x27;s proprietary connector, or proprietary charging network, no, it&#x27;s that other manufacturers don&#x27;t care! It&#x27;s that they don&#x27;t really care about EVs (or haven&#x27;t, anyway, can&#x27;t know if they actually do care now) and so don&#x27;t care about charging networks, and Tesla has no incentive to play nice because it gains nothing from other EVs using their superchargers.<p>Obviously Tesla has a profit motive, obviously it&#x27;s using the charging network to push its EV sales, but if <i>any other manufacturer</i> had a comparable network, or even if the others <i>combined</i> did, or if EV chargers were sufficiently available, it would be a no-brainer for all parties to agree to share: all their customers would benefit, and they would incur no <i>real</i> costs because a proprietary network is no longer a competitive advantage.<p>We want that world, not the world in which we force Tesla to use a crappy connector, and to open its limited supercharger network to other EVs, and end up with Tesla&#x27;s near-capacity network becoming even-more-stretched, eliminating Tesla&#x27;s incentive to keep building it out (since it doesn&#x27;t provide a competitive advantage anymore), and also not incentivizing anyone else to build out a fast charging network that&#x27;s well-placed, well-maintained, and available-â€”because they can just use Tesla&#x27;s!<p>The US may at some point want to mandate a standard connector. But to do so now, without also <i>making manufacturers care</i> about building more fast charging, will just make the situation worse, not better.')
