For exploratory programming with long running computations losing all your state because of something you could fix by hot-reloading a one line change can be rather frustrating -- I remember cursing at python years ago when I was running some ML experiments and more than once lost all data right at the end due to some silly bug at the serialization stage that would have been one line to fix.<p>Mind you, with python you can at least run things with ipython --pdb to get thrown into a debugger on failure so you can potentially serialize some state before losing it. And stacktraces are better than common lisp&#x27;s. But having a robust way to redefine stuff or fixing up a failed computation is definitely very handy in some contexts.')
