When the buyback comes at the end of each month, you can sell tokens back to Leasehold Holdings on one of the exchanges and cash out or you can hold your tokens and instead benefit from capital appreciation of those tokens. Capital appreciation is guaranteed (in the long run) since each buyback reduces the remaining total circulating supply of tokens (in a cryptographically verifiable way).<p>Also, Leasehold plans to become a multi-company blockchain project to benefit from network effects.<p>Our community also runs a decentralized exchange so that anyone can trade the Leasehold token against a mainstream cryptocurrency (Lisk) <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ldex.trading&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ldex.trading&#x2F;</a> - The DEX code is fully open source so anyone can launch their own decentralized market to trade the Leasehold token against any other compatible token.')
