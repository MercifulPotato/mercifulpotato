To be clear, I said that &quot;I probably wouldn&#x27;t code&quot;.<p>1. This is a personal preference because of the benefits.\n2. I also think the expansiveness of no-code tools now has expanded drastically (e.g. check out the type of platforms and marketplaces being recreated via platforms like Bubble). \n3. I said &quot;probably&quot; because I think the need for bespoke code will increasingly decline - at least for earlier iterations. However, there are clear exceptions.<p>Overall, I think we agree but I&#x27;m probably more optimistic over the long term prospects lol.')
