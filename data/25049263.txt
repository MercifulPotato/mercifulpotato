Item(by='6gvONxR4sf7o', descendants=None, kids=[25049334, 25049575, 25050960], score=None, time=1605032854, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25047838, text='&gt; [$500k] far outstrips what I can reasonably expect to earn in a decade, and I&#x27;m a developer working for a fintech startup with a good couple of years under my belt.<p>Is he saying that $50k&#x2F;year far outstrips what he can reasonably expect to earn as a fintech dev? If so, he&#x27;s at least as much of an outlier as the $500k&#x2F;year folks on the other end.<p>For better or worse, HN is a SF Bay Area centric forum. U.S. centric beyond that. All the discussion of whats normal needs to be understood through that lens. It&#x27;s the digital equivalent to coming to SF and saying $50k&#x2F;yr is crazy high. Sure, but not where you&#x27;re standing&#x2F;typing to.<p>(I&#x27;m not saying $500k is normal, nor that his other statements are off)')
