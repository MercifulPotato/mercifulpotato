Assume the option&#x27;s strike price is for the current stock price. Theoretically, that stock option has a current value of &quot;0&quot; (assuming that it is non-transferrable so we don&#x27;t have to worry about market price)<p>That stock option is expected to increase in value if the stock price increases (which then aligns the CEO&#x27;s salary with shareholder value). So in five years, those stock options might be worth millions of dollars. But would you then say the CEO got paid millions of dollars five years ago? But the stock options when they were granted were 0 - they increased in value when they were the property of the CEO. If the CEO bought artwork 5 years ago and the value increased 10x in 5 years, would you also add that to his taxable income?<p>I am sure there are ways to value these options. But I can&#x27;t find the details in this bill. Do you know how it might work?<p>0: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sfelections.sfgov.org&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;Documents&#x2F;candidates&#x2F;2020Nov&#x2F;200629_ExecutivePay_LT.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sfelections.sfgov.org&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;Documents&#x2F;...</a>')
