After a week of no sleep I found myself shuffling around the unit almost delirious at 4am and actually had a moment of &quot;how do I know I&#x27;m the visitor and not the resident?&quot; Would I actually know when it comes my turn - maybe it&#x27;d be better if I didn&#x27;t.<p>I suppose it&#x27;s almost analogous with &quot;Did I ever come down after taking that drug?&quot;. I&#x27;ve broken plenty of bones and that really doesn&#x27;t phase me, but the idea that I&#x27;d stop being able to reason my way through something terrifies me. I wish you absolutely all of the best.')
