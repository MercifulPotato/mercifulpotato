Your comments came off as personal attacks on Keith and I mirrored your responses.<p>I&#x27;ve worked heavily with VCs when I was the first employee at a startup that did well for a few rounds and they worked very hard to help us out. The only difference is that they lived better while helping out because they were already wealthy, but they certainly worked hard for us and for their other investments.<p>You can be fiscally comfortable and still work hard.<p>Now I&#x27;m not defending how much ownership they take relative to what they put in.
