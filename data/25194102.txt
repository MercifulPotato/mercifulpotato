How I bring floating wild hair thoughts little more down to earth and may be &quot;executable?&quot;   Here are some of my tactics:<p>1. I find someone to talk it to out loud.  Even if that person isn&#x27;t knowledgeable in the field.<p>2. Write it down as if you were doing #1 describing it to someone as if they were 5.   You would be surprised how soon you find holes and&#x2F;or new insights.<p>3. Read sites that encompasses vast knowledge of many subjects and not vertical to singular.  A site I like to visit is:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedaily.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedaily.com&#x2F;</a>   Vast latest articles and finding covering every subject.<p>4. Talk to people and also think in their shoes if they heard such an idea by putting yourself in their world view.<p>5. Find a movie that is in that realm of an idea and let your mind wonder.<p>6. Listen to something benign like trance&#x2F;house music.<p>But most of all I like #1 where I talk to someone but moreover, talk to someone who has a breadth of knowledge and not necessarily vertical to any one in particular.  Ideally a nerd be good.')
