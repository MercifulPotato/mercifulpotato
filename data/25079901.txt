My only data point is GNOME though, because I am happy enough to never try another DE.<p>I fully agree with Bluetooth problems. I just gave up and use a wired headphone with mic now :(.<p><i>But yeah compared to macOS or Windows, Linux really lacks a lot of polish.</i><p>I generally agree. I am a NixOS user, though I recently tried Fedora Silverblue and I was surprised how smooth the whole experience is. They nailed the desktop. Atomic upgrades&#x2F;rollbacks. Flatpaks are really a nice model for installing desktop applications. It&#x27;s one of the first times I felt that it&#x27;s a Linux-based system that I wouldn&#x27;t worry much about recommending to non-technical users.<p>I think the more serious problem is the lack of applications like Microsoft Office, the Adobe Suite, the Affinity Suite, OmniGroup applications, etc. Sure, there are free replacements, but they are not as good. And even if they were as good, people generally do not like to switch away from what they know.')
