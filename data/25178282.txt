Anything else out of your mouth will bring pain to you and your lawyer. Doesn&#x27;t matter if you&#x27;re innocent, shut up.<p>2) We should listen to software developers opine about the law as much as we should listen to lawyers opine about software development. Even lawyers and judges get law wrong more than one might expect. A non-lawyer has no hope.<p>If you want to know what a law means, listen to a lawyer who works in that area, otherwise you run a bad risk of being made stupider merely for having paid attention.<p>I know my harsh tone will turn some people off, but if this PSA helps anyone avoid actual trouble with the law, I am okay with that.')
