The standard 50&#x2F;60hz is a bit rough, unless one is working on a high persistence phosphor.  Older monochrome, amber, green screens often have that phosphor.<p>I like how simple they are to drive too.  Managing a high resolution analog stream takes far fewer resources.<p>For personal electronics, retro fun, I recommend one.<p>Glowing phosphor in a glass tube just rocks!<p>There were variations too.  I got to work on one of these in the 80&#x27;s:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;m.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=T-F7ZySfgZ0" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;m.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=T-F7ZySfgZ0</a><p>In a dim room, these are beautiful.  Up to 4k resolution in the 70&#x27;s, no display buffer.  Surprisingly techy looking and feeling.<p>I will miss CRTs when they are no longer available.  They should be made in 16:9 for a while longer.  People would use them.<p>All that said, current flat panels continue to improve.  They are fine for the majority of things most of us do.')
