It&#x27;s giving yourself a pass for risky behavior (bars, indoor dining) while sneering at others for actions that are far less impactful (&quot;haha, dumb hicks don&#x27;t wear masks at the gas station!&quot;).<p>The hicks aren&#x27;t sick because they won&#x27;t wear their masks. They are sick because they&#x27;re doing the same exact thing as you, just more of it. It hardly matters that your tables are spread out, or that you wore your mask while waiting for your reservation. You don&#x27;t want to sacrifice hanging out with your friends, fine. But it&#x27;s offensive to use &quot;Science&quot; to justify such a transparently frivolous choice. And I don&#x27;t see why you should attack people for not wanting to make sacrifices that you yourself refused to.')
