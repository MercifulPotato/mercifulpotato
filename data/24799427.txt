It is a different type of relationship.<p>In my experience, I had two primary goals:<p>1) The corporate strategy and tactical direction.\n2) The productivity, cost-efficiency, well-being, and cohesiveness of the team.<p>My stuff came after that.<p>In any case, you&#x27;re determined to find fault with my experience and outlook.
