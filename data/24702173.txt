I&#x27;m the most financially responsible person I know in my age group, yet I annually get letters threatening to send me to collections for charges I was not warned about by a weird middleman company that I get automatically charged through for medical supplies for my pump. Haven&#x27;t heard from them this year, and I&#x27;ve called them 4 times so far trying to figure out where the charges went. It turns out they have 3 accounts registered under my name for these things and none of them are the account that my orders have been going to. At this point I&#x27;m just going to wait for the annual letter I guess.<p>Good job on the A1C though. I want to get there someday, but I get sudden massive drops in blood sugar out of nowhere about once every two weeks and it scares the crap out of me. I&#x27;m optimistic I&#x27;ll figure it out eventually though')
