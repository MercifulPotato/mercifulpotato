Nix uses KDE Plasma by default, which uses a compositor that struggles with some video drivers.<p>Fortunately, installing from command line is practically the same, especially if you do your partitioning beforehand.<p>&gt; Then when I tried the text-based install, it couldn&#x27;t see my NVME disk.<p>That&#x27;s a more unique problem. I&#x27;m not sure what to do about it either. Did &#x2F;dev&#x2F;nvme0n1 just never populate? My best guess is that you booted emulated BIOS instead of UEFI.')
