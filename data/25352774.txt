If I only listen to one band, have my money! Why does anyone else deserve it any more than they do?<p>Or if you want Spotify could do it over the year rather than the month so it’s less extreme. I just want my money to go only to bands I listen to. Is that so crazy?<p>If I listen to no music, maybe then it can just go based on my average listening history, or last month.<p>Don’t let a few edge cases put you off a much fairer way of distributing the money in general.')
