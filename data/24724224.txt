It appears this is taken as obvious because I had a really hard time finding someone explain it like that.<p>I bought these boxes which use the Coax at very high frequencies to do Ethernet between sides of my house using MoCa which is used by TiVos and newer set top boxes. I had trouble understanding &quot;how is this secure&quot; when my modem is also connected to the same coax and this is clearly not behind my firewall. Well, of course, you filter out the signal from leaving through the Coax which provides you cable!<p>I would rather just run ethernet and keep it behind a firewall, but this reduces punching holes in the walls for now.')
