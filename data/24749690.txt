It&#x27;s cheating if the optimization sacrifices correctness, especially in a meaningful way that is not documented clearly.<p>You cannot parallelize csv parsing by chunking like this. The format prohibits it, full stop. This is why xsv comes with an `xsv index` command for example.<p>Like I said, either I&#x27;m misunderstanding the optimization they are doing or they aren&#x27;t being transparent. From a glance at the code, it looks like the latter to me.<p>(As others have mentioned, you can parallelize csv parsing, but it requires multiple passes. Which is basically what `xsv index` is. It lets you choose when to do the first pass, and then benefit in performance in all subsequent runs.)')
