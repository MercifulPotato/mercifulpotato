Altavista never got much better than literal keyword search even when they introduced PageRank-style weighting.  Google immediately had useful results from misspellings, questions, and related keywords, and only got better from there. Plus it was much faster; responses in 1-2 seconds versus 5-10 sometimes for AV.  Maybe what you said is true, but they were <i>deep</i> in the hole as soon as Google launched.')
