Orderable today for delivery in 2-3 months, maybe.<p>Yeah the supply is low but I mean it&#x27;s the current generation of chip that was released a few months before M1. It seems reasonable to compare the current gen vs the current gen instead of the current gen (M1) vs the previous gen (AMD 3000 series).<p>Hopefully the demand slows down in the next few months. I&#x27;m thinking about upgrading my workstation and I&#x27;m going AMD this time around (I&#x27;ve used Intel CPUs since the Pentium II era).')
