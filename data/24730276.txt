When your unit is declared expendable the mission objective is deemed more valuable than the lives in your unit, a rare thing that is supposed to happen only when the unit giving up their lives can save many more.  I learned about expendable units from my dad, a radio operator at the tail end of the Korean War.  Airborne leadership expected the North Koreans to attack during the treaty talks. My dad&#x27;s unit was placed where they&#x27;d likely attack and told to give early warning and attempt to slow them down, at all costs - that they were declared expendable.<p>Thankfully they didn&#x27;t attack or I wouldn&#x27;t likely be here. There&#x27;s a good story linked below about an expendable unit in Burma named Merrill&#x27;s Maruaders [1].<p>Other animals have been used in more questionable ways too, such as the Navy Marine Mammal Program&#x27;s use of dolphins to find and mark mines [2]<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.army.mil&#x2F;article&#x2F;173880&#x2F;expendable_wwii_merrills_marauders_survive_into_their_100s" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.army.mil&#x2F;article&#x2F;173880&#x2F;expendable_wwii_merrills...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;United_States_Navy_Marine_Mammal_Program" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;United_States_Navy_Marine_Mamm...</a>')
