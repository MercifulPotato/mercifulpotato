Item(by='an_opabinia', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606744341, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25252783, text='&gt; Am I hustling enough?<p>Just because the answer is no doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;ll matter, it sounds like everything is going well either way.<p>A lot of people hate spending time with their families and work hard (literally and figuratively) to avoid the home. Or maybe what they call spending time with their families is 1 hour of fun and games while a WAG does 11 hours of completely inane child care. It would be inappropriate to generalize that people get more joy out of hour 2 of inane child care than they get joy from something that actually requires their intelligence or whatever. For women in the startup world this problem is extra acute, because they are choosing between 3 and 11 hours of inane child care, while most men only are only really choosing whether to have 0 or 1 hours of fun with their kids.<p>So I really sympathize with Tracy Young&#x27;s perspective here. And she is putting things in a way that does not require making anyone out to be an antagonist, a kind of maturity most founders don&#x27;t have.<p>Anyway, for Y Combinator at least it pays for their founders to have well rounded lives. Y Combinator wants to be an index fund of seed stage startups, but to pick winners among a variety of industries it needs a very diffuse amount of expertise. Especially since the super winners look nothing at all like businesses previous businesspeople have been doing. Since it has four founders on its interview panels, the experiences of the people on that panel directly translate into whether or not they correctly see opportunities.<p>So Tracy Young is entitled to work as hard as she wants, that was a rewarding experience for her, but if someone comes to her during a Y Combinator interview she sits on with something that isn&#x27;t construction related, she&#x27;s going to have a hard time saying &quot;Yes.&quot; It won&#x27;t end up mattering if she appreciates how hard people work, because everyone says they&#x27;ll work hard in an interview, it&#x27;s something that is at once quite objective but on the other hand not differentiating. And by the time there are results for all that hard work, where is Y Combinator&#x27;s opportunity?<p>So ironically, there are many incentives for Y Combinator to be skeptical of hard work. It can pay the same dividends to fund the right rich person&#x27;s completely lazy fuck-up kids in order to get allocation in dad&#x27;s rocket ship as it does to spend that same money on someone who actually needs it. Those guys are the antagonists for being total leeches, not Tracy Young for working too hard.')
