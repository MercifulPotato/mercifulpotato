Item(by='an_opabinia', descendants=None, kids=[25255016], score=None, time=1606744341, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25252783, text='&gt; Am I hustling enough?<p>Just because the answer is no doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;ll matter, it sounds like everything is going well either way.<p>A lot of people hate spending time with their families and work hard (literally and figuratively) to avoid the home. Or maybe what they call spending time with their families is 1 hour of fun and games while a WAG does 11 hours of completely inane child care. It would be inappropriate to generalize that people get more joy out of hour 2 of inane child care than they get joy from something that actually requires their intelligence or whatever. For women in the startup world this problem is extra acute, because they are choosing between 3 and 11 hours of inane child care, while most men only are only really choosing whether to have 0 or 1 hours of fun with their kids.<p>So I really sympathize with Tracy Young&#x27;s perspective here. And she is putting things in a way that does not require making anyone out to be an antagonist, a kind of maturity most founders don&#x27;t have.')
