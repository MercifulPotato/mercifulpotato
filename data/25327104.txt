Each of the following 6 lines contains one test case (each test case represents one ping-pong tournament, and each test case is independent of the others).<p>So the first line means there&#x27;s a tournament with N=2 players, and P=1.0, which means that in any matchup, the higher-ranked player has a 100% chance of defeating the lower-ranked player.<p>The fourth line means there&#x27;s a tournament with N=5 players, and P=0.678, which means in any matchup, the higher-ranked player has a 67.8% chance of defeating the lower-ranked player.')
