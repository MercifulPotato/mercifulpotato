Item(by='seppel', descendants=None, kids=[25871961], score=None, time=1611325509, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25871211, text='&gt; What kind of stupid logger logs a uuid without a clue as to what kind of object it identifies?<p>The code cannot know what kind of object an uuid identifies, it can only assume that it identifies what it expects. So it you might see:<p>&quot;Unknown person 550e8400-e29b-11d4-a716-446655440000&quot; in the log files. Much more helpful for debugging, however, is: &quot;Unknown person order-550e8400-e29b-11d4-a716-446655440000&quot;. Then you know somebody accidentally put an order id where a person id belongs.<p>This is an easy example, in the real world you have persons, groups, representatives, accounts, acls, etc, which are easily confused. If you just have an uuid, you will have a hard time figured out what it actually is.')
