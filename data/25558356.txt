Manhattan project: The Hiroshima bomb was only tested once. The Nagasaki bomb was a different kind and never tested in advance. The whole infrastructure to produce those bombs was created from scratch within three years.<p>2. ICMBs: It required to shrink down nuclear bombs to put them on rockets, develop the capability to steer rockets precisely enough over thousands of kilometer, create a whole industry around the manufacturing. Then scale it up to hundreds of rockets.<p>3. Put a man on the moon. Nobody died at the first attempt.<p>You could consider those three steps as an example of Gall&#x27;s Law as they build on each other. However, I would say each of them is a complex system in itself.')
