I have no affiliation with the zola project and am not even big on Rust. Zola just worked for me and seems a lot less &quot;hacky&quot; than hugo thanks to the Tera templating system.<p>The Author of Zola writes on his github:<p><i>&gt; [hugo] personally drives me insane, to the point of writing my own template engine and static site generator. </i><p>a sentiment that I share very much.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20180714043311&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;iotdarwinaward.com&#x2F;post&#x2F;improve-your-privacy-in-age-of-mass-surveillance&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20180714043311&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;iotdarwin...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;getzola&#x2F;zola" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;getzola&#x2F;zola</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;getzola&#x2F;after-dark" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;getzola&#x2F;after-dark</a>')
