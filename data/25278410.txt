The truth is occluded.<p>I think of myself as atheist&#x2F;agnostic in nature, but the way we have been creating technology flies against the face of God. Humankind, the tool maker, has gotten this way by meddling with &amp; learning about their environment. Computing is, in almost all cases, invisible, something done in a way that we can not see. It is a violation of nature. It is unlearnable.<p>The modern world is not too complex for any of us to understand. It is too resistant to observation to allow understanding to begin. The world must open itself again, or we face existential peril as a species; we will have trapped ourselves inside endless boxes.')
