Item(by='waterhouse', descendants=None, kids=[24772351], score=None, time=1602631791, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24771446, text='The website says, at the top: &quot;[phrase] is a form of logical fallacy in which a statement or claim is assumed to be true without evidence other than the statement or claim itself.&quot;<p>Since the speaker is attempting to provide evidence for a &quot;statement or claim&quot;, we could say that, if the argument were correct, then that &quot;statement or claim&quot; would be the conclusion.  Therefore, we can substitute &quot;conclusion&quot; for &quot;statement or claim&quot;, and get: &quot;[phrase] is a form of logical fallacy in which a conclusion is assumed to be true without evidence other than the conclusion itself.&quot;  Therefore, &quot;assuming the conclusion&quot; is a very appropriate name for the thing they&#x27;re talking about.<p>The &quot;assuming the truth of one or more premises&quot; you talk about, where those premises are different from the conclusion, seems like a different type of fallacy than what this website is talking about.')
