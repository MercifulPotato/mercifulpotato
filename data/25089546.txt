(Technically the Mini is a desktop, but you know what I  mean.)<p>However, the extra TDP has minimal effect on single thread performance because a single thread won&#x27;t use the whole desktop TDP. Compare the laptop vs. desktop Zen 2 APUs:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.anandtech.com&#x2F;bench&#x2F;product&#x2F;2633?vs=2635" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.anandtech.com&#x2F;bench&#x2F;product&#x2F;2633?vs=2635</a><p>Around 5% apart on single thread due to slightly higher boost clock, sometimes not even that. Much larger differences in the multi-threaded tests because that&#x27;s where the higher TDP gets you a much higher base clock.<p>So comparing the single thread performance to desktop parts isn&#x27;t that unreasonable. The real problem is that we don&#x27;t have any real-world benchmarks yet, just synthetic dreck like geekbench.')
