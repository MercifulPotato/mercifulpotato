It has some pretty bizarre effects on the market (according to my friends):<p>One important difference between Geneva and Denmark though - Genevas extremely expensive housing market (in both purchase and rent prices) is driven by its geographical location. It&#x27;s surrounded by mountains on most sides and sitting on a lake. This means there&#x27;s pretty much no space to build more buildings to accommodate the influx of people moving there to work in science and politics.<p>Geneva building prices were skyrocketing without those loans just because there was no way to build more.')
