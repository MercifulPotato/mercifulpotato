They&#x27;re known to have good resale value, and to work well with Linux. If you&#x27;re getting up to the Precision line, the Lenovo P series workstations are also worth considering, though given they&#x27;re actually professional-grade machines with Xeon and Quadro parts they&#x27;ll be more expensive than a Macbook Pro.<p>There are also boutiques like System76, that white label, upgrade, and manage driver compatibility for Clevo laptops which may be worth considering, they just came out with a new Lemur Pro like yesterday.')
