Ingram content provides potentially suitable web service for consumption, but if you&#x27;re not a library or physical book retailer access to their metadata costs at minimum $500&#x2F;month with very strict usage terms.<p>I&#x27;ve checked out various others, including librarything, goodreads api, and so on but none seem compatible with usage that could be aspirationally commercial.<p>And ideally I&#x27;d prefer to avoid Google or Amazon&#x27;s Product APIs.<p>There have been peripherally related discussions in HN comments before for threads such as:<p>&quot;I Want to Fix GoodReads&quot;\nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24454221<p>&quot;Goodreadsâ€™ reign over the world of book talk might be coming to an end&quot;\nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24451428<p>Themoviedb, rawg, and similar exist for other mediums, why does print seem to be so much less developer-friendly?  Hopefully I&#x27;m just wrong and folks can provide alternatives, but hoping to open this question up to a wider audience.<p>Thanks!')
