But I don&#x27;t mind it being improved.<p>The fourth one is really just a compensation package. I don&#x27;t  agree that every job should have the same compensation&#x2F;benefits.<p>The third one is what I oppose. If you don&#x27;t want to work on a project, then don&#x27;t. I don&#x27;t want to work in a trash dump (oh the pay is great too), so I don&#x27;t.<p>I&#x27;m also certain that the fourth one will be weaponized and use for deplatforming people.')
