It didn&#x27;t matter if the guy was running a scam, might as well give him a shot in case he pulls it off since the buy in is so low (some tech they didn&#x27;t care about).  Oh &quot;what about their reputation&quot; you say?  The only people who will know or care about this already have their driveways filled with Model 3s and 4runners and turn up their nose at GM.  The real buyers don&#x27;t care.  The big banks, the suppliers, the big corporate entities GM has to deal with don&#x27;t care either since this doesn&#x27;t affect GM&#x27;s perceived trustworthiness to d business with.')
