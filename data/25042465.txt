It&#x27;s the same way with rules for a codebase... you can justify why you are using a specific set of rules, but explaining the decision process that led you to choose those rules is much more difficult.<p>That&#x27;s why tech leads don&#x27;t grow on trees.<p>I&#x27;ll add to what the original comment (about &quot;confused concurrency&quot;) was saying, because it matches with my experiences. The <i>good</i> lead developers are the ones who are able to get the job done (design systems) and keep the concurrency model simple. It&#x27;s often possible to keep concurrency mostly simple and mostly safe.')
