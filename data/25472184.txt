I absolutely would not trust Amazon or Microsoft with my personal data (I&#x27;m the type that hosts my own e-mail, sync, docs, etc.)<p>Now for a BUSINESS, I could see the advantage in less maintenance cost and being able to spin up&#x2F;down services easily. It is easier and that cost is measurable (up to a point; when you get big enough AWS costs become obscene compared to self-hosting. I&#x27;ve been at more than one shop that moved things back on-prem to save money).')
