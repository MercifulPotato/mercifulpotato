If I find myself naming a method &quot;doThisThingThisOtherThingAndLogSomeStuff&quot; then it&#x27;s not a good refactor. On the other hand, &quot;markStaleRows&quot; or &quot;enforceTreeInvariants&quot; have clear purposes that help future engineers make intelligent decisions about how to use these functions and how they should evolve. I want to build in to the common code answers to the questions &quot;should I call markStaleRows or roll my own code?&quot; and &quot;should I make this code change in the calling function or in markStaleRows?&quot;.')
