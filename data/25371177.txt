I think that one of the forces that promote “monopolization” on the internet at least might be the issue of trust. It’s harder to trust “smaller” (or less known) businesses on the internet and vendors on platforms like Ebay, Etsy, Airbnb. Roughly speaking there’s quite a lot of scam and low quality products&#x2F;services out there. Things work differently offline where physical location can in many situations create more sense of trustworthiness even for smaller businesses. Online – your brand is extremely important. And bigger companies tend to have better established brands.<p>Just a speculation (and not very related to BD in particular but to a situation where internet got overtaken by corporations instead of becoming that decentralized paradise we once hoped for).')
