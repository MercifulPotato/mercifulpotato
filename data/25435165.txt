Yes, censorship by a third party has similar effects to government censorship, but we treat them differently<p>&gt; My post was discussing whether censorship occurred and whose freedom was affected. While it did mention certain explictly public schemes, it nowhere argued that other schemes should be treated as government censorship, so you are inventing a position here for the sole purpose of claiming it is in error and a conflation of different things.<p>You brought up the &#x27;third party vs government&#x27; dynamic; I was merely mentioning that it&#x27;s distinct from the dynamic of &#x27;freedom to speak&#x27; vs &#x27;freedom to hear&#x27;. I specifically never claimed that you were arguing that we should treat third parties the same as the government. No need to speculate about my motives.')
