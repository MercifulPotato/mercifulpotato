It sounds like they have neither the bodies nor the jail to actually execute that power -- nor have they tried to acquire such resources.  The net effect is that the white house has refused to permit folks to appear before Congress, and Congress has acquiesced every time... setting a precedent that the Executive branch cannot, in fact, be checked by the Legislative branch.')
