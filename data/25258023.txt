Landlords list their property on Proptee to release equity (like remortgaging). On the other side, we have investors who wish to invest in property in small amounts.<p>We split each property in small shares. This way, investors can buy shares of rental properties and, like on a stock exchange, sell later at a different price. They also receive monthly dividends for holding onto these shares.<p>That’s Proptee in a nutshell.')
