Manual work is <i>nothing</i> compared to the energy contained in fossil fuels (or external energy sources in general). An argument could be made that the economy is in decline due to this, that the sources of fossil fuels are getting more expensive. Most of the cheap sources have been used up already. There is still a lot of oil left, but it&#x27;s a lot more expensive (offshore, fracking) to extract than it used to, and it&#x27;s getting worse.')
