They are prison, reservations, and immigration detention centers.<p>&gt; Are they tracked through a social credit system where you can&#x27;t get a train out of your town if it&#x27;s bad?<p>Again, not as bad in the US, probably, but we do have a credit system that can make it much more difficult for certain people to have a place to live, buy a car, or get a job. Add on the felony system, and we also take away their right to vote, and again make it harder for them to get good jobs. Finally, we even have a no-fly list.<p>&gt; Where journalists repeteadly disappear?<p>Does that happen in China? A quick Google search didn&#x27;t bring up much. I do agree that the US has more freedom of speech.<p>&gt; Where a treaty with the UK is ripped up and a city is invaded?<p>We have and still regularly do this with treaties we made with Native American tribes.')
