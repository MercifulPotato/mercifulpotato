The people who are working on this project are the only ones getting anything out of it. It&#x27;s CaaS &#x27;Career as a Service&#x27;.<p>The people who work for this company are probably a bunch of kids whose rich daddies wanted them to experience what it feels like to succeed in their careers and so daddy kept injecting millions of dollars into their projects.\nBut their career is about as real as a roller-coaster ride in a Disney theme park.<p>I&#x27;ve worked for many different companies over the past decade and I&#x27;ve seen this everywhere, over and over.<p>Nowadays, when I look for a job, the only question I ask myself is: &quot;Do these founders have rich daddies?&quot;.\nI only work for companies whose founders have rich daddies because they&#x27;re the only ones which can &#x27;succeed&#x27;. It doesn&#x27;t matter what the project is or whether it adds any value anymore.<p>It doesn&#x27;t matter how much value I can produce in any other capacity because other people&#x27;s daddies have access to the money printer and no one can compete with the money printer.')
