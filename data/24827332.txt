(Which is OK since they&#x27;re cheap, that&#x27;s the whole point.)<p>Yes you&#x27;ve <i>always</i> also been able to buy solid wood stuff, like certain tables and chairs or more expensive items, but that stuff isn&#x27;t replacing the classic particle-board pieces. It&#x27;s not like IKEA&#x27;s been moving to higher-quality stuff on the whole.')
