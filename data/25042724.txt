It turns out everyone peeks when they play this game. We learned this the hard way by deciding that too many people were cheating so we took a pair of goggles and spray painted them. We made sure there was no way to see anything and whoever was &quot;it&quot; would wear the blacked out goggles. Immediately people started slamming their head into the wall or the bottom of the pool. It was crazy just how obvious it made it that everyone cheats in Marco Polo.<p>The way this relates to the blog post is that I hope the author reads this comment and considers spray painting goggles as a way to replace the scarf. I imagine swim goggles for 24 hours would be terrible so I would recommend finding a pair of ski goggles that could easily be blacked out. This is probably the most comfortable way to black things out and it would be very hard to &quot;cheat&quot;.')
