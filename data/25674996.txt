I also don&#x27;t think that &quot;the blame game&quot; makes any sense. The effects of modern media are world-wide and don&#x27;t have much to do with particular party divides or &quot;left&quot; and &quot;right.&quot; Notice I spoke of radicals, regardless of political affiliation.<p>As I&#x27;ve said, in my opinion the increasing division is partly a result of the fact that radical minorities nowadays have platforms through which they can easily reach millions.[1] This leads to an amplification of radical opinions and makes them appear to be more acceptable, hence also more accepted by people who would otherwise not even consider them. This in turn has to do with in- and out-group behaviour and corresponding cognitive biases.<p>One way to counter-act the trend while still allowing free speech is to ensure that radical fringe groups do not have large amplifying platforms. They can still have free speech, just like they had in the 80s, but it should be made hard for them to reach out to millions. I agree that this is technically non-trivial, but many experiences have been made already and there are many methods like moderation, karma systems, IP banning, shadow-banning, banning by degrading service, limiting amplification&#x2F;re-distribution of messages, identifying sockpuppet and bot accounts, and so on.<p>[1] There are other reasons, of course, that have nothing to do with social media.')
