Item(by='Blikkentrekker', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607708552, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25386987, text='&gt; I don&#x27;t know if this is not well known in tech circles perhaps but this is basically an established fact among those who study this kind of thing for a living. Those communities effectively act as an extremely effective radicalization pipeline where the most extreme version is actual acts of terror and mass shootings.<p>Because tech circles actually visit <i>8chan</i> and come to the conclusion that the news reports are ludicrous — have you actually visited it? Because I was a frequent visitor on <i>8chan</i> before it was pulled and the news articles were certainly grossly inaccurate that portrayed it as <i>Stormfront</i>.<p>In reality, most of the website was about <i>lolcat</i> image macros, cartoons, and dating advice.<p>&gt; In the exact same way that say law enforcement and intelligence agencies spent the last 15 years trying to ensure that access to jihadi material wasn&#x27;t freely available online they are now being asked the question of what exactly is the difference because not only are the outcomes very similar but so are many of the steps leading up to it.<p>Yes, a prime example of how censorship is never done æqually.<p><i>Mein Kampf</i> should be illegal; the <i>Qur&#x27;ān</i> should be banned; but the <i>Bible</i>, which contains much of the same rhetoric is untouchable, of course, even though it pretty much contains “<i>Hear ye, go out and smite ye to death the male who lieth with another male!</i>”.<p>But when another Christian killing of a M.S.M. occurs, there are no cries to ban the <i>Bible</i>; there are no cries to shut down the churches that led to this radicalization or the websites where they might gather.<p>Censorship has never been a practice of fairness.')
