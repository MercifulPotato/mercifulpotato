My peers accepted nearly every piece of prosecutorial testimony without question, not just cops. It was really eye-opening. Because even if that hadn&#x27;t happened, the whole concept of lesser included charges meant the man on trial was almost certain to be guilty of something. If it wasn&#x27;t Murder 1, it was murder 2, or manslaughter, or wreckless endangerment.<p>In my case the guy was (as best I could conclude) legitimately guilty of one of the lesser included charges, but there was some dodgy testimony, and I was the only one, in my group, to question it, and suggest that it might have some bearing on which of the many charges that might actually make him guilty of. It took quite some convincing to get anyone else to drop to anything lower than the top charge.<p>While I realize that this sample size of 1 is statistically insignificant, it really seems like if you wind up in court on criminal charges, odds seem to be you&#x27;re screwed. &quot;Innocent until proven guilty&quot; felt, to me, like a pipedream.')
