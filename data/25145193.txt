I don&#x27;t want to be paying monthly for something unless I absolutely have to.<p>&gt; That can make an enormous difference to their affordability, and should also inject a large pool of electric cars into the second hand market over the next few years.<p>Still too expensive. My current vehicle cost me Â£4000. It has been paid for (I got a bank loan, I didn&#x27;t lease or hire purchase) for many years now. It cost me next to nothing to repair, run, tax and MOT. It has next to no fancy electronics and it just works. I can to take it to any garage in the UK and they can repair it, with Teslas, BMWs, Mercs etc you can&#x27;t really do that.<p>There is no benefit to me in owning an electric vehicle.')
