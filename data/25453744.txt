However, since the service can change these documents at any time, how would I, as a user, prove that they added terms I did not initially agree to explicitly when I signed up? How does the service protect themselves from users lying that there were certain provisions in the documents in the past?<p>It seems like you wouldn&#x27;t be able to do any of this without an auditable log of the service&#x27;s legal docs.')
