I&#x27;m not a climate person, and it&#x27;s a complicated system, but as I understand it, new melt would be distributed evenly by mass around the globe, which means a larger volume of water at the equator due to higher temperatures there. My hunch in that changes in wind patterns and currents will be the more important effect though.')
