The distinction I make is:<p>1) A tough project can be engrossing.  Getting started is always tough, but after that it&#x27;s relatively easy to keep up momentum.<p>2) Menial tasks are not engrossing and are usually quick, so they require a level of attention control to stay focused on them that I&#x27;m just not capable of.  It&#x27;s like &quot;getting started&quot; over and over.')
