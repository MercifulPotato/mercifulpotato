In practice, with a modern optimizing compiler, it can have very surprising behavior, including omitting further null checks after the dereference. While it&#x27;s true that an explicit dereference is very likely to cause a SIGSEGV (these are Unix semantics, not C), dereferncing NULL + something is likely to lead to memory corruption (very ugly in v[length - 1] or v-&gt;field for v==NULL).<p>Also, the recommended way of working with Maybe&#x2F;Optional values is map() or do-notation, not unwrapping. And map&#x2F;do have exactly the same semantics as most NULL-based operations in SQL.')
