Frameworks, APIs, compilers, query engines, highly concurrent code, distributed systems, etc. The &quot;hard&quot; stuff. (I&#x27;ve done embedded too)<p>Building tools is what I truly love to do, they support business use cases, and I understand them, and I build my tools accordingly.<p>For me it&#x27;s the most fulfilling kind of software development. You need to know your stack to the metal, but you may not need to tinker with it. For example, I do a lot of Java, but high performance Java, I understand CPU cache access times, and roughly what hotspot will generate, what the OS will do, etc. and have the tools to check my assumptions. I don&#x27;t do the low level stuff unless absolutely necessary, but I use the tools I have to their limit.<p>You get deep knowledge of software stacks, and get to do experiments, and get to use all the cool algorithms and techniques, and even develop a few new ones.<p>The part I love most, is that you keep learning. There&#x27;s so much to learn and it&#x27;s wicked fun.<p>I&#x27;ve done high-level stuff, but I end up liking things like rendering engines or layout engines rather than building a dialog box.<p>I&#x27;m ranting, so TLDR: learn your stack, fully, to the transistors if you can, and pick the spot where you have most fun. Money will follow.')
