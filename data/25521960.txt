However, I&#x27;m not sure how much it is used. In my case, I had a phone number that was used to set up signal. It was my number at the time. I now have a new number, yet there is no within Signal to update that number. It still shows the old number in my settings. ???? Signal still works just fine for me and all of my contacts')
