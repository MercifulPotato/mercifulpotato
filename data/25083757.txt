I&#x27;m sure flu killed even more its first year when it was novel (since we didn&#x27;t know about how viruses spread). Once it is no longer novel it will be a seasonal virus likely that kills at similar rates to flu. The real question is, can we stop wearing masks once we&#x27;ve achieve herd immunity? Or is it worth wearing them cradle to grave to reduce seasonal deaths as well?')
