But &quot;full consensus&quot; has a problem with scale — the more eligible voting members you have, the more likely it is that you get a holdout on some issue.<p>There needs to be a process by which the concerns of minority factions are heard, which gives the majority a chance to accommodate those concerns rather than steamroll, but then eventually to move on after establishing <i>workable consensus</i> (as opposed to <i>full consensus</i>) despite the holdout.  How do you get there — a majority-rule vote, a super-majority rule vote of x% of those voting?  How long does the vote run?  What&#x27;s the escalation process?  What entity has final say on technical disputes?  And so on.<p>Rust is big enough and has been around long enough that its certain many bitter disputes have arisen and been dealt with — there&#x27;s surely an abundance of institutional expertise on resolving contentious issues.  Nevertheless, it&#x27;s in everyone&#x27;s interest to avoid Balkanized, idiosyncratic, possibly suboptimal formal governance rules for the subgroups, so the process of &quot;writing down the rules&quot; should have the goal of producing one central set of canonical rules, possibly customizable, rather than many sets of potentially incompatible and superficially distinct rules.')
