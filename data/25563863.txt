If a mission critical system goes down, customers will refresh a grand total of 3 times, then call. As I explained in the sibling comment, reporting downtime within a minute is the difference between &#x27;what do you mean the system is down?&#x27; and &#x27;yeah, we noticed and are working on it&#x27;.<p>The idea that polling should be done every minute or so is madness. Here are a few thoughts:<p>- If your app is meaningfully impacted by even 1 requests-per-second extra you have more serious problems to fix.<p>- Rounding matters if you do high uptime. If 4 minutes downtime per month is high (e.g. ~99.99% uptime), rounding to the nearest minute could make a 50% difference in your downtime reported.<p>- You can speed up your resolving of any downtime by a almost a minute without any extra effort in terms of teaching people or having better processes in place. Even if the gains are small, this is the logical place to spend a tiny bit more to gain a minute on every downtime.<p>- For most things, standards don&#x27;t need to be that high. But it doesn&#x27;t hurt to have quicker feedback, and the cost is neglegible.<p>- Some systems are quick enough in recovery that you don&#x27;t notice the downtime, like when switching over to a hot replica. Your customers will notice any short downtime that occurs. Why? Scale. Your polling client is only one, but you might have thousands or millions of customers. Chances are at least one of them notices a hiccup. You should view it as your responsibility to ALSO be aware of this, even if you choose not to actively improve on this.<p>- To phrase it bluntly: standards are too damn low in DevOps.')
