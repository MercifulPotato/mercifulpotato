If increased security results in &quot;more good&quot; than evil, it is inherently ethical and thus acceptable. In this view, the idea that a good person may be blackmailed is perfectly acceptable, as long as it exposes political malfeasance.<p>On the other hand there&#x27;s the Kantian view. If you have to lie, it it hurts someone, or it wouldn&#x27;t work if it applied to everyone, then it&#x27;s unethical. This doesn&#x27;t seem to work at all, because we have to allow lying (non-repudiation). But non-repudiation could prevent someone from being hurt. And applying it to everyone would allow for the least harm, rather than the most good.<p>In the end Utilitarianism usually reigns because it&#x27;s easier. But it does ignore the edge cases, which we should consider. Perhaps the way forward is not to pick one or the other, but actually re-make the world to embrace the good and avoid the bad. Sadly, that&#x27;s probably the most difficult choice of all; when&#x27;s the last time we replaced a working standard just because it had crappy outcomes?')
