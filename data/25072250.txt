Google is not a startup. It&#x27;s like saying that you&#x27;re puzzled because companies operating from a garage are not held to the same standards than a fortune 500.<p>When Google tries to be disruptive in an emerging niche, it does it with a backing (brand &amp; money) that could effectively snuff the smaller (and more willing) competition that it finds already operating in the arena. It enters as the 800lbs big G, smashing everything in its wake. Then sometime later, loses interest and goes home with its ball, leaving its users and the surviving smaller competition to figure out what&#x27;s next.<p>Edit: If the service truly represents a dead end, why not sell it?')
