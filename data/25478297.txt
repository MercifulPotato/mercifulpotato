It&#x27;s about threat mitigation. There is nothing secure, including seccomp jails.<p>You want defence in depth - that is using multiple layers of defence to reduce the risk. You can never get it to 0, but if you combine two mechanisms that are each 99% effective, then your risk is now 0.01% instead of 1%. That&#x27;s obviously an improvement.<p>You don&#x27;t run your database without a password (hopefully) just because its behind a firewall. You want to have the password as well in case an attacker finds a way around your firewall (compromises a system on the inside) or you misconfigure your firewall.<p>Security in the physical world works the same way. You don&#x27;t turn off the alarm and leave the bank doors open at the end of the day just because your vault is quite secure.')
