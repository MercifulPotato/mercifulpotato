It&#x27;s also completely anecdotal, and doesn&#x27;t really contribute one way or the other to the validity of this pilot&#x27;s approach. The point isn&#x27;t that there are <i>never</i> any cases where armed police response is appropriate -- but rather that the vast majority of cases don&#x27;t require one.<p>&gt; The vast majority of people are good.<p>&gt; We send armed cops into the worst possible situations<p>&gt; your job requires you to engage with multiple people a day, any one of whom could kill you<p>These statements are exactly the point. The data shows that the vast majority of people involved in 911 calls are <i>also</i> not &quot;the worst possible&quot; people -- but police today are trained to consider <i>every</i> situation as if it were &quot;the worst possible situation&quot;. And the data shows that this is not true in the vast majority of cases. No one is claiming that there is no risk, but rather that despite popular belief, the data indicates this risk is in fact not constant enough to justify armed, worst-possible-sitation response as the <i>default</i>. In addition, as your anecdote illustrates, in some cases even sending an armed police response isn&#x27;t enough, and they get shot anyway. Programs like these can&#x27;t solve for these edge cases -- what they do is recognize that these <i>are</i> edge cases, rather than the norm, which is the opposite of the approach taken by much of the police force today, and by your comment. Just as one piece of data from this very article:<p>&gt; The NYC, Los Angeles, Denver and San Francisco test programs are all modeled after Eugene, Oregonâ€™s Crisis Assistance Helping Out in The Streets (CAHOOTS) program, which has been in place since 1989. In 2019, it responded to 24,000 calls for service, less than 1% of which required an additional police response.<p>So no one is claiming that there is <i>never</i> any reason to call for armed response -- rather that it&#x27;s only needed a very small percentage of the time. Can this program potentially completely eliminate any and all shootings, or terrible situations like the one you described? Of course not. But the data does indicate that in the vast majority of cases, armed response is more likely to make things worse, not better. Other cases definitely exist, but <i>are</i> the exception.')
