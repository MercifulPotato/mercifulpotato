What starts  out casual might unearth something that needs going into deeper, and going in deep on something might not have results worth documenting yet.<p>To me this points out a gap in our software for knowledge archival. The closest concept Slack has is &quot;pinning&quot; a message to a channel, which has very limited use for this. Really what you want is to be able to have a conversation with someone in any manner (casual or formal meeting) and be able to easily extract the conclusions and decisions made into a different location, ideally through an easily discoverable UI in the software already being used.<p>In an ideal world my chat software has knowledge of the projects I&#x27;m working on (through some protocol to something else that acts as a source of truth) and I can select a message&#x2F;file upload in chat and tell it to archive it against a project. It can easily fill in the details for me about who made this decision and when. Ability to effortlessly organise information arising from a connversation should a priority I think, this might remove the need for having seperate software depending on how &quot;deep&quot; you think a conversation is going to be.')
