That would be simply illegal (the words idiotic and ludicrous would be also good adjectives); but don&#x27;t worry, we never would do that to your family.<p>in short, haters gonna hate... Anybody can go and create their own Cat-anon and rewrite the history to fit into their delusions if they want (Is a free country after all), but they only lie to themselves and the reality will hit like a ton of bricks eventually')
