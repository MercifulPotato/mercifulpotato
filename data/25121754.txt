Would you? OP&#x27;s article is a follow up to an original that focusses on and explains price forks and how that affects these delivery services.

How much do you care about the restaurant&#x27;s business if the exact same thing is offered to you at 2&#x2F;3rd&#x27;s the original price just 2 taps on your smartphone removed from your door?<p>Companies like DoorDash are currently losing money and they are happy about it. Why is that?<p>It&#x27;s a cost&#x2F;benefit trade off. DoorDash perceives covering the remaining 8$ of that pizza as an expense. What they bank on is being able to buy an established position of dominance as a middle man on the delivery market.<p>Two things are happening right now. The first is a race to the bottom and drive other delivery services out of the market. That happens by accruing as many restaurants and their customers on their platform. The second is that restaurants get pressured over time to lower their own prices since they compete less with the menu&#x27;s displayed in their windows on main street, but with the cheap offerings on DoorDash or GrubHub.<p>If and when the price gap closes over time, incumbent delivery services who remain  get to flip their losses into a profit.<p>The societal cost? Keeping a regular restaurant open becomes prohibitively expensive (which is why ghost kitchens are becoming a thing), low wages for gig and restaurant workers, impact on the quality and diversity of the food on order.')
