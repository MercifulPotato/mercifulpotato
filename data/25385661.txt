But it is decently close to having to censor those sorts of things in legitimate historical contexts.  See for example all the genuinely historically centered youtube channels that have to censor those symbols because otherwise the algo will bury them.  I think we can all agree that that latter case is not ok and is the kind of censorship that should be complained about.  Considering how many historically themed video games there are out there and how strongly people believe in free speech it&#x27;s understandable why more than a few people do not like this move by Twitch.')
