In another, &quot;men&quot;.<p>It is pretty much always clear when a speaker means one or the other.<p>As with, eg., &quot;bank&quot;. No banker is complaining about the &quot;collapsing banks&quot; of a river.<p>It is pretty clearly an opportunistic misreading of &quot;guys&quot; to accuse a speaker of some how implying &quot;men&quot;, or even &quot;men&quot; as a plausible implication.<p>It is only in the eye of the &quot;feminist of language&quot; do words fail to have contextual meanings; and it is this eye we should be suspicious of, rather than any possible double meaning.')
