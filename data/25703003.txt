The temporal nature of the series (as pointed out in these comments) inevitably leads to contemplating one&#x27;s own mortality (to put a fine point on it).<p>The &quot;Up&quot; particant&#x27;s ambitious and youthful energy in some cases turns to cynicism and it hurts to recognize these things in yourself.<p>Most eventually pair off and it is on to what is usually the next stage of life — parenthood. And some of the lost energy returns in the rearing of their children — balancing it with their relationship with their partner, their careers.<p>Being just a decade or so behind these people gives me a sometimes sober preview of life to come, sometimes hopeful. Always though their &quot;common&quot; lives slowly reveal the plain beauty of a simple life lived honestly.<p>For people new to the series, jump into the middle. The first of the series are more clinical — intended to explore classism in the U.K. But as the series goes on, the class-angle falls away and, as I say, the beauty of watching people go through what we all must go through becomes the more pointed aspect of the experiment.')
