This isn’t paranoia and I haven’t felt “unable to express myself”, this is just part of functioning in polite society.<p>&gt;&gt; While I do agree there is more calling out of people for saying things (for better and worse) it also seems there is an increasing sense of entitlement to be able to say whatever you want and not be held accountable for it. This article seems to be falling into the latter bucket.<p>&gt; ???<p>&gt; I think it&#x27;s definitely the opposite.<p>&gt; The evidence seems clear - dozens of the centre-left&#x27;s most foundational global thinkers (i.e Noam Chomsky et. al.) have had to take out a page in Harper&#x27;s to literally tamp down the authoritarian tendencies of those suppressing speech, mostly more extremists of &#x27;their own side&#x27;. [1]<p>You&#x27;re both right:<p>On the right, there seems to be a growing view that &quot;free speech&quot; means that you should be able to say whatever you want (even if it&#x27;s literally a factually untrue lie), and not experience any <i>social</i> censure and be welcome on any platform or venue.  For an example of this, see the nonsense around the false claims of election fraud and people quitting Twitter for Parler because of Twitter&#x27;s labels on that misinformation.<p>On the left, there&#x27;s the extreme form of political correctness that&#x27;s metastasized into &quot;cancel culture,&quot; where  in some quarters there&#x27;s an unwillingness to tolerate differing opinions and perspectives on many topics.')
