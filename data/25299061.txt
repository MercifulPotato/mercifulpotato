I guess I disagree, I think there are probably over a thousand companies actively working on the issue with the potential to massively reduce GHG emissions. Lots of examples in this thread. General categories are:<p>- EV manufacturers (eg Tesla)\n- Solar OEMs (eg SunPower)\n- Battery makers (eg Avalon)\n- Battery operators (eg Geli, AMS)\n- Wind providers (eg Vestas)\n- Large utilities which are focused on renewables (eg Enel)\n- Distributed generation companies (eg Sunrun)<p>The list goes on! GTM is a good news site with the pulse on each industry (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.greentechmedia.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.greentechmedia.com</a>)<p>I also agree that fundamental research (either towards an energy storage breakthrough or a next-gen nuclear breakthrough) are necessary. I think this is a &quot;yes and&quot; situation.')
