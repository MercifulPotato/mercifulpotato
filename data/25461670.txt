Many in the lower income strata disproportionately eat these foods because they are convenient and relatively cheap. A 10% increase in the food budget of someone at or near poverty isn’t trivial.<p>Talk to chefs at high-end restaurants and you’ll see how  much fat is inherent in (or gets added to) “luxury” food as well.
