I don&#x27;t think that has the properties you are claiming.  At least not with approval voting.<p>Let&#x27;s spherical cow this for a second and say that 51% of the population would like candidates from the Foo party, and 49% would like candidates from the Bar party.  What prevents the 51% from electing five Foo candidates?  When a &quot;fair&quot; split would be three Foo candidates and two Bar candidates.<p>In Approval voting, one would expect five Foo candidates with 51% votes, and five Bar candidates with 49% vote.<p>Ranked choice might fix this, but the actual results would depend entirely on the vote resolution mechanism.')
