To me theyâ€™re basic human rights that every person deserves, if you hire a worker in an expensive city, then the basic cost goes up. Likewise if you hire someone in a place where the cost of living is cheaper, then that basic cost goes down.<p>But now the question is, what happens when you hire a worker in an expensive city, but then allow them to work remotely from a cheaper city, should that affect his&#x2F;her salary?')
