It&#x27;s not because you are living in a wealthy country that you have access to a decent Internet speed. On the contrary in Canada a lot of places that I wouldn&#x27;t even dare to call remote have 1-5Mbps download at best, carried through antennas on silos that drop signal on very rainy days.<p>So to whoever wrote this: I understand why you consider LEO pollution to be a very real issue (it is), but handwaving the positive to try and make your position sound stronger is a poor argumentation technique.')
