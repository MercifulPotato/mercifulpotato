Item(by='Geminidog', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609147881, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25557237, text='&gt;Godel&#x27;s incompleteness theorems state that there will always be statements that are true, but can never be proven to be true.<p>Not exactly. It says that incompleteness is always true for axioms of a consistent system. It does not have to hold for an inconsistent system of axioms.<p>&gt;Fields should be as mathy as they can be, but no mathier. Otherwise it&#x27;s just fake formalism, as you said yourself.<p>If I used the words fake formalism, i&#x27;m likely referring to the usage of big words and titles to falsley promote a sense of legitimacy. Like &quot;System architect&quot;<p>Fields should be as mathy as we can make them as developing a formal language around any concept aids in exact analysis.<p>&gt;There are plenty of fields with &quot;design&quot; in the name that are quite rigorous: analog circuit design, digital signal processor design, microprocessor design, compiler design, etc.<p>Yeah but all of these fields involve intuitive guesses. Given specific requirements can you derive via calculation the optimal circuit design&#x2F;digital signal processor design&#x2F;microprocessor design&#x2F; compiler design?<p>These constructs are &quot;designs&quot; rather then calculations and they, as a result, reflect a lack of knowledge on how to calculate the best possible &quot;design.&quot;')
