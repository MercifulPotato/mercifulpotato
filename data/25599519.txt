The EU key people stated for a very long time - access to the internal EU market <i>cannot</i> be decoupled from the free movement of people. But still, you won that. All because you gave access to french fishers to some fishing waters. I think this bribe to one of the EU partners  has been the key impetus for a lot of renewed EU resistance in Sweden. As an example:<p>After reading the terms of the deal, lots of Swedes in r&#x2F;svenskpolitik (&quot;swedish politics&quot;) actually wanted the same exit deal. I kind of agree.')
