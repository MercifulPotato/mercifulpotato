As far as I understand, the current Docker Desktop for macOS runs a Linux VM and the docker server and binaries run in that while the client runs natively on macOS.<p>Running it in a VM is bad enough. If they also had to run the VM in the Intel emulator (Rosetta 2), it could be unusable, performance-wise.<p>If they developed a macOS subsystem for Linux (like the WSL on Windows) and ran that on Rosetta 2, I can imagine it being faster.<p>Slightly off-topic: I just realized that they&#x27;re actually calling it Apple Silicon. I find that name very cringey for some reason.')
