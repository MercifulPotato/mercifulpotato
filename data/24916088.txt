Is this partial evidence that turing tapes are trash? Does that question even make sense?\nYes it is. Turing machine models are very limited, and a programme to let us achieve the things we can do with Turing machines (mainly runtime analysis) with a better model (i.e. a lambda-calculus style model) is a very good idea.<p>What you wrote is a different justification for why turing tapes are worse than lambda calculus. It has nothing to do with the number of people programming on turing tapes, which is the argument that I was responding to. \nI could easily have used &#x27;lambda calculus&#x27; instead of &#x27;turing tape&#x27; above. Most people do not code in the lambda calculus. They write haskell or javascript or whatever.<p>It doesn&#x27;t mean that the lambda calculus is trash. \nLikewise, most mathematicians don&#x27;t work directly with ZFC. Doesn&#x27;t mean ZFC is trash.<p>&gt; I&#x27;d be equally interested in a programme of doing metamathematics in some non-category-theoretic model that was still &quot;normal&quot; mathematics in the same way that category theory is (and ZFC isn&#x27;t).<p>My point is that almost all pure math (e.g: linear algebra, topology, differential geometry, category theory, group theory) is already metamathematics.  Of course, there is a spectrum of &#x27;meta-ness&#x27; but I think this is a continuous spectrum. I do not think there is a well-defined division between &#x27;mathematics&#x27; and &#x27;metamathematics&#x27;.<p>For example, can you give an argument for why, say, the irrationality of sqrt(2) is not &#x27;metamath&#x27;, yet godel&#x27;s incompleteness theorem is &#x27;metamath&#x27;?')
