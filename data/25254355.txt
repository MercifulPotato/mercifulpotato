Almost all businesses completely closed, and famously crowded locations like Trafalgar Square and Leicester Square were almost completely devoid of people. A very eerie and strange sight!<p>But this time, the streets have remained pretty busy. Many businesses and offices are open and in the evenings there&#x27;s a relaxed, festive atmosphere on the streets. Although pubs are restaurants are &quot;closed&quot; inside, they are allowed to sell takeaway food and alcohol. So there are many pubs open in Soho (for example) selling takeaway drinks and people are hanging around outside drinking and eating and having a great time. Street party!<p>Socially, there also seems to be less fear of the virus than there used to be. During the first lockdown, a lot of people were quite fearful of going out. Now, not so much.')
