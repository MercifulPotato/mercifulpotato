Getting a minimal judgement against your average &quot;living paycheck to paycheck&quot; person on the street isn&#x27;t worth your time in court. However it is &quot;easy&quot; to update that to a class action lawsuit against a manufacture where the average man on the street gets $5 and you take home big money.')
