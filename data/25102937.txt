Don&#x27;t mistake me for a hypocrite who decrys censorship only of things I don&#x27;t want censored. I&#x27;m not. People should actively discuss and advocate for positions they hold no matter the position. That&#x27;s free speech. There are few limits (openly inciting violence, plotting crimes1, copyright etc)<p>If a platform or audience doesn&#x27;t like that, they can drop free speech and become a safe space. That&#x27;s their business. But they shouldn&#x27;t censor speech and claim they are for free speech. That seems to be what is happening here.<p>Fyi, I haven&#x27;t kept up on antifa or the events around them. But my position is that looting is wrong. At the same time, I&#x27;m sure they are right about at least something. That&#x27;s a pretty safe, reasonable position right? Not on Parler. On Parlar that position is banned. And by banning my comment, you are banned from correcting me. How is that a positive for you or me or any other reasonable person? It only seems a positive for those who are too weak to bear hearing such simple positions. And even they are trading wisdom in the long term for comfort in the short...<p>Sorry. I feel quite strongly about censorship. It&#x27;s a foolish idea we should have dropped back when we still had Kings and lived in mud huts.')
