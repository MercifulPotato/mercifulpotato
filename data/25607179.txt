Consider these claims:<p>- There should be an accredited-author-ornly &quot;kernel wikipedia&quot; which the main one can choose to incorporate, almost like release vs staging branches.<p>- Different subfield way wish to keep their own intentionally biased corpuses, like <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ncatlab.org&#x2F;nlab&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ncatlab.org&#x2F;nlab&#x2F;</a><p>- After 6 months, virtually no one should have to read the original research article, because the librarian core will have incorporated it&#x27;s results claims (however controversial) into the appropriate articles<p>- Textbooks &#x2F; &quot;knowledge bootstrap plans&quot; should be continuously updated from the encyclopedia, not unlike how bootstrapping is managed in a package repo<p>- Librarians do the work, but also adjudicate disputes, as researchers will be naturally incentivized to contest how their work is incorporated as that is the primary way it is consumed.')
