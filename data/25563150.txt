Traffickers are more honest.<p>Had a recruiter from a Valley newcomer disappear on me for ~10 days, after having talked offers and how impressive the interviews had been. Then she called back out of the blue wanting to negotiate salary. I gave her my ask, and she wanted to low-ball, and then I gathered the VP, for whom I would be working, called BS on my ask, even though it was market rate and a bit lower than what a Valley resident would command. More radio silence. I had two much better offers and little pressure. It kept feeling like timed negotiating tactics to me.<p>Finally they presented me with a dumpster of an employee stock program offering to make up for their salary hair-splitting. I would have been more impressed if they’d given me an actual Monopoly board game with it, at least then the Monopoly money would have been tangible. Then I caught this recruiter in a lie about part of the company’s “newly conceived” ESP conditions. I backed away for a couple days, and hashed out the worst thing I could do in light of the employer&#x2F;recruiter wasting my time and scheming. Give that recruiter a dirty yes.<p>So I dragged them out telling them I was taking the job for over a week and to expect the offer letter as soon as I thought on it more. I never signed further, slowed any responses, and then I just stopped responding. Even got some angry text messages from the recruiter screaming, “TELL ME WHY!” The worst kinds of people, and you will find no sympathy from me.')
