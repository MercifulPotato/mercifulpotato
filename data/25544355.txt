I&#x27;ve found that the cleaning involved is burdensome. It&#x27;s recommended that you take the feeder down and scrub it with bleach every few weeks to prevent the spread of parasites between the closely packed feeding birds. Worse for me is that even when I can keep the feeder away from the local rodents (a non-trivial challenge), seeds fall to the ground and it becomes a hot spot for insects and rodents. The rodents here are causing major damage to my house and vehicles. It was just higher maintenance than I expected, so I stopped. But I do like having the birds around. Maybe I can start again after retirement.')
