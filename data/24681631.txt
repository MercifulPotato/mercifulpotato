Many ISPs perform NXDOMAIN substitution in their DNS resolvers and replace the “no such domain” response with a synthetic pointer to their own search page, which allows them to monetize all those No such domain” user typos. From Google&#x27;s perspective this NXDOMAIN substitution is not well regarded. Search is a major path to advertisement placement and advertising is Google&#x27;s core revenue. So how can Google&#x27;s Chrome browser platform detect network environments where NXDOMAIN substitution is happening? Simple. Test the DNS with its own nonce random string queries to see if NXDOMAIN substitution is taking place.</i><p>&gt; <i>This supposedly innocuous probe of the DNS should’ve been pretty harmless. But there is a lot of Chrome out there these days. Some two thirds of all browser use in today’s Internet is reported to use the Chrome browser, and the number rises when you include products such as Edge that are based on the Chrome engine. Consequently, it is perhaps unsurprising to learn that according to this report these probes are now taking up some 50% of the total root server traffic (Figure 3).</i><p>I understand that hijacking NXDOMAIN is bad, but Google is now &#x27;punishing&#x27; the root DNS operators with extra traffic when the actual perps are the bad-actor ISPs. A bit of collateral damage there.<p>And would it be so bad for Google&#x2F;Chrome to simply let the NXDOMAIN hijacking slide? They seem to be externalizing costs to help their business model.')
