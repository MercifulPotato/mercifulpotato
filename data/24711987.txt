Item(by='l00sed', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602100249, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24711502, text='OP here, there is a doc from Microsoft that talks about the changes from WSL1-&gt;WSL2, and WSL2 IS a VM. The reason it&#x27;s &quot;better&quot; than VirtualBox or VMWare is that it&#x27;s &quot;optimized&quot; for Windows. Which seems like a vague way of saying it uses their proprietary Hyper-V VM. I think what you&#x27;re saying is true though. If you want to have fine-tuned controls, I feel like VirtualBox is nicer. I don&#x27;t actually know whether or not you can go into the Hyper-V settings and manipulate memory or vCPU at all... maybe worth investigating.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;windows&#x2F;wsl&#x2F;compare-versions" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;windows&#x2F;wsl&#x2F;compare-version...</a>')
