You can&#x27;t optimize what isn&#x27;t measured and the vaccination programs that I know of are not sharing basic logistics data. In absence of hard data, people try to optimize systems based on hypothetical problems.<p>The U.S. seems unable to distribute their existing supply, Canada seems unable to acquire enough supply, the EU was slow to approve, and Israel seems to be firing on all cylinders. If we had better data perhaps we could do more than speculate about the emergent bottlenecks and best practices of each process chain.')
