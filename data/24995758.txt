If you roll a die twice and it comes up less than 4 both times, would you start looking for criminal intent?<p>It’s also worth noting that 538 doesn’t conduct any of the polls that feed into their forecast, and so aren’t pollsters in a relevant sense here. Their entire reason for existing is that they <i>agree</i> that there is systematic bias in polls so they attempt to model it.')
