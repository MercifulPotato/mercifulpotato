That leads to politicians stirring up anger and fear and their campaigns need a ground game to get people registered and to the polls.<p>I believe in a constitutional amendment that guarantees all citizens the right to vote, including convicted felons. Not only that, but every citizen should be <i>required</i> to vote (or face a fine, like in Australia). Forget voter registration pushes and poll vans. There should be a whole department of government whose job it is to go out and <i>collect</i> your vote, the way they collect your taxes.')
