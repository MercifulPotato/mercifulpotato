Not exactly illegal (maybe), but definitely not something that the cloud providers want to be associated with.<p>In Sweden we have Flashback.org, an old school PHPBB&#x2F;vBulletin-looking forum with a very strong free speech stance (attracting all kind of people, including those you can imagine being enticed by those rules). It&#x27;s of course not hosted on any cloud plattform, or using services from any big hip tech company.<p>Honestly it seems like a strange misstake for them to do, if you are dealing in one of these gray areas, you should probably find some hosting provider &#x2F; ISP actually interested in hosting you and just do it yourself.')
