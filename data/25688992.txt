Most posters are center-right and don&#x27;t advocate violence.<p>Do they also condemn or apply moderation to violence being advocated? Or is it condoned? Honest question, I have not even remotely invested enough time (nor do I plan to do so) to understand this facet.<p>&gt; I&#x27;ve reported lots of such tweets and sometimes they&#x27;re taken down, other times, not.<p>I agree that such messages should be taken down and condemned just the same.')
