It is interesting how applicable it is in authoritarian governments; you can&#x27;t simply praise, you must give enthusiastic encomiums. That is particularly interesting in business, where it may be obvious to business leaders that something is wrong, but anything lackluster brings about government condemnation, which is part of the problem the business people can see. Startup founders are usually sharp, rebellious individuals trying to upend current business practices, so the condemnations damper the business spirit to some degree.<p>(<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Damning_with_faint_praise" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Damning_with_faint_praise</a>)')
