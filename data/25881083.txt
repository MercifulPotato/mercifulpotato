One thing that is nice about using C though is that it is quite easy (compared to C++) to expose to other languages. Glib, and most libraries built on it like GTK, GStreamer, etc can be used in languages such as Python, JavaScript et.c.. And a lot of development of applications and tools has been moving to such languages over say C++.\nSo C is still useful for low-level libraries, due to being the lowest common denominator. Though arguably one could today write the library core in a better language like Rust maybe, and expose a C API&#x2F;ABI from that. Rsvg is growing into an example of that.')
