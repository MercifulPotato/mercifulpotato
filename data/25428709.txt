You&#x27;re the only one who can decide how to build upon your talents (even though EVERYONE else will have an opinion on that). If you hate research, then research isn&#x27;t your thing.<p>My point is that you shouldn&#x27;t sell yourself short by denying your talents entirely, as is being expressed in the post. Your talents are your edge, and an opportunity to make a difference (such as teaching in your case - talented teachers are the great amplifiers. They help the next generation discover and build upon their passions and talents, enriching us all). Talents in the right environments can foster passions.<p>But once again, people telling you what you should and should not do is a huge problem.')
