Mostly programming.  Or, really, editing program source code plus some haphazard IDE features I&#x27;ve bothered to hack in.<p>Emacs is definitely is not the only tool I need.  It is ill suited for graphical tasks, sure, but it is also not the best tool for email, web browsing, taking notes, calendars, and a wide variety of other things.<p>Sure, you CAN do most of those things in Emacs, but it&#x27;s not the best tool out there for any of them.  Emacs is a great IDE, but it simply doesn&#x27;t exist on most of the platforms I use all the time to make in a realistic contender.<p>Home surveillance?  Password management?  Backups?   Website authoring?  Keeping basketball scores?  Managing personal photos?   Learning a new language?<p>Literally (and NOT figuratively!) most tasks are better done not in Emacs, but some other tool.  I&#x27;m not sure why this needs to be said out loud.<p>Yes, like a piece of paper, you can use it for any of those tasks.   Almost anything can be viewed as a &quot;text task&quot;.  But it there are better tools out there for almost all of them.')
