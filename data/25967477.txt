So who else are the pharma companies going to ship those vaccines to, when the shelf life is weeks or months?<p>There is a global supply chain at work here, from the substances for the vaccines, to the equipment, and even skilled labour used to produce them.  Very little of that, if any, is subject to export bans.<p>The UK does not have an export ban on vaccines.  The EU is free to sign contracts with any vaccine supplier in the UK.  But history seems to be repeating itself again.  The EU hasn&#x27;t signed with Novavax, who have just passed trials.  The UK signed 5 months ago, and it will be produced in NE England.
