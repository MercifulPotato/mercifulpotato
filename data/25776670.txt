Then I went to work in France, expecting little issues with understanding the locals.<p>Turns out understanding a heavy Auvergnat accent is... difficult! I wrestled with the accent a couple of weeks, but after a while it &#x27;clicked&#x27;. This was pretty much a matter of &#x27;waking up and not having to translate it in your mind&#x27;, a very strange sensation.  I learned to distinct several accents: Parisian and Marseillais are different beasts, and Swiss-french is also different (I totally dig their counting system though, septante, huitante et nonante makes so much more sense).<p>Also, I learned that the french in school is nothing like the french they speak in France. Sure, you get by and they&#x27;ll understand you, but french relies heavy on vernacular, sayings and expressions.<p>Nowadays people think I&#x27;m a Walloon (French-speaking from Belgium, while I&#x27;m Dutch), which is a great compliment to me!')
