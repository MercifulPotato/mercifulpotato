This is one of the biggest lies being forced by the higher castes in the US. &quot;Smart&quot; is subjective, &quot;value&quot; is subjective.<p>Let&#x27;s be honest: this statement only true because a certain class of people want it to be true. I value k-12 education in my world view more than I value derivitaves traders: in my ideal world teaching would be a high-paying competitive field and Black-Scholes would mean absolutely nothing.<p>But I can&#x27;t tell if you don&#x27;t realize the world we live in is what me we make it, or if you just accept what you are told the world &quot;should be&quot; because you&#x27;re benefiting from the system and are scared to make it equitable.')
