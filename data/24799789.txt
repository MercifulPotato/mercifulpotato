Maybe it&#x27;s a matter of focusing on something you really enjoy.<p>You may have a point here, or at least you have made me think about it.. :)<p>As with many people around here, I prefer to do my own things rather than waste time doing &quot;work&quot;. Not that I&#x27;m lazy (as in sit on a coffee table all day), but I have lots of other interests. So I&#x27;ve been quite unhappy for the last couple of years because I&#x27;m going crazy (almost) trying to come up with ideas for monetizing side projects, so that I can live the dream. Unfortunately, similarly to you, nothing seems to be working.<p>I do also have a full time job (that is ok) and family to provide for, and they deserve the better parts of me. And I&#x27;m tired of going around in my head trying to come up with a miraculous idea and being unhappy in the process. Maybe I&#x27;m trying too hard to get out of the rat race, and although I consider myself technically proficient - i.e., capable of writing my own apps, maybe I&#x27;m just not as lucky as other people.<p>In summary, just to say that I am agreeing with you that maybe we (I) should just take it slowly, focus on something we enjoy and has (some) meaning.')
