It would be silly to compare people across countries when you have internal disparities such as in NZ residential pay NZ$250(€150&#x2F;USD$170) for 4gig symmetrical or pay NZ$70 (€40&#x2F;USD$50) 100meg symmetrical. If it made sense for a lot of  people in the country to buy the 4 gig plan then it&#x27;s price would skyrocket as it&#x27;s actually being used rather than just being sold to use slack infrastructure.')
