Part of me even agrees with it.<p>However, what I don&#x27;t see is that nVidia should have any obligation (ethical, legal or otherwise) of any sort to provide a Linux driver at all.  The demands of Linux developers and users alike seem particularly entitled.<p>Linux is the only mainstream kernel, free or proprietary, which doesn&#x27;t have a sane and supported driver interface.  And while I can see some of the justifications for it, I think after nearly 20 years they are starting to wear a little thin.  The way other out of tree subsystems, like ZFS, have been treated is appalling.  Deliberately using the GPL as a cudgel to beat other projects into submission is just plain nasty, and to treat other open source projects this way is spiteful and unnecessary.')
