It&#x27;s medium-ish sized (majority of the app is the moderator and administrator pages). It&#x27;s extremely fast to develop (and will only be faster with SvelteKit+Snowpack). It&#x27;s trivial to implement components and stores make state management a breeze.<p>Having done React for ~4 years, and some Vue projects, I won&#x27;t be going back to those anytime soon.<p>That said, it&#x27;s not without its own issues, but anything I&#x27;ve had issues with I&#x27;ve been able to solve relatively quickly or have someone within the community help.')
