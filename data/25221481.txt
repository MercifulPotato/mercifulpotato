Item(by='rossdavidh', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606409194, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25209616, text='Republican states tend to emphasize having a good labor market, and prioritize whatever gets employers to offer more jobs.  This is a positive good for wage-earners.  Democratic states tend to emphasize using government laws to require employers to do things like pay a higher wage.  This is also a positive good for wage-earners.  They both get lots of votes from wage-earners, and the ones voting for Republicans are not ignorant or blind.  They are suspicious (rightly or wrongly) of the effectiveness of government regulations to help them, and know from experience that a tight labor market makes their boss suddenly see the importance of treating their workers better compared to when there was a line of people waiting to take their job if they didn&#x27;t like it.<p>The difference between the two is mostly how they think it best to go about improving things for wage earners, who are the vast majority of their voters in both states.  Not saying this makes them equal, but the difference is not what you assert.')
