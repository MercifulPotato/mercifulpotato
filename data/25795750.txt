They don&#x27;t even build it themselves and it gets downloaded in binary form straight from Elastic&#x27;s servers.<p>If you don&#x27;t believe me, this is the line in the code where they &#x27;fork&#x27; in their build script: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;opendistro-for-elasticsearch&#x2F;opendistro-build&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;elasticsearch&#x2F;linux_distributions&#x2F;opendistro-tar-build.sh#L51" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;opendistro-for-elasticsearch&#x2F;opendistro-b...</a><p>It will be interesting to see if opendistro actually starts contributing to Lucene or adding value to the elastic code base or whether this &#x27;fork&#x27; is effectively frozen in time and doomed to go nowhere due to a lack of actual development on the core product.<p>I seriously doubt that they are going to put any effort whatsoever in that. Because in two years of pretending they have a fork, there has been no serious code contributions from their side at all that I&#x27;m aware off. Correct me if I&#x27;m wrong.<p>If you want to back an OSS version of related technology, maybe use something like Apache Solr, which continues to provide many of the same features and is part of the same ecosystem of users and developers that work on Lucene, which also powers Elasticsearch and which of course continues to contribute a lot to Lucene; unlike Amazon.')
