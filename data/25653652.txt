If you haven&#x27;t seen it in a while the original scope of the game ( spaceship based sim ) is quite complete and polished.  If all you want to do is hop in a ship, fight some pirates, do some pvp, missions or cargo hauling for credits to upgrade your ship or buy a new one its all there. Its a blast to play with a friend as most ships are multi-crew.\n</code></pre>\nThe scope creep has changed the goal from &quot;Best damn spaceship sim&quot; to &quot;Best damn space sim&quot;.  So yea the apple pie is going to take a while to bake.')
