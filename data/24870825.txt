I had a few thousand dollars worth and I became quite paranoid that my coins could be exfiltrated at any time due to:<p>* The Bitcoin client software I downloaded (I didn&#x27;t build from source, and even if I did, I wouldn&#x27;t have read the entire source first, and even if I did, I could get Ken Thompson&#x27;d)<p>* A computer virus delivered in a game I install, or hardware drivers I update, that would be virtually undetectable until it&#x27;s too late<p>* A fire that destroys my home &#x2F; somebody compromising off-site backup of my private key (pick one or the other risk)<p>* An untrustworthy exchange or an exchange that is unfortunately compromised at the moment I choose to transform them into Real Money(tm) -- while I kept my coins in a wallet off an exchange, I would still need to turn them into USD someday since the dream of paying for ordinary things directly with Bitcoin is wheezing on life support<p>Some of those concerns can be mitigated with a hardware wallet, but not all, and you still must have faith in the people who designed the hardware wallet and the manufacturer who actually built it.<p>At least with traditional banking, if my trust is violated I usually have some recourse by which I can recover my money. E.g. if my PC is hacked and the hacker transfers money from my bank account, as long as I see that happen within a few days I can probably have the bank stop it and get my money back. With crypto one false move and you lose your stuff, do not pass go.<p>In short, the &quot;trustlessness&quot; protects me from a pretty low-risk problem -- I would say practically a hypothetical problem at least in the U.S. -- but exposes me to a high-risk problem.')
