Apache is fixated on Java, and Java seems to only attract a certain kind of developer. Even Java web applications, which aren&#x27;t constrained by available UI toolkits, tend to look like they were written in Java (for example, all the AWS UIs). I think the language fails to attract design&#x2F;UI&#x2F;UX people.')
