Yes, the $1mm number I cited in my post is the estimated raw cost of a full mask set for a relatively modern process in the 2Xnm or smaller range.<p>Definitely older processes have much cheaper mask sets -- in part because there are just fewer metal layers, and fewer &amp; cheaper masks required to image the transistors when the wavelength of light used (193nm) is close to the line width of the devices themselves.')
