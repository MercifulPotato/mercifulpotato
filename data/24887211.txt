It&#x27;s about risk of coercion to employees of companies. The US government could be turning babies into hand bags but if it doesn&#x27;t coerce it&#x27;s residents into acting against their employers then it doesn&#x27;t create a risk for companies.<p>edit: Seriously, this was all in the original sentence that you people keep cherry picking from.')
