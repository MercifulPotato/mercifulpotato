E-Trade is stuck in the 90s but sell you a hardware token that you can use for logins - donâ€™t know what happens when the battery runs out.<p>Not a brokerage but PayPal has 2FA w&#x2F; totp but with them the problem is they might decide to seize your funds at any moment with no explanation or recourse so I would not keep a balance with them.<p>I think that is it for the US - every other bank either has no 2FA, or they allow you to bypass 2FA with SMS, they disable 2FA every thirty days and make you use your password and&#x2F;or SMS to login and re-activate it.<p>Biggest tragedy was when NIST decided SMS was better then nothing for 2FA and dropped all the language against it in their publications. Before that I could point to them and say here are all the problems with SMS, now pro-SMS people do the same to me.')
