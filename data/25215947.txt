Bunch of other great console tools here too, if folks are interested.<p>Makes me think a bit of one of the original-ganger XML namespaces, pim&#x2F;space[2]. Spaces for your personal information management. There are very old threads for this, going way back.<p>I&#x27;d say Atom Publishing Protocol came close. We think of Atom as an RSS competitor, but it was part of a broader general information organization &amp; manipulation effort with Atom Publishing Protocol, which included more about ways to manage &amp; append &amp; write information, into feeds, which existed in collections, across workspaces[3].<p>Tim Berners-Lee is still hard at work, trying to distill out a useful, general means of wrangling one&#x27;s &amp; other&#x27;s information. The team seems to have just released Inrupt, their implementation of the Solid specifications for linked data[4]. Which is helping power some of the latest BBC &amp; NHS &amp; NatWest (a bank) systems[5].<p>Personally I think Personal Information Management is a wonderful white whale for folks to chase. We can land it, &amp; it will make a huge difference to all if we do. As for where we are now, I rather enjoy the JSON-LD &amp; SOLID &amp; Linked-Data world, think there are great specs there, for building better general systems atop, and hope we can start to rebalance some of the questions of control over computing &amp; data with these more general systems.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hunden.linuxkompis.se&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;13&#x2F;my-desktop-november-2020.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hunden.linuxkompis.se&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;13&#x2F;my-desktop-november...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.w3.org&#x2F;ns&#x2F;pim&#x2F;space" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.w3.org&#x2F;ns&#x2F;pim&#x2F;space</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tools.ietf.org&#x2F;html&#x2F;rfc5023#section-8.1" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tools.ietf.org&#x2F;html&#x2F;rfc5023#section-8.1</a><p>[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25211816" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25211816</a><p>[5] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;money.yahoo.com&#x2F;nhs-data-creator-sir-tim-110816726.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;money.yahoo.com&#x2F;nhs-data-creator-sir-tim-110816726.h...</a>')
