Inventing a new currency that is, for a little while, hard to track by the government isn&#x27;t a real solution, it&#x27;s just pretending the problem doesn&#x27;t exist.<p>The government is persecuting WikiLeaks financially because that is easy to do. Even if a cryptocurrency were to take off as a currency and still be untraceable, the government would just move on to some other form of persecution. The real problem to be addressed is the persecution of a useful legitimate organization by an ostensibly democratic government. The form that persecution takes is secondary.')
