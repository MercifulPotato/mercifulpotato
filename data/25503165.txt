Item(by='randycupertino', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608614576, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25501771, text='I recently finished &quot;No One Would Listen&quot; by Harry Markopolos who was a whistleblower who spent YEARS and resigned from his other jobs trying to alert the SEC about Bernie.  It was pretty outrageous how the SEC passed the buck around interoffice like a hot potato literally sending the investigation to and from the DC to NYC office and back again.  It&#x27;s a great read although Markopolos comes off as somewhat (deservedly) self-rightous: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;No_One_Would_Listen" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;No_One_Would_Listen</a><p>As for the &quot;how does it happen&quot; root cause of the fraud, in my perspective it&#x27;s a bit like trickle truth.  They start with one small lie - maybe keeping two sets of books, and get away with it for five years.  Hey, that wasn&#x27;t so bad, let&#x27;s open a few shell companies for our shell companies and offshore some funds to get out of taxes.  Wow, we got away from that, let&#x27;s do a capital call and double it.  Then they start doubling down and because it&#x27;s easy money they spend it on lavish things, need more income to offset loses.  Like you mentioned- turns into a vicious cycle.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;No_One_Would_Listen" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;No_One_Would_Listen</a>')
