Item(by='chairmanmow', descendants=None, kids=[25676012, 25675508], score=None, time=1610043220, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25673655, text='I wouldn&#x27;t invest in BTC at this point - although it&#x27;s a safe long term position, the capital injection required to move the price is pretty high as I think the market cap&#x27;s around 600 billion. I HODL for now with Ethereum because of the utility factor as I also built a dapp although it&#x27;s pretty much unusable these days due to gas fees - once those come down I&#x27;ll starting spending ETH again minting strange ERC-721 tokens for my own amusement.<p>I&#x27;ve been watching the prices&#x2F;news&#x2F;volume recently on crypto generally - and it seems clear a lot of new people are entering right now with a poor understanding of the environment and that creates opportunity in the alt-coins.  Look at something like Ripple which if people were informed about current news should be falling off a cliff but still seems to 3rd in market cap and sometimes having rallies that outperform coins that haven&#x27;t been more or less labeled by the SEC as fraudulent.  Although this seems irrational to me, I think understanding those newbie conceptions opens up opportunities for some bigger gains than on Bitcoin - yesterday I decided to buy something that was certainly the days winner on coinbase that went from 5 cents to around 15 cents overnight (tripled in less than 24 hours) and I wasn&#x27;t totally surprised - it&#x27;ll probably slow down a little - but still worth holding on.<p>The reason there was quick money to be made?  Investing in something with a low-market cap relative to the others (also easily available on coinbase) - and maybe also a recognition that new buyers might like coins at certain price points.  I looked at that coin and I saw the market cap was 30 million dollars (about $50 million behind the next closest on Coinbase), wasn&#x27;t a total dud and also looked at the volumes of transactions happening on the market as a whole to see there was action happening anywhere and everywhere.  I said to myself, if Bitcoin has a market cap of 600 billion, then to move the price 1% requires an additional 6 billion dollars injected there.  If you take 1% of that 6 billion, 60 million and it went into that alt-coin (which is just about what happened) - it&#x27;s a 200% gain overnight. For that to happen with bitcoin it would require 1.2 trillion dollars going in, not likely.  Now will I sit on this alt-coin until retirement age versus a BTC?  Nope - but in the short term if you&#x27;re looking for moonshot consider what it really takes to move BTC price.')
