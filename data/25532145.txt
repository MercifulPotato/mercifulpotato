The salary of employees is conditioned on a multitude of factors, mostly relating to supply and demand, industry norms, the quality of their work, how much better they are than the median employee, etc etc. Profits made are obviously a factor, but less so when there&#x27;s a high supply of potential workers.<p>tl;dr: You get paid based on what you can demand. Money and power are never given, they are only taken. I have been both in a position as an employer and an employee and people who worked for me didn&#x27;t get raises unless a couple things were true: they were good at their job (i.e I valued and needed their labor) and they went to me to demand more money. If you don&#x27;t demand more money (or are not in a position to demand more money, like many low-skilled employees), you&#x27;re (probably) not going to be paid more.')
