Sometimes SCOTUS rules for it (eg when public defenders were first required) but recently they&#x27;ve ruled solidly against it (eg voter Id laws).<p>Personally I don&#x27;t think the current US civil society would wear such a classification and deciding the edges of it would be messy.<p>But I think it&#x27;s logically and morally correct.<p>It always surprises me when US colleges go on about diversity of race but no one really takes much interest in diversity of socioeconomic background.<p>Here in the UK we are similarly picky about what discrimination is acceptable. Maybe in another generation or two people will be ready for a more thorough review of things.')
