Data locality, page swaps, and cache-line misses are typical concerns of high performance systems engineering.<p>Regarding &quot;complexity&quot;, not sure what you mean. IIRC, someone, possibly even me ;), may have pointed out to Rich Hickey in the early days that Java code could also use those (Java or was it Scala) STM libraries. So, there is your &quot;complexity&quot; behind an API, just like Clojure.<p>&gt; Clojure has all the facilities that Java has, by definition.<p>Ergo, a situation where Java can -not- be made as fast or faster than Clojure code seems unlikely.<p>I think all we have here is you claim of &quot;complexity&quot;. I remember Rob Pike making a comment along the lines of &quot;prefer libraries over language semantics&quot; or something like that in context of Go language design. I find it a very compelling argument, based on my overall experience to date.')
