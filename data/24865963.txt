Any function with a finite integral over the real line can be turned into a probability distribution easily, and there are other functions that can be used in places where you would normally use a probability function, even when they don’t integrate to a finite value over the real line. (For example, improper priors in Bayesian analysis.)<p>“Function that can in some contexts be treated like a probability distribution” is just too long.')
