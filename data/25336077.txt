You don&#x27;t easily question the natural (seeming) background of your life.  An art work or book or song could be radical in the context of what came before, but you have at best a fuzzy idea of what &quot;before&quot; meant.<p>Of course we all miss out on interesting things going on, all the time, but not for the same reasons (or scope) as when we are &quot;coming of age&quot;.')
