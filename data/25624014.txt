My job involves consistent writing of 50% Clojure, 40% Java, 3% Kotlin, 3% Scala and another 3% of others (Python, Javascript, HTML, SQL, etc.). And so as I actively code in both Lisp and Algol syntaxes (and wtv Python is), I definitely always miss my structural navigation and editing features in the non-Lisp languages. So I&#x27;m guessing you kind of just forgot how nice it is.<p>Having said that, there&#x27;s some disadvantages to the Lisp syntax as well, rightward drift due to constant nesting is real, and can make readability and even some edits a lot more annoying, whereas the flatter structure of other syntaxes doesn&#x27;t have this problem as much. I still find its pros outweighs the cons personally, but your mileage may vary.')
