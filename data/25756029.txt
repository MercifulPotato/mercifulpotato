But I&#x27;m not sure if thats good enough. Presumably if CI&#x2F;CD was set up, some of the engineers would have had security credentials to configure any build servers anyway. And if the hackers could leverage that, they might have been able to just infect the build servers too.<p>As annoying as it is, I can&#x27;t help but think we need to bring parts of ios &#x2F; android&#x27;s security model to our desktop machines. Its ridiculous that a single rogue npm module can access any file on my computer, including SSH credentials and (probably) secure cookies in my browser&#x27;s trust store. Our desktop security model is obsolete, and should do more to protect us from threats like this.')
