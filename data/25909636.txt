If hundreds of thousands of Russians were re-infected this would be observed elsewhere and documented.<p>The closest thing I can find to reporting on this matter is here [1]. The Siberian Times does not appear to be a reputable news source [2], and its claims do not match the magnitude of those above. It reports that Russiaâ€™s chief sanitary doctor Anna Popova said, &quot;in Russia there was not a single confirmed case of coronavirus reinfection.&quot; Furthermore, the doctor on the other side of this disagreement has &quot;heard about other cases [of re-infection] elsewhere in Russia from colleagues&quot; (and claims to have been re-infected).<p>This is not &quot;lots and lots (hundreds of thousands)&quot;...<p>There <i>is</i> evidence of re-infections in the scientific literature, but they are exceedingly rare (tens of people worldwide). Long-term immunity will have to be measured, especially in light of new variants, but current evidence points in that direction.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nextstrain.org&#x2F;ncov&#x2F;europe?transmissions=show" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nextstrain.org&#x2F;ncov&#x2F;europe?transmissions=show</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;siberiantimes.com&#x2F;other&#x2F;others&#x2F;news&#x2F;virology-professor-hits-back-at-russian-chief-doctors-claim-of-no-covid-19-reinfection-cases&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;siberiantimes.com&#x2F;other&#x2F;others&#x2F;news&#x2F;virology-profess...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;The_Siberian_Times" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;The_Siberian_Times</a>')
