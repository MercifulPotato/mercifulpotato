Is the FTC able to retroactively split up a company that was originally formed via large mergers and acquisitions? Split out e.g. Youtube from Google as it was originally an acquisition? That seems unlikely to me but I don&#x27;t know much about it at all.<p>If you can&#x27;t do that, then you&#x27;re basically just preventing a monopoly from happening in advance, right? Or trying to at least.<p>At any rate, I&#x27;m assuming US vs. Google will be required to reference precedent set in Sherman &amp; Clayton + subsequent court rulings and _not_ be able to use their own mergers against them as they were approved by the FTC in the first place. Is that also correct?')
