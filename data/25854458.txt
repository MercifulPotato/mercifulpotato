The German government did not say &quot;we are taking all the Jews and gassing them&quot;, they said they were taking criminals, traitors, and their sympathizers, and sending them to re-education camps where we will use labor to re-educate them.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;training.ehri-project.eu&#x2F;nazi-concentration-camps" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;training.ehri-project.eu&#x2F;nazi-concentration-camps</a><p>&gt; During 1933-34 some 100 concentration camps existed throughout Germany, and more than 100,000 detainees went through them. The purpose of the camps was correctional because detainees of &quot;Aryan blood&quot; were to be &quot;re-educated&quot; by means of violence and hard discipline, slave labor and propaganda in order to make them give up earlier ideas and beliefs and merge into the conformist “Volksgemeinschaft” or &quot;people&#x27;s community,&quot; which the Nazis proclaimed.<p>It was not until later that the extermination was really ramped up, and it was not until after the war that the full scope of the genocide was revealed. And as another commenter pointed out, there actually were multiple different types of camps, some which <i>were</i> labor camps (such as auschwitz), and some which were extermination camps (such as sobibor).<p>Now, you claim to be arguing that the re-education camps are not concentration camps, but the plain words of your argument make it clear that you agree that the re-education camps indeed fit the definition of a concentration camp.  Instead, you seem to mainly be arguing that concentration camps are not necessarily so bad, since they don&#x27;t involve literally mass murdering Muslims, and that they are actually necessary (??), so you prefer not to call them concentration camps since it has bad associations.<p>But understand that yes, it is entirely appropriate to compare the Chinese concentration camps to the Nazi ones, because just on the basis of the description <i>you gave</i> of the Chinese concentration camps, they match the description of the camps as understood by the German public at the time, and some prisoners actually were treated in that way.')
