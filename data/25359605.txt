There are no other words for this policy. YouTube is deciding what of true and enforcing its perspective on the rest of the population.<p>And you know it won&#x27;t stop here. From now on, every time a controversy emerges between the media-tech-academia elite view of the world and the views of regular people, tech will use hard censorship to enforce the elite perspective. There is no natural stopping point or limiting principle.<p>It is not the place of a few Bay Area policy people to decide for the whole world what is true and what is false. They are not God. Nobody voted for them. They have no power except the brute force of a natural monopoly&#x27;s market share. Infrastructure companies must be part of the neutral background of technological society, not enforcers of a specific worldview.')
