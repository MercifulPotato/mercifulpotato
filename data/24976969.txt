I tried emailing them to dispute it, or at least try to figure out what supposed &quot;commercial use&quot; they suspected, but nobody ever replied. Plus, I think I may have only ever used it for like 20 minutes a month to do stuff like move a recipe into Dropbox so I could share it with a coworker, or start a Steam game downloading.
