You make a decision and, regardless of what you chose, end up in the same place. The amount of decisions that actually stick, or actually change your progression through the game, are very low. &quot;Do x or y&quot; where both X and Y cannot be undone and seem like heavy decisions, ultimately do not change the outcome of any future story items. Side with Ben or side with Jill, doesn&#x27;t matter, they both treat you the same afterwards and it never mattered at all which you picked.')
