So the bad actor is &quot;spoofing&quot; as someone trustable within your org (or outside it). But is does prob need some social-engineering for a bad actor to truly exploit this.<p>But the threat is still sever since the above logic only holds up to the point-of-entry, once the worm has infected someone the people forwarding it around are truly trusted.')
