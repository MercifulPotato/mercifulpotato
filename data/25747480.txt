Item(by='Gollapalli', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610462528, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25744828, text='&gt;Is AWS selling something like water &amp; electricity, a basic neutral service needed for many businesses?<p>This is what I find so disturbing about the Parler fiasco. Every tech person I know has interacted with AWS directly at some point. Everyone any of us knows has interacted with something reliant on AWS. What&#x27;s the percentage of web services that run on AWS now? It&#x27;s well over a third IIRC. AWS is essentially indispensable at this point. It might very well be called a technological utility.<p>Moreover AWS&#x27;s core market has, historically, been startups. Parler, being a startup, was in their core group of customers, dealing with a service that had effectively become ubiquitous among startups. They were an American company, with a CEO and investors and users and capital.<p>Being a B2B service, bordering on a technological utility, rather than a B2C online community like Facebook or Twitter, the idea of AWS banning users seems almost a category error. The idea of AWS banning an American startup would have been unthinkable to me before it happened.<p>EDIT: Moved some phrases around for clarity.')
