I think alot of people forgot the lessons of 2000. Take Palantir, a company that is 11 years old and for the past 3 years has lost 600M a year. What monopoly will this company carve out for itself to achieve this lofty valuation?<p>Or lets look at doordash [1] despite the pandemic and most of its workers not being employees(low paid gig workers) it is still losing money at an astounding rate: $533M last year and with a pandemic bump of only a 149M loss this year so far(it expects orders to slow alot after the pandemic).<p>I feel like I am Michael Burry in the big short playing my drums pointing out the obviousness of the huge crash that is coming with alot of these companies. What is scary is alot of americans and foreigners for that matter have their retirement savings(401k) tied up into these mini-titanics. When the fed&#x27;s tap gets turned off, expect a reckoning.<p>[1] -  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;beta.trimread.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;51214" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;beta.trimread.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;51214</a>')
