In embedded and real-time applications, using a high level (GC&#x27;ed) language like Haskell is totally out of the question.  D and Rust might be feasable, but typically lack the FFI you need for integration.  I mention this because I recently wrote a DSP program for a (eurorack) synthesizer module, and C++ was pretty much the only sensible option.  And I actually used variant in that codebase, even sending a (trivially copyable) variant over a RT queue to separate RT thread from UI.  And std::visit was pretty useful in that context.  I dont think it makes sense to rant against particular language&#x2F;library features.  Almost all of them are there fore a reason.  It might just be that you dont see the reason right now.  The design space for code is huge.')
