Most drivers can drive their cars.<p>Understanding is about understanding of aspects. They may well not understand the engine aspect (how it works precisely) but &quot;Most drivers can drive their cars&quot; means they control their cars, which means they <i>understand</i> what happens when a steering wheel is turned, and how not to grind the gears, and not to hit accelerator and brake together. They model it. That is the embodiment of their understanding. Without that they could not control a car.<p>&gt; Why, thank you for...<p>Quite clearly there was a question mark at the end it to indicate my implied doubt. Science seeks better understanding of x so it can manipulate x more precisely.  Please give me a couple of examples of complex systems which we don&#x27;t understand but can control, so I can understand you better.')
