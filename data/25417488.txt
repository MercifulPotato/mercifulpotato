But when one system can be used to compromise all the nodes in an org, is it really worth it? Diversity is good for security.<p>I understand that Solarwinds is a reputable company with all the right security auditing and compliance credentials. That&#x27;s why they are used by US federal and state government agencies.<p>Perhaps the criteria (MBA&#x2F;Audit&#x2F;Management driven security) that governments use to judge vendors is useless against real world attacks? If I wanted or needed to be compliant, I would buy that software (like all the other gov agencies), but if I wanted to be secure, I would not.')
