As a maintainer of an open source project, I frequently have to say &#x27;no&#x27; to features. Usually this takes the form of encouraging a plugin that implements the feature rather than adding it to the core library.<p>Bug reports on the other hard, even if they&#x27;re as simple as someone misunderstanding a feature, are worth taking. If it&#x27;s a real issue you can fix it otherwise it might be an opportunity to improve documentation. My only requirement is a reproduce provided. I&#x27;m not going to spend lots of time hunting down an issue based on something vague.')
