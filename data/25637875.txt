As the city grows, it requires refactoring roads and public transit to keep things going.<p>I recently got the Industries add-on, and found that also adds an interesting dimension: as you add factories, they require more of certain types of raw materials and I find myself wishing I had made the farming zone bigger, for example, debating if I should raze this nearby 5-star neighborhood, reroute a well-flowing multi-lane highway, or start a second zone somewhere else.<p>I kind of like I can get it to an equilibrium and stop, while not feeling like I&#x27;m leaving it unfinished.
