The iPhone wasn&#x27;t the first phone to use a capacitive touchscreen, but for a while, it seemed like it was because nobody else could produce devices with them in large volumes.<p>People used to dismiss Tim Cook as &quot;just&quot; a supply chain guy. But I think it&#x27;s become clear that supply chain management is at least as important to Apple&#x27;s success as anything on the design or marketing side.')
