FS2020 is also very buggy still (including crash to desktop after restarting a flight, etc), although getting better.<p>That, and there are not many plugins, add-ons and aircraft models available yet for FS2020, although it&#x27;s growing. The default built-in aircraft have many missing features, buttons, autopilot modes, etc - which prevent folks from using these as &quot;study level&quot; simulations.<p>As of right now, serious simmers still use X-Plane&#x2F;Prepar3d, but maybe that changes as updates roll out for FS2020.')
