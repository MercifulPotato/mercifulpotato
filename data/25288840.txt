It&#x27;s a relatively recent phenomena that stock grants equal or beat cash comp, and 99% of employers in the US don&#x27;t grant any stock to anyone below the C level. A lot of places don&#x27;t have any bonus, or do a pro-forma &quot;Christmas bonus&quot; type of thing - I worked one place where every February 1, every person in the company got a bonus that was 7.5% of their salary, no matter what.<p>Comparing a FAANG&#x27;s total comp to your total comp is a fool&#x27;s errand. You need to compare cash to cash unless you are also getting a variable performance bonus <i>and</i> stock grants. $190k for an E5 at FB (which is basically &quot;Senior Engineer&quot;) is still above-average for the US as a whole but it&#x27;s not insane. You can certainly reach that in Chicago or DC or Austin but it might take a level higher and a few extra years. I can say pretty confidently that you&#x27;re not going to be making $380k (FB E5 total comp) in Chicago or DC or Austin unless you&#x27;re doing HFT and even then you&#x27;re not likely to get anything in terms of stock that could provide long-term value, it&#x27;s going to be mostly bonuses and probably $150k cash comp.')
