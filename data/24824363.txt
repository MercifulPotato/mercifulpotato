As I understand it, litigation financing takes away some of the financial risk from plaintiffs and&#x2F;or attorneys by allowing them to borrow against a future return from a judgment or settlement. For plaintiffs, they can get access to money when a normal bank would not loan against an uncertain recovery. For law firms, they may be able to take cases on contingency without having to advance all of the costs of litigation. Loans are non-recourse, meaning that if the plaintiff loses, then the lender is not repaid and has no way to collect. As you might expect, the interest rates on these types of loans are incredibly high.')
