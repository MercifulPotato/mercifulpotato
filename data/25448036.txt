Stupid, right? Well, the same principle applies for TLDs.<p>I&#x27;m not denying that there&#x27;s some intrinsic political arbitrarity in assigning numbers&#x2F;names to people and companies (and accepting the use of those numbers&#x2F;names) but adding countries into the mix makes the problem much worse.')
