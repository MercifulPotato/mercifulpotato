The question is whether the politicians have the will to act.<p>Emerging carbon capture technologies can sequester atmospheric CO2 at low enough prices.<p>Last I checked, the prices were between $15-$75 per ton, which translates into $0.15-0.75 per gallon of gasoline burnt.  Other carbon fuels would have similar costs per energy produced.<p>We need to transition to a carbon-negative economy as quickly as possible.  Current atmospheric levels of CO2 are not sustainable.')
