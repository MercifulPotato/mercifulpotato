Item(by='andrewmcwatters', descendants=None, kids=[25296743, 25299333, 25296603], score=None, time=1607035380, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25296078, text='No, that’s pretty much the number one reason someone would purchase equity in a company.<p>I don’t know where the concept of dividends dropping the value of a company came from, but from a transactional point of view it doesn’t make sense. Sure, there are more earnings that have not been retained for increasing future earnings, but the value does not drop correspondingly. That’s just not how companies are valued.<p>3% of earnings going to shareholders just does not at all mean the company drops by 3% in value. Companies are valued in a number of different ways, but not one of them is based on a 1:1 proportion of earnings. Earnings multiples, yes, but what you’re suggesting is companies drop equivalent to being valued at a P&#x2F;E ratio of 1.<p>A company making 1 billion in earnings is not worth 1 billion dollars. Certainly not a majority of the time, at least.<p>I am well aware of this myth, but not from where it originates. Yes, certainly cash on hand drops which affects valuations, but not by as much as you’re suggesting.<p>I don’t understand your comment about stocks not producing cash flow. You’re buying part of a company. You’re not buying the certificate.')
