So as a devils advocate question: what is the advantage of writing your spec in a spec language vs having it written in a (sufficiently well typed) language and generating the spec from that?<p>Especially when you have one dominant language that most of your code is interfacing with, having the the interface be hand written with idiomatic code for that language is a lot nicer than everyone having to work with auto-generated code that is often not as nice.')
