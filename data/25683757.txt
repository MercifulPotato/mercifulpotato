The power to sanction is losing the zest it once had. Russia has been building relationships that surpass mere political ties. They&#x27;ll be fine.<p>Two. Maybe you don&#x27;t know you&#x27;re governments history. Maybe you don&#x27;t care. I would say ask the middle east and South Americas, the history of any non-EU country that tried building national infrastructure using loans from the world bank and dead democratically elected presidents all over the Levant, Douth Americas and Africa.<p>Should I especially mention Libya?
