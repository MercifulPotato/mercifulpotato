Item(by='rlpb', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603981581, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24929287, text='&gt; Change your CTAs from being labelled &quot;Buy&quot; to &quot;Buy a limited license for on-demand viewing over an indefinite period of time&quot; if that&#x27;s what it is.<p>It should be the other way round. If it said &quot;Buy&quot;, the buyer is deemed to have been sold it and owns it. If it turns out the buyer did now own it to sell it in the first place (eg. someone else held the rights, not the purported &quot;seller&quot;), then the seller now owes the buyer a refund.<p>The situation should be dealt with just like any other fraudulent misrepresentation&#x2F;misleading labelling, whether driven by a corporate marketing department or not.')
