Item(by='opan', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606952919, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25275592, text='Seconding this. I&#x27;m a big fan of the NEC P462. The port selection is really diverse. DisplayPort, HDMI, VGA, S-Video, Component, Composite... the list goes on. (some adapters from BNC are needed) It also supports sync-on-green. It feels like I could hook up anything to it. I suspect if you go much newer than this model, you&#x27;ll lose some legacy ports.\nThe remote is also way cooler than a normal TV remote. Inputs have dedicated buttons. I can switch between DisplayPort and HDMI without using a menu. You can also mute the speakers and have headphones plugged into an aux jack for sound.<p>I found it at an auction by chance and have looked for them occasionally since. I recently got a second one for around $100.')
