It&#x27;s a functional placeholder for now, still a significant bump over what it replaced, but only temporary.<p>My plan is to wait for Socket AM5 to come out, and get the last-best AM4 offering to stuff into my existing motherboard. That may be complicated by BIOS and chipset support (which effectively means a socket-generation-increment even if the physical connector is the same), but we&#x27;ll see how far my B450 can take me. And at the time, I&#x27;ll be adding a discrete GPU, since I&#x27;ll surely be going to a non-APU chip.')
