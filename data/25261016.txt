Note that this doesn&#x27;t include third party repair shops. To me, this indicates a large industry dedicated to repairing Apple products - hardly a niche industry. To me, this indicates that a large amount of Apple devices need repair, something that Apple is hostile to.<p>Also while AppleCare is easy and convenient for the customer, Apple&#x27;s &quot;geniuses&quot; do not do board-repair, they simply replace and throw away broken logic boards (which sometimes all they might need is a simple 10 cent capacitor). If that wasn&#x27;t as bad, they actively prevent other businesses from performing component level repair by blocking access to spare parts.<p>&gt; I&#x27;m guessing big old servers running 24x7 are in this category: Recycling the materials into new computers takes a lot of energy, but just running the old server takes a huge amount of energy over its life compared with the newer, faster, more efficient ones you could make from the same materials. I would be surprised if not recycling was less harmful than recycling.<p>If that was the case, then of course, we should recycle. Maybe we should have a case-by-case approach depending on specific products? I&#x27;m totally willing to go wherever the evidence leads us. As of now pretty much every single environmental organization promotes reuse over recycling for electronics.<p>&gt;When saying Apple should change they way they manufacture to be more like other manufacturers for environmental benefit, Apple being rated number 1 tells you that the advice is probably incorrect,<p>I merely accepted the &quot;number one&quot; in good faith at face value. Digging further with a cursory Google search, things seem a lot more nuanced. That being said, I have no idea what &quot;number one&quot; even means without context.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fastcompany.com&#x2F;40561811&#x2F;greenpeace-to-apple-forget-the-robots-and-make-iphones-repairable" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fastcompany.com&#x2F;40561811&#x2F;greenpeace-to-apple-for...</a>')
