A sort of &quot;on this day&quot; for my life, with room for a daily journal entry.<p>It&#x27;s already running in production, and collecting my backups, social media posts etc. I add new sources on occasion.<p>Unfortunately, it&#x27;s really hard to access my own data on other services without relying on manual imports. The biggest hurdle is getting my photos, which Google Photos is holding hostage. There isn&#x27;t an easy way to export text messages from various apps. I&#x27;m not too sure about Google Calendar either.<p>It shows how little control you have over your own data.')
