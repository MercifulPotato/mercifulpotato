For example, with the iPhone &amp; iPad, Apple owns both the OS and the CPU. On the Watch, Apple has integration with the iPhone and the best wearable CPU.<p>How can Apple bring a unique enough experience to the car to get the margins they command on their other products? Perhaps they wouldn&#x27;t get the 30% plus margins they get elsewhere, but I can&#x27;t see Apple spending so much effort to get the slim 5-10% margins you see other automakers getting.')
