The middle class of farmers in the antebellum south would barely have been able to afford one, the plantation owners were stupendously wealthy. This, in part, explains why the south was able to wield such outsize political influence.<p>Very bleak, but slave owners had a large economic incentive to make sure their slaves were fit for work (although that didn&#x27;t cause qualms on other, more brutal forms of mistreatment). The only way they treated them well was in providing food, but that wasn&#x27;t due to kindness but more from the same motivation to feed a team of draft horses well. It&#x27;s tough reading, but some of the ledgers kept by plantation owners really drive the point home that they viewed slaves more akin to livestock than people. And they somehow justified what they were doing as christian and moral.')
