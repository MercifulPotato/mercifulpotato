I don&#x27;t blame the phone for it, its very hard to achieve with small sensors, and the iphone is probably the best of the bunch. But it doesn&#x27;t make the picture quality near &quot;good-enough&quot; for that scenario.<p>With slightly better lighting it can be &quot;good enough&quot; to be hard to distinguish from a bigger sensor camera for &quot;web&quot; where &quot;web&quot; really means ~6inch phone display - and that&#x27;s great, but let&#x27;s not fool ourselves ;-)<p>I&#x27;m also curious what the max will look like - though at the size and price it&#x27;s difficult to say if buying a RX100 and a cheaper phone isn&#x27;t a better option still, for many.')
