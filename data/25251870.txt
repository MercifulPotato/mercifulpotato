If they go no further, then it&#x27;s fine. But &quot;not likely&quot; is a bit too soon to say until they&#x27;ve gone a while without further limitations. That is, unless you consider something like the Mac equivalent of Project Sandcastle running on outdated hardware to be an acceptable situation, which appears to require a jailbreak of their stack anyway. There&#x27;s simply nothing stopping Apple from going that route, and some years of incremental changes to MacOS that have inched it closer. Again, I&#x27;ll believe they won&#x27;t do that when they stop taking those incremental steps. Until then, &quot;nope&quot; really just means &quot;not yet&quot;.')
