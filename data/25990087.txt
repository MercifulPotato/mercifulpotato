Being &quot;asked to cross an imaginary river&quot; etc is a great way to unite the humble employees in their universal loathing of their woefully mis-guided management. Always had a niggling feeling that the &#x27;bad games&#x27; couldn&#x27;t be that bad by accident.\n(&quot;Look, everybody hates everybody - could we push some more hate towards us, so they at least talk to each other?&quot;)<p>Or there are the &quot;split into small groups to do a task&quot; tasks, which are usually won by teams where one person &#x27;just does it&#x27;, whilst the rest are bickering around how to break down the task and assign r&amp;r. \nAgain, not sure if this is the point, but you very rapidly notice which of your colleagues are both loud and useless.<p>Oh and final whine, &#x27;the prizes&#x27;\nThere doesn&#x27;t need to be one - but if there is, could it please be something that&#x27;s actually wanted?
