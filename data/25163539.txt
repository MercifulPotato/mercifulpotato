I find it easier to visually spot the difference between the == and === ligatures in Fira Code or Cascadia Code than between the non-ligature forms and counting the spaces in between the lines. Your mileage may vary of course, but in most cases after several years with Fira Code I find the ligatures in general are much faster for &quot;at a glance&quot; precision than some of the non-ligature forms.')
