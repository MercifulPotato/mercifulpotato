This sort of criticism is inappropriate (or at best, poorly framed). This is Hacker News, and this is a Hack.<p>If I made a bot that drives cars around in GTA would you make a post ridiculing how dangerous my lane detection algorithm would be for a self-driving car in snow?<p>Furthermore, the point OP makes about L5 cars being presumably achievable while &quot;L5 software&quot; is not is a 100% valid point - why should we not aspire to that level of consistency and effectiveness in our systems? Maybe achieving this is actually possible and projects like this inspire the approaches that actually deliver those capabilities in a production-mature form.')
