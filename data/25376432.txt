Item(by='x1798DE', descendants=None, kids=[25376761], score=None, time=1607623344, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25373524, text='FYI, some of the sites on there that bill themselves (or have billed themselves) as &quot;public domain&quot; actually use proprietary licenses that are not compatible with public domain declarations. I find it very frustrating that &quot;public domain photos&quot; turns up unsplash, pexels, pixabay and a bunch of other sites that have licenses with terms like, &quot;cannot be used to make the model look bad&quot; and &quot;cannot be used to create a competitor to our site&quot;.<p>For many use cases, these licenses are perfectly fine, but they aren&#x27;t compatible with actual CC-0 declarations (or even CC-BY), so if you are trying to create permissively licensed derivatives, you must avoid them.  It may be worth marking those ones with an asterisk or something to avoid misunderstandings.')
