The main culprit : meteor supports react, not preact. I found a workaround at first but when getting a bit more serious it made sense to switch over to the mainstream and avoid unnecessary pains. \nMigrating from preact to react was easy,  except for the render method arguments that I had to manually move over. Overall I like preact for small projects with little dependencies, and react for larger enterprise project where your just want as little pain as possible. Most react libs have to be forked to work with preact.')
