But I&#x27;m not sure what you want here. Do you want me to stop building things in Rust? Or is it ok to build things in Rust, but I shouldn&#x27;t share them? Or is that ok, but if people like it enough to reach the top of hacker news, its just another RIIR (rewrite it in rust) project?<p>The anti-rust backlash is so interesting to me because the Rust community is by far the friendliest programming community I&#x27;ve been a part of. And theres so much high quality new and interesting work being done. Trivializing that really rubs me the wrong way.')
