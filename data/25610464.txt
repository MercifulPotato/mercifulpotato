The market has realized that killing large numbers of foreign people and overthrowing foreign governments is good for domestic economic growth, and therefore happily operates in the US. The US defense budget is huge, and in turn it&#x27;s a huge portion of taxes on market participants, and they&#x27;d figure out a way to make it stop if they weren&#x27;t getting their money&#x27;s worth, precisely because markets <i>are</i> good at solving problems and not wasting money.<p>The Swiss have their bank accounts, yes. You could convincingly argue that people who are happy to accept low gains as a tradeoff for low risk are interested in avoiding war. But the world&#x27;s largest <i>markets</i> are in the US. And before they were in the US, they were in the capital of the British Empire.<p>Markets are very good at solving the sort of problems they solve. But be careful about extrapolating that into &quot;Markets are very good.&quot;<p>(Also, don&#x27;t forget about the British East India Company.)')
