There&#x27;s a non-zero amount of games that are lost not because of skill, but because of another player trying out a new hero or build, someone having an off day, poor team composition, or the team chat degenerating into an all out flame war. If that happens, there isn&#x27;t much that can really be done, and one is stuck in that doomed game for another half hour of unpleasantness. That&#x27;s definitely a frustrating experience.<p>As you point out, the ELO system is fair, but it&#x27;s also a rather noisy metric. Players can be skilled with some heroes while being completely awful at others, and the ELO rating is only a singular value that has to capture this range of player ability.')
