They were definitely not first to market with 3D-NAND but my gut feeling is that was because of the engineering focus on Optane.  AFAIK they and Kioxia (toshba) were leading the charge on PLC memory.<p>All of that is ignoring the fact that there is absolutely a benefit for Intel to have vertical integration in this area.
