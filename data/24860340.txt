EVs are certainly responsible for some emissions.<p>But ICE cars share all the &quot;Emissions&quot; you mention (Tire rubber dust&#x2F;oil&#x2F;windshield wiper fluid etc.), plus the massive emissions of just burning gasoline increasingly inefficiently over the lifespan of the vehicle. Plus wasteful oil leaks and just oil burning over the life of the vehicle; the environmental cost of shipping oil and gasoline all over the planet; the environmental damage from massive oil spills and small gasoline spills from everyday fill-ups; transmission fluids, the list goes on and on.<p>EVs aren&#x27;t perfect in terms of the environment, they aren&#x27;t even <i>great</i>, but they are a metric ton better than ICE vehicles.')
