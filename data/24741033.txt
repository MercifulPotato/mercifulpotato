Item(by='codelord', descendants=None, kids=[24742482, 24742854], score=None, time=1602356234, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24740385, text='I got my BSc in computer science and PhD in machine learning, and ended up working in a top FAANG AI research lab.<p>In the hindsight both when doing research for my PhD and also when working as an engineer I felt the most useful courses from undergrad were linear algebra, algorithms, calculus, operating systems, and statistics in that order. I ended up filling the gaps in my math education later by reading textbooks and taking online courses.<p>IMO an undergrad program should focus on very fundamental theory. If I was in charge of designing CS programs I would quadruple the amount of credits required in math and specifically in linear algebra. You would be surprised how handy and applicable linear algbera is in ML, CV, robotics, computer graphics, finance, etc. etc. Calculus is also important but to a lesser degree.<p>It&#x27;s a waste of time to teach TensorFlow or teach the trendiest neural network architecture at school. The knowledge becomes irrelevant in a few years, and it&#x27;s fairly easy to pick it up by reading docs&#x2F;papers if you know the fundamentals.')
