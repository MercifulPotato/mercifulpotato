I admire Steve Wozniak, and love what he did to the world.<p>At the same time, I fear that he has picked a weird way to address climate change.<p>It is VERY unclear from the beginning what Efforce actually is. Almost at the bottom, you see it&#x27;s an ICO.<p>Perhaps we can describe it as the equivalent of a carbon offsetting marketplace, just for energy?<p>Well, if that&#x27;s the case... It doesn&#x27;t need a blockchain, and it doesn&#x27;t need a token. It can be done, today, in dollars and euros.<p>If there&#x27;s a token, and a token sale, Efforce and its founders will benefit from it, even if their efforts will not positively impact the world. That&#x27;s unfair.<p>Why not, instead, reward them in a &quot;normal&quot; way - create an energy efficiency marketplace, earn a commission on the energy &quot;traded&quot; there, voil√†. No blockchain, no token sale, no bullshit.<p>Am I wrong? If so, what did I not understand?<p>Edit: I see that EFFORCE is listed&#x2F;tradeable, and apparently worth ~$950M already, which makes me even more suspicious...
