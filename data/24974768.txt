Press releases are almost always complete BS from companies when it comes to tech, again not all but most, we saved x using some dubious calculation.<p>AWS makes some things easy sure, but at my house I have what would cost $15k a year and I spent ~1500 all-in including 10G switch(used) power use is a joke, even with expensive electricity where i am AWS still a ripoff.  Same processors as AWS essentially as he was quoting, 10G to my home nodes that need it and bobs your uncle.  And I do tensorflow things at home too, i bet that would cost 30k&#x2F;year, i do it for $1500 BOUGHT and for another $500 for a 3080 or a few in my servers and id be saving tons.  Yeah it can go down, but just buy two or a rack, its going to be cheaper than AWS hosted colo.  I could scale this myself to a few thousand servers, ive seen it done wrong so many times.....<p>The truth is more like he mentioned in hist first paragraph, if you have a fan boy at the helm it doesn&#x27;t matter if he&#x27;s CTO he knows it all, Ive worked with a lot of CTO&#x27;s lately they don&#x27;t have a clue and I feel sorry for them, wasting so many company assets because underlings couldn&#x27;t possibly know more, i love the x google&#x2F;facebook guys saying basically scrap everything re-architect its funny and so wasteful but at least they are making more money than me!<p>One guy said he hates Jenkins, some teams have hundreds of jobs in jenkins that work just fine, he said it should all be redeveloped, some of the stuff has been working fine for 10+ years, not sure he has company interest in mind, he want&#x27; everything to be &quot;serverless&quot; its the same damn thing effectively genius.<p>Hire some sysadmins to run your show, the good ones cost a ton, and computers at their core haven&#x27;t really changed much in 20+ years  nor has the fundamental way the internet works.  Good experienced sysadmins can save you a ton and its just as reliable.  You just have to trust experience over advertising and real math over funny math.')
