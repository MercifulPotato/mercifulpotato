Item(by='tacon', descendants=None, kids=[25913320], score=None, time=1611629824, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25911368, text='With &quot;mountains of evidence of fraud&quot;, and more than one person alone who could have pulled this off, that means there was a conspiracy.  Let&#x27;s say there were a hundred people minimum in this conspiracy.  When someone tells me how the election was stolen, I just ask them to name two of the conspirators.  Just two, any two.  Conspiracy is so much easier to prove in the courts than the actual crime.  But all I get are blank stares.  &quot;Fraud!&quot; by utterly nameless people.  It&#x27;s like the voting machines changed themselves.<p>The real tell is if these patriots keep digging to find and expose the conspirators in the &quot;steal&quot;, or if somehow all interest in the fraud is lost when Trump is not going to be President.  If their efforts will not reverse this election, how can the patriots stop from protecting the next election from the conspiracy?')
