Will they suddenly end up unemployed with a skillset that is primarily based on violence and imposing control? Even if they have used those skill for what they believed to have been positive goals, when they need to feed their families, who is going to be the buyer for those skills? Hopefully the government has considered this and has some sort of plan for easing these people into other lines of work.')
