At the end of the day, who are we protecting when we silence hate speech?<p>Are we suggesting that we ourselves cannot handle hearing and rejecting the speech, or are we suggesting that other adults should not even hear hate speech because they might be influenced?<p>Either of those is a profound infantilization of the public.<p>I am capable of hearing hate speech and rejecting it.
