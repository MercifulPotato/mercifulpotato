Perhaps it&#x27;s the tone and lack of enthusiasm for all things systemd.<p>In the matter, I agree.  I&#x27;d think unlocking of the filesystem ought to be happening in the boot-loader (either GRUB or ROM resident).  Systemd will only be able to do so, if the root fs (typically holding &#x2F;etc with plenty of stuff worth protecting) is unencrypted.  It seems to me this feature was added to systemd just because they can.')
