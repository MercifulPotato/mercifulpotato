Therefore lisp is objectively harder to read for humans. If you have never read other code and is super familiar with lisp it is easier to read, but anyone with experience with both will find other languages much much much easier to read thanks to the much better UX design.<p>I don&#x27;t see how you can argue otherwise. It is as if you have no clue at all about how UX works. You can&#x27;t get used to everything, there is a hierarchy of syntaxes, and lisp syntax is just plain bad for humans.')
