Item(by='azernik', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607989953, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25419074, text='&quot;Country&quot; is also ambiguous. Lots of &quot;countries&quot; are not independent, e.g. the UK is made up of four &quot;countries&quot; - England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. Similarly, the &quot;Land&quot; example I used above for the German federal subjects literally means &quot;country&quot;.<p>&quot;Governmental actor&quot; would be a better international-friendly term for use in computer security, outside of the parochial world of US national security discourse.')
