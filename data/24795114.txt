I care about my managers but I don&#x27;t care about the projects. I hate my work.<p>There are so many things in life that I am curious about like singing, drawing, gardening, bird watching, etc. I&#x27;m not good at any of them (nor do I wish to be) so they won&#x27;t bring me any income. Every day I put my curiousness aside to code some stuff to make my managers look good.<p>I can&#x27;t quit my job to take a break because my wife and kids depend on my salary for money. My neighbors are suffering more because they are not in tech. They are trying so hard to have my life and I try my best to help them get into an industry I don&#x27;t even like.<p>Money brings so much suffering and our entire society is built on it. Society is greedy and wants to expand infinitely too! Everything in nature must eventually be owned my someone.<p>It seems like the only way to escape is to become a CEO, make millions, and buy a bubble of eternal happiness as Ryan has done.<p>I hope I don&#x27;t end up behaving like his former board member.')
