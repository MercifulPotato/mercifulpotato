Interviewer was not subtle in thinking that was stupid.<p>My rationale was - and is - that C is not sexy. It&#x27;s hard to motivate people to look into it, and it&#x27;s often hard work because a sort algorithm or a lookup table tend to be compartmentalized, while C issues are diffuse - they&#x27;re literally everywhere, and they don&#x27;t always show up on a flame graph. On one project I got a 2x improvement in overall performance by fixing issues that weren&#x27;t visible in the perf output, and would have been invisible on a flame graph (this was before flame graphs).<p>C is particularly a bigger issue once you consider Amdahl&#x27;s law. A 20% slowdown in a linear part of the code can show up as a second-for-second slowdown in response times, while a search algorithm that&#x27;s only a small part of an overall process, or parallelized, you can make it 10 times faster and might only see a 2% improvement in response times. If you avoid allocating more servers, for a new feature, nobody celebrates your achievement. You have to do it wrong the first time for anyone to notice you.')
