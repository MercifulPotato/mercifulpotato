Every new report is translated to &quot;it&#x27;s not done yet&quot; with an excuse, which is probably why you were deemed a slacker.<p>Also in my own experience I can get carried away with the side tech -- spending a few days setting up a monitoring system and things like that -- is it really needed or are you scratching an itch? Small companies can&#x27;t really spare the time to set up the enterprise-grade tooling if it&#x27;s not one and done.<p>Maybe you are actually slacking, it took me a while to accept the reality myself anyway.<p>To directly answer your question: go to the meetings. Meetings are a way to reset your slacker status to &quot;not a&quot;, no matter how boring or pointless they are or how accurate it is (it&#x27;s why managers love them). They&#x27;re also sometimes a decent way to share information with the team without relying on having written it up nicely if you get to talk before the snacks come out.<p>Of course this is just one guy&#x27;s assumptions and opinions. They could just be jerks.')
