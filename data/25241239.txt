I think the key difference will be in the topic&#x2F;market focus. The creator&#x2F;artist market (e.g., Patreon) is different enough from the researcher market that I don&#x27;t think people browsing Patreon (on average) would be interested in backing graph neural network research, for example. From there, it will be about tailoring the platform to researchers&#x27; (and their backers&#x27;) needs which could include a bunch of things like facilitating connections between other researchers and &quot;advisors&quot;, (hopefully) being able to provide cloud&#x2F;GPU discounts, having different standard rewards (e.g., a backer&#x27;s name listed on a paper), etc.<p>If there is enough interest, I&#x27;d definitely want to expand to other areas, but AI&#x2F;ML seemed like a good place to start since it&#x27;s where I&#x27;m most familiar and there&#x27;s not much overhead in terms of needing lab space, etc.')
