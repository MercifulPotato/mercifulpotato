Item(by='st_goliath', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602495648, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24750849, text='&gt; Why is anyone using NFS?<p>I use it a lot because the Linux kernel can mount it as rootfs during boot with little more than a few boot commend line flags. This IMO comes in very handy when working on embedded systems (at least when they have Ethernet and a sane boot loader).<p>My development setup looks pretty much like this: My workstation is connected to the board and has DHCP, DNS, TFTP &amp; NFS servers running on that port. Outbound traffic from the board is routed across the workstation and possibly passed through tcpdump or Wireshark.<p>The boot loader on the board would get an IP from my box, then load the kernel &amp; device tree from the TFTP server. The kernel would then do the DHCP dance again and mount the NFS rootfs from my box.<p>I can simply recompile the kernel, power cycle the board and have it boot into the new one with all the new&#x2F;changed modules available in the rootfs; or recompile some user space software I&#x27;m working on, install it into the rootfs and have it available on the board immediately.<p>The only other options I can think of would be 9pfs and SMB. Support for SMB as rootfs was only quite recently and 9pfs would require some initrd trickery.')
