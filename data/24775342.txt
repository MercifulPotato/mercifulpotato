He says at time of printing the experimental value is 2.97275 but the best theoretical value they had was 2.7 plus or minus 0.3 as the calculations were so complicated. The things are full of quarks and gluons going all over the place. If doing one proton is so hard a whole universe is going to be tricky.')
