Your implication, that society is better off with high levels of taxation, is not supported by the science on the matter.<p>The evidence strongly suggests economic development is most rapidly achieved through adoption of pro-market policies.<p>The last 30 years has seen the largest most rapid reduction in the global poverty rate in human history, and almost all the decline in poverty was due to economic development, which economists have concluded was massively facilitated by the spread of market institutions like property rights:<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theatlantic.com&#x2F;magazine&#x2F;archive&#x2F;2010&#x2F;07&#x2F;the-politically-incorrect-guide-to-ending-poverty&#x2F;308134&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theatlantic.com&#x2F;magazine&#x2F;archive&#x2F;2010&#x2F;07&#x2F;the-pol...</a><p>2. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.csmonitor.com&#x2F;World&#x2F;2016&#x2F;0207&#x2F;Progress-in-the-global-war-on-poverty" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.csmonitor.com&#x2F;World&#x2F;2016&#x2F;0207&#x2F;Progress-in-the-gl...</a><p>3. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.economist.com&#x2F;leaders&#x2F;2013&#x2F;06&#x2F;01&#x2F;towards-the-end-of-poverty" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.economist.com&#x2F;leaders&#x2F;2013&#x2F;06&#x2F;01&#x2F;towards-the-end...</a><p>There is no reason to assume that this relationship between pro-market policies and high rates of economic growth stops existing for advanced economies.<p>We see indications of it manifesting across the developed world, like the superior performance of Hong Kong and Singapore relative to other developed economies, or Iceland relative to other Nordic countries, or in cross-European studies correlating low tax rates with high economic growth rates.<p>Economic growth is the primary source of all improvements in quality of life, so we should have policies that maximize it. It is how an advanced economy comes to be that way.')
