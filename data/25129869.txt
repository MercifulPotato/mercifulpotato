And people will time shift energy consumption when incentivized. If we were able to charge cars at work, for example, that would shift massive amounts of load to peak solar hours, when electricity will be essentially free on the generation side, and transmission&#x2F;congestion costs will be the major factor.<p>We are well on our way to making enough batteries to replace our car fleet. If we do that, we will have already built the industrial manufacturing capacity to store several days worth of energy.<p>I forget the numbers, but a huge proportion of wind and solar installs are planning foe good chunks of battery right now. The contracts I&#x27;ve seen indicate a storage cost of $80-$110&#x2F;MWh, which is cheaper than new nuclear, and pretty much in coal territory.<p>The future is one of super abundant renewable energy, with the huge fractions of it thrown away, unless somebody can figure out used for it or ways to transmit&#x2F;store it.')
