Comment from an independent expert:<p>&quot;Research has shown vertically aligned – or even just well distributed – carbon nanotubes have far greater properties than randomly placed carbon nanotubes,&quot; said Dr. Shearer. &quot;I am not surprised a x10 in conductivity is possible. Controlling the placement of carbon nanotubes is really the way to unlock their potential. The issue in commercialization is the cost associated with producing aligned carbon nanotubes. My guess is the cost would be much more than x10.&quot;<p>Even if it was x10 the cost right now, I would expect that cost to go down a lot as the engineering gets better. Looks interesting.')
