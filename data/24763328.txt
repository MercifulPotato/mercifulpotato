Because I have written a lot of Cython over past 5 years, and unless my python code is monumentally stupid (and in that case I can get an order of magnitude or two speedup by just writing sane python), I have never seen anything close to 100x speedup in real world code. Even getting a 5x speed up over a baseline python&#x2F;numpy implementation requires a fair amount of refactoring to make the code more cython friendly.<p>Same with Numba, despite its promises, I&#x27;ve never seen anything close to 100x speedups in the real world, and I&#x27;ve even seen a fair few cases where numba resulted in slower code compared to &#x27;pure&#x27; python&#x2F;numpy (although admittedly that was 2-3 years ago)<p>Sure I could probably design some pathological code where you might see 100x speed up by just adding type annotations, but that would probably require starting with some really inefficient python code.')
