I don&#x27;t get cadence data, but I could with a pedal magnet thing if I actually cared.<p>Their reddit is also heavily astroturfed, which makes me never want to do business with them again.<p>Kudos to them for figuring out how to make 100%+ margins, I guess. It&#x27;s just very much not for me.')
