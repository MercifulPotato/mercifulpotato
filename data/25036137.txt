Being able to make strangers say, &quot;He&#x27;s not a narcissistic asshole, he donated to the ACLU!&quot; makes me think that&#x27;s specifically an image he tried to project of himself onto others and succeeded for some.<p>But I don&#x27;t know the man, so I&#x27;d rather think it was just a donation.')
