This is explicitly stated in the &quot;limitations&quot; section.<p>Second, getting a decent control group is almost impossible. Essentially no one in modern society is unaware of COVID or the recommendation to wear a mask, and essentially no one had failed to form an opinion on whether or not they will comply with that recommendation. And indeed, &quot;variable adherence&quot; is another factor called out in the limitations.<p>The summary could be reworded &quot;having one more doctor tell someone to wear a mask does not make them less likely to contract COVID-19.&quot;<p>This study is very much <i>not</i> about the efficacy of state- or nation- wide mask mandates.')
