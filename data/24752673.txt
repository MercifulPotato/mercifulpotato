It could be based on a TON of other things instead: take the ID, passport, driver&#x27;s license, legally prevent them from leaving the city, etc etc.<p>Obviously, none of them are perfect, but I don&#x27;t think they are generally worse than ability to pay. Especially for rich people, ability to pay bail means nothing, so they could very easily leave the country if none of those other interdictions are set anyway.<p>So the bail system it&#x27;s really just an oppression tool against the poor. Not unlike debtors&#x27; prisons, really.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Debtors%27_prison" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Debtors%27_prison</a>')
