Or did you ask the same question after Equifax was hacked?  I&#x27;m not sure I can take that question seriously.<p>As for ID or no ID, it seems odd that demanding ID, still ends up with all of these airbnb horror stories, yes?  Thing is, VRBO checks out landlords more stringently than airbnb, and also charges slightly more.<p>ID doesn&#x27;t give control, although I suppose it gives the illusion of it.')
