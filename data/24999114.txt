I don&#x27;t remember exactly (it was years ago on the last attempt), but it was something small like the cursor position being slightly different after some operation like shifting a line.<p>My &quot;problem&quot; is that since I&#x27;ve been using the same editor for 30 years, I don&#x27;t tend to think too much about the manipulation of text. So even the tiniest of behavior changes is unsettling to me.<p>Though I could probably adapt.<p>I should try it all again (maybe not emacs, but something), and really set up everything well for auto-complete and such (mainly C and Rust).  My current vim setup (using pathogen) is sort of a mess.')
