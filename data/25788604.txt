This shows just the semi-portrait of the person playing.<p>Z shows the view from a second webcam mounted above the keyboard to display the keys and the fingers.<p>X is the view of just the virtual keyboard from a Synthesia window, where the pressed keys are highlighted.<p>S is all three previously mentioned scenes combined in one nicely arranged view.<p>Audio from the digital piano is also a source for scenes in OBS.<p>OBS provides a virtual camera that can be used like a normal camera in most, but not all conferencing software. For example, the preinstalled Skype in Windows 10 doesn&#x27;t recognize the virtual cam, but Skype Desktop from skype.com does.<p>It&#x27;s not perfect, but - I think - a decent setup, quickly built with only a laptop, one extra webcam and free software.')
