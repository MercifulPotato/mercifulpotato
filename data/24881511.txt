Tivoization is one problem. If you have GPLv3 in your (embedded) product, you must  provide tools to the customer to reflash it. Many corporations don&#x27;t want that, and in cases where type appovals are required it might be illegal. Think of a car owner reprogramming the engine control unit or the brakes.<p>That&#x27;s probably all not very applicable to gdb, but corporate policies might not allow such a nuanced perspective.')
