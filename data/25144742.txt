Against a company the size of Disney, with incentive to make the case as long and painful as possible to try and discourage other creators from trying to get what they&#x27;re owed, it would likely take thousands of man hours, and tens of thousands of dollars out of pocket. Between discovery, filing fees, appeals, all for a victory that would result in (and I&#x27;m just completely guessing based on essentially no data) only hundreds of thousands of dollars. Lawsuits can very much end up being pyrrhic victories based on the costs incurred alone, not to mention the emotional toll that fighting a protracted legal battle can inflict upon a person.')
