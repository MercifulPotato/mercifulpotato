And once you do git becomes far more intuitive. The key concepts to understand are commits and refs. To a first approximation a branch is just a variable ref and a tag is a constant ref. A commit is a node in a generally sparse upside down tree and refs are pointers to said nodes. Once one realizes that then pretty much everything makes sense. For example the difference between rebase and merge is how they affect the structure of the commit tree.')
