Adobe had app exporter functionality for Flash back in 2010. There&#x27;s even drama surrounding it. If you remember Steve Jobs&#x27; famous &quot;Thoughts on Flash&quot; - that wasn&#x27;t a mea culpa for not supporting browser plugins. Apple was seriously considering banning all third-party development tools to stop Adobe from getting Flash games on iOS, and &quot;Thoughts on Flash&quot; was written and published to justify that ban. The FTC threatened to sue and Apple backed down a few months later.<p>I should also point out that you seem to be remembering the days of Flash 5-8 where development was primarily on the timeline and AS2 classes were fancy new tech. By the time Adobe and Apple were feuding over Flash, most developers were using AS3, which was a lot more like modern JavaScript development. Hell, Adobe was specifically pushing to make AS3 the next version of JavaScript. You could still develop AS3 on the timeline, but it was less powerful than AS1&#x2F;2 and most developer resources assumed all your code lived in separate files using Adobe&#x27;s APIs to interact with the display list directly.')
