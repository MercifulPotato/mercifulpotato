Not a whole career yet but it&#x27;s something. I love writing software, but I cannot wait to escape production internet services. There&#x27;s nothing glorious or noble about them. It&#x27;s a pain in the ass and I&#x27;ll let other engineers who seem to like making it their life&#x27;s work. Investing so much energy in a company who just pays me is not worth my lifetime&#x27;s career. Luckily doing it for a few years pays well, and software skills are lucrative for things besides managing internet services. So escape is palpable.')
