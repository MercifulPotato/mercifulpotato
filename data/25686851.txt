I&#x27;m afraid it doesn&#x27;t debug the web app I&#x27;m working on nearly as well as Chrome -- I think something is misconfigured with our Sourcemap settings -- and that has made it slide from my first choice).<p>One thing I especially love is Vivaldi still carries forward the mouse gestures I learned in Opera years ago, and they work so much better built-in than trying to use an extension&#x2F;plugin.')
