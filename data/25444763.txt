Here in Austria they did a round of free mass testing. The plan was to test the whole population, however only 17% of eligible people showed up. They just don&#x27;t care.<p>In fact, acquaintances asked me &quot;why did you get tested if you didn&#x27;t have any symptoms?? don&#x27;t you have anything better to do with your time?&quot;.<p>For the next round of mass testing they are considering paying people â‚¬50 just to show up!')
