They&#x27;re happy that they&#x27;re hyper educated, that their kids are going to be hyper educated, that their healthcare is paid for, and they get lots of vacation. Because you can&#x27;t save, you are entirely dependent, in a broader sense, on the government&#x27;s stability (I am not using this sentiment in a pejorative sense like some might.)<p>Americans want their fair share of the pie, which will always lead to certain people making more and others making less. Compensation is more than just money to us. It&#x27;s vacation, stock, better healthcare, expanded education resources and benefits, buying programs, etc... This can be both good and bad. I suspect you can find an endless list of rosy and dark examples to draw from. Most Americans would like to think of themselves as quite independent from the government, whether they want to admit it or not.<p>The value in risk and reward versus security and stability is just different. It&#x27;s okay that they&#x27;re different too. Personally, I believe letting people leave the US without monetary penalties so they can pursue cultures that more match their own values is the solution. I once thought that having a system setup so that people could switch places between countries might be beneficial, one that augments the current immigration system.')
