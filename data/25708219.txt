Telegram did not used to surface NSFW chats on iOS to comply with the App Store. But you could still join the channels manually. However, on a whim Apple decided that wasn&#x27;t enough and now you cannot access those at all on iOS, you get a message saying it&#x27;s blocked.<p>Of course, it wouldn&#x27;t be able if they were committed to equal treatment, so the counterexample here are the many Reddit apps on iOS. You can join NSFW subreddits and they are allowed so long as they aren&#x27;t shown by default. The only explanation is here Reddit is used by Apple employees or they know there would be an outcry if the rules were evenly applied.')
