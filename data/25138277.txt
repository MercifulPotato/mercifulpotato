Then moved to Telecom and it was Python, C++, Javascript, Oracle, and MongoDB. Few years later I&#x27;m working on Cloud (AWS, Azure, Golang and .NET Core). Again after few more years it&#x27;s Golang, C++, Image Processing, machine Learning, ReactJS and AWS.<p>In a span of 6 odd years having to learn all this, it&#x27;s been taking toll on me as I didn&#x27;t know where I was going with all this. Hence the feeling of being lost :-)')
