Item(by='scarygliders', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605496789, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25106316, text='+1 for Qt.<p>I dumped GTK a few years back due to - and I have no idea if the same thing happens today - weirdness with GTK themes not working between minor releases of it, and I vaguely remember there were other annoyances but by then I was impressed with Qt and the PySide (noe PySide2) bindings so stuck with it.')
