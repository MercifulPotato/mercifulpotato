Item(by='sneak', descendants=None, kids=[24680780, 24680682], score=None, time=1601830978, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24680081, text='I think a lot of it is perhaps fundamental attribution error, which is ridiculously common in people.<p>I actually tend toward the idea that people that manufacture and sell potentially harmful, but inanimate things are in no way responsible for their final use (or misuse).  They&#x27;re not forcing anyone to take these drugs, nor is the prescriber, nor is the pharmacist, nor is the truck driver who drove it to the corner store.<p>That said, I also recognize that while the person who put the opiates into a human body is the ultimately 100% responsible party for any harm caused by those opiates, the fact remains that many people would choose such self-harm in various circumstances (such as massively addictive drugs being prescribed by their doctor), and that we must consider the effects of <i>circumstances</i> on people and their decisionmaking.<p>Treating people as sheep that are entirely dependent upon their circumstances to determine whether or not they make good (in your and my view) choices is the wrong move, however.<p>Ultimately though, it&#x27;s simply not the fault of the manufacturer or vendor if adults misuse their products.<p>There seems to be a lot of support for ending the drug war in the United States.  (I&#x27;m one of those people.)  If that happens, opiate addiction seems to become much more likely, as opiates will be cheaper, safer, and more plentiful&#x2F;available.  I guess I&#x27;m just not sure where the outrage at this manufacturer comes from, given the disaster that the drug war&#x27;s been.  What they&#x27;re doing is (mostly) legal, and the parts that they&#x27;re trying to hang criminal charges on shouldn&#x27;t be crimes.')
