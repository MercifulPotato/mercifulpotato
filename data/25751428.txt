I&#x27;ve built microphones before in a college laboratory where all we used (proved) was &quot;any object that vibrates from sound, which can be used to alter an electrical current, can be turned back into sound&quot;<p>Even the most basic form of digital audio stored as PCM (redbook, etc) is actually nothing but a file where every data-point in the file is an integer representing the &#x27;magnitude&#x27; of a disturbance during that short milli&#x2F;microsecond of time.
