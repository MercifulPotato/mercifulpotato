Item(by='1996', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610888298, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25810171, text='&gt; Not just through the letters, but little slivers of light under each one.<p>My pet peeve too. I hate that, as it doesn&#x27;t happen on Microsoft Surfaces.<p>If it can&#x27;t be fixed due to the different travel distance, give me instead a RGB led per key and I will be coding funny patterns to work around the issue (ex: red keyboard backlight at night, with a green for the important keys like enter, and blinking F keys if I got activity on a terminal)')
