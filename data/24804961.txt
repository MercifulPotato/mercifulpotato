Has anyone ever surveyed successful people at large on their views on rationalism? I wouldn&#x27;t guess that most successful people are rationalists but I would definitely bet that a very significantly higher number of successful people are rationalist then the population in general, even if it&#x27;s still a small number.<p>Then again, having a stated preference for philosophical camp at all probably corresponds highly with success against the population who is totally uninterested or hasn&#x27;t gotten enough education to be exposed.<p>Either way I don&#x27;t buy the premise.')
