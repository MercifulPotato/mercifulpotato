I personally have my own on-prem arm64&#x2F;amd64 K3s cluster, including a basic 4-node Minio deployment, so I’m very interested in getting local deployment up and running myself. We’re a small team and we’ve been focusing on getting a couple well-defined use-cases in order before adding support for running Opstrace in custom and on-prem environments. It turns into a bit of a combinatorial explosion in terms of supporting all the possibilities. But we definitely want to support deploying to custom infrastructure eventually.')
