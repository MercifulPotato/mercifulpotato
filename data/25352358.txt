Item(by='JoshTriplett', descendants=None, kids=[25352716], score=None, time=1607466691, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25351942, text='The most common thing I&#x27;d want to do with location information is display it on a map. For instance, I&#x27;d love to use this to help coordinate meeting up with someone, so that we could each see each other on a map. I&#x27;d also like the client-encrypted private historical record for a variety of purposes; everything from &quot;what path did we walk on that romantic evening?&quot; to the mundane &quot;where did we park?&quot; or &quot;where did I leave my phone?&quot;. All of those need map integration, and that map integration needs to not compromise the privacy properties of the location service. <i>That</i> would be well worth paying for.<p>The issue is that I wouldn&#x27;t want to use a <i>separate</i> mapping application for that. I don&#x27;t want to use Google Maps for directions&#x2F;navigation&#x2F;restaurants&#x2F;etc, and a separate app for location sharing. I also don&#x27;t want Google Maps to have my location information&#x2F;history. I&#x27;d pay for an all-encompassing map service with this feature, and privacy would motivate me to happily pay for that even though Google Maps is &quot;free&quot;.<p>But I can&#x27;t honestly say I&#x27;d pay for <i>just</i> the location feature if I still have to use a different (and non-privacy-preserving) mapping service for everything else. If I can have a single &quot;Maps&quot; application on my device, and that application preserves privacy, I&#x27;d <i>love</i> to pay for that; if that app also has location sharing, that&#x27;s even better.<p>Messaging or Signal integration would be for the same kind of &quot;meet up&quot; purpose: send someone a link that gives them time-bounded access to a subset of location information (most commonly live information about current location).')
