You may not feel that you owe the person you&#x27;re arguing with any better, but you definitely owe this community better—much better—if you&#x27;re participating here.<p>Your account has already done this more than once, as well as posting unsubstantively and baitingly in other ways. That&#x27;s a poor track record for only 11 comments. I don&#x27;t want to ban you, so please fix this. On HN we want thoughtful, curious conversation. Bashing each other like this is obviously at the far extreme from that. No more of this, please.')
