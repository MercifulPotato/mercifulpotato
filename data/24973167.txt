On large desktop screens I don&#x27;t find fractional scaling to be necessary. The important text in apps that matter like terminals, text editors and browsers, chat clients, etc, has always supported scaling well. The only thing that lacked support were system dialogs and title bars. 2x was fine for those until fractional support came out in gnome recently.')
