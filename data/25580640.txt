So seemingly touchable. So very human. \nNothing of these people remains. Not their names, their voices, or even their bones. But their \nhand prints are still here. A simple &quot;Hey, we were here!&quot; message, across millenia and continents.<p>[0] I wouldn&#x27;t actually visit it though, every breath nearby causes damage, every moment of exposure to the world \ndeteriorates them. Tourism means destroying the very thing you are observing. To place my hand on it \nwould be an act of reverence, To place my hand on it would be sacrilege.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Cueva_de_las_Manos" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Cueva_de_las_Manos</a>')
