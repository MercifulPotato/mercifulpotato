In math, CS, or SWE it&#x27;s easy to pick up a new topic, but in biology and chemistry people seem to have overwhelming tendency to work for decades at a time on singular problem areas. CS papers likely go over history because it tends to be more useful, with chemistry, all interested readers may have 5+ years in that field already.')
