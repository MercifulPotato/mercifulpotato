This is a light weight ebike! Obviously it&#x27;s not as light weight as a professional bike (or like any without a battery), but this cuts weight everywhere it can and still has a 45 mile range (plus an extended battery you can add on to extend the range).<p>On top of that people are already spending thousands of dollars on ebikes- this really isn&#x27;t that much more expensive than a much shittier version. The &quot;best ebike&quot; according to Wired last year is the exact same price as this one but weighs five pounds more.')
