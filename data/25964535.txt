Item(by='rektide', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611964976, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25962806, text='&gt; The main problem with Apple&#x27;s App Store is that it is a closed monopoly. It is the only way to install software on an iPhone without jailbraking it, and if you do jailbreak it, then there might be other apps that refuse to work.<p>Android does allow side-loading of apps, but only with the typical very very very limited very dumb privileges. If you want to do anything at all beyond what the OS is willing to bless, you need to root your phone. And as soon as you do that, you are back into the iphone&#x2F;jailbreak nightmare hell world.<p>As soon as you root your phone, you no longer pass Android SafetyNet checks[1] hardwired on the device, and can no longer use a wide variety of payment apps &amp; secure systems. Netflix. Google Pay. Samsung Pay. There&#x27;s been some cat &amp; mouse games[2], some wins for the rebellion&#x2F;resistance, but the intent is clear as a bell: this is Google&#x27;s device, this is the developer&#x27;s device, and you the user are not entitled to privileges on your device. Anything that violates the app developer&#x27;s sense of security is unacceptable in the New Computing Order (NCO). What a hell-hole piss-pot back-water reality of computing we&#x27;ve landed in. Bicycles of the Mind are such a far off out of reach intellectual froof-y ideal compared to this all-spectrum anti-us consumerization-assimilation warfare.<p>Apple is not the only one: it&#x27;s every (big) company, every organization, fighting actively to deny us anything more than superficial access to the devices we carry with us 24&#x2F;7.<p>Give us root, you god-forsaken infernal beasts! #IFightForTheUser. Make our machines ours again.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.android.com&#x2F;training&#x2F;safetynet" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.android.com&#x2F;training&#x2F;safetynet</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.androidpolice.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;03&#x2F;11&#x2F;safetynet-improvements-kill-magisk-hide&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.androidpolice.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;03&#x2F;11&#x2F;safetynet-improveme...</a>')
