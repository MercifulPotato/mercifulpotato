I was saying the claim that compression at the shock could not be the cause of (all) the heating, unless you simply define heating at a shock as being due to compression.   Instead, I think you should separate out the heating there into two parts: one due to isentropic compression, and one due to injection of additional entropy by dissipation at the shock.')
