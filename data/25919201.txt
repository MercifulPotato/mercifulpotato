The brave move would be to firefox to include built-in adblock, but I don&#x27;t think Mozilla has the cojones.<p>&gt;Of course we&#x27;ll have the inevitable guy pop in here and talk up how awesome web tracking is because it helps sites monetize better, but that&#x27;s all bullshit.<p>I think if adblocker usage became widespread we <i>would</i> in fact see the death of a lot of websites, but to be perfectly honest I kinda want that to happen because advertising is cancer.')
