Item(by='NikolaNovak', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609635841, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25618182, text='I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s incompetence.<p>I think it&#x27;s a UI that&#x27;s been designed for one very clear, specific use-case; that&#x27;s been stretched beyond belief by people cramming it to fit radically different use-cases. Developers I&#x27;m sure are simply stuck; do they optimize for original use-case and its legions of users; or other use-cases and those legions of users; I genuinely believe they cannot make everybody happy.<p>But as a <i>user</i>:<p>1. As an author, you have a choice not to try to cram a square kitchen through a round sink (long-form articles onto twitter)<p>2. As a reader, you have a choice not to consume content from a platform not designed or well-supporting of that content.<p>There&#x27;s a million lifetimes worth of fascinating, useful, interesting, <i>readable</i> content out there.<p>Puzzling through a maze that is Twitter long-form article threads... is not how I choose to spend my time :).<p>As I asked in another post, I&#x27;m not sure what your underlying point is - that the UI is good and fit for purpose? Or that we should put up with it? Or that we should be more understanding of it, and that implies not criticizing it?')
