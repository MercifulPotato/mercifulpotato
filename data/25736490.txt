The next objective is to talk to him, but once you exit the building you can&#x27;t re-enter or call him. I had to go back to a previous save a few times. Sometimes the game just crashes and I have to restart the console. There have been some other bugs that I just found funny, like once I was driving and all of a sudden the car was stuck hundreds of feet in the air and I fell and died when I got out. I&#x27;ve been enjoying the game though and the bugs haven&#x27;t really bothered me too much, but I see how they could.')
