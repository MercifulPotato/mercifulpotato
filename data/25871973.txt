In fact, I know because my parents are retired doctors, and they (and all of their colleagues) were among the people who would opt out. On top of that, when I got my first mobile phone as a teenager I learned that I had to opt out as well, because patients would mistakenly think I was my father and randomly call me and tell me shit I really didn&#x27;t want to know.<p>(This is why I was quite confident when I emailed them that this would not happen in my home country, but I&#x27;ll concede that I maybe should have mentioned this in the top comment)')
