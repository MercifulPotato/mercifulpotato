I don&#x27;t mind if they give her 24&#x2F;7 security, if they watch 24&#x2F;7 people who they suspect want to harm her, whatever. IMHO police #1 role should be protecting the people.<p>I would also argue that in the long term this should pay off. Protect the lawyer, stop crime organizations, save much money later because less security needed. Don&#x27;t protect the layer == more crime == more future expenses.')
