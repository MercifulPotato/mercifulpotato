Decreasing individuals&#x27; buying power is about as good a solution to consumption as &quot;don&#x27;t give people enough food to feed their kids&quot; is to overpopulation.<p>&gt; Is there proof of this for tiny devices with tons of integrated chips and processors requiring specialized equipment and knowledge to fix?<p>Well, you could say that when a device breaks, it will either get discarded or repaired, so repairability can only be a net positive. It&#x27;s debatable whether repairability will actually prolong the lifespan for things like headphones, where everything is tiny and will wear down eventually, and monitors, where most of the money goes into an irreparable LCD panel anyway.<p>I&#x27;m convinced, though, that phones and notebooks are expensive and &quot;modular&quot; enough that repairs with proper replacement part availability would be cost-effective.')
