Some of them are referenced to the retail rate. Many though are defined price (including surcharges) with annual escalations. Parcel carriers have been disrupted to some extent by Amazon building out their own logistics capability both line-haul and last-mile and have been signing contracts with non-Amazon shippers to ensure they could cover their costs and make a profit.<p>Now, pandemic hits and drives a lot of unexpected, probably just this year, traffic into parcel shipping that would have otherwise been freight to stores and passenger car to homes and there&#x27;s not enough capacity.<p>There&#x27;s not as much price shaping they can do without being in violation of their contract. In a lot of cases, they know they need these big shippers next year as well, so they can&#x27;t entirely burn them this year even if they were willing to litigate the contract.')
