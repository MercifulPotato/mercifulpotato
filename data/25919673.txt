The only escape hatch is casting (and of course co&#x2F;contra&#x2F;invariance, but it is a semantic issue).\nOverloading may be a legit issue, but I am yet to run into it, you are right about arrays and value types, but they are being worked on and hopefully project valhalla can solve these issues.<p>C++’s templates have different trade-offs (lack of semantic validation, though perhaps it is solved by concepts and constraints? I haven’t looked into them yet)')
