You&#x27;ve truly been mislead if you believe that is its purpose. I grew up around lots of these sorts of people and what those guys are really for is to keep the blacks and immigrants properly terrorized and subjugated. My experiences with them were that they were uniformly from the most racist and ignorant class of whites, usually the ones the military wouldn&#x27;t take, and they were essentially another version of KKK. That crap in the 2nd amendment about a well regulated militia is a nice cover to let these dudes do their thing, but please do not confuse that with the actual purpose of these people in US society. They maintain white supremacy.')
