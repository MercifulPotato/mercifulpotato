Item(by='bigiain', descendants=None, kids=[25759691], score=None, time=1610525793, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25759190, text='I think this attitude reflects much more on your misplaced understanding of what OWS are doing and why, rather than anything meaningful about your critizisms.<p>It&#x27;s a _really_ poor proxy for most things, but they&#x27;re the ones with $100mm of somebody else money. I suspect your opinion that they&#x27;re &quot;wasting&quot; any of that is much more likely to be that you don&#x27;t understand the goals, rather than the people behind _that_ much money letting it be &quot;wasted&quot;.<p>You&#x27;ve demonstrated very little understanding of the reasons behind the problems you cite. Do you know the tradeoffs behind the decision to limit linked devices? Do you think OWS&#x27;s priority on desktop video call quality is the same as yours, and do you know the tradeoffs they&#x27;re making by choosing not to prioritise that? You pretty much admit you have zero clue how or why they&#x27;re using SGX - which is one of that most innovative privacy techniques in the entire space (it&#x27;s not perfect, but it&#x27;s about as diametrically opposed to how Facebook et al do contact discovery as it&#x27;s possible to get).<p>[Edit: It&#x27;s also possible _my_ understanding of what Moxie and OWS are trying to do is wrong, and I&#x27;m crediting them for or at least giving them a pass on a lot of stuff based on that. But I don&#x27;t think so. I&#x27;ve been reading their blog since they worked on an Android app called TextSecure back in 2014 or so. Moxie is a friend of a friend, and I&#x27;d eaten and drunk with him. I think I have a reasonable understanding, for an outsider, of what is important to them and why they&#x27;re doing the things they do.]')
