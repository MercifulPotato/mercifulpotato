It seems that most 15-year-olds in China have already had to pass at least one major exam to remain in school, and those who didn&#x27;t make the cut were diverted out into vocational training.  That distinction might explain the very existence of Level 4 in the data, particularly if Singapore does something similar.<p>Americans should probably be more concerned about the substantial additional financial resources they have poured into their education system in the last couple of decades, with apparently very little impact whatsoever.')
