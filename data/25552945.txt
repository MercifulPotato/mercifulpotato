This can happen in MOBAs where teams level, and get more powerful each time they do... the larger the level differential, the less fun the game is for all involved. As soon as the losing team has no chance to recover, there&#x27;s not much reason for them to continue playing... And the lack of challenge usually gives the winning players or team an unsatisfactory game too, there&#x27;s no challenge.<p>In games with a mechanic that snowballs, generally, the game developers try to tune it out, ensuring that players and teams stay within a one or two level margin... a margin that the losing team at least stands a chance of recovering from.<p>Dominion is not just a game with a snowball effect, but one that does not remotely try to curb it.')
