Everyone keeps saying how well the highdpi stuff works<p>I use Wayland daily and have for a few years. Itâ€™s clearly gotten better, and I rarely encounter problems. I do have my load of applications still running in XWayland though.<p>But yes. Support for varying DPI in my multi-monitor setup is handled much better on Wayland than on X11. I would say much better than on Windows too.')
