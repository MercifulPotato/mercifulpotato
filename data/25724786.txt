Now I actually want to go a step farther, but I realize the president is a kind-hearted man and a good man. I’d actually like to go back to the old times of Tudor England, I’d put the heads on pikes&quot;.<p>Now the generally understood figurative meaning of putting someone&#x27;s &quot;head on a pike&quot; is &quot;fire them in disgrace&quot;. But Bannon&#x27;s ruled that one out in the first sentence. So I&#x27;m honestly at a loss as to what he meant.<p>Can you, as a &quot;native-born American citizen&quot;, help me understand what his figurative meaning was here? I&#x27;ve asked a bunch of people on here who claimed &quot;no big deal, it was a figure of speech&quot; but they failed to explain what it means.')
