It&#x27;s a self solving problem. We wouldn&#x27;t be discussing lock downs, because everyone would lock down without being told they should lock down.<p>The virus we are talking about, COVID-19, is incredibly low risk for 90+ percent of the population. I don&#x27;t think we should enact policy that infringe on freedoms, so that vulnerable people can move around freely. Or rather, it&#x27;s important to balance the two. Mask mandates are a reasonable compromise, but an immunization mandate isn&#x27;t. Focus policy making on vulnerable people - give them wage replacement to not go out in public or to their job if they are overweight, have diabetes, if they are elderly, immunocompromised, etc. But, don&#x27;t mess with our natural rights. Do not trade liberty for safety, do not build the social will and legal foundation for future erosions of liberty, regardless of the purity of the motive today.<p>Edited to clarify mask vs immunization mandate above.')
