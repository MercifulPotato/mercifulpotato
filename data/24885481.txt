Haven&#x27;t used Windows in 15 years and don&#x27;t intend to in the future either. Linux would require a whole lot of fiddling (if I&#x27;d even managed to find a laptop with good hardware and hardware support to begin with). Macs have excellent hardware (yes you pay a premium for it). Good battery life. Good keyboard (up to 2015 models at least). Great touch pad (hardware and driver wise). MacOS has a good window manager, excellent applications like iTerm2 and Alfred that I wouldn&#x27;t want to live without and would have to find subpar Linux replacements for. This sucks a bit since I&#x27;ve generally tried to keep to cross-platform apps and because of these I&#x27;m a bit locked in.<p>Oh and the consistent keyboard shortcuts across the OS (terminal included) with Cmd is soooo nice.<p>That said I&#x27;m using 2015 models (Air and Pro) as the newer ones haven&#x27;t impressed me at all (had an MBP with touch bar for a year or so). Love the Magsafe power connector (which just gracefully disconnects when you rough it) and don&#x27;t want to switch to USB-C and its adapter hell.<p>Once it&#x27;s no longer possible to find proper 2015&#x27;s anymore I might want&#x2F;have to consider switching back to Linux (and spend <i>a lot</i> of time fiddling with everything), but we&#x27;re far from there still - I recently bought a 2015 MBP with new battery for â‚¬800.<p>Edit: Unlike one other poster here I loathe iOS and think it&#x27;s horrible (had an iPhone for a year so have some hands on experience) so I don&#x27;t use features like AirDrop or handoff (even though it&#x27;s super convenient between two Macs). And he mentions Touch ID which was actually brilliantly convenient on the newer MBP I had, but that&#x27;s not unique to Macs. So yeah, the more you lock yourself into the Apple ecosystem the more benefits you get, but I&#x27;ve tried to explicitly <i>not</i> do that.')
