Sure, I ran into things it couldn&#x27;t do, but most of the time I was kept enchanted by all the things it could already do.<p>At the time it was being worked on its main competitors were Windows 95&#x2F;98 and (pre-Unixification) Mac OS; multiuser capability just wasn&#x27;t that important. If development had continued, I don&#x27;t think it would have been out of the question for a future version to include multiuser support. In any case, I really do wish we&#x27;d been able to see where BeOS might have been in 2009 if things had gone differently.')
