You can just try some benchmark with nanosleep() on your system. It works in a similar way to the PIT you described, although I don&#x27;t think it tries to offset the delay from interrupts.<p>What I want to say is that we already have precise timers usable on modern hardware; as for why Windows doesn&#x27;t use that properly, I have no idea, but I can guess that&#x27;s some technical debt in the scheduler.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kernel.org&#x2F;doc&#x2F;ols&#x2F;2006&#x2F;ols2006v1-pages-333-346.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kernel.org&#x2F;doc&#x2F;ols&#x2F;2006&#x2F;ols2006v1-pages-333-346....</a>')
