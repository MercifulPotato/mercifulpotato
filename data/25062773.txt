I’ve been waiting for this feature for ages. Our company uses Notion for managing objectives in a hierachical structure that all need to be looked at in different timeframes. Our Campaigns are measured in years, missions in months, projects in weeks, milestone in days and tasks hours. Being able to easily change the granualirity of the timeline views make it so we can actually use it for all levels of our system.<p>Now if only Notion could add the option on adding requirements&#x2F;logic to parameters I will have very little I feel I can’t do in Notion.')
