Item(by='vetinari', descendants=None, kids=[25986297], score=None, time=1612129844, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25982736, text='When you switch resolution to lower; the operating system cannot do anything then, and whatever you see is either your GPU or your display scaler&#x27;s fault.<p>It will be not pixel perfect; but: In the display control panel, under &quot;Customized&quot; group, you should have &quot;larger text&quot; option, as the first one. This will keep the native display resolution, and the description will says that &quot;it will look like XY resolution&quot;.<p>However, I don&#x27;t currently have @1X monitor available to test it; it works with @2X display, which might not be the same - it works by rendering at higher resolution, which is how @2X normally works. But worth a try.')
