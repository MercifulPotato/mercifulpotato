The last time I used Comcast it was something like 400 Mbps down, advertised 10-15 Mbps up (reality sub-5). The Comcast site no longer shows upload speeds anywhere - I remember they used to at least do that. I don&#x27;t think Comcast has any upload tier above 35 Mbps in 2020, though.<p>When I was in Europe these were considered DSL speeds.<p>The atrocious thing I remember while ISP-searching is that virtually all cheap plans would demand you provide proof of assistance, like if you just wanted to sign up for a 10 Mbps plan for backup, there was no such thing, Comcast would demand documentation[0] of low income.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;internetessentials.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;internetessentials.com&#x2F;</a>')
