Same kind of epidemic as everywhere else. Nothing out of the ordinary and a year that&#x27;s comparable to any flu year.<p>Look at the data for parts of Switzerland that didn&#x27;t lock down for the second wave (which is most of it, including where I live). It goes into remission anyway, without overflowing hospitals or mass deaths.<p>Remember that the only reason you believe deaths would be far higher without lockdowns is epidemiologists predicted that. But they have a long track record of making predictions that are always wrong. This time they were wrong again, just like all the other times. There was never any experience based justification for lockdowns or even restrictions of any form: only models, which have turned out to be buggy and unrealistic.')
