I always wondered why your car sometimes launched to the sky in Stunts, from 1990.<p>Yes, you could have for example energy limiters and total momentum checks in your algorithms. Energy can not be added in a collision. In a collision between two finite mass objects, total momentum is preserved (you can&#x27;t use this with collisions with the ground). Maybe games already do this?<p>You could also just fudge the equations to avoid singularities, like always add +1 to the divider. This could probably cause other problems though.')
