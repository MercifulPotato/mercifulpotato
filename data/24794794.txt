Item(by='zapita', descendants=None, kids=[24795965, 24795820], score=None, time=1602800004, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24790055, text='The documentation says that Waypoint does not want to replace PaaS, but rather to integrate with both PaaS and lower-level infrastructure like Kubernetes.<p>However, the documentation also says that Waypoint injects a “smart entrypoint” into the containers it builds, and that entrypoiny seems very intrusive. Among other things, it calls home to the waypoint server and registers on a “URL service” which will then route traffic back to it. That is basically a PaaS service mesh.<p>So my understanding is that Waypoint, while claiming to be complementary to PaaS, is actually a trojan horse to inject its own PaaS into my infrastructure. I understand why that is valuable to Hashicorp; and I may even be interested in evaluating a Hashicorp PaaS. But I am not a fan of the way this is being snuck in. Injecting a service mesh into my stack is a major change; please be upfront about it so I can compare it to other PaaS.')
