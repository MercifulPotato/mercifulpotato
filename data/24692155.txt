Based on published materials, FSF&#x27;s peculiar desire for assignments stemmed from some early concerns about court procedure for license enforcement:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gnu.org&#x2F;licenses&#x2F;why-assign.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gnu.org&#x2F;licenses&#x2F;why-assign.html</a><p>Some large companies followed suit.
