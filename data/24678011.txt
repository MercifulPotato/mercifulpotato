Red zones everywhere, closing regions after holidays, event and cultural sectors are ravaged, unemployment is rising up and our government are still all about `investing into the future but cut the spending at the same time`.<p>I am now convinced no one can really read anything into economic and governance. It&#x27;s all just tea reading and twisted stories so it fits the worldview of the authors. Who is winning what exactly ? The only constant narrative on both sides of the ocean is that wealthy people are still getting wealthier and the 99% are getting worse. And China bad.')
