Putting the government (or any other third party) in charge of censorship for the sake of filtering out what&#x27;s false just moves the decision elsewhere - but it&#x27;s still made by some people somewhere. Whether those people are determined directly or indirectly through some democratic process, or self-appointed, the same problem applies recursively.')
