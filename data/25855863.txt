At a minimum i think a &quot;standard&quot; is a document detailing the behaviour of at least two competiting implementations sufficiently that you could use it to make a new implementation that was interopable. I don&#x27;t think that was true of W3C standards in the pre WHATWG days. Compare it to say the HTTP rfcs, which i think did meet that standard.')
