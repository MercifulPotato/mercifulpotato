You might not need it, but sometimes it&#x27;s nice to have something with more. Most people on this planet think that managing files from terminal is pure insanity, and I do just that, I didn&#x27;t even bothered to install a graphical file manager. And yet I use a git client&#x2F;front-end in my text editor, because it&#x27;s nicer to do some things that way. The most useful feature is probably interactively staging hunks just like you&#x27;d edit a text file over what standard git does.')
