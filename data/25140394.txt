You don&#x27;t have to believe in science itself, but you do have to trust scientists when they report data (you can check the conclusions yourself, but you can&#x27;t check if the data was accurately reported, if the published protocol was followed etc).<p>That said, I believe the legal repercussions of lying about these studies will be too high to stomach, so I do trust the companies to be truthful here. That doesn&#x27;t mean that it is irrational to choose not to trust them.')
