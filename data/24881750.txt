A single 8 1&#x2F;2 by 11 double sided sheet of paper could usually fit everything I needed to memorize at one given time.  I&#x27;d write out a cheat sheet (a very valuable exercise in condensing and distilling while reviewing) and then reproduce it from memory before and after bed three days in a row allowing a tapered amount of cheating&#x2F;peeking (with the first few being pretty much all peeking).
