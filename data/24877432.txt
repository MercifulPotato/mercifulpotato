It&#x27;s gonna require <i>work</i>. It&#x27;s going to not only be opportunity cost, but require us to <i>do stuff</i>. This is what it means to have climate change as a priority. It&#x27;s a priority above money, above GDP growth, above even the standard of living. It should be our highest priority, and we should be prepared to roll up our sleeves and hit everyone up for money. It&#x27;s a debt we need to pay, and there&#x27;s no getting out of it.<p>&gt; The more we learn about nuclear, the more expensive it seems to get, in contrast to pretty much any good tech.<p>At this point in time we need to push the dollar cost much further down our list of priorities and be shooting for what&#x27;s going to avoid catastrophe <i>and</i> what&#x27;s sustainable. (spoiler: nuclear energy is absolutely sustainable; there are literally billions of years of nuclear fuel accessible to us).')
