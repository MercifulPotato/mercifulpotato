I don&#x27;t have anything on AWS except S3 bucket which costs $0.5&#x2F;month. My credit card expired so they aren&#x27;t charging me, just sending &quot;urgent action required&quot; emails.\nI contacted AWS support to either regain access to the account or pay what I owe and close it but they asked for:<p>1) A completed, signed, and notarized Identity Verification Form and Affidavit, which can be downloaded online at the following link (the link didn&#x27;t work)<p>2) A photocopy of the AWS account owner’s primary proof of identification, such as a State driver’s license or passport.<p>3) A photocopy of the AWS account owner’s proof of address matching the address on file.<p>So I&#x27;m waiting, maybe they&#x27;ll give up.')
