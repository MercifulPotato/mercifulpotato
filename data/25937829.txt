The number of hours without food or sugar or cream or diet pop versus the window of hours that you&#x27;re allowed to eat during.<p>2) Water Fasting:  Skipping food altogether. For example, a 32 hour fast.  Eat dinner, then go the entire next day without food, and then eat breakfast. Regularly doing a 32 hour fast once a week can be incredibly effective.  Or do a longer fast once every few months.<p>3) Low carb (&lt; 20 grams), medium protein, high fat diet.  Keto diet.<p>Why do these things help?  Adult onset diabetes generally traces back to insulin sensitivity, and too much insulin in the body. Reducing the amount of insulin in your veins, reducing the insulin spikes, etc all help the body recover back to health.<p>Highly recommend checking Dr Jason Fung&#x27;s youtube videos or book.')
