It&#x27;d be interesting to see if a technique like that could be applied here too. And on the flipside, if you want to do this using ML, rendered images from a game engine&#x2F;blender could be used for generating large amounts of training data with perfectly defined &quot;ground truth&quot; colors already known.')
