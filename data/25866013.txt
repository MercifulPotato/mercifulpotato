Intel has had full time developers doing the Linux drivers for that series of cards since the earliest days of their 64-bit&#x2F;66MHz PCI-X 10Gbps NICs about 17 years ago.<p>Also worth mentioning that FRR is now an official Linux Foundation supported project.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;frrouting.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;frrouting.org&#x2F;</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.intel.com&#x2F;content&#x2F;www&#x2F;us&#x2F;en&#x2F;products&#x2F;docs&#x2F;network-io&#x2F;ethernet&#x2F;network-adapters&#x2F;ethernet-800-series-network-adapters&#x2F;e810-cqda1-cqda2-100gbe-brief.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.intel.com&#x2F;content&#x2F;www&#x2F;us&#x2F;en&#x2F;products&#x2F;docs&#x2F;networ...</a>')
