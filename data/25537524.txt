The best explanation I have heard about Fermi paradox is that it disappears when you express the number of planets in exponential notation. If instead of saying &quot;what are the odds that we are the only intelligent species when there are 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 [random number, I don&#x27;t know the number] planets in the universe,&quot; you express it as &quot;... when there are 10^36 planets in the universe,&quot; it becomes easy to answer:<p>Imagine creation of intelligent life requires 36 uncorrelated parameters to line up in a planet, an each of those parameters have a 10% chance of occurring in any given planet. There would be only one such planet in the universe in all likelihood. Our loneliness in the universe doesn&#x27;t seem so implausible now, does it?')
