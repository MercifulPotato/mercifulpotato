Logicians demand perfect rigour, and label reasoning that fails to attain that a &quot;fallacy&quot;. Humans are satisfied with heuristical arguments, which the slippery slope is an example of. Pointing out that it fails to achieve perfect rigour is meaningless; no argument reaches that bar, and demands to pursue it will only result in obfuscation. Instead, try to explain why the heuristic doesn&#x27;t apply in this case - if you can. The general response to a slippery slope argument is to explain why one step, once achieved, won&#x27;t lead to any further steps. You will have great difficulty demonstrating that in this case, since government expenditures regularly rise to the level of their budgets (and indeed beyond).')
