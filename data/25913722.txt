Notice anything out of place?<p>Each and every one of these seemingly innocent TV show trailers have a short video stitched before the actual trailer (and sometimes after as well).<p>These stitched videos are always scary news reports about people being attacked, robbed or murdered.<p>The choice of shows to upload trailers for seems random at first, but if you look closer - those are all relatively obscure and niche shows with fairly small following.<p>To me - it looks like it&#x27;s a concerted effort by some entity to try and raise (certain?) peoples fears?<p>I&#x27;m not sure who or why would be doing this, but I thought it might be a good idea to expose this here for some discussion and further investigation?')
