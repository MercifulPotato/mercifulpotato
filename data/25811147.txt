Do most people not do this - make choices based on values (and constantly re-evaluate those choices in the face of new information)?<p>When I decide to use software, move to a new location, purchase cereal at the grocery store, buy music, and a variety of other daily activities, these are choices I make based on my values. Many times I end up picking something that I find slightly less convenient or usable because it aligns with my values better, and I&#x27;m unwilling to compromise my ethical stance for a little bit of convenience.<p>It seems unrealistic to me that people would choose otherwise, given enough information.')
