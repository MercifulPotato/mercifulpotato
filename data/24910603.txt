It&#x27;s about 10x the power worst case (maybe 5x for some dsp heavy apps) and also around 5 to 10x for speed. An FPGA can easily run at 100s of MHz, up to 500 with good design pipelining, so suggesting an ASIC could do 500x20 times the speed is 10Ghz, so definitely beyond most ASICs, so I think 5x is more reasonable.')
