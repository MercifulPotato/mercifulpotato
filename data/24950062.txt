I mean you may know more about it than general practitioners and you will only have some hope of learning more from a doctor if you see a specialist.<p>So you have buckets and buckets of info and you run into well-meaning people who want to feel helpful and they toss out some random snippet of an idea without even really talking with you. It would be sort of like if you walked into a doctor&#x27;s office and said &quot;I have x condition&quot; and they replied &quot;Do you want X antibiotic?&quot; without taking a history of finding out what your current complaint is.<p>And it becomes about their emotional needs. Even if they are sincere, it&#x27;s exhausting to try to explain.<p>It&#x27;s like if you go to a cocktail party and you spend the entire evening repeating your entire medical history to everyone you meet to satisfy their curiosity and you never get one minute to actually enjoy the party and socialize a little.<p>So you eventually just don&#x27;t want to talk to people casually about it <i>at all.</i> Because it is one hundred percent downside for you.<p>There is a long-shot scenario in which maybe you will meet someone who actually knows something useful and is actually sensitive about how they talk with you about it and it&#x27;s mostly not worth leaving that door open in hopes of connecting with that one rare person once in a great while because the rest of the time it is such a huge burden on your already limited time and energy that you are better off just betting that &quot;This person <i>cannot</i> help me. Moving on. Yeesh.&quot;<p>So while I welcome sincere interest in my various problems, no, some random person who knows nothing of my background and just wants to get their jollies feeling &quot;helpful&quot; for five minutes isn&#x27;t really going to enhance my life <i>at all.</i> It is all downside and I mostly want to avoid having certain topics come up.')
