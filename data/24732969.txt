You probably don&#x27;t <i>want</i> to transpose your table, except when you want to, but that&#x27;s true of any function -- I&#x27;m can&#x27;t imagine any scenario where transpose(table)-&gt;table would as an algorithm fail (unless I suppose if julia tables include header rows, in which case there&#x27;s probably no generally correct definition)')
