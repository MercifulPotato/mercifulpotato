You wouldn&#x27;t have web pages melting down and requiring people to hammer f5, because you could run the auction for long enough that everyone can get their bid in. And at least theoretically scalpers should have much harder time making profit in a well-organized auction. And nobody can accuse vendor of price gouging in an auction because the price would be so purely market-driven.')
