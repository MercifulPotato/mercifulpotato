Workers don&#x27;t want to be on a crusade they want rights like better pay, better hours, freedom to choose, rights for parents, etc. It&#x27;s not a social crusade if that&#x27;s what they&#x27;re planning on doing, they will tune out 1&#x2F;2 or more of the other workers there. I think you&#x27;re a bit harsh on people standing up for their status like preferred gender, sexual orientation, etc. You seem to be dismissing their concerns entirely. I don&#x27;t think a worker&#x27;s union is the right place to try and enforce anything other than an equal rights workplace as idealistically most labor unions say that they&#x27;re for.')
