Item(by='eru', descendants=None, kids=[25988097], score=None, time=1612179464, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25987158, text='&gt; With normal shorting the number of shares being traded is no greater than the float. Only with naked shorting can there be more shares traded than float, as in the parent&#x27;s example. Interestingly, in both cases the short interest can be greater than 100%.<p>Why?<p>A owns a share, loans it to short seller B.  B sells the loaned share back to A.  Then A loans the share again to B, B sells it back to A.  Now repeat the process a million times.<p>You can get arbitrarily high amounts of shorting without any naked shorts.  (And usually, A and B don&#x27;t know each other.  It&#x27;s all done via exchanges and clearing houses etc.)')
