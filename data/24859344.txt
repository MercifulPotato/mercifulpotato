Surely the amount of people who actually pay the tax is near 0 and they&#x27;d get far more tax revenue from a lower tax rate right? I&#x27;d actually bet that this tax in particular not only doesn&#x27;t raise money, but is a net-negative tax-wise as you&#x27;re forcing people to spend their incomes on flights&#x2F;hotels out of the country they otherwise wouldn&#x27;t and they probably buy other things on their trip too.<p>From living in Chicago these forms of taxes seem so counter-productive. The pattern seems to be that a budget needs to be balanced, so they come up with a new consumption tax that conveniently assumes that the level of consumption stays the same with the new tax in place, but it never ever does.<p>It&#x27;s so frustrating because once a tax gets extreme enough that almost no one pays it, lowering&#x2F;removing it would benefit everyone including the government. It&#x27;s one of those rare things that can be fixed instantly at no effort&#x2F;cost with only positive results, yet it won&#x27;t get done.')
