They talk about it a bit:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pushing-pixels.org&#x2F;2016&#x2F;01&#x2F;21&#x2F;a-window-into-another-world-interview-with-timothy-peel.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pushing-pixels.org&#x2F;2016&#x2F;01&#x2F;21&#x2F;a-window-into-anot...</a><p>I think they&#x27;d rather bring you into the world by showing the UI and interactions while also showing the actors. With a opaque device, we know they&#x27;re using it, but we don&#x27;t get to see any detail about it. And a camera angle behind the actor that shows the UI can be awkward. So I think it&#x27;s really just a compromise to be able to show the UIs, interaction, and the actors from the front at the same time.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t ever use one for privacy, and I think the only realistic way transparent devices would be useful is if they tint the glass so it&#x27;s maybe 50% opaque.')
