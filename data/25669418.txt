We do so by bridging the gap between what was planned in ERP and MES systems and what really happened on the shop floor. Doing so, our customers can explore their shop floor data based on single production orders, compare performance between products and perform root cause analysis.<p>One of our major efforts is to implement as many PLC integrations as possible to make our product work out of the box without any prerequisites. Currently, we are looking for a capable reverse &#x2F; systems engineer to join our machine integration team. Within that team, you will be responsible for extending our current range of PLC integrations, oftentimes reverse engineering your way through different protocols.<p>Our main application is written in Rust, but as most of the industry is still running on legacy Windows systems (Yes, we&#x27;ve encountered NT 4.0), C++ and Windows knowledge is definitely a major plus.\nAlso, as most of the systems we encounter have German as their system language, we believe that this position requires a solid knowledge of German.<p>We don&#x27;t require you to be on site, but you should be able and willing to travel to customer sites to connect appliances and do recon.<p>Instead of an application, we thought that a reverse engineering puzzle &#x2F; challenge might be more suited for you:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;storage.googleapis.com&#x2F;enlyze-challenge&#x2F;challenge_final.jpg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;storage.googleapis.com&#x2F;enlyze-challenge&#x2F;challenge_fi...</a>')
