Some folks like to call that freedom, or a set of ideals about how we structure things.<p>I agree with the parent comment that lately people are really down on the US and capitalism, and others are super positive about it in unthinking response. Capitalism has provided a lot of amazing things - avocados are always available! - but also done damage and been destructive.<p>Similarly, America was the experiment and inspiration for modern democratic&#x2F;republican governance, and a major component in the beginning of more freedom for more people, while also having been built on slavery, the killing of natives, massive environmental devastation, and other terrible things.<p>The world is really complex, and simplifying things to good or evil tends to lose a lot of reality.')
