Item(by='runarberg', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608851503, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25531239, text='&gt; The term &quot;defense in depth&quot; comes to mind.<p>For me the term that comes to mind is: <i>Security at the cost of quality of life</i>.<p>Sometimes security is redundant, that is fine. Sometimes it is unessisary, that could be fine as long as it is not harmful. Phishing training <i>should</i> be redundant at worst and unessisary at best. But these types of phishing training definitely has negative effects on the trainees. You are invoking a sense of failure and unessisary stress. Some people will have underlying stress issues, perhaps they are having a bad day, perhaps they are experiencing PTSD, and then seeing they failed a phishing test could be disastrous. Definitely not worth putting your workers at this risk for supposed (and unproven) security.')
