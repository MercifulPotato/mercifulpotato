There is a leaked video from Google with mass crying post election, and the organization then vowed to prevent it from happening again. I suspect other tech companies were similar.<p>Throughout Trump&#x27;s presidency they have been constantly fighting Trump since, rather than trying to stay in his good graces. So I don&#x27;t buy that it&#x27;s about power.')
