And partly as a result you&#x27;re getting downvoted by the idiot brigade.<p>To the rest of you:<p>It&#x27;s not so much to do with disinformation, which is a separate conversation entirely. It&#x27;s specifically to do with institutions that we rely on reporting to us more or less &quot;fair and balanced&quot; factual information distorting things by not reporting on everything that is happening within that subject, choosing to only focus on a part of the whole picture that promotes their agenda[1] in a positive light, completely ignoring the other pieces that intertwine that bring about a more &quot;Well, it isn&#x27;t so black and white&quot; perspective. They are using weak and pathetic framing devices that I&#x27;ll get into later.<p>When you start to pick up on this to the degree where you can predict and see how things will unfold, there is little reason for you to actually believe any of the published information. So this isn&#x27;t just about lizards, it&#x27;s also about far more basic things that occur day in day out.<p>And this isn&#x27;t even the tip of the iceberg. The language that is used is carefully chosen to force you to agree with certain assumptions so that the rest of the piece makes sense, when really, it&#x27;s nothing more than shitposting by some Opinion section columnist. These assumptions once again come from a place so blatantly obvious to have an agenda[1] that when you start to pick up on it, there is no reason for you to take anything they say anymore as having basis in reality.<p>That&#x27;s how trust in media and reporting institutions erodes from people who know how to tell apart what&#x27;s fact and what&#x27;s propaganda. And once those people are off your platform, things just go downhill from there.<p>So, it&#x27;s much more sinister than the lizards. And focusing on the lizards is just you being naive.<p>[1] If you have a problem with the word &quot;agenda&quot; here, you haven&#x27;t been paying attention.')
