We were systematically and intentionally lied to, over and over, by oil and related industries.  Technology that would aid us was scrapped for the sake of short term profits.  Scientific analysis was hidden.  Lobbying allowed the practices to continue.  Lies were allowed to be propagated to the public to the extent that, even today, many people doubt climate change is even happening despite overwhelming evidence.  These need to be crimes, as they have real victims: and unlike many person-to-person crimes, these corporate crimes can affect our entire society.')
