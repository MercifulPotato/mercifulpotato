Item(by='gruez', descendants=None, kids=[25863564], score=None, time=1611258353, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25862096, text='&gt;But for normal usage-as-a-currency, I am a huge believer in XMR (monero), which masks who you&#x27;re sending money to<p>There was a talk[1] a few years ago that basically argued that this property only really holds if you look at individual transactions in isolation. It basically boils down to: if you make one transaction to a darknet market, it&#x27;s impossible to know whether you were actually sending to a darknet market, or whether that was just a decoy transaction. However, if you make repeated transactions to a darknet market, the chances that all of your transactions had a darknet market decoy approaches zero, and you&#x27;ll be considered suspicious. At that point the police can get a warrant to search your house, or put surveillance on you so they can catch you slipping up irl.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=9s3EbSKDA3o" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=9s3EbSKDA3o</a> core argument starts at around 10 minutes.')
