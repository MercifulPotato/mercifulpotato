It was the easiest decision I ever made. Basically, there was $5000 in closing costs and the bank paid me $6000 in points. If I paid money I would have gotten a lower rate, but I already had a great rate.<p>Now, I&#x27;m refinancing again, but I&#x27;m paying some money. All in all, my net refinancing costs will be around $2000, but I have halved my interest rate almost, and will now be able to pay my home off about 10-15 years earlier (we just bought two years ago).')
