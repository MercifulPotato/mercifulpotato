This is true of first snow in all countries, though in many, they have had more experience.<p>The other factor is the UK road system is kinda densely used with many bottlenecks already and any factor will quickly increase that, so a few flakes will see drivers over or under compensate causing a ripple that can turn into waves very quickly.<p>But it&#x27;s always fun.  The dynamics of the UK weather sure do make for interesting repercussions and whilst those same dynamics play out in other countries, they are more stable and more adjusted to such things.<p>Just look at how lock-downs impact area&#x27;s, peoples habits changing suddenly has ripple effects and in the UK - toilet roll is serious business.<p>Another way to view it is - a covering of snow, even less than 1CM in London is headline news in the UK.  You probably have to look at Miami to get a comparable response to snow.')
