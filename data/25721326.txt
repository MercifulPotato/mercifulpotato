Qualifications below.<p>Learn the Cortex-M4 ecosystem <i>first</i>.  You can do a remarkable amount of stuff by abusing microcontroller systems in weird ways.  The tools for dealing with microcontrollers are <i>MUCH</i> better than the FPGA ecosystem tools (which suck--and that&#x27;s on a good day).<p>If you need an FPGA, generally you know it.  The first sign is: &quot;There&#x27;s no way to do this with my microcontroller.&quot;  That step is generally followed by: &quot;Is there a different microcontroller that could do this?&quot;  followed by asking the old greybeard &quot;Is there <i>really</i> no way to do this on a microcontroller?&quot;  And finally, &quot;Crud, this can&#x27;t be done on a microcontroller&quot;--at that point you can <i>consider</i> an FPGA.<p>As someone who has been dealing with this for <i>mumble</i> too many years, I&#x27;ve been slowly migrating functionality of my clients away from their FPGAs and into the microcontrollers more and more.  It&#x27;s just way easier on too many fronts--and they don&#x27;t have to learn Verilog&#x2F;VHDL.  The FPGAs will never go away, but they will have the minimum functionality we can get away with.<p>&gt; I&#x27;ve no experience with FPGA, but would like to learn.<p>I&#x27;m likely to get some static for this, but get an actual supported dev board and not an open-source hacker board.  I would recommend something like this that has an academic version:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.terasic.com.tw&#x2F;cgi-bin&#x2F;page&#x2F;archive.pl?Language=English&amp;CategoryNo=218&amp;No=1230" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.terasic.com.tw&#x2F;cgi-bin&#x2F;page&#x2F;archive.pl?Language=...</a><p>Use the manufacturer tools (which, in this instance, are free) as using an &quot;open-source toolchain&quot; is <i>NOT</i> for beginners.<p>Once you understand FPGA&#x27;s a bit more thoroughly, then you can take the leap to the open source stuff.')
