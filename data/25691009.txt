Nevertheless, I refuse to refer to &quot;ntpd&quot; as a worse implementation because it implemented the leap-second as the standard specified. Also, ntpd can be manually configured to never slew time (excluding leap second) if -x and -g are used.<p>&gt; <i>ntpd&#x27;s behavior of non-monotonic time adjustments was brought to my attention after a developer uncovered database corruption.</i><p>BTW, my original topic here is how a negative leap second may cause service disruption, ntpd&#x27;s behavior is only a footnote to that discussion. I think your experience only strengthened my original argument: if the standard leap second implementation (instead of smearing) is used, which is the case in a default configuration, <i>something</i> might happen. But I&#x27;m not sure, a negative leap second doesn&#x27;t break the monotonic assumption. So it&#x27;s all speculations...')
