Simply put, computing would be on any device, in any location, and in any format.<p>&gt;We&#x27;re getting there. During my son&#x27;s homework this week we created a Word document on an iPad, inserted a photo taken on a Windows phone, saved the doc to the cloud via Dropbox, printed the doc from a laptop over wifi to a printer.<p>&gt;Weiser helpfully proposed three basic forms for ubiquitous system devices;<p>&gt;Tabs: wearable centimetre sized devices<p>&gt;Pads: hand-held decimetre-sized devices<p>&gt;Boards: metre sized interactive display devices<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Mark_Weiser" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Mark_Weiser</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ubiquitous_computing" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ubiquitous_computing</a><p>&gt;Ubiquitous computing (or &quot;ubicomp&quot;) is a concept in software engineering and computer science where computing is made to appear anytime and everywhere. In contrast to desktop computing, ubiquitous computing can occur using any device, in any location, and in any format. A user interacts with the computer, which can exist in many different forms, including laptop computers, tablets and terminals in everyday objects such as a refrigerator or a pair of glasses. The underlying technologies to support ubiquitous computing include Internet, advanced middleware, operating system, mobile code, sensors, microprocessors, new I&#x2F;O and user interfaces, computer networks, mobile protocols, location and positioning, and new materials.')
