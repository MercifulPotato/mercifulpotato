I should have specified that I was saying that in the context of conventional crops. From what I&#x27;ve read, they don&#x27;t pollinate many conventional crops but they are drawn to fruit trees. Otherwise mostly native plants which humans don&#x27;t cultivate for food.<p>In some places I know similar species are actually grown for commercial pollination, so it&#x27;ll vary from place to place for sure.')
