The compiler and runtime is written in Rust (Qt is C++), the renderer is a lightweight GLES 2.0 renderer  and winit is used for window creation and events.<p>The runtime’s API is available as plain C++ API (only depends on C++ standard library), JS api in node (via neon) and Rust natively (simply a crate). It’s generally rather lightweight in terms of its surface. Instead the focus is on our compiler generating API for the input design files, to make it easy to manipulate properties or feed data models into the UI.<p>We’re internally using QStyle calls to produce images of controls when selecting that kind of styling at compile time, but that’s entirely encapsulated. The style you see in the wasm demos for example is entirely done using GLES accelerated primitives (such as SDF based anti-aliases rectangles).')
