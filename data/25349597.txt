I had a hamburger for dinner. An hour or two later, my ankles were itching fiercely and I assumed I&#x27;d run into some poison ivy while tending the yard, so I took some Benadryl (which may have saved my life). Around two in the morning, I woke covered in the worst hives I&#x27;ve ever seen--I looked like I&#x27;d been attacked by an alien life form. I slammed some more Benadryl, and then I passed out on the bathroom floor while talking to my wife, so she called 911. By the time the EMTs got there, my blood pressure was down in the 50s, and I was solidly in &quot;how are you still conscious right now range&quot;. One ER visit later, I had an epi-pen and an allergist appointment. :)<p>I count myself VERY lucky, and doubly so to have a wife who&#x27;d done lots of allergy research and knew how to respond!')
