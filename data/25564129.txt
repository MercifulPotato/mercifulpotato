Alternatively games won&#x27;t actually <i>want</i> to render photorealistic and will want to render with varying types of stylized graphics. Is that easier or harder? Probably a little bit of both.<p>We actually are at a point where we can real-time render photorealistic scenes... for certain types of objects. Primarily static environments. Photogrammetry is basically cheating, but it is highly effective! Mandalorian is famously filmed on a virtual set and it&#x27;s cool as fuck.<p>Graphics is moving rapidly into physics. We might be soon be able to render photorealistic scene descriptions. However simulating the virtual world we still have a long, long ways to go. By simulation I mean everything from the environment (ocean, snow, etc) to characters. We most definitely can not synthesize arbitrary virtual humans.<p>Will we someday see a movie that _looks_ like a live action movie but is completely virtual? Oof. Maybe? But even if we could, would we want to? I&#x27;m not sure.')
