HN relies on the &quot;platform&quot; choice to avoid responsibility for 3rd party posts. HN also relies on operators like dang moderating at the server side.<p>2. The proposed model would prevent operators moderating at the server side, when the &quot;platform&quot; model was selected.<p>3. Historically, Usenet had workflow, content, and userbase similar to HN - multiuser, near-realtime threaded discussions with text and links, on technical &amp; related subjects.<p>4. Usenet didn&#x27;t rely on centralized moderation by the operators;  instead the moderation was performed at the client side, by end users. This was entirely sufficient for the purpose. This was done partly in collaborative ways, with sharing of moderation tools &amp; datafiles.<p>5. Certain groups were centrally moderated through middlemen; participation in those was optional, and content was explicitly submitted to moderation. Those were generally ran in parallel to similar unmoderated groups.<p>HN, and other fora, would do just fine as &quot;platforms whose operators abstain from interfering in the flow of content&quot;, as informed by the historical precedent.<p>It irks me how quickly we forget the hard wrought lessons from the early internet.')
