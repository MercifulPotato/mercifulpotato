I am definitely curious to know what&#x27;s causing that, Pixel 5 has a slightly newer version of the same chipset (765G&#x2F;Adreno 620 vs 730G&#x2F;Adreno 618). The two best guesses I have is either the waterproofing really messes up with the thermals, or there&#x27;s some unlying bug causing bad performance in those specific benchmarks.<p>That being said, in real-life use, unless you&#x27;re playing some heavy games, phone devices are generally more memory bound than CPU bound in my experience, so the 2GB extra ram will go a long way.')
