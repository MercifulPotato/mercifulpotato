And where there is a lack of organization, this anger has no focus and what you see is a chaotic lashing out.<p>I think the same is true of populism in general: when you render individuals powerless you prime them to be welcoming to the populist who promises to fight for them.<p>Is that an excuse for either Gebru or Google&#x27;s behaviour, here, specifically?  I have no idea.  None of us have enough of the details to really understand what happened.<p>But the idea that labour shouldn&#x27;t challenge leadership, or that the public in general shouldn&#x27;t challenge the establishment, is a product of decades of union busting and concentration of power in the political class that we shouldn&#x27;t accept just because it&#x27;s become the status quo.')
