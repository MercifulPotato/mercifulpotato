Isn&#x27;t Rupert Murdoch a venture capitalist in this context? He cut a big check to a startup (Theranos) with high growth-potential in exchange for equity. How did Murdoch&#x27;s investment in Theranos not qualify as VC? It seems like Benedict is trying to argue that Murdoch isn&#x27;t a VC because he isn&#x27;t known typically as a VC. Instead of explaining his argument, he simply compares this to &quot;summer intern&quot; work. It should be pretty easy to make the distinction between VC and whatever Benedict considers Murdoch without resorting to attacking the reporters.')
