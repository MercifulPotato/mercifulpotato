Coverage is a big problem for some but not the biggest problem.<p>The biggest issue is arguably billing and pricing. You have no idea how much something will cost until it’s done. Medicade is paying over 80% more for prescription drugs than the EU.<p>&gt; In 2016 the U.S. spent 18% of its GDP on healthcare, whereas the next highest country (Switzerland) devoted 12% of its GDP to healthcare. The average amount spent on healthcare per person in comparable countries ($5,198) is half that of the U.S. ($10,348).<p>&gt; The average price per coronary bypass surgery in the U.S is 129% more than Switzerland’s next-highest average.<p>&gt; In 2014, the U.S. performed more MRI exams than most similarly wealthy countries at an average price of $1,119 per MRI. This was 42% more than the average price in the United Kingdom, 122% more than the average price in Switzerland, and 420% more than the average price in Australia.<p>&gt; While fewer appendectomies are performed on average in the United Kingdom compared to the U.S., the price per surgery in the U.S. is $15,930 – nearly double the price in the United Kingdom. Meanwhile, in Australia and Switzerland, where far more appendectomies are performed on average than in comparable countries, the price of each surgery is even less, at only $3,814 in Australia and $6,040 in Switzerland.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.healthsystemtracker.org&#x2F;chart-collection&#x2F;how-do-healthcare-prices-and-use-in-the-u-s-compare-to-other-countries&#x2F;#item-the-average-price-of-an-angioplasty-or-bypass-in-the-u-s-is-higher-than-in-comparable-countries" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.healthsystemtracker.org&#x2F;chart-collection&#x2F;how-do-...</a>')
