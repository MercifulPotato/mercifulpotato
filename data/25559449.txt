(E.g. the ecologically least-bad disposable one?)<p>- Other purchases with longer time horizons and tradeoffs. (E.g. roofing material, cars)<p>Also, do you have a plan to wrestle with the complexity of a product&#x27;s revision over time? For example I heard Vasque boots got way worse when production went overseas. Pyrex glass types, etc. One thing I&#x27;d hope to glean from your site is how to identify the good version of a thing, and to know whether I can still find a new one or need to look for a used one.')
