Some of the frustrations the OP had with respect to Ocaml are some I - and many others - have experienced as well. Enumerating those constructively can potentially benefit the Ocaml community as well.<p>However, as a possible target user...<p>Reading blog posts like these are _scary_. It is very rare that I want to read a &quot;hey, that service you use regularly? yeah, we decided to rebuild it from the ground up using entirely new tools &#x27;just because&#x27;&quot;.<p>Will I still be able to work?\nShould I postpone signing up&#x2F;paying?\nWhat new bugs will appear? \nWhich features I currently rely on will change or outright disappear&#x2F;cease to work? \nWhat edge cases that are currently handled will be forgotten?\nThe list goes on...<p>There are often very legitimate answers to these questions, and sometimes taking a HUGE step back in order to meet demands you didn&#x27;t know existed before is what&#x27;s required. But those requirements, and how this step back will address them, should be clearly laid out to your users.<p>More importantly, work such as this postpones any current roadmap features (potential) users may be waiting for and have been previously promised. Presumably an analysis has been done on how much they&#x27;d be postponed by, and why those features will benefit greatly once done. Sharing that would also be extremely helpful in assuaging concerns.')
