But it does, and it&#x27;s annoying!<p>They refuse since over a decade to implement some generic way to open the file-picker native to the running DE. They force their garbage usability on everybody, even people that would prefer not to use &quot;anything Gnome&quot;. Same issue with CSDs, by the way.<p>Like I said: They can have their broken stuff at their place if they prefer it like that. But it&#x27;s utterly antisocial to force that stuff on everybody without any opt-out possibility. They even actively and deliberately break and remove configuration options. That&#x27;s just not OK.')
