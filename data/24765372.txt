They probably knew how to optimize it, but didn&#x27;t because they had no reason to.<p>I say this as a professor myself, because we do that all the time in my team: we create some software system (also in NLP, by the way), we do experiments to show that it improves whatever metric we are interested in or that it teaches us something interesting, we publish a paper with it, make the code available and then move on to the next paper. That&#x27;s what we are typically incentivized to do. The time spent into optimizing a system that we are not going to take to production anyway is time not spent doing more research. Which doesn&#x27;t mean that we don&#x27;t know how to optimize.')
