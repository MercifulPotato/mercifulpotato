I hung out on Fremont Street a lot, toured Zappos, and tried to contact him through every avenue I could, but couldn&#x27;t meet him.<p>I became disheartened by the business and startup ecosystem in Utah, and began moving everything from Utah to Arkansas right at the time he was moving in.<p>It feels like we had a bunch of near misses and I can&#x27;t help but think that things could have been different if we had connected.')
