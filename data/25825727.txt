We end up more often than not trying to fit developing a digital product into an enormously stupid gantt chart to execute some poorly thought “business requirements”. I prefer to talk products and not projects, I deliver the full thing including “growth” as adoption doesn’t come “if you build it” even within a Company setting. If you are building a product you can also get closer to those with the real problem willing to fund you with real budgets. On top of everything else if you are making users happy they will not chase you on fake estimates but rather work with you to get stuff done.')
