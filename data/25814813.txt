It&#x27;s a drawdroppingly low number for those of us in cities that even the rest of the U.S. considers overpriced.  That&#x27;s what he&#x27;s playing to, the people who will be shocked by the number using their own hometown as a frame of reference.<p>He&#x27;s not Tweeting any context like that it&#x27;s X% below median SWE wage in Warsaw. If it&#x27;s still an insultingly low wage even by the standards of the area, it doesn&#x27;t hurt to put it in context.')
