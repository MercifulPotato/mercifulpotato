Item(by='CogentHedgehog', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604023197, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24937737, text='My conclusion is making sense of both of these.<p>Why didn&#x27;t I believe Greenwald initially?  Well, I have had the dubious pleasure of seeing many people behave badly and then play the morally-outraged victim to try to legitimize it.  There&#x27;s a particular way they write and talk, and Greenwald&#x27;s description of events reeked of it.<p>The Intercept&#x27;s response made a few jabs but it didn&#x27;t level any particular wild accusations, unlike Greenwald. It seemed much more credible, although clearly frustrated.  I assume (reading between the lines) there he developed a prior history of conflicts and bad blood at the Intercept, and political differences.  This kind of blow-up does not just come from nowhere.<p>Greenwald has since released the emails, and they sound much closer to what the Intercept said than what he did: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;greenwald.substack.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;emails-with-intercept-editors-showing" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;greenwald.substack.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;emails-with-intercept-edito...</a><p>The editors clearly had substantive journalistic concerns about the extent Greenwald was drawing conclusions from dubious evidence, and the lack of context around it.  They&#x27;re comfortable publishing the parts of the story he can substantiate, but not the parts that are weaker (or less on-topic). There have some political disagreements, but that&#x27;s hardly censorship.')
