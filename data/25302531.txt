Now it&#x27;s not.<p>A company I&#x27;d consider to be currently endgame (say, FAANG), may not be 10 years later.<p>For the sake of discussion, as I mentioned in my original comment, I would simply define an endgame company as one where I&#x27;d be satisfied staying for a while without further ambition about finding the next great thing. Where I&#x27;d be content doing a helluva great job and not even think about leetcode.<p>My best friend ended up at one of the FAANGs a few years ago and is doing exactly that. Although he is now afraid that his leetcode skills have atrophied and he&#x27;d fail interviews horribly if for whatever (involuntary) reason he ends up having to look for another job. But he has no short term intention of leaving and thus hasn&#x27;t been grinding leetcode for a while.')
