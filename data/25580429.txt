That does NOT mean that heard immunity is the goal.<p>So where is your source on herd immunity strategy? Or will you just keep on spreading lies?<p>EDIT: Off course Sweden, just as Finland admits, calculated and talked about herd immunity. But there is not a single shred of proof that they picked that as a strategy. Do you really think everyone at the FHM (health agency) colluded on doing this behind the backs of the population and then they all keep it a secret? Why? What would there motives be?')
