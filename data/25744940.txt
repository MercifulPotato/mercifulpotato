Dutch people do know that the extent of their bike lanes and infrastructure is incredible.<p>I&#x27;ve only seen the new &#x27;megafietsenstalling&#x27; at Den Haag Centraal train station complained about because 8000 bike parking spaces was not ambitious enough and is not expected to be enough space. And yet, it&#x27;s the second largest in the world after Utrecht (also in the Netherlands).<p>At a comparable train station in London, you would be lucky to find 10 bike parking spaces.')
