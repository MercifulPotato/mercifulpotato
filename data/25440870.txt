I try to keep the number of windows opened to the minimum: Having more than 4 windows opened is counterproductive (at least for me) since it implies 4 different context I must switch between. I can handle 4 different windows opened easily without any tiling wms.<p>The windows I have opened are:\n- the terminal (at most 4 tabs as well... but here my terminal allows me to easily switch to any numbered tab I want)\n- the IDE (sometimes). In most cases, my IDE can be run on my terminal (e.g., Vim)\n- a web browser (again, I try to keep the number of tabs to a minimum... but here it&#x27;s harder to do so)\n- anything else (usually nothing)<p>Another reason to not use a tiling wms: yet another dependency I don&#x27;t have to take care (as in: configuring and updating it).')
