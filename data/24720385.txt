The thing that stands out is that Doppler is a technology in its own category — analogous to what Airbnb is to the travel industry or what Uber&#x2F;Lyft is to transportation. As far as I know, nothing else exists like it, and yet it’s incredibly useful.<p>Have been in touch with one of Doppler’s co-founders and he’s been extremely helpful in integrating Doppler for us to use with NextJS (hosted on Vercel). Way to go on giving attention to your customers. We’ll be using Doppler for life, that’s for sure.')
