No legislation can even happen without bipartisan support unless one party has control of the House of Representatives, the Senate, AND the Presidency. Oh, and unless there&#x27;s a supermajority in the Senate, the minority party can filibuster most legislation anyway.<p>Sounds like a great way to ensure that compromise has to happen, except that the party in power ends up getting credit for anything that gets done (or doesn&#x27;t get done), plus to the other side they&#x27;re dangerous fanatics who can&#x27;t be trusted.<p>If you&#x27;re in the minority, why not just ensure that the ruling party (if it can even be called that) fails to accomplish anything? Your side will love blocking their agenda, and if enough people aren&#x27;t paying attention maybe they&#x27;ll blame the other side for &quot;not getting anything done&quot;.<p>As long as your party can hold out hope for not losing too badly in the next election, the status quo works just fine.')
