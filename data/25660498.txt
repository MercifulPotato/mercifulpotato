The government is obviously touchy about other countries recognizing what it views as a breakaway province. China views such recognition as meddling in its internal affairs.<p>In Western news coverage, though, I see precisely the opposite of what you see. Taiwan is often listed as an example to follow, while China&#x27;s combating of the epidemic is largely ignored.
