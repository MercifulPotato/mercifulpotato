For instance, even if a phone company learned that an answering machine had a libelous outgoing message (see Anderson v. N.Y. Telephone Co. (N.Y. 1974)), and did nothing to cancel the owner&#x27;s phone service, it couldn&#x27;t be sued for libel. Likewise, a city couldn&#x27;t be liable for defamatory material on signs that someone carried on city sidewalks (even though a bar could be liable once it learned of libelous material on its walls), and a broadcaster couldn&#x27;t be liable for defamatory material in a candidate ad.&quot;<p>If you see a difference between that and &quot;common carrier&quot; that is relevant to whether an entity considered a traditional platform would have to carry spam or porn, what is it?')
