In SIMD terms, all <i>lanes</i> of the core will be &#x27;along for the ride&#x27; in case of control-flow diverging. The core must run the instructions for both branches, effectively disabling and re-enabling its various lanes as necessary. When disabled, a lane does no work.<p>What SIMD calls a <i>lane</i>, SIMT calls a <i>work-item</i> or (perhaps more confusingly) a <i>thread</i>. The term &#x27;core&#x27; refers to the level at which there is independent control-flow, much like in CPUs.<p>See <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Single_instruction,_multiple_threads" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Single_instruction,_multiple_t...</a>')
