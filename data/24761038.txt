The programmers need to make their lowest altitude a real figure rather than some arbitrary figure.<p>There are several places in the world where land is below MSL. Two that I know of are the Dead Sea in Israel and Lake Eyre in central Australia. The Dead Sea being the lowest, the programmers should organise their lowest altitude some 500 feet below that Dead Sea level. That way they are certain to cover all possible cases of &#x27;flying below the ground&#x27;.<p>I was wondering why they didn&#x27;t set the altimeters to the height above the local ground rather than standard altitude. The Israeli airport would have had instruments to give the local air pressure. Trying to calculate negative heights in your head during a landing is looking for trouble.')
