I gather that I&#x27;m one of the few users of Google Play Music, so it&#x27;s not surprising it&#x27;s being killed. But it was one of the few streaming services that had the ability to upload your own music, a good catalog, and widespread device support.<p>YouTube music is OK, but worse in a bunch of respects. It separates out your uploaded music into a separate library (admittedly the matching in Play Music was always a bit wonky, but better than just giving up on the problem) which makes finding and managing music much more annoying. The UI is also really, really slow. Tt loads a single page of albums &#x2F; songs &#x2F; whatever at a time and takes a second to load the next one.<p>This can turn the process of scrolling through your albums, which has been effortless since iTunes debuted, into a multi-minute process. I&#x27;ve been hoping ever since they announced the switch that they would improve this stuff but it doesn&#x27;t look like they&#x27;ve made any progress.')
