I tried during a vacation, and it was way more work and way slower than it needed to be, and it wasn&#x27;t because it wasn&#x27;t powerful enough, it was the OS.   Dumping photos from an SD card with not apple photos ran into a lot of annoyances and was a lot slower than doing the same thing with a 5 year macbook pro at that point, something that is objectively slower in the CPU realm and were both using USB2 speed SD card readers of some sort.  Not to mention iOS&#x27;s hostility to backgroup apps, making my file syncing app need to be on the foreground all the time for it to sync my photos to my E2E encrypted cloud drive.<p>A convertible M1 MacBook Air would probably be a better iPad Pro than that iPad Pro would be, and I think that is where apple is going with the &quot;touch-size-ification&quot; of macOS.  iPad Procreate running full screen on a macOS convertable would give you %95 of the iPad experience TBH.  A laptop is better than an iPad for videos and web browsing TBH.')
