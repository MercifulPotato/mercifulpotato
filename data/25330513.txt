For example, I&#x27;ve noticed that the commute to and from work provided a nice break to get into work mode or to decompress out of work mode.<p>On my drive in, I can think about the things I need to get done during the day, maybe think about how to solve a tough problem. I can organize my tasks, think about what to do first, etc.<p>And many times on my commute home, listening to music allows me to put the work out of my mind, so when I get home I can fully detach. Obviously, it doesn&#x27;t work this way all of the time, but without this barrier while wfh  it feels like I&#x27;m in work mode even if I&#x27;m not doing work any more.<p>There is really no one size fits all for everyone, and it sounds like the vast majority of people don&#x27;t want wfh. And for those that do, I think it&#x27;s a good idea to try and see if more wfh options can be made available for people.')
