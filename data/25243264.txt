On average, you can pull 4% from a balanced portfolio and it should last in perpetuity.  Again, on average, across a range of scenarios.<p>So $1M nets you $40k, <i>before tax</i> or around $33k after tax (assuming no-state tax state of residence).<p>That&#x27;s $3k per month free and clear, which would be doable a single person in a LCOL area, even having to pony up for a high-deductible health insurance plan.  You&#x27;d have almost nothing left at the end of the month, but that&#x27;s the plan?<p>Edit: Good point below - most&#x2F;all of the returns will be capital gains and the rate is 0% under $40k (which should be easy to keep below, since you&#x27;d be selling a percentage of initial investment + returns)')
