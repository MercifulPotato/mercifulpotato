Or camera + audio recordings of all government rooms and corridors. All encrypted, hashed and archived with a very specific and difficult to fake process that can &quot;unseal&quot; them.<p>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m a genius or anything, but why aren&#x27;t we putting really smart people on this problem and giving them plenty of funding? I constantly think we&#x27;re just a few steps away from putting in a small set of technological solutions that would <i>over time</i> solve all our political&#x2F;criminal problems.<p>E.g. Just imagine a world where all politicians, CEOs, major figure-heads are <i>safely and securely</i> recorded constantly. Think of all the ridiculous talking points and &quot;Scandals&quot; that would go away, be disproven, or never occur at all.')
