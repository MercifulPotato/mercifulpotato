The default assumption is everyone should be working together to accommodate on how we can all work best together.<p>I&#x27;ve been in environments where certain communications styles are labeled more correct or ideal. So I&#x27;ve really loved this guidebook + accommodation approach.<p>I went into this article with an open mind about there possibly being toxicity I haven&#x27;t witnessed w&#x2F;i the company. But tbh the evidence comes up short and just doesn&#x27;t match with what I&#x27;ve seen. I have interviewed at companies where some level of toxicity was easy to pick up on during the onsite (eg Uber during peak growth years).<p>My fear is that this article might scare away diverse folks from Coinbase, and possibly even crypto at large given some of the descriptions about the industry at the end. CB is a really great company for any curious nerd to join. I&#x27;d also say the Ethereum community and associated startups+labs are especially welcoming and friendly.')
