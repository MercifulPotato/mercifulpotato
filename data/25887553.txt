Item(by='kelnos', descendants=None, kids=[25887646], score=None, time=1611448320, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25885348, text='&gt; <i>I’m doing it for the blog content and the experience and to hopefully provide you guys with some very cheap Raspberry Pi’s for your projects!</i><p>One other thing here that makes me happy is that these repaired Pis will not end up in a landfill, which I bet would have otherwise been the end result.  Yes, there are electronics recycling services, but who knows if the original owner would have gone that route, and I imagine there still ends up being quite a bit of unrecycleable waste, not to mention the energy required to do the recycling itself.<p>Meanwhile, I have a thermoelectric wine fridge that died recently.  Looks like it&#x27;s the logic board, but the manufacturer doesn&#x27;t make them anymore (couldn&#x27;t find anything on ebay etc. either).  I feel really awful that I&#x27;ll likely have to have to toss the thing due to what is probably a really cheap and easy-to-replace dead part.  (I need to take another look at it to see if there&#x27;s something obvious like a blown capacitor that I can replace.)<p>&gt; <i>Instead I will be donating the proceeds of the sales to the Raspberry Pi Foundation and they can decide what to do with the Money!</i><p>This is just really awesome.  Kudos to the author.')
