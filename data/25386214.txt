Yet the vast majority don&#x27;t need special consideration to live their life. Even when someone does need special consideration what is important: Those bumps in the sidewalk that let a blind person know there is a road crossing ahead are critical to their safety - but they are very uncomfortable to someone in a wheelchair, sometimes to the point of being unable to use the sidewalk at all!<p>In short, the question is invalid. What is really needed isn&#x27;t a yes&#x2F;no response it is an appendix of what accommodations they have and already and then a blank of what you need. If you are in a wheelchair and the place already is wheelchair accessible then you are not disabled, but if the building hasn&#x27;t be remodeled to wheelchair accessibility you are disabled. If there won&#x27;t be a meal&#x2F;snacks then your food allergies are not a disability, but if there are then it could be (could because some are you know what to avoid and can trust to find the something safe, while others are don&#x27;t even have something in the same room).<p>But it is easier to have a yes&#x2F;no question even though that is useless to everyone.')
