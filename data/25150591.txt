Someone disagreeing productively should get your upvote - even if you still disagree with them.<p>Subreddits often become a way for mods to push their agenda. There are exceptions to this - &#x2F;r&#x2F;moderatepolitics has done a decent job of becoming a good place for across-the-aisle discussion, etc. Unfortunately even productive subreddits get raided by crazy people and extremists from time to time.<p>HN by not having scores (visible to anyone but you) prevents the &quot;playing for internet points&quot; game. As a user you have very little history and exposure to others so each argument is generally standalone. Whereas on reddit someone will dig through my comment history and bring up the subreddits I&#x27;m on (&quot;Oh, you claim to be a moderate so you&#x27;re really just a nazi!&quot;) or stalk me, that kind of bad behavior is just not possible on something like HN.')
