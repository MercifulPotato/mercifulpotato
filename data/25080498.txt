It felt wild in the beginning but now, after 10 years, I&#x27;m glad I took the risk. Yes, I have had a few sleepless nights trying to solve problems (90% of time caused by myself, remaining 10% caused by not reading wiki&#x2F;docs&#x2F;forum before doing stuff). And yes, Arch is not as polished and pretty as MacOS is but... I don&#x27;t care, I do backend so I can survive without frontend niceness. In the same time I feel sorry for people who rely on tools from apple... it won&#x27;t be as easy for them to switch.')
