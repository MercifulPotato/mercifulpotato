The article is mainly informational.<p>TFA:<p>&quot;What does this mean for the future of AI research? Things may not be as bleak as they look. The cost of training might come down as more efficient training methods are invented. Similarly, while data center energy use was predicted to explode in recent years, this has not happened due to improvements in data center efficiency, more efficient hardware and cooling.&quot;<p>Also. One flight in and of itself isn&#x27;t an environemntal problem; thousands of flights are.<p>Training this one instance of a model isn&#x27;t an environmental problem; I would be curious to see some educated guesses about the number of models being trained over the next ten years. Not an expert but I know that use of ML is exploding - lots of new use-cases and thus lots of new models.<p>So it makes sense to me think about this stuff.<p>To')
