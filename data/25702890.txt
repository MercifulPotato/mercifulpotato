Item(by='rconti', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610216270, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25696585, text='I often wonder if it work for some personalities vs others. For lack of better terms, I see the two personalities as community-minded and leadership-minded.<p>I&#x27;ve got this idea in my head where community-minded are people who like forums, facebook groups, etc. The leadership-minded like thought leaders. This might be a pro athlete, it might be a cutting-edge researcher, it might be the president. You might be a follower of many leaders, or you might be a leader yourself (or both). On Twitter, people can gain celebrity by actual thought leadership, or just applying their &quot;street&quot; popularity to the online world. Or by loudly shouting the most outrageous things you can, for clicks. Think of how people try to be &quot;influencers&quot; on Instagram or YouTube, for the dollars or for the attention.<p>When I&#x27;ve tried to make Twitter work for me, I&#x27;ve worked to curate my feed with thought leaders (and a few F1 drivers). But I find that I often just don&#x27;t care about what they have to say except on a very very narrow set of topics. I don&#x27;t care about celebrity, and the thought leaders don&#x27;t post often enough about the topic they lead on, for the signal to be worth the noise. And I&#x27;m not interested in trying to be a &quot;leader&quot; for leadership&#x27;s sake, but then, on the rare occasion when you have something to say, your voice is unimportant, because you don&#x27;t have followers.<p>I&#x27;ve always been somewhat allergic to celebrity, and I&#x27;m not saying people who find value from Twitter are celebrity-seekers, but it does feel like the mindset is orthogonal to mine, and the value I derive from social networks, I have a very hard time deriving from Twitter.')
