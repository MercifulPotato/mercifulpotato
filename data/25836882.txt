With the revenge murder you add another corpse to the pile and probably end up removing yourself from the utility pool.  Without it, perhaps the rapist-murderer adds something of value to the world before their death, and you don&#x27;t remove yourself from the utility pool.<p>Utilitarianism is simplistic, but then again, so is &quot;I&#x27;d feel morally obligated to do it, and I&#x27;d be a coward if I did otherwise.&quot;  Point being, this is not a hard point to argue against, using almost any philosophical framework created in the last couple thousand years.')
