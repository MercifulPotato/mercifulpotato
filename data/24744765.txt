Not like they are on opposite sides, but intuition almost always has a lot of technical holes, and when you are coding, something always ends up surfacing from those holes... and it&#x27;s never pleasant. In this sense, focusing on the data and simple rules is most likely to bring us closer to the true technical problem that we are trying to solve. Abstractions and organization and good names are still vital because <i>we do need</i> an intuitive vision of the <i>system</i> as a whole, but the technical processes need to be strictly correct, not just intuitive.')
