Cosmetic surgery is largely useless, but people still do it. It&#x27;s an issue of bodily autonomy.<p>I used to live in Germany, where health insurance companies cover all manner of quack treatment in the standard plan. You cannot choose a plan that does not cover this. It&#x27;s annoying, because I don&#x27;t want my insurance payments to be funding someone else&#x27;s placebo habit, but it seems there is no broad move to change this. Society as a whole has decided that placebos are okay.<p>I do think doctors should be honest with their patients about the various alternatives and not push them toward useless surgery, but I&#x27;m not sure it matters very much if some people still choose to get it.')
