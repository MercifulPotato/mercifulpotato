He said he was never sick in orbit, but once he came back to Earth “I was probably more sick than I was in my life.”<p>Astronauts launch into orbit with their own germs and get exposed to their crewmates’ germs and then after a week with nothing else new in the “very sterile environment” of a space station “your immune system is really not challenged,” Linenger said.&quot;<p>Thus we can see that not being sick while in orbit, despite all the stress and other space factors - microgravity&#x2F;radiation&#x2F;etc. - which are supposed to weaken immune system, while getting sick on return when those space factors disappear clearly favors the immune system antigen exposure dependence explanation.')
