And people who want wealth inequalities to fade away, can they explain people who have better looks due to better genetics. Then they carry for their next generations. Maybe also force attractive people to mate with less attractive ones so these inequalities also go away? Sounds insane doesn&#x27;t it? This is equally insane idea.<p>This is just unfair to everyone. It is wrong, immoral, unethical to tax the wealth of people, if you don&#x27;t account for other inequalities in life. The inequalities will persist, just that when assets, money isn&#x27;t that medium of storage, people will only value looks and other things even more, because that&#x27;s how you&#x27;d effectively store your wealth, untaxable. The genes of the people become the platform for storing wealth in that kind of world. The only place where breaking or taxing people&#x27; wealth is agreeable is when they become too powerful and above governments. No other excuse.<p>This is something seriously overlooked.<p>Why do some guys get all the girls and some don&#x27;t. Isn&#x27;t it unfair to those guys that they have their needs emotionally met just like any other successful humans? If you are so fair, fix these problems. Everyone has feelings, and it&#x27;s not their fault that they&#x27;re bitter about it.<p>Is it those men&#x27;s mistake that they were born in this world? And they couldn&#x27;t even do anything to rectify that problem when the baseline is so high to reach?<p>Everyday I read about these people and it makes me sad. Thankfully I don&#x27;t have any of those problems, but I can&#x27;t overlook those who do have them. Atleast they&#x27;d have a chance in todays world had they pushed themselves and become wealthier.<p>This isn&#x27;t only about men, but women too.<p>When you save money and forgo pleasures, you aren&#x27;t supposed to be penalized.')
