And at what point does the child learn to recognise images of anything?<p>I mean, how do you know it takes 5 billion images of non-horses before the child can learn to recognise a horse? Even if the child sees 5 billion images of non-horses, who says that they haven&#x27;t learned to recognise the non-horses and the horses from the first of those 5 billion images? After all, I don&#x27;t know that children stay transfixed for hours staring at horses and non-horses while their brains process all those billions of images until they finally get it.<p>I think you are making an effort to explain away something that is not very well understood by modern science, by analogy with machine learning, even though there is no good reason to suppose that the two are connected in any way.')
