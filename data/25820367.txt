Not only is my wife a working engineer, but I do this same kind of meal all the time on my own as a full time working person, and it takes about 5 minutes of bumping around the supermarket and yaoya that are across the street from each other conveniently located next to my station. It really is not hard to put together a nice meal of a hot pot or whatever. Miso soup isn’t literally just miso and water, you can put whatever you want in it, including boiling vegetables, tofu, fish, soy milk, whatever - crazy simple, I some variation almost every day and it’s neither boring nor a meme.<p>Meta point, you sound very bitter and defensive about this. How about give some of the suggestions people have made a shot? Like I mentioned, can you read some Japanese? Cookpad has tons of simple recipes.')
