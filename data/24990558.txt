One item cannot be used to harm others<p>Going looking for expensive power tools in unattended work vehicles to pawn because you&#x27;re desperate for your next fix or  driving drunk sure sounds like &quot;harming others&quot; to me.<p>I am well aware that that is the exception and not the rule.  The same is true for guns and explosives. Most guns will never be fired at anyone, they will go home, trunk, range, trunk, home, repeat or they will sit in a closet collecting dust.  Pretty much all non-commercial explosive use in non-warring nations is for entertainment (anvil tossing and the like).')
