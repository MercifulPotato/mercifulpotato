If you want to anyway, I understand that at least mypy has syntax for this<p>Neat, I didn&#x27;t realize this. This is far from desirable, but nice to know it&#x27;s possible.<p>&gt; Many syntax niceities will be introduced in upcoming Python releases. From the article:<p>I mean, typing out &quot;Union&quot; and &quot;Option&quot; or even having to import generic types from the typing module aren&#x27;t really the syntactic pain points I was referring to. It&#x27;s more like &quot;Where do I define the TypeVar for a generic method on a class? Do I define it inside of the class or at the top-level module? In either case, if I reference that variable in another method, does it imply that these two types are the same? No doubt there are answers, but Python is the only language in which I have to navigate these kinds of questions. Similarly, having to create a protocol for kwarg callbacks seems really heavy. These are the kinds of things I would like to see improved.<p>&gt; Dropbox has dedicated engineers maintaining mypy. And of course a few volunteers such as myself. And Guido. :)<p>Yes, I didn&#x27;t mean to suggest there was no investment, only that the progress seems really slow (also, I didn&#x27;t realize Guido was a volunteer? I thought he was employed by DropBox to work on Python). How long have recursive types been in a holding pattern, for example? I don&#x27;t mean to disrespect you or any of the other maintainers--no doubt you&#x27;re doing great work.')
