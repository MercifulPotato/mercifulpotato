Item(by='jbullock35', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611838314, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25937287, text='&gt; There is a clear implied threat: the threat is that you [the &quot;teacher&quot; in the experiment] will be removed and someone else will be brought in to finish the job.<p>The claim made above, by others, seems to be that the experiment involved an implicit threat against the &quot;teacher&quot; that might explain why he followed instructions to deliver electric shocks to the &quot;learner.&quot; How is being removed from the experiment an &quot;implied threat&quot; against the &quot;teacher&quot; that would get him to follow instructions? And if it isn&#x27;t a threat of that sort, how is it relevant to understanding why &quot;teachers&quot; followed instructions?<p>&gt; the assumption [that is, an implicit premise of the experiment] is that your actions cannot stop the experimenter from inflicting harm without yourself harming the experimenter<p>That doesn&#x27;t sound right. The teacher can put a temporary stop to the experiment by refusing to obey -- that is, by refusing to shock the learner. He can put a permanent stop to it by, say, calling the police.')
