It’s crazy.  I have a 5 year old dual CPU Xeon with 128GB of RAM and a couple NVME disks that I’ve spent about $1000 CAD total to build ($700 USD).  Something in that range on Azure is about $1 &#x2F; hour if you reserve a year.  ~$9000 per year.<p>All the people running workloads that don’t require the redundancy given, like CI, blow my mind.  The costs are astronomical vs buying a cheap or used server.  Sure, use the cloud for you production builds, but why not augment it with something that doesn’t cost as much?')
