Item(by='kevincox', descendants=None, kids=[25995112], score=None, time=1612202899, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25989698, text='Reminds me of <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;remotestorage.io&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;remotestorage.io&#x2F;</a> which I have used in a (mostly personal) website. I like that I can provide a service as a static website, and users pay for, manage and have control over their own storage. One of the things that could help it bootstrap is that they also support client-side Google Drive and Dropbox shims, so users who want to use something else can, but most users will just use one or the other.<p>There are downsides though.<p>- The API may be less than ideal for some use cases. This can make a well-performing app hard. For example there is no relational-sql API.<p>- You can&#x27;t migrate user&#x27;s data. So if you make changes to the format you need to retain backwards compatibility &quot;forever&quot;.<p>- If you want to provide &quot;discovery&quot; or cross-user features you will need to have your own storage anyways.')
