If an independent, volunteer mapper contributes a poor edit, someone from the community has to reach out to them individually. This is hard since there&#x27;s no prior relationship, and no expectation that the person will even take any advice on editing.<p>Contrast that to a major corporate contributor: the people leading these corporate mapping teams are all talking. Both to each other, and to leaders in the community like prominent volunteers, OpenStreetMap Foundation board members, etc. If a corporate contributor makes a bad edit, one of those _existing relationships_ can be used to help put processes in place that might prevent not just that one individual, but any other contributor paid by that company from making the same error again.<p>IMO at least, that process scales a lot better. And as OSM continues to grow that will be even more valuable than it already is today.')
