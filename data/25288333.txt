Item(by='oblio', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606999851, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25288271, text='&gt; When packaging has become standard, no one competes there any more. If everyone has the mindset that this is expected and OK, just focus competitive efforts elsewhere -- product quality, branding, better ingredients&#x2F;parts, lower price, whatever. Your packaging design&#x2F;pollution budget is now free for other opportunities.<p>They can still brand the packaging. Just use biodegradable, safe glues, paper, paint, etc. to put on top of the actual bottle. Yes, the bottles will be a bit generic, but there&#x27;s a lot you can do with a bit of creativity.<p>What they&#x27;re doing is like developers rewriting the Python library 1 billion times because they all want to be special snowflakes. Though rewriting does happen, the vast majority of developers build on top of the standard library, not besides it.<p>&gt; And then there is the entire packaging design industry, not a small one, who will not like this at all. Anyone want to play devil&#x27;s advocate and guess what they might say?<p>When a few benefit and many lose, that&#x27;s called corruption. Any proposal will have some people against it, you can&#x27;t please everyone all the time.')
