So much complexity everywhere. I wish Stripe would handle MORE problems &amp; complexity and would happily pay for it.<p>Just a few examples Stripe could handle:<p>- Checkout + Portal is a great start, but it still takes too much (expensive) design+dev brainpower to create the entire experience of a high quality trial-to-paid and existing-customer billing management in a SaaS app.<p>- Running a SaaS company at any scale is full of Support headaches that Stripe Dashboard simply does not handle well - stuff like tweaking a billing date, and doing combination (e.g. wire transfer + credit card) payments, &quot;can you re-send my invoice but with my VAT ID on it this time?&quot; and many more. At any scale, lots of effort is spend on custom billing support tickets and building internal tooling even if you use all of Stripe&#x27;s features.<p>- Are you a SaaS company selling all over the US? Good luck being complaint with all 50 states in terms of sales tax reporting without expensive legal&#x2F;accounting help. Did you hire any remote out-of-state employees? Good luck -- now your financial compliance got even more complicated.<p>Stripe doesn&#x27;t do any of these things well today. And if they did, it would likely be much cheaper than the in-house solutions everyone is coming up with instead. I think Stripe should handle 10x as much complexity for a SaaS company than it does today, and of course they should get paid for doing so.<p>[1] I agree it would be amazing to see Stripe come up with smoother flows for supporting payments that bypassing the expensive card network&#x27;s fees.')
