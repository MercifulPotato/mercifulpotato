If yes, it would be helpful if you could point to resources that were helpful to you and any daily practice schedule you followed?<p>I have tried learning piano and I found a lot of stuff irritatingly hard to get right and got bored. Like for some reason I am not able to transition to other keys well when I am using both hands or when some finger involuntarily moves because of motion of neighboring finger. Also, I seem to get finger fatigue which is surprising considering the amount of time I spend on keyboards anyway.')
