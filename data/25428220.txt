I agree to a certain degree with the GP that philosophy is mostly post-rationalising of existing phenomena. It&#x27;s the creation of these ideas that allow for deeper thought and exchange of these ideas. Einstein had the idea of relativity before he could prove it.<p>When it comes to creating &#x27;new things&#x27;, it seems an individual&#x27;s curiosity and serendipity is what drives innovation. But I think one must not underestimate the role philosophy plays in this as it can give one&#x27;s thought direction.')
