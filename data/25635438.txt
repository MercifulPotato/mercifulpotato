I don&#x27;t know if they improved the accuracy of their tests, they were kinda sketchy when they announced it.<p>The PR and marketing is not targeting the US for some reason, maybe because they think no one will want a &quot;Russian&quot; vaccine in the US or maybe because it&#x27;s more expensive... but in other countries it&#x27;s going to be &quot;the&quot; vaccine, so I hope it works.')
