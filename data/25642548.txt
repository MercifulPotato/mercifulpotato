There are so many issues to worry about you can really only afford to pay attention to a few. Water pollution, food pollution, being able to to be housed and fed 20 years ago...the list goes on and on. And computer security is obscure and way down the list.<p>I would be quite surprised if American citizens were not able to come to a reasonable (at least partial fix) consensus on most of these issues in fairly short order if there was a platform designed specifically for making such decisions.  Of course, getting any substantial value out of this knowledge would require a means to pass legislation, but &quot;democracy&quot; is at least as compromised and beyond control of the citizens as our software is.<p>Nonetheless, I think it would still be valuable to have a grassroots way for the public to actually voice their opinions on matters, at least then we could all have a good laugh in higher resolution at how we allowed control over our destiny to slip out of our hands, without putting up even the slightest fight.')
