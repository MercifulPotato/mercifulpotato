You are right that being able to run the system on a smaller number of nodes reduces inefficiencies and reduces the &quot;hit&quot; of diminishing returns stemming from Amdahl&#x27;s law. However, to do that, you need to speed up your code and I argue that unless you speed up the non-parallelizable part together with the parallelizable part, you won&#x27;t be able to achieve that system speedup that allows you to remove a number of servers from your cluster in the first place.<p>However, I think you are right that on small number of servers speeding up parallel part can have a more immediate effect. I did a small calculation just to check the numbers. Assume you have a server that can do 100 RPS. You can either speed up the parallel code 2x (let&#x27;s be realistic here and stop this 100x nonsense) and bring the RPS almost to 200 or you can take that serial code that is just a fraction and reduce it by half, so that f=0.995 and not 0.99 (and adding a marginal RPS increase to 102 RPS).<p>Here is the plot: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;7w1hms9" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;7w1hms9</a><p>Edit: read <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.frankmcsherry.org&#x2F;assets&#x2F;COST.pdf" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.frankmcsherry.org&#x2F;assets&#x2F;COST.pdf</a> as recommended in the upvoted comment above!')
