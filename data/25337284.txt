Usually they&#x27;re looking to rep their OS to other people, whatever that OS ends up being, so rather than build on its strengths, they look for a specific set of strengths to which they&#x27;re already attuned over time spent with other OSes. Ergonomics and sensory aesthetics are big preferences of this group. Good refresh rates, overall feeling of smoothness, little wastes of their time eliminated, etc.<p>Mouse acceleration is IMO a good pointer to this kind of sensibility. Unfortunately if that&#x27;s really important to you (not that you can &#x2F; can&#x27;t tweak it, but the _way_ in which you need to do some perceived extra work to configure it) it&#x27;s important to know that it may be best to build on and adapt to Linux&#x27;s other strengths, or try it on the side in something less important, or stay with what you already like.<p>Other phrases like &quot;people should expect&quot; or &quot;things like X should just work&quot; are also good clues here. Nothing wrong with that, but Linux brings really huge subjective strengths to the table (a deeper connection to what do _you_ need or want, starting closer to bare hardware, vs. what do _people_ need or want, starting closer to end user experience) unless you are doing specific types of work where Linux is already a known dominant solution for groups of people.')
