The whole notion of setting personal goals, working out tasks and sub tasks and strategies and charts - like, you deal with all that stuff in your work life.<p>Give it a rest. Be with your family. Look at a sunset. Read a book or two. Paint or play the piano. Eat well, go for a run. Do things that are good for you and other people. Spend less time on your phone. Be a nicer person.<p>None of this needs a chart or a strategy or a plan. It&#x27;s just common sense humanity.<p>Don&#x27;t worry if you &quot;fail&quot;, it&#x27;s the journey that counts. You don&#x27;t need to be grade VIII on the piano or the best artist in your social circle - just enjoy doing whatever it is. Find stuff with flow. Live life. Don&#x27;t spend your time measuring it.<p>Just my halfpence.')
