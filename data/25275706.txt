But I&#x27;m still happy to celebrate the Turkish couple&#x27;s German company that&#x27;s owned by Pfizer, as I will be when Oxford hopefully release more good news on top of their initial press release.<p>And our culture is far from perfect in the UK. Criticising a country&#x27;s problems doesn&#x27;t prevent also celebrating its positives.')
