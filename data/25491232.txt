Such is communication between humans ;)<p>Btw. in case it helps you. No fresh clone in a different place needed. I think I know what kind of situation you mean and all you need is to cherry pick your commit on top of the branch you want instead of doing that merge&#x2F;rebase that isn&#x27;t working out. Takes even less time than cloning somewhere else and moving your changes over.<p>And in some cases what this sort of situation really just needed was an interactive rebase that just skips the appropriate commits that already happened on the main branch. Suddenly a litany of seemingly unresolvavle conflicts doesn&#x27;t even exist in the first place. Many ways leading to Rome there.<p>I would encourage you to always work from just within exactly one repo with git. The whole &quot;having another copy of the repo somewhere else&quot; is something I have seen so much with svn but it just really isn&#x27;t required with git at all. And even if you have to &quot;do a fresh clone&quot; you really don&#x27;t have to. Just get rid of all files (rm -rf) except the .git directory (or copy it where you need it) and checkout again. I&#x27;ve used that a few times when I was having build issues and I wanted to make absolutely sure there were no generated files from either my IDE or the local build left anywhere that could screw things up.')
