The court will assume that no reasonable person would agree to a contract without reading the contents and consulting with a lawyer on anything that is unclear during the contract&#x27;s negotiations, and for major contracts between large companies, they would be correct.<p>It would be a nearly revolutionary change to introduce a law like &quot;you cannot meaningfully agree to any contracts or agreements without a lawyer advising you and a representative of the other party empowered to negotiate the terms.&quot; I&#x27;m all for it, though.<p>You&#x27;d need to fix several other kinds of laws around liability for negligence and the like, but those things need fixing anyway. The current hack where everybody agrees to waive their rights to sue for negligence is stupid. You would, however, need a new kind of thing that handled common agreements like terms of a credit card. There need to be terms, hiring lawyers for each person is ridiculous, but &quot;contract&quot; is probably the wrong model since no customer could be expected to understand it all, meaningfully consent to it, or negotiate the terms. I would be interested in what an alternative system could be. I kind of imagine a government body deciding on acceptable terms for various forms of business, effectively acting as the customer&#x27;s agent in negotiations, but that seems ripe for corruption and also really inefficient and hard to innovate around.
