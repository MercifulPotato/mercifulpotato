Same goes for Square -- but for some reason, the emphasis on these integrations seems to be lacking... I&#x27;ve interacted with both and Stripe seems to &#x27;get&#x27; this integration value.<p>For them, the hardest part was getting the data, then maintaining the relationship to keep access. Stripe has a 0 cost data stream (which is a slightly different definition I guess for novel data stream) - it&#x27;s novel in that it&#x27;s kind of like the Rockefeller &#x27;what&#x27;s this stuff we dump into the river? oh gasoline?&#x27; type of novelty.<p>Also, the metadata that sits on top of all of this - which products are selling, what&#x27;s the product life cycle of company A in similarity to company B, makes this so much more potent than just the CC data itself. Stripe understands your business better than you do.')
