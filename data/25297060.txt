Slack made headway because it infiltrated from the bottom-up. Employees used it, probably sometimes surreptitiously, and once it had a lot of users it started reaching out to management teams. That’s the one thing that concerns me about the acquisition by Salesforce. Slack might not really cater to end-users anymore, although Heroku is one example where Salesforce seems to be doing an acquisition right.')
