But then many miss solving the problems they previously worked on and realize that creating change isn&#x27;t so easy after all.<p>So that leaves us in search for a company that one can be themselves, provides a feeling of accomplishment, and creates happiness. That&#x27;s a tough mix to find.<p>For me, the only solution to this problem has been to start a company of my own. Sure it brings it&#x27;s own problems, but the satisfaction and happiness it brings is well worth it.')
