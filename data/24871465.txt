But I have a major problem with programs that exist just to milk money, cost a fortune ($90K for like 15 months in some schools), and almost everyone who is enrolling in these programs do it for the wrong reasons (i.e., not for the knowledge but for the prestige and networking; but I don&#x27;t blame them, it&#x27;s part of the system and they are just following the rules). They are also much less competitive than many people think. Getting into an MBA at Harvard is 100 times easier than let&#x27;s say Math. It&#x27;s not as bad as their executive programs, those are really BS and I always laugh when people put it on their resume cause they think the name Harvard would help them.')
