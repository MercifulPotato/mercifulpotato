The ad doesn&#x27;t appear &#x27;in the browser window.&#x27;  On Windows 10, for instance, it pops up in desktop Notifications.  The ad is a sentence of text and a button, full stop.  No video, audio, animations, or anything creepy.  Just a little dialog box you can click or dismiss.<p>Every time that happens you receive BAT, a cryptocurrency, that accumulates in your automatically created BAT account.  You do with it what you will but, by default, it is periodically distributed to sites that opt-in to accepting BAT.')
