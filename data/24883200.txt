I was describing a database with centralized trust.<p>&gt; <i>Why rebuild what already exists? A blockchain is a great drop-in solution and reduces our costs and implementation worries massively.</i><p>I didn&#x27;t say you should rebuild anything.<p>It sounds like you think that the only easy-to-use, mature append-only databases with cryptographically verifiable logs (popularly called &quot;ledger databases&quot; these days) are blockchains. That&#x27;s not true. All the major clouds have such databases now.<p>&gt; <i>And the distribution of this public blockchain is much more decentralized than we could ever achieve running our own nodes.</i><p>I still don&#x27;t see any evidence (either from you or anyone else advocating blockchains) that this is good for you use case.<p>Can you please explain an attack that is possible against something like Amazon&#x27;s QLDB[1] but is impossible against a public blockchain?<p>There&#x27;s also the issue of speed and usage costs of public blockchains, not to mention the frequent bugs, 51% attacks, and other uncertainties that come up.<p>We know the costs of building on public blockchains. I&#x27;m dying for someone to come up with a benefit that is <i>only possible</i> on that blockchain. Every time they try, it seems to be benefits that are shared with services like QLDB or a variety of FOSS solutions.<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.aws.amazon.com&#x2F;qldb&#x2F;latest&#x2F;developerguide&#x2F;verification.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.aws.amazon.com&#x2F;qldb&#x2F;latest&#x2F;developerguide&#x2F;verif...</a>')
