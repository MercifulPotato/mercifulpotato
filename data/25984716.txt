They&#x27;ll always line up with whatever they believe will maximize profits because that their entire reason for existing.<p>That&#x27;s both unfair, and quite frankly lets companies like Boeing off the hook. Executives get paid egregious amounts of money to set the direction of companies. Yes, some do focus solely on profit and it&#x27;s generally obvious when they do. Some focus on making customers happy at nearly all costs.  And there is everything in between.
