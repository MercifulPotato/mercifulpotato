Indeed, if I understand you correctly, it&#x27;s a major cause of both languages&#x27; slow compile times, and a source of a lot of difficulties for humans learning and writing both languages.<p>But this makes me suspect we may be using very different definitions of &quot;accidental complexity&quot; here: Your usage seems to apply to programs, which wind up over-specifying low-level details in both languages. My usage of the term applies instead to the languages themselves, and the level of extra pain they inflict on programmers who have already accepted the C++&#x2F;Rust&#x2F;etc aesthetic.')
