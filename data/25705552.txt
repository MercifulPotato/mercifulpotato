I interpreted it to mean that most people don&#x27;t naturally have the capacity to kill others who they identify as equals, and that&#x27;s why many extremist groups take steps to <i>other</i> their targets.<p>I get the sense that people are reading it to mean that the rioters at the capital <i>hadn&#x27;t</i> been radicalized like this.  Or that dehumanizing people in that way is somehow okay.  Perhaps you can clarify.<p>I tend to believe that, thankfully, most people don&#x27;t have the capacity for extreme violence at a moment&#x27;s notice.  It takes intense conditioning.  The US military started to emphasize this [1](paywalled) after it was discovered that even during combat, <i>while people were shooting at them</i>, most soldiers didn&#x27;t try to kill their enemy or even fire their weapon [2].<p>So it seems like the highest priority is to re-humanize the &quot;normies&quot; and &quot;communist antifa spies&quot; or whatever nonsense phrase these extremists are using.  I have *absolutely* no idea how to do that, but it must be done.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;opinions&#x2F;killing-does-not-come-easy-for-soldiers&#x2F;2017&#x2F;10&#x2F;13&#x2F;6008e742-ae26-11e7-9b93-b97043e57a22_story.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;opinions&#x2F;killing-does-not-com...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.historynet.com&#x2F;men-against-fire-how-many-soldiers-actually-fired-their-weapons-at-the-enemy-during-the-vietnam-war.htm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.historynet.com&#x2F;men-against-fire-how-many-soldier...</a>')
