Once you solve protein folding, you can take DNA sample and see the structure of the molecule without working in lab using crystallography techniques.<p>Solving protein folding is huge, Nobel in chemistry scale achievement. It would be massive leap for biochemistry.<p>It seems that Deep Mind solved competition benchmark and made huge leap, but it&#x27;s just partial solution that works on limited set.<p>After you have solved protein folding, there is still  problem of solving chemical interactions between molecules accurately. Quantum chemistry is extremely compute intensive.')
