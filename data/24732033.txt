Item(by='hnracer', descendants=None, kids=[24732631], score=None, time=1602263382, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24731484, text='One problem is that the power to vet&#x2F;censor particular things may be beneficial in a certain pair of hands but disastrous in another, especially when you&#x27;re dealing with a platform that has extremely powerful network effects and controls so much of the information flow in society. To reiterate the point of the previous comment, would you feel comfortable if FB came under control of the Saudis while it was engaged in extensive vetting? I would not. Naval says that one test of a good system is whether you can hand the keys over to your adversary and things don&#x27;t go wrong, which applies well in this case.<p>Another problem is that vetting (&#x2F;censorship) is often supported when it&#x27;s &quot;your side&quot; doing the vetting, but I don&#x27;t trust that any politically tilted group of individuals will engage in unbiased, non-partisan vetting. FB&#x27;s staff is of a certain political demographic that differs substantially to the country at large and this will likely sway the decision making away from a fair and balanced outcome.<p>If FB or Twitter engages in vetting I would like to see it done in a satellite office set up explicitly for that purpose where great effort is made to select individuals without extreme political leanings.')
