I&#x27;ve noticed no slowdown or performance decrease, but my fans spin up MUCH less often and my battery lasts a couple hours more.<p>I suppose it goes to show just how badly Intel has screwed up in recent years -- so much development went into this &quot;Turbo Boost&quot; feature that heats up processors hugely under any sustained workload in a way that no laptop can properly keep up with. In certain cases it could make sense (&quot;my project takes 20 seconds to compile, and then the processor basically shuts off&quot;) but I routinely end up pegging the CPU at max for 10s of minutes at a time for huge compilations, and the minute the fans spin up I know that Turbo Boost is about to thermal throttle my CPU into oblivion.')
