It seems like there were two complaints, one of them was clearly a complaint of rape (I&#x27;m not saying a rape definitively occurred, but the accusation was intentionally breaking a condom and not using protection against the wishes of a partner is considered rape in Sweden) and one was a potential claim of rape (it is unclear in the other complaint if the preference for protection was a retroactive regret or something established before sex).  Anything that transpired after that, no matter how shady, is irrelevant to the initial allegations.  There were obviously people who wanted to use those allegations to achieve some political end.  However that doesn&#x27;t invalidate the accusations which deserve to be evaluated on their own merits.')
