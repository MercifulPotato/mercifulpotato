I think it&#x27;s a good way (the only way) to reason about the whole &quot;who pays for open source development?&quot; problem. \nIf you can define the terms of that license, and figure out how to get licensors to follow the terms, and copyright owners to license their code under it, then &lt;boom&gt;. Also it may be possible to prove the converse -- that it&#x27;s impossible to define such a license. Then we can all get back to work on proprietary software, or at least know we&#x27;re not going to get paid.<p>+Yes, I know.')
