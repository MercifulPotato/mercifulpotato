It&#x27;s a welfare program. Economically and environmentally it makes no sense, farms in upstate New York or Wyoming, when food grows so much better in Illinois and California.<p>Another good book: <i>An Indigenous People&#x27;s History of the United States.</i> There were people everywhere when colonists arrived, it isn&#x27;t even accurate to really call it wilderness.<p>Anyway, the celebration of the farmer is preposterous, the best thing that could happen to farming is if fewer people farmed, because prices would rise.')
