Except that, in Europe, most (if not all) forms of &quot;equity&quot; are proportional: your title, your salary, your ability to decide, etc.<p>It becomes an equivalence:<p>* Since you decide nothing, therefore your salary is low.<p>* Since your salary is low, you therefore decide nothing.<p>This stems fundamentally from a (backward?) European strict view of companies, regardless of how hierarchical&#x2F;flat their structure may be. And that view is that the corporate environment is split into two groups:<p>* Managers: they decide;<p>* Workers: they do work.<p>This split may have made sense in the Industrial Revolution era but it has shown it&#x27;s age in this day and age. And yet the model (and the perception, and the values) persist.<p>If you, as a knowledge worker, ever make the mistake of &quot;getting down and get things done&quot; you will have chosen your side.')
