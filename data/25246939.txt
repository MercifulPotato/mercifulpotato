This &quot;half awake, half asleep&quot; state is one I know quite well.<p>Here&#x27;s a variety of sleep paralysis symptoms I&#x27;ve experienced over the years:<p>- You&#x27;re in the &quot;real world&quot;, but you feel like you&#x27;re not really awake<p>- Limited control over your movements; or extreme difficulty moving your limbs; or you &quot;feel&quot; like you&#x27;re moving, but you&#x27;re not quite moving (or not at all; kind of like you&#x27;re swimming in tar)<p>- Extreme stress &#x2F; nervousness, like something&#x27;s wrong and you can&#x27;t figure out what; panic even sometimes<p>- Manifestation of some phobia (spiders, insects, monsters) in your room &#x2F; around you<p>- The last few moments, or last situation of your dream keeps repeating, like it&#x27;s on a loop (you &quot;wake up&quot;, think you&#x27;re awake, and you&#x27;re still dreaming)')
