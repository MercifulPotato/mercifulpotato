Item(by='autotech', descendants=None, kids=[25413903], score=None, time=1607923573, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25413815, text='For me, I hated to see parts missing or damaged on assembly. Wiring repairs or accessory installs made with scotch-lok connectors or wire nuts.Using crappy eBay parts. Using an entire tube of RTV sealant where only a dab was necessary. Messing with refrigerant including (illegal) venting to atmosphere. The list goes on and on but it boils down to improper techniques and materials. I really can&#x27;t fault anyone for trying to do it themselves. Most of the people who read HN can afford an auto repair bill so I think its more the &quot;hacker&quot; mindset that influences people here to attempt repairs themselves. Just be honest with the service department if you got in over your head. We won&#x27;t snicker too much :-)')
