There will be recounts in this race, but:<p>(1) There&#x27;s no reason to believe they&#x27;ll change the outcome much (recounts in 2016 didn&#x27;t) --- states have learned since 2000 and have moved away from faulty ballot designs.<p>(2) The recounts will be occurring in multiple states, and Trump needs to sweep them.<p>(3) The margins in those recounts are much bigger than in 2000 --- tens of thousands of votes, not hundreds.')
