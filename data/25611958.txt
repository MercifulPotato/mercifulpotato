But over time, CHI began to include more disciplines, especially the social sciences, evaluated papers with different value systems.  The technical HCI people didn&#x27;t use the same values as the social scientists, for instance.  Rather than try to settle a war of values, they simply increased the number of papers that were accepted, and also increased the number of best paper awards.<p>More fundamentally, evaluating HCI research is very subjective.
