I travel a lot, so having something ultra portable was my favorite part of the MBP 13&quot;.  I even had a smaller and lighter 45W usbC charger I could use for it.  I really really really enjoyed that.<p>and I just kept a dongle in my travel kit with my charger and other cables, nbd :) (but yeah everyone is different, I&#x27;d probably just invest in USB-c thumb drives, or the ones that have ports on both end for C and A).')
