I&#x27;m optimistic about the web in general, but I consider good, reliable clientside storage to still be an unsolved problem, at least for the moment.<p>Some of the things we&#x27;re still missing:<p>- the ability to easily share data between domains without opening yourself up to massive security risks.<p>- the ability to share data with native apps.<p>- the ability to move data between browsers without syncing it to an online account.<p>- the ability for normal users to inspect offline data.<p>- the ability to trust that browsers like Safari won&#x27;t just arbitrarily delete your data one day.[0]<p>- the ability to trust that browser upgrades won&#x27;t ever corrupt the data you have stored.[1]<p>- the ability to share large amounts of data without worrying about storage limits (this matters a lot if you&#x27;re making an editor like Atom or Visual Studio).<p>Typically, what I see with offline apps is that they&#x27;ll use offline storage, but they don&#x27;t trust it. They use it when possible as a progressive enhancement, but then they have to sync that data to a server someplace if it&#x27;s something that users actually care about. And that matches my experiences as a web developer as well. I can&#x27;t imagine building something like a password manager or text editor in-browser that was only storing data locally, I wouldn&#x27;t trust that.<p>It&#x27;s also not just a technological problem, it&#x27;s a problem of UX. If I tried to make a purely offline web app, I&#x27;d be getting angry customer calls in a week asking where their data went just from them clearing browser history and not realizing that it deleted all their data as well. There isn&#x27;t a user-friendly, user-controlled way to indicate that storage for one website should be permanent, and users aren&#x27;t really trained to think that way about the web anyway -- their instinct is to think of it as transient.<p>----<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ar.al&#x2F;2020&#x2F;03&#x2F;25&#x2F;apple-just-killed-offline-web-apps-while-purporting-to-protect-your-privacy-why-thats-a-bad-thing-and-why-you-should-care&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ar.al&#x2F;2020&#x2F;03&#x2F;25&#x2F;apple-just-killed-offline-web-apps-...</a><p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.androidpolice.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;12&#x2F;17&#x2F;google-fixes-chrome-bug-that-broke-local-storage-for-some-web-and-android-apps-no-data-is-lost&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.androidpolice.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;12&#x2F;17&#x2F;google-fixes-chrome...</a>')
