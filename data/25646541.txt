RedHats kernel is equally a master as SuSe&#x27;s. So you are maintaining various tips in a semi-synchronized manner. In most projects there is a single repository branch that is the true branch (with perhaps a few tags for LTR) that represents the project. For that reason a lot of Git&#x27;s mechanisms are unneeded complexity.<p>The killer features of Git is GitHub, and to a lesser degree local commits (after all, Mercurial has that too).')
