But it is not any more dangerous than suburbs or other cities (and significantly safer than rural areas), it is dense enough that there are many other kids around (many parts of the city have more kids within walk distance than a typical suburb), and kids will not be harmed if they see weirdly dressed (or weird undressed) people sometimes.<p>The biggest mortal danger kids face in the USA is cars. Followed by guns and various kinds of home accidents (drowning in pools and spas is a big one).')
