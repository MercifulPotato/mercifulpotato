Nothing. And in the 5% of cases they&#x27;d be excoriated for giving their client bad advice.</i><p>Spot on. EDIT: On further thought, there&#x27;s a wrinkle, which is that NOT being super-conservative can be good marketing for a lawyer.  In a 95% confidence situation, consider the lawyer who tells the client, &quot;here are the pitfalls, but IMHO they&#x27;re an acceptable business risk <i>[one of my favorite formulations]</i>, so if you want to do it, then go for it!&quot; That lawyer is likely to have a happy client who, if asked for a recommendation by a third party, might refer the third party to the lawyer.<p>(Of course, this presupposes that the lawyer has enough experience to be able to confidently weigh the business risks â€” and that a 5% disaster doesn&#x27;t befall the client.)')
