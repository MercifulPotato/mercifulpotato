I started learning Rust as a second language right after Python and it was hard to make sense of anything. Why the hell some values have the Copy trait and others don&#x27;t? Then I learned C and now I have good mental model of how memory is allocated and Rust feels okay. I just don&#x27;t like that it hides away the complexity because when it does not work, you don&#x27;t have the means to understand why, you just know did not follow the rules that you never remember anyways because they don&#x27;t make sense to you. C has quirks too and the learning can also be steep, but it forces you to understand how things are working under the hood. Will continue to learn Rust but I have high hopes for the Zig language which seems more approachable with C in mind (rather than C++ which Rust is said to be a replacement for).')
