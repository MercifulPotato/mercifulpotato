They weren’t super rich, they were from middle class Canadian families 25 years ago.<p>I even have a friend going to school today with a rental 5 bedroom house, as single parent raising 2 kids, and having 2 exchange students help out.  Between scholarships , loans, and the students from China it covers expenses (well over €2k monthly).<p>I recognize that is richer than 99% of the world.    It’s just my experience.<p>If you’re coming out of university and making £2k a month that is a bit low.<p>An MBA graduate makes €90k+ annually in Denmark.  This is about the same in other European countries maybe +&#x2F;- 10k<p>My point isn’t that some people have it good, it’s that €1-2k a month isn’t exactly glamorous living.   The “jet setting” types (I have known a few) are getting an allowance of €3-4k+ monthly.')
