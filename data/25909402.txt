Such links could only be intercepted from a space-borne platform.  I have no idea what laser wavelength StarLink is using, so it may not apply here.<p>I have no doubt that (like every other geo-mobile satellite constellation) the system allows for &quot;port mirroring&quot; on point-to-point links, or (more likely) relays everything through a ground station even when doing so has performance implications.  This allows them to fulfill their obligation to government(s) surveillance.')
