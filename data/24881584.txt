Seems like it should be a straightforward calculation.<p>My guess it it <i>is</i> a straightforward calculation, and that it is real.  We&#x27;ll have a hard time dealing with it existentially, but the math will be right and the physics will eventually be shown to correspond.<p>We&#x27;ll have something where a particle can be entangled with its past&#x2F;future self, the future self being affected by the past self and vice versa.  And that should be okay.  It&#x27;ll reignite the debate of the possibility of changing the past vs the lack of free will, but in a way it will push the &quot;shut up and calculate&quot; forward because it&#x27;s all math.')
