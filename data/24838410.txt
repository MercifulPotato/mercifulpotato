I say that as someone who has worked extensively in china, Taiwan, japan, and the usa. So for the same reason I don&#x27;t see why your anecdotal evidence is relevant.<p>I saw that movie. I saw a lot of chinese foreman types expressing their own bigotry towards american workers. I saw a lot of american foreman expressing their bigotry towards union workers, blue collar workers, and imo black workers.<p>I didn&#x27;t see any actual meaningful evidence to back up the claim that all chinese workers are harder working than american ones. That would be an extremely difficult claim to make evidence for, of course, like all prejudiced positions that paint with a brush as large as a race, culture, or country.<p>By the way, I can&#x27;t know why foxconn employees (in china, not in Taiwan) died by suicide individually, but I suspect it has a lot to do with the massive poverty divide in china, as well as the lack of social services. I imagine they worked in such awful conditions for such long hours because they wouldn&#x27;t have shelter or food otherwise, which as we know take precedence over all other needs.')
