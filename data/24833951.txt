Why can I not express emotions in an argument, or why do I need to be &#x27;rational&#x27;, or why can I not be subjective? I don&#x27;t mean this in an offensive way but why is everyone who argues supposed to pretend they&#x27;re autistic, because that&#x27;s honestly how this piece comes across.')
