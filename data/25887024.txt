Public wifi goes to wifi dongle + Pi and ethernet wire from Pi to ddwrt router. That one creates access point and is not a public wifi anymore lol. Thats for tor network or researching purposes. Boots from an old flash stick I found on the street.<p>I thought at the time Pi B was broken, turning off in 1 min while booting without any reason. LCD was going crazy on off.\nI booted without an lcd and pluged in. Yes time to type in usr+psw lcd on of went crazy but I managed to measure temperature it was 56°C in seconds +70°C and Pi went down.\nThen I went to the basement and attached huge fan from old gpu card and temperature of cpu is always +34°C works like a bee.<p>After some time I found third Pi B, SD card slot was broken I have soldered that one, works. But I have no use from it. Still thats an old hardware.')
