Item(by='PaulDavisThe1st', descendants=None, kids=[25879167], score=None, time=1611369557, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25878680, text='&gt; this nation was clearly intended to be a federation of states with independent control<p>Appeals to history like that don&#x27;t work for me. You could just as easily say:<p>&quot;this nation was clearly intended to be a place where only white men got to vote&quot;<p>or<p>&quot;this nation was clearly intended to be a place where slavery was legal and a slave was counted as 3&#x2F;5 of a human being&quot;<p>The emancipation proclamation, and later civil rights movements have changed those things in an explicit way. But I would argue (and I&#x27;m not alone in this) that many other legislative and judicials changes since the end of the civil war have undermined the historical notion of &quot;a federation of states with independent control&quot;.<p>I don&#x27;t disagree that it would be <i>better</i> if we were to explicitly modify the constitution to reflect these changes. But modifying the constitution is very tricky to do (a major defect in the constitution IMO), and so for now we have to deal a de-facto situation rather than one necessarily reflected in the words of an amendment or three.<p>The feds have never (so far) been faced with &quot;trying to conquer Wyoming&quot;. As outlined in the quotes I gave last time, the federal government <i>created</i> the Wyoming territory, <i>appointed</i> its territorial governors, voted on whether to allow it to become a state. The federal government owns most of the land in Wyoming too. This story repeats for more or less the entirety of the western states. It is purely an imagined fiction that these were once sovereign independent nations that finally decided to join the continental union. They were paid for and controlled by the union <i>until</i> they decided to be states instead of territories, at which time they had more self-determination in many important ways (but less in others).<p>This process is more or less unrelated to the formation of the states that existed at the time of the DoI. These states had already existed for 40-100 years in various ways, and had never been part of anything other than the dominion of the British monarchy.<p>I would wager that even had the constitution <i>not</i> granted WY it&#x27;s 2 senators for its 60k people, the handful of those who voted in 1889 would <i>still</i> have decided to become a state (the alernative was not some glorious independent future, but simply remaining as a territory).')
