Al Qaeda openly bragged about attacking the Great Shaytan (Satan). I don&#x27;t recall much opposition to that invasion.<p>The Iraq War was a definite mistake. The only argument that might stand, which is completely absurd if actually analyzed, is that of humanitarian intervention (against Saddam and his Ba&#x27;athist party). Even that humanitarian intervention angle, however, is very suspect due to the human cost of severe sanctions imposed on on Iraq after the first Gulf War, which the US maintained and pressured allies to do as well.<p>As we saw, once no WMDs were found, the US government switched to a different argument - the humanitarian one. And when that was shown to be BS due to thousands of civilians dying monthly at the hands of The Coalition of the Willing, they switched the argument to &quot;bringing Democracy&quot; to the country. It&#x27;s the biggest fuck up and biggest moral stain on this country since I have been living here (mid 90s).<p>Ultimately, the worldwide opposition was palpable. The WMD inspectors from the UN were kicked out by the US. Scott Ritter, the head of the UN group, decried the invasion and did in fact predict the US would achieve nothing and leave &quot;with their tail between their legs&quot;. It should have never happened.')
