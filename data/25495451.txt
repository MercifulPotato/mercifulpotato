I assume apple pays for devices, not necessarily time.  \nWhich means that we see the results, what motivated it, but we don&#x27;t know what apple paid for.<p>People can be mad at apple for not having enough scrutiny into their supply chain. From similar articles, it seems foxconn doesn&#x27;t pay very well, but it seems to match the promised levels here. Now I don&#x27;t know what cost of living is between those parts of China and India, so that&#x27;s a big caveat.<p>But it sort of torpedoes the outrage to me if the failure mode isn&#x27;t actually known. You can lament the salaries, but the fact is we don&#x27;t know what apple was paying for or what wistron&#x27;s operations were. We just know there were riots.')
