If that hasn&#x27;t been the case for you, I&#x27;m sorry.<p>Your claim that HoTT is &quot;broadly regarded as an exciting and important new area of mathematics&quot; is simply wrong. I suggest talking to a wider variety of mathematicians.<p>In particular, concerning &quot;well-regarded and prominent mathematicians,&quot; Steve Simpson and Harvey Friedman are on record on the Foundations of Mathematics mailing list saying, essentially, that HoTT is a waste of time [0]. The other set theory experts I know agree with them but haven&#x27;t said so publicly. My impression is that this is a fairly common view in the set theory and foundations community.<p>Further, Jacob Lurie, who is perhaps the most talented mathematician currently working in higher category theory, has also written he doesn&#x27;t think highly of it [1].<p>[0] I can provide links if it you want, but if you search the archive these arguments are easy to find.<p>[1] View the comments on this blog post: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mathematicswithoutapologies.wordpress.com&#x2F;2015&#x2F;05&#x2F;13&#x2F;univalent-foundations-no-comment&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mathematicswithoutapologies.wordpress.com&#x2F;2015&#x2F;05&#x2F;13...</a>')
