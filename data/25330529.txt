One thing I noticed when I experimented with what things would be called without the traditional names is that I would lose the &quot;namespace&quot; of what I&#x27;m thinking about. I think the names are awful, but Dorian means something specific, C something specific, etc. You can map it to just numbers like... scale 1 for note 1, mode +1, chord 5 and it may be initially easier to &quot;calculate&quot; the result, but also more confusing.<p>But then you just get used to the names with enough practice. A bit of a Stockholm syndrome. They&#x27;re still awful, but familiar enough you stop caring.')
