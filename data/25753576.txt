A few years the snow remains in the city for a couple of days, but is not that common and is usually seen as a joyful event.<p>But this time, the whole city was completely covered in snow, all of it. Cars abandoned in the middle of the street, people skying in the main avenues, it was crazy, no one I know has ever seen this here so if it has ever happened, it must been at least 80 years ago.')
