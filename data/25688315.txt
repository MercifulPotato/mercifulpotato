I might want to connect with others who have done this and ask what their approach was. Did they evolve from what they have or build from the ground up or use a domain driven design from first principles? Did they organize the APIs around team ownership? Is there tooling that proved particularly helpful in a migration?<p>In short, I suppose it&#x27;s boils down to having a group of people that you can ask &quot;I&#x27;m tackling X problem, has anyone else done it before? What was your approach?&quot; and hear their stories, warnings, gotchas, or recommendations.<p>Another reason is just to generally participate in discussions around current trends and problems that are being worked on. I feel like there&#x27;s a lot of good content out there (blogs, podcasts, white papers) that I&#x27;m just missing due to lack of visibility.')
