Are most users aware of that.  What this alleges Google is doing with AMP is making the delay worse, but there is still a delay.  This is part of the price the user pays for online advertising.  Not just (potential) visual distraction of advertising, but (real) time waiting for advertisers to bid before an ad can be shown.  Advertisers may be competing for the user&#x27;s attention (which they might fail to get), but they are always successfully stealing the user&#x27;s time (with help from Google).  Regardless of whether the user ever looks at the ad, or clicks, she still has to wait for header bidding to complete.')
