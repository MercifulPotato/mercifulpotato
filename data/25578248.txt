It&#x27;s a beautiful theory that&#x27;s striking all the right chords within me.<p>Lemme paraphrase the great Arthur C. Clarke about this. We are fish in water. And some time fishes do jump out of the water. And sometime fishes, while jumping out of the water are seeing fires on land.<p>That&#x27;s String Theory for me - it&#x27;s a fire on land that we get a glimpse of it and can&#x27;t quite make what it is. And until we will not walk on land and make fire ourselves we&#x27;ll never fully understand its potential. 20 years is nothing in this regard.<p>My 2 cents.')
