Item(by='vmception', descendants=None, kids=[25615592], score=None, time=1609614329, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25612615, text='Hi, I skimmed the bill and some explanations after finding out about it last night.<p>I feel like this bill doesn&#x27;t actually change anything. Look at your example: &quot;Someone from Russia could create a BVI company that opens a Delaware LLC and gain near-total transactional anonymity.&quot;<p>Your bill exempts every nominee or person paid to form the business. That is completely common practice, and also benefits the exact people you made this bill for?<p>Let me be absolutely clear, when I think about MY user experience, nothing has changed? If my registered agent formed the business with one of their employees names, or if my lawyer did that, in both circumstances there would never be a report to the Treasury for them, and there would never be a report for me.<p>I don&#x27;t actually want a burdensome regulation, but I also don&#x27;t feel Congress actually cares about this since this was just a rider into an actually politically charged bill, so I don&#x27;t mind talking to you about it:<p>How does this bill accomplish anything if it exempts everything that real people actually do, let alone anyone trying to mask ownership and control.')
