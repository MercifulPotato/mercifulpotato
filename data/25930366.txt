I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m very\nsqueamish but there&#x27;s stuff online that still profoundly disturbs me in my mid\nthirties. Meanwhile, and at the risk of bragging a little, I can watch any Tom\nand Jerry easily even late at night and still sleep soundly. Hardcore, I\nknow.<p>You couldn&#x27;t see the surveillance footage a guy being dismembered by a lathe or\nweird Japanese rape porn in 1080p by &quot;pushing a couple of buttons&quot; before the\ninternet.
