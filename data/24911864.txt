The examples given in that piece don&#x27;t show any priming (e.g. the one calling for suicide...). I would definitely not use such a model in a fully automated manner, but the outputs are better than that of most humans in many cases, and could support a human-in-the-loop system.<p>Here is an example I ran that was not cherry picked (I ran only 2 prompts like this, both were equally good).<p>Think about how many people you know who would respond as well? (I don&#x27;t know about you, but I definitely feel like I&#x27;m at a bit of a cliffhanger at the end also!)<p>----- Prompt ------<p>Mike is a mediator and crisis counselor.<p>===<p>User: My dad is always getting sucked into conspiracy theories and it&#x27;s getting worse. I&#x27;m worried since he recently bought a gun. I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s going on in his head. What I should do? What should I say?<p>Mike:<p>----- GPT-3 -----<p>I can&#x27;t diagnose your dad but it sounds like he&#x27;s dealing with some difficult issues or there&#x27;s some other stressor in his life. When people feel under stress or are dealing with difficult issues it&#x27;s common for them to look for meaning and solutions outside themselves. It&#x27;s helpful to approach him in a non-judgmental, non-confrontational way to start a dialogue. It sounds like you&#x27;re already trying to do that. I&#x27;d suggest that you let him know that you&#x27;re concerned and you want to be helpful. Then ask him what he&#x27;s going through and how you might help.<p>Listen to him without judging, interrupting or trying to solve things. Let him know you&#x27;re there for him and that you care. You could also let him know that you&#x27;re concerned about his gun and the consequences of using it.<p>If he&#x27;s willing to talk, when he feels like it, he might feel relieved to have someone to talk to.<p>If he&#x27;s not willing')
