Then, nearly by chance, I discovered MicroPython, and that you could actually program microcontrollers directly in Python. I fell in love with it, and started building Pythings.<p>The idea is to have a MicroPython-based OS running on a microcontroller (as the ESP8266 or the ESP32) that handles all the boring stuff (i.e. device setup, network connectivity, remote updates, error handling...) so that you are free to care about your application code only, which is pushed from the cloud directly on the micro. There are also other features, as a remote shell, a basic plotting engine and a few REST-ish APIs, but this is the core of it.<p>You can both sign up on the cloud or download and run it locally (everything comes dockerized and with a &quot;batteries included&quot; phyilosophy).
