No, it won&#x27;t take care of pipeline problems; no, it won&#x27;t solve the &quot;tipping point&quot; problem (i.e. where candidates of underrepresented groups are dissuaded by a lack of pre-existing representation, making it very hard to go from zero to one, so to speak).  That said, we&#x27;re uniquely positioned as an industry to do this - technical interviews are similar to auditions in that they hinge on skill-based performance - so why not?  It can&#x27;t be any less arbitrary than asking random questions about manhole covers and light bulbs.<p>I&#x27;d posit that even the &quot;show your thinking process&quot; parts could be done in this way - e.g. via text chat, or inline comments, or maybe even using voice obfuscation and&#x2F;or neutral avatars.')
