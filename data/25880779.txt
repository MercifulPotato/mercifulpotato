This has only recently become possible, thanks to technologies arising from the blockchain and cryptocurrencies.<p>I absolutely believe that the pendulum does need to swing back towards community controlled services but it&#x27;s quite the leap to make to say that we can only do that now and only with a specific set of technologies that this VC firm happens to be heavily invested in.<p>What about good old fashioned trust? Producing and following open standards based on systems of collective decision making is how we built the web in the first place. We don&#x27;t have to have zero trust networks with monetary incentives to rebuild the open web. We just need aligned individuals building towards a common vision of what the web should be.<p>I think our failure to do this well in the last decade has really been a failure of vision where former leaders in this space have either been too dogmatic to really represent our collective interests or all too willing to adopt antithetical business practices that compromise that vision in the first place.<p>We need new leaders to represent open innovation and to build alignment towards an internet that can really be a tool for disintermediation. Novel technology won&#x27;t save the web. Focusing on money will only exacerbate the problems in the long-run. A culture of open innovation is the only thing that will help us realize the abundance of the digital economy. To build that, we need communities that we can all trust will remain aligned to our collective interests.')
