It actually took me around a year to bring them to me: Initially my address was not served by them, I have to say I &quot;want business internet&quot; on their website to make someone contact me, and eventually bring their residential service to me (they use some short range wireless technology, a dish but not pointing to satellites but their other relay dishes nearby, so the latency is much better than satellites).<p>Another thing is that I refuse to use any service that doesn&#x27;t allow me to use my own router directly without any additional NAT. This is why I chose Sail over Sonic, a more popular local ISP in the Bay Area: In my area Sonic&#x27;s only service is the one they resale from AT&amp;T, which doesn&#x27;t allow you to use your own router.')
