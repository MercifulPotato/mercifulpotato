I wanted to submit performance metrics from a build script to an analytics service another team was running, but the service only accepted gRPC.  This meant the bash script had to somehow pull in the entire protobuf&#x2F;gRPC stack so it could say &quot;The build on this host for this branch took 12 minutes&quot;.<p>I think accessibility from a broad range of environments is a disadvantage of the &quot;protobufs everywhere&quot; approach.  I&#x27;m one of the few that still believes in dynamic typing though, so I&#x27;m probably biased.')
