(8 people, 100 - 200 customers). We create a WhatsApp group for every customer and stay with them right from onboarding onwards.<p>Beauty of it is they sneeze, we know. Everyone in the team kinda knows what&#x27;s important what&#x27;s not. we can confidently say things like &quot;nobody cares about that fancy feature&quot;. It super valuable for a startup to get immedeate feedback. Especially valuable has been knowing \n- the first things the notice when they start using: where is sort? how do i add team members? do i have to prepay? \n- feature requests: it&#x27;s painful to keep closing windows, need the ability to adjust windows, I also want to do this other thing you guys havent thought of. \n- Bugs: why am i seeing double messages.<p>Disadvantages are that some customers expect immedeate answers, unrealistic expectations. and its cringey to lay down the rules and set expectations every time. no matter how many times you do it.<p>Our take is its 80% good and 20% bad. As we grow the company, the idea is to keep doing this for a &quot;representative sample of customers&quot; . Customer feedback is gold. If you can setup some kind of process like this, its great.')
