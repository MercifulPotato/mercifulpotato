But what about the API of the language&#x27;s top-level constructs? A class must have an initializer, for instance. Or protocol &#x2F; interface has the notion of required as well as optional methods. Why is the latter (language APIs) not copyrightable but the former (standard library APIs) is? What is the substantive difference between them?')
