So, here&#x27;s what happened:<p>Drosten, Corman et al. from the Charit√© (among Europe&#x27;s largest and most reputable university hospitals and medical schools) published a paper [1] in January 2020 [2] in the &quot;Eurosurveillance Journal&quot; in which they described a diagnostic workflow to detect SARS-CoV-2 (not &quot;SARS-CoV-19&quot;, as you say) which they had developed and tested (both sensitivity and specificity). That became known as the Drosten PCR, and was the standard procedure initially to detect the virus (at least in Germany).<p>A group of 22 nutcases with bad English claim that the Drosten&#x2F;Corman paper is severely flawed, put up a &quot;report&quot; &quot;refuting&quot; it (on a website, not published) and demand that Eurosurveillance retract it.<p>That report (which highlights a few very minor actual issues, but is otherwise false, misleading, and blown up entirely out of proportion) is later used by covidiots to claim that PCR testing is flawed and full of false positives, the virus doesn&#x27;t exist, and further nonsense.<p>Needless to say, there are by now several different PCR testing protocols, they have been developed further, crosschecked, etc, and there is no major problem with PCR testing. Certainly no &quot;big scandal&quot;.<p>This is political posturing and fabrication applied to medicine.
