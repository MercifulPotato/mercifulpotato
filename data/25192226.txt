I&#x27;d puke from the pain.  I could barely think straight and in the rarest of situations my mind would pass out from the pain.<p>Migraine medicine and other kinds of medicine I was given did not work at the time, so thinking they might be cluster headaches I turned to 4-aco-dmt, which is psilocin without the psilocybin, so no stomach nausea, but a bit weaker.  It didn&#x27;t stop a migraine once it had started, but it did work as a preventative.  I did a little bit larger than a microdose once a week and had no pain, no migraines, no problems, for quite a long time.  (A regular full sized dose I could take once every 12 days without migraines.)<p>I turned to 4-aco over mushrooms, because it was legal at the time, and no nausea.  I believe it&#x27;s still legal today, but I haven&#x27;t kept up.  Today, mushrooms are legal&#x2F;deregulated in parts of the US, including where I live, so it&#x27;s less of a concern.<p>Today I have a prescription medicine that works.  I&#x27;m cognizant of taking a single drug for too long.  When I look up what I&#x27;m currently taking (sumatriptan) people online complain it stops working at 7 years of use.  This is great, because now I feel comfortable taking it for 5 years before needing to switch.  However, the second I start needing more to function, I&#x27;m switching it out.  I do not want a life long resistance.  That needs to be avoided at all cost. When I was taking the 4-aco I was a bit more cautious, because I can&#x27;t find online how long it works for migraines.  I would rather keep it in my back pocket if I ever need it again, so I went off it the second I found a prescription drug that worked, despite that the 4-aco worked better.')
