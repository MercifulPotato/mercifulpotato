You then sell it for $1200 + 10% Vat = $1320 you collect. You remit the $120 VAT you collected to the government, but you first deduct the $100 VAT you paid as an input tax credit = $20 paid to government.\nWorks out like sales taxes, where intermediate buyers have sales tax exemptions, but it is harder to cheat as there are no VAT exemptions = if you are exempt = Foreign Embassy, you file a VAT refund claim to the government, same if you export to someone outside your VAT area.')
