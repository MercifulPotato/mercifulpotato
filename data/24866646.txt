But I think it should be attacked from both sides: Unemployment benefits, healthcare for unemployed and so on should be so good that people don&#x27;t take the worst jobs. But also: employers should be forced to offer such good employments that the worst jobs simply don&#x27;t exist. The end result, and a measure of success here would be a higher unemployment. Having a low single-digit unemployment isn&#x27;t a mark of success.')
