If I make my client really wide, so that all heads are in a line, it should sound different than if all the heads are stacked vertically. (Also, people on &quot;page 2&quot; of a big meeting could sound like they are further away -- indeed, that latter feature is something I&#x27;ve always thought should exist for a teacher to be able to listen to the soft hubub of breakout rooms).<p>If the transfer function is fast, I could also see it being eventually paired with the camera that is already watching your face, so that it could tweak it subtly as you turn your head. I&#x27;ve noticed that people already naturally cock their heads towards someone they&#x27;re straining to hear, even though they are wearing headphones so it makes no difference (except as a subtle hint to the person talking).')
