Modern iOS has the ability to show multiple things at once, some of the time, but it pales next to what you can do on the general purpose OS of your choice. THAT, to me, is the productivity gap.<p>This is NOT to say that I want iOS to change and become more like MacOS in this regard. I think there&#x27;s a real place for both modes. It just depends on what you need to do (and, to a point, where you need to do it).')
