This is harder than in parts of the US, but no-one with a legal gun has problems getting ammunition.<p>Now, the boxes of 50 rounds that were issued as standard kit for military conscripts is no longer issued. This was designed to allow the conscript to fight their way to a designated muster point. As the need to do that is low currently the practice has been stopped to both save money and hopefully have a small effect on impulsive firearms related suicides. It&#x27;s perfectly legal and normal to put one&#x27;s own ammunition through an issued rifle.<p>There are also government sponsored shooting events, to encourage practice. The rounds here, being paid for by the government are tightly controlled to stop people walking off with handfuls for their own use.')
