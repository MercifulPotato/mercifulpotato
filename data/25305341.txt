These installs fail, in the middle of an ungrokable stack of install logs. I have to shuffle thru useless messages to eventually track down the source, and then try to find a new compatible version. So sure, maybe there&#x27;s native code in there, but I think claiming &quot;useful summaries are not the package manager&#x27;s job&quot; is silly<p>But I also have had other terrible experiences: packaging is a bit overwrought; the terrible import&#x2F;export&#x2F;module system in Python means your dependency names have nothing to do with where you import from; SSL Certificate errors crop up at random on domains with valid certificate.<p>I am sure it&#x27;s good enough to use, but I think it&#x27;s a bit pie-in-the-sky to claim all package managers are good and you just have to be in the community.
