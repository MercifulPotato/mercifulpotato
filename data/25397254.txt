And unfortunately, the attempt was somewhat successful. It&#x27;s maybe the most effective way to get very famous very quickly, especially if you elude capture for a long time.<p>Something tells me there&#x27;s a decent chance he may get identified one day. But if it ever happens, I suspect it&#x27;ll be like this cipher solution: it&#x27;ll take more decades, more toil, and more excruciating retreading of old ground until the right combination of advances in technology, dedication, and creativity finally uncovers a thread that quickly unravels.<p>My absolute deepest respect and admiration go to the cipher crackers and to everyone else working on this and any other murder cold case; amateur, professional, civilian, or authority. Each individual knows they probably won&#x27;t succeed, that probably no one will ever know who they are or what they did, that there&#x27;s probably a major opportunity cost to what they&#x27;re doing. With very few exceptions, they&#x27;re doing it solely because it&#x27;s the right thing. Keep doing what you do. You&#x27;re our unsung heroes.')
