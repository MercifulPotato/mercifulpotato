Even if process shrinks bottom out two or three node shrinks from now there will still be improvements in process, materials, thermals, and packaging to allow things like greater z-axis stacking. And there&#x27;s a ton of room for targeted improvement in things like vector instructions.<p>That&#x27;s not to say that there isn&#x27;t an enormous amount of improvement available in software. Projects like simdjson prove that there&#x27;s a 2x or more improvement available for many high-performance use cases by migrating to vector instructions.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;simdjson&#x2F;simdjson" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;simdjson&#x2F;simdjson</a>')
