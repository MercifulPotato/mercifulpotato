As I said, biometrics == identity.<p>Compare biometrics with identity:<p>1) Your identity is not secret. Your mother knows you, your entire school knows you, your neighbour knows you, when you go anywhere the police may ask for your ID at any time and knows you. Biometrics is the same.<p>2) You don&#x27;t hide every day from the world. You don&#x27;t cover your face (ok maybe before COVID) when entering a shop ;)<p>3) You cannot change who you are. You shouldn&#x27;t have to and shouldn&#x27;t want to. Same for biometrics.<p>4) If your identity is discovered then of course they know who you are. Same applies for biometrics.<p>So yes, biometrics isn&#x27;t passwords, it&#x27;s identity. Username + Password is a workaround to establish a person&#x27;s identity and will never be as good as a biometric. The fact that you can have multiple usernames but only the same right index fingerprint is proof that biometrics is superior in establishing your identity than username + password.')
