Over the years I am agreeing with this more and more. It seems lately it has become very fashionable to constantly being &quot;outraged&quot;, &quot;angry&quot; or similar. Sometimes anger can motivate people to change things but usually it causes  a lot of friction and prevents finding solutions to problems. Anger can also easily be exploited by political leaders.')
