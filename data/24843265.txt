To take the simplest idealized example, if the production of goods and services is unchanging, and people&#x27;s needs are unchanging, the only possible source of price changes is a change in the money supply.<p>In the real world, of course, the quantity of goods and services does change and so do people&#x27;s needs. But that just means the price system now has a genuine function: to inform people about the changes in supply and demand through changes in prices. Messing with the money supply just obfuscates those price signals with an arbitrary quantity of noise. So while it&#x27;s true that messing with the money supply isn&#x27;t the only cause of price changes in a real economy, that&#x27;s certainly not an argument that printing money is okay.<p><i>&gt; If all the wealth currently currently squirreled away in places that banks can&#x27;t trivially lend out (art, real estate, etc.) were instead cash in the hands of the lower and middle classes, I would expect a lot more money to be chasing those goods and services against which we measure inflation.</i><p>That would depend on where the cash came from. In the case of real estate, for example, if you want a mortgage, the government will print most of the money (all but the three percent or so that banks in the upper reserve tranche have to put up--but IIRC even that minimal requirement was waived by the Fed fairly recently). So turning real estate into cash (by, say, taking out mortgages to buy homes from lower and middle income people who have more house than they want or who would rather rent instead) just means the government prints more money. Which will indeed increase average prices, but that&#x27;s just an example of what I was talking about.<p>If, OTOH, you&#x27;re talking about something like auctioning off expensive art works and using the money to start a business that employs people, so those people now have more cash to spend, that just means a transfer of cash from whoever buys the art works. That won&#x27;t affect average prices at all; it will, however, increase the price of art works (assuming that the supply of those is basically static) and decrease the price of whatever things the people who bought the art works would have bought instead. Those two changes will cancel out on average.')
