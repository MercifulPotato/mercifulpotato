In my social bubble convenience is king. Privacy is not something desirable, because people &quot;have nothing to hide&quot;. It&#x27;s something they don&#x27;t consider at all. They are not stupid or uneducated, they know stories about stasi. They don&#x27;t care. And they care even less if privacy brings inconvenience. And this is where we, techies, should step in: provide privacy-friendly platforms which have the same level of convenience. Is that going to happen, tho? No. The problem is too hard, the status quo too deeply entrenched, no better (!) money is to be made here.')
