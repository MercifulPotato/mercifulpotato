Consider, the same weight of dry firewood would still burn slower that that much paper&#x2F;kindling.<p>One could argue those are different ingredients, and to an extent I can agree with that.  However, the point is the same ingredient at a different density is practically a different ingredient.  So the problem is some ingredients shift during rest into other ingredients.<p>Which, I don&#x27;t think, is controversial.  Whole milk and cream are obvious facets of this.  And most different types of flour are visually indistinct.  Then there is kosher salt versus table salt.  Pretty sure those are not really substituted just by weight.')
