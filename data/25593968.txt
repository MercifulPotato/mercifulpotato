We may also use multiple payment processors in this case and fallback to a more expensive one if we see our preferred one go offline for a while.<p>MQ&#x27;s are distinct from APIs. APIs require both sides to be free to talk, while an MQ allows one side to send when it&#x27;s able and the other to read when it&#x27;s able which can happen out of sync.<p>MQs do have limits but this is typically several orders of magnitude higher than an API - a few million queued messages is pretty trivial on any decent MQ cluster.<p>An MQ isn&#x27;t a buffer alone, it&#x27;s also routing, retries, error handling, deadlettering, etc. This is the difference between your crappy in-memory blind buffer and something like RabbitMQ. Yes MQs still require maintenance&#x2F;attention&#x2F;etc, they&#x27;re not magic.')
