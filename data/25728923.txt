Item(by='pietjepuk88', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610373666, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25727094, text='&gt; In his article, Vitalik claims Electrum’s cosigner model isn’t good enough, without mentioning it by name.<p>He says multisig has been very successful for organizations like the Ethereum Foundation, but suggests that it&#x27;s possible to better for individuals. You are free to choose something that reduces to N-of-M, if you want to trust financial institutions, family&#x2F;friends, and&#x2F;or (mostly) yourself.<p>If I&#x27;m understanding what he writes correctly, it&#x27;s somewhat similar to a &quot;1 OR 4-of-7&quot; multisig concept. Fairly sure this is supported by the Bitcoin protocol, although I don&#x27;t think any wallets support it. There might be additional options you can implement on Ethereum that might be harder (read: require protocol upgrades) on Bitcoin. Time delays, maximum spend amounts (with exceptions), etc.<p>Also, I&#x27;m not sure why you&#x27;re calling it the &quot;Electrum cosigner&quot; model. I thought multisig was a feature of the Bitcoin protocol, and not of the Electrum client?')
