The first two were smash hits after season 1. Schitt&#x27;s Creek was a really good show from the start but it wasn&#x27;t well known until later seasons. It didn&#x27;t &quot;hit it&#x27;s stride&quot; it built up it&#x27;s audience over time. The quality was always there.<p>The shows Netflix is cancelling aren&#x27;t even close in quality.')
