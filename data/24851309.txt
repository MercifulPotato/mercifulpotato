Look in prisons and you will find plenty of people who have ruined their lives and others by not thinking things through at all. Hell most criminals are dumb and serial killers have been horrifyingly successful with relatively basic precautions and choice of victim as most arrests are on the &quot;dumbasses&quot;. Horrifyingly lead exposure can cause violent impulsivity and is strongly linked to crime rates.<p>Just getting upset about them being &quot;irresponsible&quot; or not as it &quot;ought&quot; to be is unproductive pseudo-moralism (the distinction being that it is reasonable to require that for a set code to be considered moral it has to actually improve the situation in at least some sense or else it is irrelevant) it doesn&#x27;t address either the root cause or the symptoms. Hammering them with hard consequences fails so continious nudging with trivialities shows better results for all involved even if it is a tacky and kind of weird stop-gap social work. Getting into the classic &quot;if it looks stupid but works well it isn&#x27;t stupid&quot;.')
