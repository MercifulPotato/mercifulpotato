For EDM, cultural differences have kept the US lagging behind Europe and the UK. EDM-specific clubs are not common outside of major cities known for nightlife. A lot of EDM tours end up at venues that aren&#x27;t designed for EDM. These are the conditions informing people&#x27;s tastes, so probably a big factor for why bass isn&#x27;t as prominent as elsewhere.
