What really prevents the phones from being updated is that they publish neither open source drivers nor hardware documentation, and then ship blob drivers that only work with a specific kernel version. When that kernel version becomes outdated and the hardware maker doesn&#x27;t make drivers for any newer one, it prevents newer versions of the OS from being installed on the older hardware.<p>Granted Google could probably lean on them a little harder to stop doing that.<p>Moreover, Apple does the same thing. They might give you longer than HTC, but they still stop issuing updates to perfectly operational devices, and don&#x27;t publish the documentation necessary for anybody else to make an OS for them.<p>Compare this to PCs where you can still install the latest Windows or Linux on some piece of hardware that originally shipped with a CRT monitor and whose manufacturer went out of business a decade ago.')
