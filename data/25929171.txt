But our system is very complicated. There are supposed to be checks and balances at every level that comprise a type of Sybil resistance to rife dishonesty and exploitation from one person no matter how wealthy or to what position they were elected. Thus it would take a conspiracy, or at least some level of coercion or bribery, to subvert our system. Is it really just a bunch of hard-working impeccably-honest people engaged in fierce competition against each other at the top, as we were told to assume in Econ101? Or is it more like cooperative game theory where normal people are not players, but the game itself. Or is it something different altogether, not motivated by profits, but by ideology, something secret and anathema to those not in on it? It seems that the latter is simultaneously most celebrated and feared, that ‘the elite’ would use their power to manipulate us into something of their liking, “to serve man”, presented as broad selfless gestures of benevolence and philanthropy. It seems today that all voices of power are engaged in a constant rally of fear-mongering, hatred, and censorship against the few voices screaming, “it’s a cookbook”. Sometimes I wonder whether this is a clear implication of something wicked, or just a profitable form of madhouse entertainment, full of social illusions.')
