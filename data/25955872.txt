Worring about income distribution seemed a bit unnessecary when there was so much growth that &quot;everyone&quot; gets a piece of the cake.<p>This really isn&#x27;t the case anymore, but a large part (maybe even a majority) of americans still seem to think that growth is the most important factor when designing their economic system.<p>The new administration doesn&#x27;t have a mandate to change this, Biden didn&#x27;t win because he promised reform, he won because he promised to stop trump from dismantling american democracy. And he won with a really small margin.<p>While I generally argue that the american institutions are dysfunctional, I really wouldn&#x27;t blame the current administration for not addressing the issue, not only do they not have the mandate, but their stated political ideology is &quot;liberalism&quot;, not social democracy, so why would they want to?')
