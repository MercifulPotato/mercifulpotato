When we did our first React applications without a JSX compile step, we even went further with the syntax with the power of functional programming. You could do stuff like:<p><pre><code>    div({className: &#x27;m-3&#x27;, onClick }, &#x27;the text&#x27;)\n</code></pre>\nOr go an abstraction step further create your own elements as a function, that take in custom parameters:<p><pre><code>    navBar([navItem(&#x27;Home&#x27;, &#x27;&#x2F;&#x27;), navItem(&#x27;About&#x27;, &#x27;&#x2F;about&#x27;)])\n</code></pre>\nI mean, isn&#x27;t that line actually quite expressive? It felt powerful to build the DOM exactly as you needed. You could generate anything without having to worry about JSX syntax, cause it&#x27;s all JS and you can abstract using all of your toolkit. And if something goes wrong, you never have to look at JSX documentation or the JSX compiler output.')
