What I do, is create a file, usually called something like &quot;DoNotCheckThisIntoSourceControl.swift&quot;, and then put that in a directory called &quot;DoNotCheckThisIntoSourceControl&quot;. I then add &quot;<i>DoNotCheckThisIntoSourceControl</i>&quot; to my .gitignore.<p>Clunky, but it works. I add things like server secrets and whatnot, there. I keep the file small, and usually add the contents to a secure note in 1Password, so there is version control, of a sort.')
