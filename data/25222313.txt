There&#x27;s plenty of low-rent clickbait out there but there&#x27;s also good material that is ultimately being created and paid for for marketing purposes. (And SEO isn&#x27;t all black hat. For example, if you&#x27;re writing about some hot topic, you probably want to mention it in the title and not take forever to get to it in the article.)')
