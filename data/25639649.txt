As in, there just has to be a deeper sense in CSS layout models, and if I fail to discover the reason why CSS properties and olde HTML presentation attributes are essentially representing the same thing with different syntax, it&#x27;s my fault for not recognizing the grand plan behind it. Thus, if I finally managed to see a dubious use case for it, I&#x27;ve advanced one step in the hierarchy of the CSS church. That&#x27;s how military hierarchies are build - by giving people ranks, thereby using their desire not to loose height energy aka sunk cost fallacy. Of course, unless you&#x27;re doing CSS&#x2F;web design all the time and nothing else, soon you&#x27;re leaving your trail of knowledge acquisition in the form of a CSS framework product or consulting, at which point you have a vested interest in CSS staying opaque.')
