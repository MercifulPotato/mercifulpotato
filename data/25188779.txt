Or int, either. Only a single type -- a 16 bit word then.<p>At the time, most computers used word addressing exclusively, so you couldn&#x27;t directly access bytes, only words.<p>This is also why some early computers could easily be e.g. 36 bit machines, like the PDP-10.<p>C was, thus, an extension of B(CPL) to allow both words and bytes, or &quot;char&quot;s, using the PDP-11&#x27;s brand new byte addressing. (among other additions like structs)')
