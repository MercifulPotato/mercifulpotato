CUPS might have been a lare improvement over the 2000s and the 90s, but it&#x27;s still not great. Especially now that much more end-users are active on linux that aren&#x27;t very knowledgable in computers, Linux and it&#x27;s tooling, including CUPS, needs to get comfortable with the idea that, for most users, it is better to have sane defaults and work out of the box with minimal interaction, such as being able to easily add printers from autodiscovery, failing that, allowing users to add printers from an easy to understand dialog option. There is no reason why I need to select what protocol my printer needs (JetDirect, ApplePrint, PCL6, etc.) if the easiest option is to try out which ones of them work and select the one that works the best. On Windows I don&#x27;t have to care how my printer talks to my computer, it autoselects from the various protocols, usually trying to identify the printer and letting the driver pick. On linux with CUPS I very much have to care and I don&#x27;t see why.')
