I read jalopnik regularly for brainless amusement and car news. You&#x27;re perceived slant against tesla is baseless. They regularly shit on H-D for their idiotic product decisions, chevy and BMW for their idiotic truck&#x2F;M car grilles, nikola for fraud lately, tons of other cars&#x2F;manufacturers, and yes, they shit on tesla for poor QA practices, dickish moves on resold cars, and being run by a petulant egomaniacal manchild.<p>What&#x27;s the deal with tesla fans? Sure, every brand has fanatics and haters, but tesla fans are special. They froth at the mouth like an attack dog. Any single miniscule criticism of tesla is treated like you&#x27;d pisssed on the dinner table. They&#x27;re like some hybrid of a 12-year old who thinks the supra has 1000 horsepower stock, and a basement dweller who thinks the Oculus is the pinnacle of technology.<p>Seriously, what&#x27;s in the kool-aid and why has no one called the FDA about it?')
