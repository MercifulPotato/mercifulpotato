It has detractors but lacks many supporters, and so it was easily swept aside.<p>Presently we are seeing significant alarm raised by media over the content, not bugs, within Cyberpunk 2077; accusations have been raised by major outlets that it includes bias in support of law enforcement, a transphobic setting, and bog standard sexism.<p>But despite its severe bugs and missing features, it&#x27;s enjoyed three solid weeks as a top seller on Steam and easily made back its expenses through PC pre-orders. For all the flak it gets, the game has an enormous and happy fanbase.<p>What I see happening is a bifurcation in game players: those who reject the gamer label and reject moral terpitudes, and those who embrace the gamer label and tolerate or enjoy moral terpitude.<p>I expect that in ten years we&#x27;ll see an industry with healthy diversity in players and content; divided into their separate groups and with stores that have adapted to cater to specific groups.<p>A hundred years ago there was the Bay and Sears, and now those have been superseded by a large variety of clothing vendors. I don&#x27;t expect to buy a cardigan and leather bdsm mask in the same store, right?')
