I have a friend who runs a cruise expedition company in New Zealand. They run trips in the south seas (Antarctica) as well as the North (Russia, Japan) but they have to reposition their ships between seasons. Those repositioning trips are 3-4 weeks at sea with little-to-no land in sight. So what they did to make money was to sell heavily discounted seats to bird watchers because there are some species of birds who are only at sea during this time and this is the only way to see them. Pretty fascinating way to make up some revenue during an otherwise dead period.')
