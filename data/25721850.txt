(unless you call getting bought and then shut down by Cisco a win)<p>But I 100% agree with you that this is a design problem to be solved first with better interfaces and workflows, not AI. Innovation is the sum of behavior change and AI is not going to be doing our knowledge work for us anytime soon. Given we&#x27;re doin the work, we deserve better tools to do it ourselves.<p>I&#x27;m currently building grain.co that layers a new kind of video conferencing on top of Zoom, focused on brokering the recorded information gathered during sync calls into the async tools where knowledge lives and actual work is done after the convo ends.<p>Our approach is to make it easy to annotate in real-time, clip out those parts you want to save&#x2F;share, and then push them into async tools where anyone can view them like it were text in a document or a message in Slack.')
