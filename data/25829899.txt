I think I&#x27;m allowed to say that because I&#x27;ve completed some long-ass hikes and other suffer-fests myself.<p>Suffering, in and of itself, isn&#x27;t a skill. You will endure iff you <i>want</i> to endure. That is, if the perceived benefits of enduring outweigh the pain.<p>I&#x27;ve suffered through multi-week hikes with blisters and a too-heavy pack because I loved the views, the remoteness, the self-reliance and asceticism. And also because there were no good alternatives, because bailing midway would have been a different kind of emotional and logistical pain.<p>I&#x27;ve also bailed on things. Not a ton of them but always with good reason. I quit a job I hated after trying to suck it up for too long. I quit my college sports team after barely getting played for two years. I left a long-term relationship when I realized my partner wasn&#x27;t treating me well.<p>I don&#x27;t think of those bails as failures. They just didn&#x27;t work out, and I&#x27;m happier without those things in my life. In fact I&#x27;m proud of myself for putting aside my pride and fear of being a &#x27;quitter&#x27; in order to pull the plug on them. The hikes I suffered through aren&#x27;t successes, either. With experience I&#x27;ve gotten better at preparing and packing, so even longer and more challenging hikes are easier for me now. Better views and more comfort is where it&#x27;s at. No need to suffer just for the sake of suffering.')
