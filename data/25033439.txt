Item(by='romanoderoma', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604919021, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25033047, text='&gt; Why isn&#x27;t this middle ground being discussed?<p>that&#x27;s what they <i>need</i> to do even today after they have found enough evidence that the court sent you what&#x27;s called &quot;notice of inquiry&quot; and preliminary investigations start (it doesn&#x27;t mean yo are guilty, it means there&#x27;s gonna be an official investigation on you and after the investigation has ended they&#x27;re gonna either drop the charges or go to trial).<p>but crime prevention usually works best when investigations are kept secret.<p>Imagine if in Italy we called every mob boss the police was investigating on to tell them they were tapping their phones or checking their bank accounts.<p>They knew it anyway, but that&#x27;s where the middle ground is.<p>Another possibility would be, as I&#x27;ve written somewhere else, that a pair of keys is always created and made available to the local authorities, but they have to be authorized from a judge to use them.<p>The encrypted data is instead kept on the provider side, so that even if someone steals the keys, they can&#x27;t access the data because it is in a separate facility, protected in the same way it is today, because it&#x27;s in the best interest of the provider, that is already collecting that data, to keep it safe.<p>And if someone steals the data, can&#x27;t decrypt it.<p>Metadata are also very important to investigators, I imagine that their need to decrypt the conversations comes from the fact that with the metadata they can narrow down the number of suspects to a few, but without the actual content they can&#x27;t tell exactly what&#x27;s going on.<p>&gt; if they read the messages and find you&#x27;ve done some crime, authorities will eventually track you down<p>that&#x27;s not so obvious.<p>I could show you a lot of cases when this has not happened, for various reasons, most of them formal (tapping lasted a few hours more than authorized, tapping was badly misreported in some other meaningless section of the conversation but it&#x27;s enough to nullify it in its entirety, tapping included someone else that was not under investigation that should have been removed from the records bu it&#x27;s still there, etc. etc.)')
