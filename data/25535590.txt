Item(by='CorrectHorseBat', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608891898, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25535273, text='True, but if they didn&#x27;t write their own TTS nothing of that matters.<p>Most TTS software out there will be better at English than any other language despite the more complex phonology. Then it&#x27;s solely about distinguishing language characteristics and I think the amount of syllables would have an effect in that. Japanese has a lower information density than English (at the same speed) so with the same amount of distortion Japanese should be more recognizable.')
