Item(by='maxk42', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607474272, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25349066, text='Same story here with UPS.  Ordered a computer recently.  Original delivery estimate was last Thursday.  Then they updated and said it&#x27;d arrive yesterday.  Why does a one-time delay incur four days of lateness?  In four days I could&#x27;ve driven to the origin and picked it up myself.  To make matters worse it didn&#x27;t even arrive yesterday.  Apparently it&#x27;s at a facility less than three miles away yet they couldn&#x27;t get it to me in the 13 hours it stayed on the truck before going back to the facility.  Finally arrived today - after four delivery delays and five days past the original maximum estimate.  The worst part is I paid the merchant to ship it expedited and received nothing like expedited service but since I&#x27;m not the one who made the contract with UPS I can&#x27;t get a refund.')
