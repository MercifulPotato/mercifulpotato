What I also find ironic about these &quot;1st world preppers&quot; hoarding these is that they&#x27;ll buy a glass jar of some sauce, salsa, cheese, or jam, but then throw that away. However they won&#x27;t bat an eyelash over buying like a 12 pack of 16oz mason jars for like $30.<p>Another thing I remember when I was a kid, my grandmother would reuse plastic cool whip bowls. She grew up late depression era and not that where we lived was destitute honestly, but it was just something most people would scoff at. She&#x27;d also save plastic bags.<p>As I&#x27;ve gotten older, I&#x27;ve found that this way of living is perfectly acceptable and honestly the way to go. It&#x27;s contrary to the status quo simply because it is a simple and effective means to save money. Just because the amazon industrial complex wants you to believe their products are so cheap you&#x27;d be stupid not to just buy a new one!')
