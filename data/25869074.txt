Kafka is far more fragile than it should be, partly because companies have always approached it as cluster-first and partly because it&#x27;s enterprise-first software where high setup costs just aren&#x27;t important. A lot of JVM software ends up like this - there&#x27;s a big chunk of fiddly O(1) work in getting it all going, just because no-one ever bothers to make it all easy to get started with.<p>I say this as a huge fan of Kafka, but things like MySQL have better defaults and are easier to get running out of the box, and there&#x27;s no reason Kafka&#x27;s starting experience couldn&#x27;t be the same if someone cared enough to put the time and effort in. And ultimately it&#x27;s a shame, because it leads people to ignore something that&#x27;s a much better model and platform in the long term.')
