For example suppose a driver falls asleep or gets a heart attack. The lane keep will beep a few times quietly and disable itself when the car reduces speed to under 40mph, causing the car to then go straight and crash, instead of aggressively lane keeping until the car comes to a complete stop while increasing the beep volume the whole way, and then putting on emergency flashers, which would be the safe thing to do.')
