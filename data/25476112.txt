Item(by='nvrspyx', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608367140, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25475956, text='I get constant audio issues where dialog from one NPC is either not coming through or sounds like it&#x27;s from 100ft away. I&#x27;ve also had problems getting the next part of a mission to trigger when you&#x27;re supposed to wait a day for the NPC to call you back (one particular one, I waited an in-game week with 2 game reboots to trigger it). I randomly get stuck in the zoomed view. When I&#x27;m being passed a shard by an NPC, it&#x27;s randomly replaced with a gun. Multiple areas at ground level throughout the map with gaps in collision resulting in you falling through the world. I&#x27;ve been stuck in rooms multiple times where the input prompt to open a door simply never triggers and I&#x27;m unable to open the door, requiring me to reload from checkpoint. Texts from NPCs come in the wrong order. Forced NPC calls in the middle of dialog during a separate mission. Sometimes unable to choose dialogue options when driving, requiring me to stop in the middle of the road to get out to give the response I want. Sometimes unable to do absolutely any blunt melee damage, which has resulted in a stuck loop requiring a reload (like the boxing robot near the beginning of the game)<p>The list goes on and on. With that said, I&#x27;m playing on PC with pretty decent performance all things considered, I&#x27;ve tolerated them because I&#x27;m still enjoying the game, and I wouldn&#x27;t classify any of the bugs as necessarily &quot;game breaking&quot;, but they&#x27;re significantly detracting from the enjoyable game and narrative underneath.<p>It&#x27;s almost as if not a single gameplay aspect has any sense of polish whatsoever and that sucks.')
