Although it looks like you came here to argue (which now explains the presumptuousness), I didn&#x27;t, and I&#x27;m not wasting any (more) of my time indulging you.<p>&gt; I get what you&#x27;re saying. People often do couch cynicism and trolling in pleasantries.<p>No, apparently you don&#x27;t, because that&#x27;s not at all what I said or what I&#x27;m trying to say.  Aside from failing at that, you almost succeeded at deflecting, but not quite.  The attempt to change the subject and avoid responding directly is yet more reason to stop this here.')
