Either they considered it and decided they would never encounter a system error like this and refused to implement an escalation route, or they never even considered it.<p>Or perhaps even worse than that, maybe they considered it, decided it was possible, but just don&#x27;t care because of their insane borderline monopoly.<p>I don&#x27;t understand how internet companies provide such consistently awful service.<p>Slightly off topic story, I&#x27;ve recently changed to another provider called Starry, and they force you to have a second router in front of your own router which they claim &quot;decodes&quot; their stream between the modem. I don&#x27;t know the real reason but I&#x27;m pretty sure that&#x27;s not it. If you plug their modem directly into a non-Starry router, the router just doesn&#x27;t detect a connection.<p>One day, I tried to torrent something, and my internet would immediately get throttled to 0mbps. After investigating I found out that their router had a custom OS which hid a firewall and various security settings. Amusingly you could still access those settings if you just manually entered the page names into the address bar. Now all their stupid settings are disabled and I just feel badly for all the folks who use their service and don&#x27;t have the savvy I do to actually get what they&#x27;re paying for.')
