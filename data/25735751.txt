Item(by='dragontamer', descendants=None, kids=[25750803], score=None, time=1610395825, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25735463, text='&gt; I don’t think I’ve ever met an engineer who’s a domain expert who talks like that. Unless you have actual specific information about future plans and reason to believe in them, expecting everyone to qualify their prognostication with “this generation but it might change in some hypothetical future” is just not useful. That’s generally true of all technical topics. What’s stated today can change in the future. These aren’t physical limits being discussed.<p>If I, 5-years or 10-years ago, claimed ARM sucks because its in-order, then I&#x27;d be making a similar mistake as Linus did. There&#x27;s nothing about the ARM-ISA that forced in-order execution, it was just the norm (because back then: it was considered more power-efficient to make in-order chips).<p>There&#x27;s nothing part of AVX512 that says &quot;You must use more power than other instructions&quot;. That was just how it was implemented in Skylake-X. And lo-and-behold, one microarchitecture later, the power-issue is solved and a non-issue.<p>Similarly, ARM chips over the past decade switched to out-of-order style for higher performance. Anyone who was claiming that ARM was innately in-order would have been proven wrong.<p>----------<p>Maybe it takes experience to see the ebbs and flows of the processor world. But... that&#x27;s what I&#x27;d expect an &quot;expert&quot; to be. Someone who can kind of look forward through that.<p>I mean, I&#x27;ve watched NVidia GPUs go superscalar (executing INT + FP simultaneously). I&#x27;ve watched ARM go from largely in-order microcontrollers into out-of-order laptop-class processors. I&#x27;ve watched instruction sets come and go with the winds.<p>------<p>If that&#x27;s not good enough for you, then remember that Centaur implemented AVX512 WITHOUT power-scaling issues back in 2019, still predating Linus&#x27;s rant by months. A chip did exist without AVX512 power throttling, and he still ranted in that manner.')
