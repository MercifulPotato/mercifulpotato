Read the outer story as a fast-forward (narrated by an unreliable antihero) for <i>The Theory and Practice</i> (Goldstein is far more realistic than Smith) and it gets much better. It might even become a story of what happens if one seriously attempts to implement Plato&#x27;s <i>Republic</i>.<p>Also compare to various essays of Orwell&#x27;s, especially <i>Such Such Were the Joys</i>, <i>The Atomic Bomb and You</i>, etc.')
