If you fall below a certain threshold (e.g. sub-20% downpayment) your lender may require you to carry private mortgage insurance (PMI). If your home&#x27;s value were to fall substantially, your equity-debt ratio could be pushed below the threshold -- e.g. if tax assessments were updated.<p>I&#x27;ve never heard of situations that have re-triggered PMI... but it doesn&#x27;t seem outside the realm of possibility.')
