MITRE (understandably) doesn&#x27;t have the resources to verify every CVE request it receives, which have resulted in bad CVE details being filed on multiple occasions.<p>I wonder if maybe, instead of trying to fix CVEs, we could try to think about creating alternatives? I know some companies already use their own identifiers (e.g. Samsung with SVE), so perhaps a big group of respected companies can come together to create a new unified identifier? Just an idea though.')
