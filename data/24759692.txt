Item(by='10000truths', descendants=None, kids=[24760334, 24762156, 24759949], score=None, time=1602538522, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24759273, text='&gt; I don&#x27;t understand this attitude. No, we will go back to normal. This cannot continue forever. We cannot live the rest of our lives in fear. This is not how we evolved and I&#x27;m honestly sick of it.<p>It&#x27;s not about living in fear, it&#x27;s about not catching the virus. The facts are that COVID-19 is still out there actively infecting people, deaths are still climbing at more or less a steady rate, and it doesn&#x27;t really care about how you or anyone else feels about it. Many a school has opened under the rationale of &quot;we can&#x27;t just hide from it forever&quot;, only to go into shutdown again because of the inevitable outbreak that occurs when a bunch of kids are packed like sardines into a hallway or classroom environment.<p>&gt; Mississippi, Florida and other states are starting to go back to normal without any increase in fatalities (and don&#x27;t go on about cases, because there is no distinction between people who test positive and people who test positive because they&#x27;ve actually been sick). Fatalities are going down across the board. Exponential growth does not go on forever. It ends.<p>Just because COVID-19 isn&#x27;t immediately fatal doesn&#x27;t make it harmless. What are the rates of reinfection, and how does that impact a patient? What are the chronic effects of being infected, if any? <i>You</i> may have a cavalier attitude about the virus&#x27;s effects, but plenty others (including the elderly, infants, the immunocompromised, etc.) do not, and the virus doesn&#x27;t discriminate between who cares about it and who doesn&#x27;t. It is far better to be overly cautious than not cautious enough in such a case, even if it comes at the expense of inconvenience.')
