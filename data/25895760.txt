RawPedia is chock full of information relevant to pre-production (calibration, etc.), photography and post-production techniques, along with advice on development tool usage. I’ve learned a lot from it, which will stay with me even if I move away from software itself. It’s one of those tools with educational documentation that doesn’t just explain what the tool does but actually teaches a lot about the problem domain (similar to docs for DCamProf, which has the same maintainer).<p>&gt; RawTherapee can edit jpegs and tiffs. Filmulator only edits raws.<p>Most software can consume DNG but almost nothing, except for camera firmware, can produce it. RT’s ability to edit 16-bit TIFFs output means it can participate in diverse workflows with other raw processors.<p>(For example, I use Siril to combine multiple exposures, and then can still apply a RawTherapee profile with all the numerous curves, Lab, film emulation, CIECAM and other power tools that get my pixel data into output-referred image state. Of course, some controls behave differently with a 16-bit TIFF than when a DNG image, but it’s not that difficult to adjust to that.)<p>Filmulator, on the other hand, can’t be used other than at the very beginning of the workflow, which takes away from its flexibility.<p>That said, RT sort of stands alone so far, and more open-source software that can compete with it can only be appreciated as far as I, a happy user, am concerned.')
