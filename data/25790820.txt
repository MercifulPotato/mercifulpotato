Seems nuts!</i><p>I believe what the law actually says is that Google should to pay news providers when it displays content from their websites in search listings - eg when you search for a topic in the news and Google highlights some articles in the &quot;Top Stories&quot; section at the top of the results. The contention is that those links provide very little value to the news site and a heap of value to Google. If that is really the case then there&#x27;s no reason why Google should get to access and display that data for free.<p>The point of search engines being able to index a site and display the link alongside adverts has always been that it&#x27;s a mutually beneficial relationship - the site gets traffic, and Google gets sites to show ads next to. If people are no longer using Google to go to websites then that value proposition changes, and having your website in Google&#x27;s index is no longer a benefit. If that&#x27;s true then it&#x27;s not unreasonable for site owners to suggest they should be paid for the &#x27;raw materials&#x27; that Google makes money from. There is an argument that news sites could put up a robots.txt site to block Google, but that&#x27;s a bit like saying burglary is OK if a house owner hasn&#x27;t locked their doors...')
