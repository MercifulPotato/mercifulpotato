Posit that over time people are becoming more protective of children, for whatever reason.  This (a) makes parenting substantially more work&#x2F;money (closer supervision, more childcare hours), leading to people having fewer kids on the margin, and (b) makes people supportive of legislation to protect children (car seat laws).  So while it looks that car seat laws are causing fewer children, they could actually both be caused by changing societal attitudes toward child protection.')
