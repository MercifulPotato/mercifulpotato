They immediately locked the account, asked for a copy of my ID, and then <i>permanently banned</i> that account <i>after I provided it</i>. I have no idea why, there&#x27;s no mechanism for appeal, and I can&#x27;t even submit a request to have the image of my ID removed because <i>that</i> form is gated behind the account.<p>Their &quot;KYC&quot; system has no problem with the 10-year-old alt that I created in college using a fake name which has never done anything but manage some ancient meme pages, though...')
