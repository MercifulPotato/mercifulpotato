A very, very common mistake among most &quot;mediterranean&quot; and &quot;romance languages&quot; (Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, French, Romanian) people when speaking English is to pronounce ps as in &quot;pissed&quot; without the &quot;i&quot;, instead of just the &quot;s&quot; (the &quot;p&quot; is silent), which is the correct way to pronounce it in English.<p>Another very common mistake in my language group is the &quot;gn&quot;, as in signal.<p>Correct English is sig-nal [0], while my group usually says it with a different &quot;gn&quot; sound [1].<p>Well, there&#x27;s much more, of course, but I wanted to share these two just because, anecdotally, I hear the mistake very often.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=whOXnmbOJvQ" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=whOXnmbOJvQ</a><p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forvo.com&#x2F;word&#x2F;segnale&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forvo.com&#x2F;word&#x2F;segnale&#x2F;</a>')
