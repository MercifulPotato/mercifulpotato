The State doesn&#x27;t have cameras. It will develop a automated warrant-generator to pull all cloud footage from cameras that were in a specific area at a specific time. They will have agreements with the major cloud camera vendors. All legal, above board, reasonable, protective of rights and process, and exactly identical to if the State had camera towers.<p>Same for biometric ID. Fine. You don&#x27;t want the State having in-house biometrics? Great. It can set up agreements with Facebook and Google: &quot;Identify this person&quot; - a few flatfeet go run down those leads.<p>Net effect is to have the same result, but now with less accountability (private firm), more expense (private contracts getting profit), and less safety (private firms with the data).<p>That&#x27;s why we need to <i>assume</i> the existence of these technologies and the followons, then design the world we want to see <i>given</i> the followons.')
