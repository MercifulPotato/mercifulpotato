Let me explain why.<p>&gt;Well, first of all, I demonstrated how this extreme case is impossible, but let&#x27;s address war.<p>Did you happen to be an engineer working on the design or marketing of the Titanic in a past life? You sure sound like it. You also sound like you have not once ever grown a plant.<p>You can go from perfectly green and healthy to dead in a week if you don&#x27;t pay attention. A seed can flourish just fine, only to eventually die as the energy burden required for it to thrive is no longer met. If this happens before you go to seed, congratulations, your population of plants just went extinct due to breaching the carrying capacity of their environment.<p>Try raising an orchid some time. I guarantee you&#x27;ll learn something. One of the Vanilla ones in particular is best.<p>Your arguments are naive and reek of &quot;not my problem&quot; type thinking. You may believe that carrying capacity is a a priori defined as &quot;I&#x27;m here, therefore not exceeded&quot; but it isn&#x27;t.<p>We&#x27;re all hot-house flowers who are facing the possibility of the gardener (humanity collectively) just saying &quot;screw it&quot; and destroying our chances at continued success.<p>And war... War&#x27;ll happen, and calling that a systemic self-correction is both callous and wretched beyond all reason. Nevermind that no one tends to factor in environmental damage that occurs as a result of warfare.')
