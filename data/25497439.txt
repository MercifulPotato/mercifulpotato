A majority of good astronomy papers are published in ApJ or in MNRAS. Big things go in Nature&#x2F;Science + then there are other smaller journals.<p>(At least this is what I tend to find. This may just reflect my biases - US based, in the cosmology field.)<p>But just because something gets published doesn&#x27;t mean it is right :) I think non-scientists don&#x27;t know what &quot;peer review&quot; actually entails! First, as this was a MOND paper, it could well have been reviewed by someone who favours MOND. Second, even if the reviewer doesn&#x27;t favour MOND, if the steps taken and the arguments given seem reasonable, I expect they would suggest it should be published.<p>I have no issue with the paper being published. It is important that theories have advocates who put forward the best argument for them. What I do take issue with is the skewed presentation in popular science. What sells is exciting and new, not slow and steady. And 99% of science is slow and steady.')
