Chickens just aren&#x27;t really built to lay that many eggs, and ultimately there doesn&#x27;t seem to be any way to optimize industry-level farming to care about animal health&#x2F;happiness. At best we get much more expensive products that appeal to a minority of the market. Especially when you realize that a nontrivial percentage of the eggs you eat are coming from restaurants and as ingredients in pre-made foods, where there&#x27;s basically no current market pressure to ethically source those materials.<p>In theory there could be a version of the egg industry that avoided most of these problems (yes, I know some vegans would view that as non-consensual exploitation anyway) but regardless, practice is still a long, long ways away from theory.<p>I know people like to believe that you can just get cruelty free eggs that solve all of these problems, and you can certainly do a lot <i>better</i> than just buying the cheapest brand -- and I&#x27;m not going to shame people, doing better is a good goal to have. A lot of food, even vegan food, has problematic elements that you can dig up, we&#x27;re all just trying to do a bit better than the default and to be <i>more</i> ethical than we otherwise would be.<p>But while it would be really convenient if the modern egg industry was ethical, it&#x27;s just very hard to argue that point.')
