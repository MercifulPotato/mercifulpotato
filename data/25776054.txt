So I just set up wireless links between routers, use OSPF to determine routes, set appropriate weights to prefer the 5ghz band (which periodically goes down because of DFS but otherwise gives higher throughput), and use VXLAN to create the logical network I want.  It has worked extremely well for several months now and my wife is happy to not have cables going all over our house.  There are probably &quot;better&quot; ways to do this but honestly, it works, it is flexible, and it is straightforward to extend to more routers if needed.')
