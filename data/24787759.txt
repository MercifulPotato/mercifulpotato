Item(by='tombh', descendants=None, kids=[24787873], score=None, time=1602764113, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24787528, text='&gt; So everyone in the West is guilty for everything anyone in the West has ever done<p>Of course that&#x27;s nonsensical and I agree with it. But I wonder what you think when it&#x27;s positively framed?<p>So everyone in the west can _benefit_ from everything anyone in the West has ever done?<p>That statement seems much closer to being universally accepted. Our rights to benefit from the fruits of Western &quot;progress&quot;; medicine, civil rights, social security, peace, etc. Yet these things are fundamentally dependent on the historical and contemporary colonial and neo-colonial &quot;heist&quot; upon the rest of the world. How can we simultaneously distance ourselves from the crimes of the West and benefit from it? Actions have consequences. Yes, neither I nor my immediate ancestors (and I&#x27;m as British as can be) took part in any colonial crimes, but I sure as hell take advantage of my Western privileges. If I don&#x27;t have any personal responsibility for my culture&#x27;s crimes then how do I justify personally benefiting from those crimes?')
