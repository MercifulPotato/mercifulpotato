There was a marked difference in customer uptake before and after the ads. We have also pretty regularly received feedback on our ads.<p>In fact, that is what we have observed over the years. Customers are conscious of what the ads say, where they get placed, and - usually - can crosscheck the quality of the ad with that of the product.<p>In my experience, it is rash to generalise and say that ads are not useful.')
