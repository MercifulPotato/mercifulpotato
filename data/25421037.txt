People choose obvious patterns for their passwords to get around it. Like `1q2w3e4r!Q@W#E$R`. Then they shift by one each time they have to update, by the time they get across the keyboard they can restart (or twice, in which case you swap the shift to the first half instead of second half). Or, this was fun, my first gov&#x27;t job the guy had stored passwords on a sticky underneath the keyboard (I changed them all). They also used a shared account for admin stuffs, even though we were all given an admin token (like the smart card or CAC for regular login, but with admin credentials and issued separately).<p>In theory, the DOD CAC system (they&#x27;ve gotten better over the years) eliminates the need for passwords entirely, but somehow most teams never tie their system to it properly.')
