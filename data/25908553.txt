I agree that we can&#x27;t crowdsource truth. But we can crowdsource information that can help reduce misinformation. When you have two sides disagreeing the first step is to build some common ground.<p>Twitter is trying to solve a tough problem. On one hand you&#x27;ve got people accusing Twitter of hosting and platforming hateful, harmful content. On the other hand you have people claiming that Twitter is calling the shots about what&#x27;s true and suppressing information it doesn&#x27;t like.<p>Maybe this is the first step towards something like a digital court. People on both sides present evidence, experts, witnesses. The two sides get a hand in picking the jury.<p>Or maybe the solvable problem is that information gets misconstrued and propagated. A video clip might get edited a certain way, for example. Solving this problem may not help us all agree on what happened in the video clip. However, we should at least be able to agree on what the two interpretations are. To make this happen, both sides would have to steel man the other side. Otherwise, the opposing side would claim they&#x27;re being misportrayed. Having things that opposing sides agree upon would greatly help reduce unnecessary conflict.')
