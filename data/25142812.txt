The iphone isn&#x27;t the problem. It&#x27;s the scapegoat. The real problem is what other people have said: too much time on school and she&#x27;s a teenager. How much time is she really getting to do things she WANTS to do. With my kids, they seem to turn to the phone when they are lonely, sad, anxious or angry. It&#x27;s a painkiller, not the pain.')
