Item(by='rualca', descendants=None, kids=[25235398], score=None, time=1606534351, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25231313, text='&gt; Perhaps I&#x27;m too cynical now, but to me this post reads as a troll trying to get a rise out of people.<p>Might be. I don&#x27;t know.<p>What I do know is that once I had a job where my supervisor was highly abusive to the point she criticized me for having left the office during an afternoon due to a close relative dying. This was a research job, where the closest milestone was scheduled to be in 3 months.<p>In that job I had a fixed-term employment contract structured in a way which it was automatically extended for 6 months when it expired. Thus I waited out my contract, looked for another job and presented my resignation. Well, that didn&#x27;t sat well with my supervisor. She started complaining that we had work to do and I couldn&#x27;t just leave because I owed her at least six to eight months work. Even though she was aware I was no longer an employee, mind you. She demanded I continued working for her in spite of the resignation while a) not being paid, and b) while working another full-time job. She even demanded (not asked, demanded) that I should ask my new employer for a 1 year delay so that I could continue doing her work.<p>Well, I left anyway and still she continued trying to contact me periodically about stuff at the job up to a year or two after I left. I&#x27;m talking about stuff from high level technical issues to passwords to an old windows 7 desktop that was sitting around.<p>So, I personally don&#x27;t see Gust&#x27;s story as outlandish.')
