By the looks of your demo page, you&#x27;re not using the &#x27;for&#x27; attribute to associate form labels to their fields. This makes the forms very difficult to use for users of assistive tech, including screen readers. Screen readers read out the appropriate label when an input gets focus, but without the &#x27;for&#x27; attribute it has no way of knowing which label is intended for which input.')
