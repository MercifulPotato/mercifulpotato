Investigators often aren&#x27;t aware of what data these companies store and if it&#x27;s not specifically requested then it&#x27;s not provided.  Lawyers basically copy and paste their last successful warrant&#x2F;wiretap&#x2F;whatever and send it to the judge because that&#x27;s how the legal system works.')
