I don’t really care about data redundancy.<p>The cheapest way I’ve been able to figure out to do this is just buy a case with 15 HDD bays, eg the Anidees AI crystal case, and just get a ridiculously beefy processor + 256gb RAM and do all the computation on a single box.<p>Does this sound right? All of the purchasable NAS cases all seem more expensive, but I’m out of my element.<p>I expect I’m going to want to figure out ZFS to make a single logical drive.<p>Does this seem right? Building eg a backblaze pod is outside of my budget, and my eyes glaze over whenever I try to read about NAS controllers.')
