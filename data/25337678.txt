Item(by='axegon_', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607375888, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25332421, text='Go unfortunately suffers from something similar: packaging. Even if you don&#x27;t know the history of go, you have to look at it only once to figure out that this part is a hacky afterthought. Like everything in js. Also comparison of scripting languages is the stupidest thing one can do and I&#x27;d have expected better from debian but oh well...<p>My point remains: javascript is the stupidest language ever made(including the esoteric languages) and it should have been scrapped a long time ago. I have 1000+ books on my shelves next to me and if I start describing the utter crap found in javascript, I&#x27;d have to write 10 times as much. Stupid type system, idiotic paradigms, no clear structure, shit standard library, inconsistent naming conventions even in the standard library alone, it&#x27;s as compatible with lower level languages as olive oil and alcohol(ffi is absolute shit with outrageous overhead), slow, unpredictable, does not have a clear way to do basic stuff like deep cloning.<p>But you are right, it&#x27;s cheaper to write an interface using javascript. But if cost saving is our top priority, there&#x27;s yet another argument for scrapping it altogether: ncurses. 10 times faster to write, 10000 times better performance, runs on anything with a screen. I&#x27;d totally vote for dropping the current web in favor of console-based web.')
