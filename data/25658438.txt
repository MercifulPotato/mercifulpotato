I&#x27;m more interested in the opportunity cost for the individual, however, irrespective of what others think. I&#x27;ve posted here with my own experiences, but they are not necessarily applicable to everyone. I&#x27;m certain that many people have a perfectly healthy relationship with computers but given the context of the thread I was writing for those who didn&#x27;t, that is to say those who sought refuge in them in the face of an unsatisfying reality.<p>In my case, I&#x27;m trying to reverse the flow and build the life I was always afraid of. I&#x27;ve caught glimpse of it here and there so I know it&#x27;s not just a figment of my escapist imagination but a genuine interest. I know that many activities leave me more fulfilled than using a computer, but organizing my life so that I can engage in those regularly is the same difficult challenge that nudged me to get addicted to computers in the first place.<p>By all means, if you&#x27;ve found a life that&#x27;s inherently satisfying, don&#x27;t let yourself deviate from it!')
