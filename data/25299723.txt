Expect the same mindset to apply to mentoring, promotion and getting any big thing done.\nAt the opposite side of the spectrum: if you’re hired no question asked with a 3to5 letter language in your CV and blabbing about having done some HTML at some point, expect some very fuzzy internal politics and decision making flow...<p>Here is the thing though: in most countries I recruit in, tech people are in demand.<p>Pick the process that reflect the type of company you want to work in.<p>Maybe there’s a tech job crisis I don’t know about, but we, as recruiters and recruitee, dont have to accept this state of affairs.\nIf people stop applying to some type of interview, or gently refuse to participate in the p*ssing-contest part of the flow (pun intended), company will adapt ...or die.\nTell them, no sorry, you won’t be doing whiteboard-coding with comma validation.<p>And if mediocre candidate learn rote leet-answers and spit them out to go and crash down BigCompanyX every 2-weeks, I can assure you the the company will soon learn and change (Google did, I believe MS did too). Or go bankrupt. Or outsource to a more sound-minded company.<p>Build the world you want to live in!')
