I&#x27;m a solo actor at work with a lot of agency to decide my workflows.<p>I see myself building small to medium size data collections over the next year or two at my job.<p>Can someone point me to some learning?<p>I have a CS degree etc. and my title in software engineer etc. etc.<p>End users of my data <i>usually</i> like their data as a CSV that is then read using R or Python. However there is also a use case where I will build an app to view my data in a simple way.<p>All of this is completely doable with my current knowledge&#x2F;workflow but I can&#x27;t help feel like I do a data engineering job with very different tools than i see &quot;data engineers&quot; speaking about online.')
