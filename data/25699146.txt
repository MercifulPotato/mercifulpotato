I&#x27;m not a huge nature fan, but does NL even has any sort of country-side housing? Another question is how they deal with bureaucracy and how much of common sense does average citizen or governor has? I thought I was hacky and handy until I moved to NZ to learn so much about farming while still living minutes away from metropolis.')
