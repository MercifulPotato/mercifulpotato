The point was to have a respectful, intellectual discourse in public. Pick your favorite public policy topic. My point stands, even if we&#x27;re discussing soy bean pricing laws. Discussing the details of immigration is a massive topic for another day.<p>To really drive this home:<p>1) Don&#x27;t spread hate - there are obvious limits to this. Calling for assassination of public officials counts as hate speech. Saying something offensive is fine as far as it doesn&#x27;t incite violence.<p>2) Have an intelligent, evidence based discussion, be respectful and we&#x27;re trying to move the country forward. Not divide and turn to our own echo chambers. Come to a resolution through debate and concession.')
