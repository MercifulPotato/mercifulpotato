He’s addicted to fame and power...</i><p>Whoa. You have strong feelings.<p>One of my Life Rules that has served me enduringly well is to avoid believing that I can confidently have real insight into what motives drive someone. That rule is not for their benefit, but for my own: to putatively &quot;know&quot; something is to invite an incorrect model of reality and thereby incorrect action. It doesn&#x27;t actually matter what drives Musk or anyone else: ego, pure business interests, a desire to take humanity to the stars, boredom, pathology, space ghosts, whatever. What matters is behavior and its effects.<p>If you criticize Musk&#x27;s ego, ambition, pride, there&#x27;s nothing actionable for anyone, neither Musk himself nor Tesla&#x27;s potential customers. If you criticize the Tesla FSD rollout, now there&#x27;s something people can do.')
