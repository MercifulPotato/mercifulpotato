If you are born and live in America, you are <i>not</i> a migrant by definition. So I am not sure where you are getting your 98.4% number.<p>While immigration policies can always be improved, your initial statement was that America is &quot;anti-immigrant.&quot; This is hard to reconcile with the actual immigration numbers.<p>From the UN [2]: &quot;The United States of America has been the main country of destination for international migrants since\n1970.15 Since then, the number of foreign-born people residing in the country has more than quadrupled â€“\nfrom less than 12 million in 1970, to close to 51 million in 2019.&quot;<p>We can debate whether the number should be increased or decreased. But it is unfair to classify a country as &quot;anti-immigrant&quot; when it is leading the world in immigration. Even on a per-capita basis, America is way up there (look at the map on page 23 [2])<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.un.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;sections&#x2F;issues-depth&#x2F;migration&#x2F;index.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.un.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;sections&#x2F;issues-depth&#x2F;migration&#x2F;index....</a>\n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.un.org&#x2F;sites&#x2F;un2.un.org&#x2F;files&#x2F;wmr_2020.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.un.org&#x2F;sites&#x2F;un2.un.org&#x2F;files&#x2F;wmr_2020.pdf</a>')
