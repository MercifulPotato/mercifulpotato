Over time it has dwindled and been withered away by downvotes. Nearly every post I make these days seems to get downvotes now, even for fairly innocuous posts. I don’t get it. I am almost certain that I have now been targeted by some downvotes cabal, and perhaps the same individuals continue to downvotes my posts and then dig into my post history to find even more posts to downvote.<p>In my opinion, downvotes should <i>not</i> be anonymous. If someone disagrees with you then you should know their name. Instead, we have these forums where people hide like  cowards while inflicting harm.')
