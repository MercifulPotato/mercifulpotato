In his blog post as well as in the comments here.<p>He has a point. In big cities the carsharing model is very meaningful. Or the park-instead-of-backyard. It is insane to try to own all this in a big city. It&#x27;s never gonna work for _everybody_. At the same time the argument only stretches this long. You own a stove? A musical instrument? A toothbrush? Insane! You use them less than 5% of the time!!<p>For his blog post that&#x27;s totally fine, he is trying to make a reasonable point and naturally pushes its boundaries. And look at his profile, that&#x27;s basically his job. But in the comments here which just go 180 degrees against, it&#x27;s less forgivable. Of course there are examples where this does not work, like those that I mention above. But they are ridiculous. His point is valid nevertheless. He makes you think, that&#x27;s great. But many comments here don&#x27;t do that. They just want to ramble.<p>And that&#x27;s sad.')
