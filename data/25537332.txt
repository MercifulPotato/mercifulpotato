I would never worry about keeping state or company secrets because they would never keep mine. It&#x27;s a one-sided exercise in self-flagellation. The more we learn about our government the more we learn about it&#x27;s inhumanity. Giving your life to it is akin to throwing it away. Perhaps worse than that because of the damage one can cause.')
