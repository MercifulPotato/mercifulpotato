I often get issues where I try to solve the user&#x27;s problem and think I have answered the question or provided a solution, but don&#x27;t get any reply from the reporter when asking if it is solved, sometimes for years. I configured Stale Bot with a IMO generous delay so the user has enough time to at least give a short reply if the issue persists. If it does, I&#x27;ll gladly add a &#x27;pinned&#x27; tag to keep Stale Bot away from it. But in the end the bot just does what I&#x27;d do by hand anyway.<p>If it&#x27;s configured with a short timeout and with preventing further comments, I totally agree. That&#x27;s rally annoying. But maybe there are circumstances where it&#x27;s actually useful.')
