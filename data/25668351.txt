Insurrection means violent uprising against the government. Attacks on public servants and public buildings for the purpose of overthrowing the government are insurrection.<p>The Portland courthouse siege- OP&#x27;s chosen example- was led by violent white anarchists. Their motive was to topple the government. Portland&#x27;s Black Lives Matter activists complained many times that their cause and movement had been hijacked [0][1][2].<p>The people who invaded the capitol today, at least some, probably thought they were protecting democracy. They may have thought they were defending election integrity. They were wrong. That doesn&#x27;t mean they are evil or amoral. It means they are misinformed and misled. Using them as a foil to downplay other, much more violent unrest is neither helpful nor informative.<p>I haven&#x27;t seen photos of armed rioters in the capitol. If you have some, please link them.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kgw.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;news&#x2F;local&#x2F;professor-focus-of-portland-protests-increasingly-frustrating-black-community&#x2F;283-d15904c0-6e4b-4791-a831-cbb71da9410e" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kgw.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;news&#x2F;local&#x2F;professor-focus-of-po...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;komonews.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;local&#x2F;black-people-in-portland-struggle-to-be-heard-amid-protests" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;komonews.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;local&#x2F;black-people-in-portland-str...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.latimes.com&#x2F;opinion&#x2F;story&#x2F;2020-09-04&#x2F;black-lives-matter-white-people-portland-protests-nfl" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.latimes.com&#x2F;opinion&#x2F;story&#x2F;2020-09-04&#x2F;black-lives...</a>')
