Yocto goes to a large amount of effort to make for repeatable builds, something which docker is actually quite bad at for all that it is touted as a solution for not being able to replicate someone else&#x27;s setup.<p>I think nix actually represents the next useful stop here: it avoids just piling another layer of abstraction&#x2F;virtualisation on the pile and actually reinvents the package manager in a way which actually solves the problems docker exists to solve but in a more complete manner. Bitbake I think actually represents a much messier implementation of the same ideas: just like nix uses a functional language to express package configuration, so too have bitbake files grown the same kind of functionality. The main things which bring bitbake down are the language is ridiculously quirky, hard to debug, poorly documented, and has any number of soundness holes (as well as a good amount of action-at-a-distance akin to INTERCAL&#x27;s COMEFROM statement which is simultaneously really useful and really frustrating)')
