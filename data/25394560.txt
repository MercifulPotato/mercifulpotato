Also more surprising was the courses my friend is running are not your hack a nodejs app together in 24hours but some advanced Scala and functional programming courses.<p>I donâ€™t know much about Africa but if they are training up highly skilled devs and not just people writing small Python&#x2F;Nodejs scripts us western countries are then all the better for them.')
