On the mac, I have recently started using agenda (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.agenda.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.agenda.com&#x2F;</a>) and am really liking it. You can easily link notes to dates, events, and other notes. You can export notes and sync through iCloud or Dropbox.<p>The free version already gives a lot of useful functionality and they have an interesting payment model in which you unlock all current features (and updates over the next year) with a single payment. Hence you could use it as a subscription or simply pay once if the new features are not yet worth it to you.')
