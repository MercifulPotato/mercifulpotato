But I wonder the same about H1B&#x27;s: I don&#x27;t understand the allure of the United States (besides the money?). Our industry is horrible to its H1B&#x27;s, H1B exploitation is rampant and disgusting. FAANG hires them so that they can exploit them as cheap labor that can&#x27;t risk leaving.<p>Why not move somewhere else if you want to work abroad? I can think of so many better options.')
