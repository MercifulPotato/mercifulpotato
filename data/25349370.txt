It&#x27;s about that they have that power in their form of government where they make all the calls, not them actually achiving it.<p>On the other hand, many of Xi&#x27;s predecessors are well-alive, well, two of them, if they are&#x2F;were dicators, what is Xi? There are three dictators at different times in China, with one in the office and the other two well and alive? I doubt dictatorship would be an accurate account for what&#x27;s really going on.')
