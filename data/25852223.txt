I like the phrase but I disagree with the premise you apply to it. If I were defining a few things about myself I would say &quot;I like Anime&quot; and &quot;I hate EDM&quot;. I keep ratings for every anime I&#x27;ve ever watched, the average score is about 7.48&#x2F;10. Objectively, a lot of it was crap that I would never recommend to anyone, but it&#x27;s crap I enjoy. On the other hand, there are EDM songs I like that are on my playlist on Spotify. Even though I&#x27;ll happily listen to them, they don&#x27;t make me think &quot;Wow, I really need to test my view that I don&#x27;t like EDM&quot;. I already know I don&#x27;t like it. The fact there are exceptions doesn&#x27;t make it not a useful rule for me to follow when choosing music.<p>IMO the healthier attitude, rather than seeking out things you don&#x27;t like, is to leave yourself open to things you don&#x27;t like, particularly in a group setting. It&#x27;s very annoying lately, my group of friends wants to play video games after work, but everybody has some kind of game type they don&#x27;t like that makes it hard to reach consensus. Rather than being in constant pursuit of optimized personal pleasure, it&#x27;s important that I sometimes just play the games I don&#x27;t like so in the future they&#x27;ll play the games they don&#x27;t like with me. And then maybe by chance one of us actually will end up liking it despite ourselves.<p>There&#x27;s another layer here as well as to the scale of things. &quot;I don&#x27;t like EDM&quot; is a very differently scaled statement than &quot;I don&#x27;t like Music&quot;. When confronting your own preferences, I think it&#x27;s important to compartmentalize them appropriately. I identify myself as someone that likes anime, but I will never watch another shonen sports anime again willingly.')
