In general, there is no explicit right to copy that book, though an archival copy would certainly fall under fair use. But it would not be fair use if you buy a book, copy it, and then sell the original book while retaining the copy (obviously, the chance of being prosecuted for something like this are essentially 0, but it is certainly copyright infringement if someone were to actually care - e.g. if you were to setup a site for wide distribution in this manner, where members would pass around and &quot;copy for personal use&quot; a book that was only purchased once).')
