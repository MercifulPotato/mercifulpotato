Item(by='AnthonyMouse', descendants=None, kids=[24788824], score=None, time=1602770062, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24788556, text='&gt; That&#x27;s not a thing I said.<p>Then it&#x27;s not obvious what you meant to imply by bringing up the voter turnout rate.<p>&gt; I also don&#x27;t assume that everyone who did show up to vote is associated with a tribe. A lot of people just plug their noses while filling out the ballots for the lesser evil.<p>But none of this is really addressing the original point, which is that the red tribe and the blue tribe are of approximately equal size, and their members are not at all in agreement as to who the liars are.')
