So effectively you only have to enter one password, rather than 2 or 3. Even if the laptop is stolen, TPM included, you still have to guess the login password. This is how Bitlocker et all operate and to be honest makes a lot of sense for a regular user (and practically everyone unless your enemy is a government-like entity than can decap&#x2F;sniff TPM chips...).<p>Secure Boot actually does not help much here... since the idea is that thief wouldn&#x27;t be able to change the disk contents.')
