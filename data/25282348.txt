At best, the problems would have been so general like &quot;I am uneducated about the world&quot; or &quot;it takes a long time to travel between places&quot; that they are effectively immaterial when it comes to the process that led to these innovations.<p>For example, if someone told you today &quot;I don&#x27;t like that I am going to die one day&quot;, would you be able to iterate your way via customer development to stop death? Would the fact that people don&#x27;t want to die be incorporated in the understanding of the process that led to any solution that gets created? No. Some problems are either so obvious or so non-obvious that the spark of insight that leads to solutions is barely influenced by the articulation of the problem or lack thereof by those who are suffering under it, often completely oblivious of it.')
