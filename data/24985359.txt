Can you elaborate on what&#x27;s lacking and what Vue provides that&#x27;s better?<p>I come from a Rails background, so I don&#x27;t tend to find anything &quot;magical&quot;. I guess to me, it&#x27;s all pretty simple so long as you take the time to read how it all works. (I understand not everyone has time to do that).<p>I&#x27;m not sure about the incremental stuff- it may be that I&#x27;m used to it going fast. You should also checkout the latest Svelte (not public yet) from Rich, it&#x27;s able to automatically show updates after every save, with state being kept within the refresh.')
