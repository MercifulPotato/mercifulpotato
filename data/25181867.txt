I just felt it would have been even better if it were simply a conversation, without jumping back and forth in time, inserting explanations (although they were helpful), etc.<p>As you said in the podcast - &quot;start at the beginning&quot;. If it had then proceeded from the beginning to the middle and from there to the end, I would have found it more relaxing to listen to.<p>On the other hand, there are some of these heavily edited, radio-style podcasts that lots of people think are amazing but leave me confused and annoyed. So maybe you shouldn&#x27;t listen to me. :)')
