They used to produce their own optimized distribution, which had better Cocoa widgets among other things. It was part of the original big push to get decs on OSX, it’s mentioned in Jobs’s keynotes etc. They later deprecated it once they reached critical mass, and discontinued it; if i remember correctly, the last jdk they shipped was a v6.')
