In my opinion the Bay Area has nearly nothing going for it except the abundance of high paying jobs and all the effects of that line networking, visibility to early stage investors, etc. The weather is nice. Which is a lot. A whole lot. But if it becomes apparent you don’t need to be there to start a technology company (or rather there aren’t as many advantages) or to reliably find the best jobs due to the open location policy companies could move to, it begins to lose that.<p>NYC is still NYC for example. It will suffer for awhile but people will continue to want to be there because being there is different than anywhere else. It doesn’t rely on an industry or on locality of an industry. It will rise as it has many times before as a capital city of the world. The surrounding suburbs in NJ and CN are well served by trains which the Bay Area can’t really say.<p>The Bay Area is just another sprawl of highways, strip malls, and parking lots. You could be anywhere if it did t happen to be there.<p>I think there will remain a certain prestige in the Bay Area though. But maybe not a monopoly like today. Sort of like how Wall St. is more a legacy than an actual locality that matters in the finance world.')
