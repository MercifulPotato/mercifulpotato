While I do think there&#x27;s probably a middle ground here, people do have the option to say &quot;no&quot; - they just don&#x27;t buy it. I think the motivation behind that is both a financial one (Apple makes money on the bricks) but also a psychological one (people won&#x27;t pay money for something they don&#x27;t actually need, thereby reducing e-waste).')
