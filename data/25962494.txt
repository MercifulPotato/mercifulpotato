Aspiring to and eventually developing that level of language mastery is, IMO, one of the core signs of maturity for a Software Engineer.<p>However, that would be wildly impractical in our day to day work, which is more about connecting pieces together in the right way, and hence is a lot about reading the manual for those pieces, understanding what it is they do and how they should be assembled together, and then actually assembling them together and testing that it all worked as expected. &quot;Googling things&quot; is an essential step in that process, but you could substitute Google for &quot;read the manual&quot; in an earlier era and it would be the same thing.<p>Perhaps what is sad is how many things these days ship without good manuals, because Google makes it easy enough for people to stitch together scanty release notes, comments in the source code, blog posts, Stack Overflow questions, etc. that you can actually get away with not having a manual.')
