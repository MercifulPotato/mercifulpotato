I think people are missing the point that people actual like living in these places too and are willing to pay a premium it.<p>I live in New York and like living here. I understand the cost of living here is high, but I also know that there are few places that can offer the lifestyle New York can. Given the option to keep most of my salary and relocate to a lower cost of living city, I think Iâ€™d stay in New York.')
