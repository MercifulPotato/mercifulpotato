(Plus, “its worth thinking about how much work your code is going to take to do what it needs to do”, as it was also my first introduction to algorithmic complexity.)<p>I&#x27;m trying to grasp the pedagogical failure that would result in people taking the lesson “implementing bubble sort is a reasonable thing to ever do for non-toy problems”.')
