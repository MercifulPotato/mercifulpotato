I said they shouldn&#x27;t be <i>mixing</i> their own music.<p>Until a decade or two ago, almost no musician ever mixed their own music, they relied on audio engineers to do that. The proliferation of DAWs and cheap powerful computers has changed that so that now many musicians believe they can&#x2F;should do this work themselves. They&#x27;re not necessarily wrong, but a little humility is required I think, mostly by remembering that good audio engineering is a distinct skill set, quite different from being a good musician.<p>Although there are few exceptions, I&#x27;d wager that almost no example of whatever you (or anyone else) considers &quot;great music&quot; was mixed by the musicians who made it.')
