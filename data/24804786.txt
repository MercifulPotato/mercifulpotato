The closest to success were San Fransico and Palo Alto which effectively just sprawled the area that is effectively Silicon Valley outside the prior bounds. The attempts to go far afield failed and the physical manufacturing wasn&#x27;t where the money was located resulting in a minor shake up.<p>There is a historical resemblance superficially in the first point but the second two are outright foils as every little highly publicized kerfluffle for what is effectively a relatively fringe cause like say not taking DoD contracts is nothing compared to a work stop or a gain of union claim to control.<p>Come to think of it the employee stock share benefits are a sort of weird foil to a union - not even trying for control or working conditions but giving some token stake to sufficiently valued workers. Not a replacement by any means but it is an ironic undermining of a company vs worker mentality.')
