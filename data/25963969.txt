Before that, I was about 75% remote for 5 years or so.<p>I live in semi-rural Scotland, so about as far away from a tech centre as it gets :)<p>My experience has been entirely positive, but I should add that I&#x27;m an introvert.<p>No commuting has obvious benefits - more sleep and&#x2F;or family time, and cost savings from transport. For some, those cost savings can be pretty substantial.<p>Being able to have breakfast and lunch with the family (I have 2 young kids) is also great. It also means I can help out here and there, such as watching the kids for a short period while my other half gets stuff done.<p>I&#x27;m the kind of person that prefers a quiet space to work in - and in an open office (which is invariably the norm) there is always at least one really loud person who paces back and forth while speaking loudly in conf calls! I have a home office that&#x27;s just perfect, with a door and everything! If you&#x27;re going to work from home, I think a dedicated workspace should be a priority, as long as you have physical space of course.<p>I don&#x27;t have any regrets, and doubt I&#x27;d ever return to an office environment, unless it was 1 day in 10 or something like that.')
