Its population might be 705k, but the average number of people in the city on a given day is much higher. Tons of people who work in D.C. live in Virginia and Maryland and commute. I don&#x27;t think I need to really get into why its kind of a major tourist destination. It does not surprise me they have a much higher people per officer than the average town.')
