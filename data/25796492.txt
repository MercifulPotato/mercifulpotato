My prior is strongly pro union, so for a long time I disbelieved them.  But I hear them so often from so many sources...<p>We had problems back in the day here (Aotearoa) as the union movement became the battle ground for the larger social class conflicts, that whilst meat hook reality overseas, made less sense here (here it was racial conflict and colonisation that mattered, another story, another day).<p>The union movement was smashed in the conflict.  Too corrupt and ossified to fight back against a revitalised state in the 1980s and 90s.  But the public sector unions survived, and were are  strong now.  The teachers union here is mighty.<p>But we see none of the problems (bad teachers defended, stupid rules enforced arbitrarily - well some, there is still bureaucracy).  The unions campaign very effectively for their members, some political agents try to stir up concern (American issues leak through here) but mostly no body really cares.  When my children were at school I never gave it a thought.<p>Good luck to the Amazon workers, I hope it goes well.')
