While doing this, part of my mind was saying the slapstick was so obvious, overdone and predictable, why am I laughing at it?<p>Perhaps it&#x27;s like watching a Laurel and Hardy movie. Fans know that if there&#x27;s a puddle in the street, Ollie will step into it and will sink in up to his neck. I know it&#x27;s coming, everyone knows its coming, and it still makes me laugh. Maybe it&#x27;s so funny because Hardy will look directly at the camera with a long-suffering &quot;look what they made me do again&quot; expression.')
