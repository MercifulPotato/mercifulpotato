Item(by='munk-a', descendants=None, kids=[25864566, 25863917, 25866455], score=None, time=1611261310, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25863092, text='I disagree - non-software companies feel entitled to price employees based in relation to their peers rather than in relation to the value they add to the business (and possibly misuse their tech labour because they never hired an architect that could actually steer it to be as valuable as it could be) but Jack the EE might be a perfectly servicable developer.  There&#x27;s a lot of theory we learn in school that Jack would need to pick up himself but don&#x27;t assume you&#x27;re imbued with a special skill that sets you apart from the rest of the employees.<p>The company should definitely be paying more out of their pocket to employ good tech talent, but I&#x27;m not so certain whether it&#x27;s good for society for all that created value to be given to the developer who happened to create it.  I think there is a big value gap in how much developers can produce with relatively little labour compared to, say, a car mechanic - but I think that it might be best for everyone if a really big proportion of that value gap was sliced up and distributed more evenly across society in the form of social programs to benefit us all.')
