You&#x27;re right of course that we tend to assume somewhat similar properties to ourselves, because that&#x27;s what we know, and we tend to assume that we&#x27;re at least in some ways &quot;normal&quot; - or at least not unique.<p><i>&gt; with no physical artifacts of &quot;civilisation&quot;</i><p>I would not be surprised if there are quite a few intelligent organisms out there that are not tool users. Earth itself has a few, as well. These would potentially make great candidates for a visit, if we could detect their biome from afar.<p><i>&gt; just not at the pace and scale we are accustomed to</i><p>I don&#x27;t disagree that these are probably out there. But that&#x27;s not the same as asserting that every single culture besides our own is on a completely different and imperceptible scale than us. We&#x27;d expect at least <i>some</i> organisms to build tools that we can detect, that is unless we&#x27;re one of the first civilizations in the universe. Another solution would be that FTL travel is possible and&#x2F;or thermodynamics can be at least partially circumvented, but even if such techology existed, it would have to be <i>ubiquitous</i> in order to explain why we don&#x27;t see anyone.')
