Eventually one figures it out.<p>I love the Hemnes line for example: the design suits my tastes and it&#x27;s all 100% wood â€“ from the smell of it I guess pine.<p>Regarding the paint job, that can be the case, though I wouldn&#x27;t know as I normally get them in raw wood. Sometimes I overpaint them myself with a different color.')
