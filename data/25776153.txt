I can do the same - plenty BLM protests included rioters and looters, so anyone supporting the protests supports looting, associates with rioters, courts their votes etc.<p>Trump didn&#x27;t say the Fascists at Charlottesville where &quot;very fine people&quot;, he said &quot;you also had people that were very fine people, on both sides&quot;, making a point not applicable to the whole group, in general, and in fact that applies as much to antifa&#x2F;the opposition.<p>Instead this nuance (and the context that he was talking in the context of both sides) is dropped in paraphrases such as yours. I can&#x27;t say what Trump <i>really</i> feels, or if a broader context suggest he&#x27;s just playing dangerous politics anyway - but you are twisting his word, or at least his meaning via selective quoting, in a pretty obvious manner.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.politifact.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;2019&#x2F;apr&#x2F;26&#x2F;context-trumps-very-fine-people-both-sides-remarks&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.politifact.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;2019&#x2F;apr&#x2F;26&#x2F;context-trump...</a>')
