Because the money is only going out of the nation&#x27;s borders and isn&#x27;t used to grow its own economy, the currency of the nation is devalued and international exchange rates fall, leading to a catastrophic amount of inflation.<p>One thing I heard Stephanie Kelton and other MMTers has always emphasized about MMT is that the main question of the theory isn&#x27;t &quot;Should we print the money?&quot;, but &quot;HOW should we use the printed money?&quot; The money-printing is already conceptually independent from yearly budgets; the big question is how we&#x27;re going to use that money so that uncontrollable inflation does not occur (which the Keynesians failed to answer with stagflation). If the newly printed money improves the strength of the &quot;actually existing&quot; national economy, then its currency will become competitive with others and a hyperinflation moment like Weimar would probably not happen.')
