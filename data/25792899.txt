I said that most people who are killed for their actions are indeed killed in genocide or war. I know that you want to have an attitude where you are indignant that I am minimizing genocide and war, but no, I agree with you that it has been the main killer of people.<p>Pragmatism cannot be escaped simply by complaining that I am pedantic. Saying something is an action. Practicing a ritual is an action. Dressing a certain way is an action. Eating certain foods is an action.<p>Recall that your original post insinuated that most people are too selfish to choose to die for their beliefs. I am trying to explain to you that people do not choose to die for their beliefs; rather, they choose to take certain actions, and then their killers choose to kill them because of those actions. It is the selfishness of those personal actions which we are considering.<p>And, once we have achieved this scale, we can clearly see that killing itself is an action. It is simply another tool for achieving our selfish ends. A person can choose to selfishly kill as many people as they can reach. This suggests that our morality needs to not just account for making the choice to &quot;die for what you believe in&quot;, but also the choice to <i>kill</i> for what you believe in.<p>Finally, let us consider the context of your original comment. The comment recounted a tale of folks who were sent to concentration camps in the USA during WW2. They claimed that the average person has no control over federal politics; you agreed and asked people to consider how they would prefer selfishly to not stick their necks out for the sake of ending the concentration camps. However, there are two grand ironies there: first, that we today claim to have entered WW2 in order to destroy concentration camps; and second, that we today have concentration camps on our southern border.<p>I don&#x27;t know exactly what your point is, since you&#x27;re not using your words well, but I think that you should take a step back and try to figure out where you&#x27;re headed. I have the luxury of an elected representative who already is trying to close down the concentration camps, so I know which side I&#x27;m on.')
