Item(by='dmitryminkovsky', descendants=None, kids=[25563117, 25563528, 25563501], score=None, time=1609188482, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25562816, text='&gt; AND FYI - recruiters get ghosted too by employers for various reasons.<p>Eveyone ghosts everyone, all the time... and that&#x27;s okay? I may be in the minority here, but to be honest I think I actually prefer getting ghosted.<p>It&#x27;s like the proverb: &quot;A wise man hears one word and understands two.&quot; I don&#x27;t need a polite but almost always vacant pleasantry, which is what this site is saying is missing (&quot;manners&quot;). If I didn&#x27;t get a reply, that&#x27;s a lot of information already. That&#x27;s all I need to know.<p>Now, many people do want to know why they didn&#x27;t get a job, what they can improve upon, etc. That&#x27;s a way more relatable gripe for me. Still, everything in life is a numbers game. You&#x27;ll always want to know why someone broke up with you, and part of growing up for me was realizing that you&#x27;ll never find out and that&#x27;s okay.<p>EDIT: To clarify, not advocating ghosting and certainly not something I practice in my personal life. It&#x27;s definitely better to be polite and direct whenever possible.')
