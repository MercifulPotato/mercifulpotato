My questions would be:<p>Does their small subset have the same number of vaccinated vs placebo? Are the ~90 evaluated cases representative of the whole group, or are they only from one area or health profile? How long have they followed this group?<p>It still seems like this early on in the study you could cherry pick the data to show any amount of effectiveness that you want.<p>Did I miss something here?')
