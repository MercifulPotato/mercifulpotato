The thing I would like to add to the conversation is that I think its important to know what people like Nick Cannon think or DeSean Jackson and Louis Farrakhan. Many prominent celebrities are followers like Snoop Dogg and P. Diddy.<p>When Nick Cannon came on air and said horrible things he got challenged and presumably (at least I hope), understands how his comments came off.<p>The main battle online is disinformation from not genuine sources. Many Holocaust deniers fit this bill and should be removed. That being said, there also needs to be room to discuss history and try to understand the events that led up to historical atrocities and I really want to know what the best way is to facilitate healthy discourse. I think the current method of upvoting and downvoting on the internet leads to an inorganic and not a serendipitous experience.<p>NYT and WSJ have sections for Featured Comments in an effort to put insightful comments at the top and eliminate recency bias. I just want to do anything to fight the tribalism happening in the USA.')
