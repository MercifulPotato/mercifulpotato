Was diagnosed with ADHD in 1st grade. Have been on it since and have done very well in life. Much of it, I give credit to medication. Though it hasn’t been the cure-all. I’ve had many peaks and valleys in life. Medication doesn’t prevent that. I’d attribute my positive results due to inner work, personal-development (hundreds of books), countless podcasts (Tim Ferriss, Naval Ravikant, Farnam St), and Mindfulness&#x2F;meditation, and intense periods of obsessive hard work, and deep work processing and learning from missteps. Medication has been a helping hand in this. Yet, I come across those who espouse getting off everything. I’ve found myself curious to stop for a week as an experiment, but haven’t mustered up the courage because of the comedown fears. That said, the only right answer is to run an experiment. But stopping momentum, I’ve found, is a challenging and courageous hurdle. Plan on doing it soon.')
