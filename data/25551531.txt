I just wanted to point out that often this aspect is also overlooked when it comes to immigration in America. The social aspects mean nothing to me when I could never be certain about my status in the US. In fact if I&#x27;d not integrated as much socially, I&#x27;d probably be much happier in life right now after having been forced to leave. On the other hand I completely agree with you about the social aspect. I&#x27;m worried about how I will fit in to Europe once I move there, and whether I will always be considered a foreigner. I&#x27;m trying to convince myself that it&#x27;s the better choice for me since I was forced to move there. But at the end of the day, I can&#x27;t help thinking that Europe just doesn&#x27;t have the same diversity and open culture as California did when I lived there. Who knows, maybe I will be pleasantly surprised when I go there. However, like I said before, in Europe I have certainty about my immigration status. As a highly skilled migrant, I don&#x27;t have to keep worrying about &quot;What happens if I don&#x27;t get the H1B visa&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s been 10 years, and I still haven&#x27;t received the priority date for my Green Card&quot;.')
