It should be something that was specifically designed to be used by the wider community.<p>It has become the de facto distributed version-control system for the world, but if even people who are &quot;highly paid&quot; professionals struggle with the CLI, what hope for everyone else? It might only be &quot;semi-complex&quot; to you, but there are dozens of GUIs listed on official site[0], dozens of books teaching it and an official manual which is still a &quot;work in progress&quot;[1] 15 years after it was released suggesting a different view in the wider community.<p>Imagine if git was lost and it had to be recreated, would it make sense to rebuild it exactly as it is now? It&#x27;s an amazing tool and has stretched far beyond it&#x27;s original use case, but surely we can all agree that there is room for improvement in its design?<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;git-scm.com&#x2F;downloads&#x2F;guis" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;git-scm.com&#x2F;downloads&#x2F;guis</a>\n[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;git.github.io&#x2F;htmldocs&#x2F;user-manual.html#todo-list" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;git.github.io&#x2F;htmldocs&#x2F;user-manual.html#todo-list</a>')
