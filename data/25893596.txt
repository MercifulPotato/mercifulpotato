Malaysia is another country that also has a bit of problem with this. But then, China has an awful lot of other misleading advertising and false claims (in particular around TCM and efficacy of folk remedies) that the government ignores or promotes. Why only target halal?<p>Misleading advertising aside, it&#x27;s definitely the case that Arabic script for halal disappeared from legitimately halal restaurants all over China as part of this crackdown. The message seemed to be that it is okay to be Muslim, just keep quiet about it and do not advertise it too much.')
