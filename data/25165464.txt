A whole bunch of money was spent.<p>All the software dev tools are great.<p>The problem is the linux machines running batteries out when you try to go do a webex in a conference room with a customer whereas a Mac would barely even drain the battery at all.<p>Or the linux stuff has a major FUBAR issue with the specific VPN your company uses and you need.<p>Or the linux stuff has trouble with some security related config on the specific Wifi setup in the building.<p>Or gnome&#x2F;unity needing a reboot after unplugging external monitors and trying to walk off to a meeting.<p>It&#x27;s all that stuff.   People who run stuff at home (like I did) have great flexibility to swap out the hardware and software that don&#x27;t work well with Linux.   It&#x27;s much much harder in the corporate environment.<p>Both the XPSes and the System76 work awesome if you leave them permanently on a desk.. they don&#x27;t work as replacements for MBPs in our environment.<p>I was making it work and hacking away at fixes for various broken things in linux for a while.  And then I realized it was killing my productivity and I just took the linux laptop back and asked to have another MBP.')
