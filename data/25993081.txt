It&#x27;s public, as are the rules and procedures for implementing them. I&#x27;ve read them. They have an add-on for situations like this. The add-on has a calc. That calc has a parameter they pick, which just multiplies it by whatever they want.<p>&gt; This discretionary part is intentional. It was open to public comment. People commented. DTCC responded. SEC approved.<p>&gt; DTCC is definitely going to see their discretionary use of this &quot;knob&quot; as the system working as designed.')
