Item(by='ar_lan', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612120886, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25980164, text='&gt; The biggest problem is Robinhood&#x27;s poor messaging. It&#x27;s clear their highest priority was to avoid admission that they were running out of money. They didn&#x27;t want to trigger a bank run or shake the confidence of their newly acquired users, so they tried to obscure the message as much as possible. As a result, the popular narrative assumed some sort of evil conspiracy theory.<p>All of the previous bits of your message don&#x27;t matter because this right here killed any chance of &quot;good faith&quot; people might have in Robinhood. Even if there really is no conspiracy, I personally am moving 100% to Fidelity after this fiasco (in fact, I moved everything <i>but</i> my remaining GME that exists in Robinhood already). I honestly, at this point, have about 20% faith that Robinhood will allow me to liquidate that GME - instead they will probably remove the &quot;sell&quot; button at some point too.<p>I explicitly do not trust Robinhood anymore. It&#x27;s one thing to say &quot;we fucked up&quot;, or even &quot;we can&#x27;t handle this load anymore, we are going to need to remove the buy button&quot;. I&#x27;d be pissed but wouldn&#x27;t want them scorched - at this point I hope the whole company goes bankrupt instead.')
