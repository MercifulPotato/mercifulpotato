This is mountains more evidence than ever existed for Russia or Ukraine or all the other nonsense that has passed for news during the past four years.  This bizarre dodge of saying &quot;it can&#x27;t be verified&quot; is nonsense.  There&#x27;s plenty here for a journalist to do some journalism on to try and verify.<p>Its not that it can&#x27;t be verified, it&#x27;s that mainstream news doesn&#x27;t want to verify it and be blacklisted by their peers for taking out Biden.  They value their standing in their fancy social circle more than doing their job with integrity.  It&#x27;s pure corruption.')
