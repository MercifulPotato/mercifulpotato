For some reason I thought Nintendo owned the IP since I played Chrono Trigger on the Super Nintendo but now that you mention it, I remember the &quot;Square&quot; logo on startup. The other examples (AM2R and Full Screen Mario) were shut down by Nintendo though and I have no doubt Nintendo will quickly shut down any future fanmade project touching their any of their IP if it gains any attention at all.')
