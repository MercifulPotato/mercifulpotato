It began years ago with literal hate groups like FPH or coontown on reddit, pedos on 8chan, later came pickup artists and incels, TheDonald, Chapo Trap House, then Apple, Amazon and Google banning Parler, YouTube and Twitter restricting Trump, and now, finally, even WSB. In isolation, every one of them is a drop in the bucket. But overall it&#x27;s definitely enough to matter. If this continues, at some point everyone but the most boring will feel the banhammer somewhere. And the most boring aren&#x27;t the ones producing content (aka generating all of the value).')
