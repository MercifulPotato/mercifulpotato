That is, the expectation of the conditional variance (the amount of variance left after using the information from the linear regression) is 90% of the unconditional variance.<p>A p-value of 0.01 means that under the null hypothesis (generally that the variables are independent), a result at least this extreme (in this case, with at least this large a correlation) would be seen 1% of the time.<p>Note in general that R^2 = 10% does not imply p = 0.01, nor the converse. They are largely unrelated measures. In principle one could have a small correlation with high significance, or a large correlation with low significance.')
