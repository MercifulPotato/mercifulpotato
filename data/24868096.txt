You definitely still care about that cross-platform. (Sure, there is also the API split where now you have two sets of functions, the A and the W variants, so that UCS-2 made things <i>much</i> more complicated for ever after, compared with implementing Unicode as a code page, by whatever means. Compatibility was not <i>quite</i> such a big deal there, though the approach they took seems to me to have been a poor choice. Again there were reasons why they did it the way they did, but those reasons have aged very poorly.)')
