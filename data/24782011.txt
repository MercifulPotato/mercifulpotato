I know many members of the LGBT community who are against corporate involvement in pride events for precisely that reason, and I know many LGBT people who find it very disingenuous that companies might be profiting off rainbow marketing while not (or only recently) having non-discrimination policies, or offering equal coverage for health insurance to their LGBT employees.<p>On the other hand, I would contend that the pride washing and corporate push into LGBT rights is a large reason why they haven&#x27;t backslid as quickly during the last 4 years as they might otherwise have done, and why there&#x27;s still broad public support for marriage equality even in the face of a possible reversal of Obgerfell after the inevitable SCOTUS appointment. The activists did the work, but a few years of corporate pridewashing, seeing rainbows on every t-shirt, cereal box, soda can, and brand of tennis shoe normalized things for a group of people who wouldn&#x27;t have ever listened to the activists who are pushing on things.  There&#x27;s real social value in signaling &quot;Supporting LGBT rights is the cheap, easy thing that we&#x27;re obviously going to do because everyone agrees it&#x27;s the right thing&quot;. It won&#x27;t change the mind of the active bigot, but there are a whole lot of people who will just go along with the majority opinion on social issues, and corporate signaling is perhaps the defacto way to signal the majority opinion on social issues.')
