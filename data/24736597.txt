We&#x27;re a bootstrapped hardware startup in New Zealand. Been working on this for a couple of years. Its been a long hard slog but getting there. In our first prototype (which cut the hair in the video), we tracked the head position using a realsense depth camera, and tracked the handheld device with the Valve lighthouse system. This worked well and could track the handhelds position on the head down to 2mm, even with the head moving. Our next prototype we&#x27;re gonna make tracking a lot less complex.<p>Website here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hairsense.co&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hairsense.co&#x2F;</a><p>Let me know what you think.
