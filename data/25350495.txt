Item(by='alxlaz', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607457396, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25347928, text='Gnome is still the default in most of the big distributions -- <i>but</i> arguably its most popular incarnation, Ubuntu&#x27;s, deviates significantly from upstream&#x27;s vision for the default Gnome desktop.<p>Some of these things are pretty hilarious to watch from the outside. For design&#x2F;UX considerations, Gnome 3 hasn&#x27;t supported desktop icons in a while now -- so a bunch of distributions ship it with one of the (several) desktop icon extensions, none of which are very functional, along with a bunch of other extensions, like Dash-to-Dock. So every time an unsuspecting user gets a work-issued Ubuntu laptop, you get to watch them trying to figure out how to drag a folder to the desktop, or pin a folder to the dock or whatever.<p>FWIW, though, KDE has a pretty wide install base in some popular distros, e.g. Arch: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pkgstats.archlinux.de&#x2F;fun" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pkgstats.archlinux.de&#x2F;fun</a> .')
