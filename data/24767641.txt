The result is very rural agricultural areas _just_ outside of Portland.<p>- The weather patterns bring different wildlife and kinds of beauty. While the forests outside SF are quite pretty, they are also very different than the wet douglas fir forests up north. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder -- Portland also extends into the hills and provides famous views of Mt. Hood from the SW hills. The portland zoo for instance, is like going from a city into a rain forest.<p>The oregon coast is cold and rainy 95% of the year, not the most fun place to visit.')
