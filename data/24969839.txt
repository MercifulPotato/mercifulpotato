Lots of things use USB for lots of different incompatible use-cases. They just happen to share a connector.<p>But on the other hand, you can also think of it like a regular PSU: all motherboards connect to all PSUs, and there’s no way for a PSU and motherboard to communicate to “lock out” a mismatch. And a PSU will <i>seem</i> to work for a given configuration of motherboard+CPU+peripherals, until you drive that configuration hard enough to overdrive the PSU, and it shuts off.<p>The solution in both cases is the same: you overbuy on PSUs. A good high-wattage-rated power supply (whether a USB one or a desktop molex one) will power anything <i>below</i> that wattage requirement just fine. USB PSUs <i>do</i> negotiate power draw with the client device, so you <i>can</i> run a Pi off a big-brick laptop-class USB charger without damaging it.<p>And <i>that’s</i> mostly why Raspberry uses USB power, I think: if you already have a big beefy USB PSU from something else (as most early-market adopters do), you can use it to power your Pi for playing around, without having to buy the Pi its own PSU, if you’re not sure you want&#x2F;need to set it up for its own standalone use-case.<p>(Also, the Pi will run just fine on a wimpy 5V1A iPhone charger <i>if</i> you don’t tax it very hard. Just like a cheap desktop PSU will power a gaming rig with a beefy GPU, <i>if</i> you never open a game. And most <i>embedded</i> use cases, e.g. PiHole, <i>don’t</i> tax the Pi very hard. So there’s a lot of cases where people get along just fine with the cheapest possible configuration, where forcing them to buy an actual power adapter would make things a lot <i>more</i> expensive for no gain.)<p>&gt; or they could design Pis to use less power<p>You know that they stop selling old-model Pi’s, right? It’s not because they want to. It’s because those chips stop being manufactured upstream; and Raspberry doesn’t do enough volume to drive production of SoCs all on their own.<p>Raspberry is constrained by what parts they can put in a Pi that are both <i>available</i> and sufficient for the use-cases their customers have (e.g. driving monitors at native resolution.) Those chips have minimum power requirements. The power requirements never go <i>down</i>, because there’s no high-volume customer with exactly Raspberry’s use-case (where that use-case is “using process-shrinks to build a graphical desktop SoC <i>of the same performance</i> at ever-lower current draw, rather than achieving <i>ever-higher performance</i> at the same current draw.” An SoC process-shrink that is taken as-is with no commensurate re-layout for increased perf, is <i>extremely</i> rare in the industry. Not rare in microcontrollers, but an MCU can’t drive a desktop computer.)<p>You might suggest they undervolt the newer chips — and they do! — but there’s only so far you can undervolt a chip before it just stops functioning at all. (Especially an SoC, that contains DRAM that must get refreshed, IO controllers that must drive peripheral lines with to-spec line voltage, etc.)')
