For example - I bought a rowing machine on Amazon. It was the first piece of home gym equipment I&#x27;d ever purchased. For months after, other rowing machines were suggested to me. I already bought one, why would I buy another, especially if I hadn&#x27;t returned the first one?<p>Ads like this are very common for me - a purchase that I would consider to be a one-off thing (at least, for several years, whatever the standard lifetime of that product is) just leads to more ads for different models of that same thing. Occasionally, accessories that only go to a different model or brand of that thing.<p>I don&#x27;t see how this is any better than the random shotgun approach - these ads that are 100% irrelevant and not going to lead to a purchase are taking up space that ads that are possibly &lt; 100% irrelevant (even if completely random) could be occupying.<p>It seems like this would be a solvable problem for Amazon - aggregate the data of everyone who has purchased X model of rowing machine and see how many of them purchased a second rowing machine, which brand it was, and how long after purchasing #1 they bought #2. Don&#x27;t show ads for rowing machines to people who have purchased X until time is &gt;= avgTimeBetween1And2, with some fancy statistics in there somewhere.<p>Clearly I&#x27;m missing something in my logic, because plenty of people a lot smarter than me work on this adtech stuff.')
