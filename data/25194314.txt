I was given a passing grade only on effort - not by the skills I learned poorly.<p>But a year later, at my first Fortran computer course in college, I was the star of the the keypunch room which had the same keyboard on the 023 Keypunch as my familiar IBM typewriter.<p>I got an A in every computer course, which was greatly enabled by the lack of frustration in the keypunch room.<p>From worst to first.<p>Now at age 69, there has not been a year in which I did not program, which is the most satisfying avocation I can imagine.')
