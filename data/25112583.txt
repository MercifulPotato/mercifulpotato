If you have &quot;trigger&quot; foods [1], then those still need to be avoided, but the cherry juice will allow you to enjoy a normal, non-excessive diet of pretty much everything else.<p>[0] Sweet cherry juice works too, but you need <i>a lot</i> more of it, to the point where it would be excessive and unhealthy.<p>[1] By trigger foods, I mean those that will cause a gout attack regardless of how much is consumed. For me, it&#x27;s spinach - as little as one leaf will make my toe sore for a couple of days. Most people never learn their trigger foods, so consider yourself lucky if you know yours.')
