It&#x27;s decided at the local level where homeowners are locked into huge investments that are dependent on car infrastructure. And in cities, even supposedly &quot;left&quot; movements have very little appetite for this sort of switch from private infrastructure to public transit infrastructure, at least here in California.<p>I am skeptical of anybody engineering full level 65 self driving cars within the foreseeable future, but I think it&#x27;s more likely than the necessary change you lay out. (I would consider it a huge success beyond all imagination if we had city planning changed to allow even 50% of our households to live a car-free life)')
