So now you have two of the best keys on the keyboard mapped redundantly to a relatively little used function.<p>- What about the enter&#x2F;return key? It does the same thing as j, it moves down. Brilliant.<p>Those are just minor nitpicks of course, but I have a laundry list of those if anybody cares to hear them. It&#x27;s littered with small inconsistencies and idiosyncrasies that stem from historical baggage and not actually trying to design an ergonomic editor.<p>That being said I don&#x27;t get where you&#x27;re coming from with VScode. Do you consider the editor part of VSCode to be better than Vim, or are you talking about Vim failing as an IDE?<p>It&#x27;s important not to mix things up, VSCode is an IDE, Vim isn&#x27;t. If you wanted an IDE and tried to get Vim to do that by adding 3MB of vimscript from various sources to make it work I can&#x27;t blame you for giving up, it&#x27;s probably going to end up being a mess.')
