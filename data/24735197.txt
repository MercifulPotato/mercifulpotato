When a debit card is abused fraudulently I am out the money. When a credit card is abused fraudulently the bank is out the money.<p>In both cases neither the bank nor I have done anything wrong. We’re both literally victims of a crime. And through the payments system  and the justice system we’ll hopefully be made whole in the end.  But the difference is the incentives. When I lose the money the bank has less of an incentive to rectify the situation.')
