I think the community at HN is tech-obsessed which is what I like about it. But finance? This is not yahoo finance or wherever all the finance guys hang out.<p>It sounds more like he had a clash with someone specific on a finance-related issue and bases his view of the HN community on that. The eggcup is a bit of an immature way to deal with this IMO. Especially as he has good points to make about X11 security, and this undermines them.')
