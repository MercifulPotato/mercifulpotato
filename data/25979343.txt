Each of your conversations on the remote side has a corresponding room, and what you say in that room is forwarded by the bridge trough your remote account.<p>You could try out dendrite.matrix.org as a homeserver (btw, dendrite would nicely fit into these 4GB). Most bridges need admin access to the server though, if you want to host them yourself. t2bot.io hosts a few you&#x27;d be able to use with your own dendrite, though it hits capacity problems at times.<p>Finally, you could try to make synapse leaner by not joining big rooms with hundreds of federating servers. There is a max_complexity (something like it) setting for that use case.')
