This abstraction allows us to understand the problem better, rather than just analyzing the way the problem manifests itself in code. Having a programming language that mirrors our everyday communication is an important step forward in making the innovations from software broadly available.<p>The next wave of programmers will need to understand how human language can be used to efficiently guide models to solve problems that can’t be solved by human-written code. This is a big challenge, and we’re just at the very beginning of it, but I think it will open up new and undiscovered ways to create value in the world.<p>I have quite a few additional thoughts on the topic which I’ve captured here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sundayscaries.substack.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;whos-the-real-expert" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sundayscaries.substack.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;whos-the-real-expert</a>')
