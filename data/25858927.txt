He’s surprised to see that they  have used every single tool in the workshop and have completely exhausted the supplies of components.<p>They are all huddled are a fantastically impressive, and extremely complicated looking machine.<p>Prof. Wolff asks “How are you getting on with transporting the egg?”<p>One of the developers replies, we’re still working on that part, but we’ve made some fantastic omelettes, poached eggs with hollandaise sauce and the scrambled eggs are  quite exceptional.<p>Prof. Wolff congratulates them on their achievements and moves on to the next team.<p>The second team are the production support team.  Prof. Wolff is somewhat confused when he enters their workshop because all the tools are still on the shelves and there is no sign of any activity.<p>He asks the team what they have been doing, they look somewhat defensive before responding that in fact they’ve been watching the developers and have concluded it is impossible to make such a machine and produce a substantial set of diagrams explaining the problems with the developers machine and why it can’t work without completely redesigning it.<p>Prof. Wolf moves on to check in on the the last team. This team is a group of senior business executives.<p>When Prof. Wolff walks in he is completely taken aback, there seems to be egg covering every surface of the workshop, there is even egg dripping from the ceiling.<p>He asks, “What on earth happened here?”  The team all shrugs their shoulders and the one says “I don’t know, I think it was like that when we got here”')
