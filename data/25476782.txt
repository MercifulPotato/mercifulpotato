Often when it occurs, the university will side with the academic rather than postdoc or PhD students, which puts them in an extremely difficult situation since their manager is often the bully. In addition, you&#x27;re likely in a position of power since you&#x27;ve been in academy for 15+ years ... It could be that you do not interact with certain circles to observe this behaviour.<p>Also, discrimination, particularly sexism also very much occurs, including to students. See for for example: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;amp&#x2F;s&#x2F;amp.theguardian.com&#x2F;education&#x2F;2020&#x2F;jan&#x2F;07&#x2F;third-cambridge-university-staff-experienced-bullying" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;amp&#x2F;s&#x2F;amp.theguardian.com&#x2F;education&#x2F;2...</a>')
