You probably don’t, unless it’s your job to do so.<p>There isn’t really a lot of literature on this subject aimed at employees trying to lead up-wards, but any sort of team-management literature will cover it.<p>There is a big difference between conflict management, and leading a team in a design process though. They really don’t relate on any level. If “you’re” entering design by committee, then “you’re” not using “your” resources correctly, “you’re” not defining the direction or goal and “you’re” not making decisions. Note that “you” is the person in charge and this persons manager, but there is typically very little people, who are not in charge can do, to successfully change that. Conflict by contrast is how you resolve disagreements, and in interpersonal conflict you’ll always want to seek compromise and figuring out how to get along. In design processes, you’ll want a team leader to take charge and pick whatever input is most likely to achieve the projects goals.<p>I wouldn’t worry about conflict though. It’s a natural part of life. Be honest and be assertive but be polite and pick your battles wisely. If whatever it is that is being mismanaged isn’t actually your responsibility, then you don’t actually have to care. Even if you can’t change your job right now, it’ll be healthier for you, if you stay true to yourself and don’t carry any weight they don’t pay you to carry.')
