I&#x27;m a scrappy student working on a startup I believe in, and I would not trade places with the successful entrepreneur.<p>I have fun climbing mountains. So does he. I have plenty of mountains to climb, while he&#x27;s surrounded by the fog and believes he has no other mountains to climb. Ergo, I&#x27;m having fun while he believes he&#x27;ll never have fun again.<p>&gt; That is an excellent point.<p>Thank you.<p>&gt; Personally I cannot think of anything more boring than a meeting of the EU Parliament, the UN, US Congress, or the CCP.<p>I never stated they have good taste :P<p>In all seriousness, I wouldn&#x27;t really consider politicians the ruling class. Now, I&#x27;m not an expert on this topic, but I&#x27;d wager that the billionaire entrepreneurs have more power than the US senators being paid a measly $200K&#x2F;year. Suppose they have a little side-hustle and make 1M&#x2F;year; that&#x27;s still peanuts.')
