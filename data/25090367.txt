I&#x27;ve never seen the south&#x2F;north divide you&#x27;re describing. If they thought deforestation or whatever was the solution to the fires in the North, they would&#x27;ve done something about it, considering the one-party nature of the state. Instead, they believe the problem is climate change or whatever warming, and they have voted and taken action toward mitigating climate change. If you have more info about SoCal blocking the north from being able to put more resources toward deforestation, I&#x27;d love to see it.')
