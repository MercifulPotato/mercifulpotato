As is, there is entitlement on both sides, developers feel entitled to track and log everything, share it with who knows who and where and users feel entitled to free apps with no cost to themselves, lauding apple for getting the opt-out of any tracking while not paying devs in any other way. I don&#x27;t understand why that should be a right. Don&#x27;t use the app if you don&#x27;t want to pay in some way.<p>And of course the cynical view is that Apple wants everyone to pay with money, as that&#x27;s how they get their cut.')
