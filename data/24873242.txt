Item(by='mistermann', descendants=None, kids=[24874110], score=None, time=1603482796, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24872984, text='&gt; First, you know you&#x27;re on extremely weak rhetorical ice<p>a) You do not know what I know<p>b) I would say that I am not on &quot;rhetorical ice&quot; <i>at all</i> - rather, I am <i>combating</i> rhetoric with precise, <i>non-rhetorical</i> ideas<p>&gt; and also kind of outside the norms of our community<p><i>This is my very complaint</i>.  It may be true that I am &quot;outside of the norms (Overton Window) of the community&quot;, but have I violated the HN guidelines?  Is strict epistemology (disciplined adherence to <i>that which is actually true</i>) a <i>formal</i> violation of explicit community rules, or an undocumented, culturally imposed one?<p>&gt; when you start quoting the dictionary as a rebuttal.<p>Adherence to formal, broadly accepted definitions of words (upon which someone else&#x27;s argument is based) is improper behavior?<p>&gt; The person you&#x27;re debating told you what they meant; what they meant is no longer a part of the debate.<p>How does one know what portions of reality are acceptable to discuss, and which ones shall not be discussed?  I see nothing in the guidelines.  And I would strongly disagree to objections based on &quot;Please respond to the strongest plausible interpretation of what someone says, not a weaker one that&#x27;s easier to criticize. Assume good faith.&quot;  It is a fine guideline, but when it starts being used as a wildcard to suppress true ideas, the discussion of which may not to be some people&#x27;s liking, I think that crosses an important line.<p>&gt; Second, it is very much out of the norms of HN to do email-style alternating quote&#x2F;response the way you are. It&#x27;s also very difficult to read on this site.<p>Certain forms of communication (precise, non-narrative) lend themselves to different writing styles.<p>Do you have any objections that are based on the actual content of the ideas I have written?  Or might your objection be not to the ideas themselves, but that I am stating them out loud?<p>Does it matter to anyone what is actually True any longer, or have we mass adopted a culture of &quot;the ends justifies the means&quot; to managing and discussing the affairs of the world?  Should bad ideas be fought with better ideas, or with censorship (formal, or informal) and pretending they do not exist?<p>Based on how I see events unfolding in the world, now seems like an opportune time to be discussing <i>just what exactly we humans are actually up to on this planet</i> (as opposed to what we like to tell ourselves we are up to), from a more philosophical&#x2F;abstract perspective - this facilitates the ability to rise above the repetitive loop of object-level &quot;he said, she said&quot; conversations, and ascend to a level of more thoughtful, less combative&#x2F;partisan communication and sense making - at least in theory.  Are we <i>formally</i> opposed to that level of conversation, is that &quot;outside the norms of our community&quot; - or not?  This is not my decision to make, I am only asking the question.')
