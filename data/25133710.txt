Wholesale prices drop, retail prices rise because of there is too much energy when it isn&#x27;t wanted.<p>There is too much energy because obsolete base load plants can&#x27;t keep up with a modern grid. The primary source of excess energy isn&#x27;t renewables because we want to use every single renewable kWh. Excess energy is energy that isn&#x27;t wanted not just because we don&#x27;t need it but also because we don&#x27;t like how it was created. Coal plants not only force flexible power generators to turn off prematurely, they also generate CO2. So any insistence on protecting coal plants is completely misguided considering their fatal flaws as a technology.<p>&gt;it seems likely Big Battery is fixing up losses from installing an unstable amount of wind and solar.<p>Is this supposed to be some kind of joke? Flexible power generators cannot increase grid instability because their response time is measured in minutes or seconds. You can turn solar panel on&#x2F;off immediately. You can turn on&#x2F;off turbines at any time with a slight delay. The Tesla battery stores an insignificant amount of energy so it can&#x27;t even do what you are talking about. It&#x27;s primary purpose is frequency stabilization which was usually done with peaker plants and unconventional energy storage like flywheels.')
