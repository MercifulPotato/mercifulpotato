You are responsible for understanding and following these as well as the appropriate laws (which probably require the assistance of a lawyer, which I am not, and which is probably a good idea in any case).<p>If a service provider refuses you service and you believe it violates the terms of service that you agreed to (that&#x27;s going to be a hard row to hoe), you should have legal recourse. (Still not a lawyer, though.)<p>Technically, the safest approach would be to build your own geographically-distributed server facilities and get your own Autonomous System Number.
