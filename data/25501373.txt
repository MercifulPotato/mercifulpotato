They didn&#x27;t invent electric motors. They didn&#x27;t invent pretty much anything novel.<p>They <i>execute</i> superbly, had a brilliant strategy of starting as a luxury vehicle to be the beachhead for getting an economy of scale, and were risk takers, but lets not pretend they invented the market. They didn&#x27;t.<p>No doubt they have loads of superficial patents though, but Tesla has an open patent policy and a declaration that they won&#x27;t sue, so that doesn&#x27;t seem to matter much.<p>Apple can buy a company like Magna Int with pocket change. Recall that Magna made the &quot;Sony&quot; electric car, bumper to bumper (Sony put in some screens demonstrating a Sony-esque UI), because that&#x27;s what Magna does -- they&#x27;re the maker behind a lot of automobiles, either in part or whole. And Magna has loads of patents around the engineering of vehicles because they&#x27;ve been doing it for decades.')
