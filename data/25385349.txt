Apple has demonstrated far too large of a performance and power efficiency savings to not try. Of course, even if that becomes successful, x86 will be available for decades.<p>Right now, ARM Macs are going to just be lost for any kind of gaming (except Catalyst versions of mobile games). This is probably ridiculous, but my dream is that the M-series chips become so compelling over the other options that the NEXT nextgen consoles would adopt it. Then we could get back to having at least a few of the biggies getting ported to Macs. But I can&#x27;t even get my hands on the current new-gen PS, so this is a looong way off, even in the best case.')
