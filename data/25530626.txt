It&#x27;s not on purpose, we just grew apart and have moved on. If we happen upon a chance meeting, I&#x27;m sure we would be friendly with each other, but we&#x27;re not going out of our way to seek out <i>or</i> avoid each other. I find these black and white rigid &quot;rules&quot; (such as not keeping in touch with any exes as a red flag) to be incredibly judgmental and limiting.')
