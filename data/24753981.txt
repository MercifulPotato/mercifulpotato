I&#x27;m going to guess this person could have just posted bail and ran regardless. Bail isn&#x27;t foolproof, and if you have enough money, you can get out of it. Heck, simply having money makes your odds of getting found &#x27;not guilty&#x27; much greater in the US.<p>The problem is that bail really doesn&#x27;t work better than a lot of other sorts of interventions. Know what has a good track record? Letting folks go and having them check in regularly. Calling them to remind them of appointments and court dates. And this has the added benefit of not ruining innocent people&#x27;s lives and it is a better use of taxpayer money.<p>Not forcing ruin on folks really does help society at large.<p>Making victimless crimes legal wouldn&#x27;t help with keeping innocent folks out of jail. Everyone in jail before trial is innocent. It doesn&#x27;t matter what they are charged with - before trial, they are innocent. Even if the crime committed had a victim.')
