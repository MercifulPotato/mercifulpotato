The evidence for B.1.1.7 being more transmissive is quite solid, and seems to be getting more so as time goes on. But no matter how strong the statistical data is, it could never be good enough for them. So their policy recommendation ends up as &quot;do nothing at all until there is 100% certain non-circumstantial evidence&quot;.<p>The problem is that action now is way more valuable than action in 1-2 months. Mass vaccination is right around the corner, we just need to buy time to get there. If there is a substantially more transmissive variant around, that will make it much harder to buy that time. You need to be able to act on the balance of probabilities, not wait for perfect information.<p>(And their claim that there&#x27;s nothing we can do differently is just total bunk.)<p>And because they run a popular podcast, their view gets massively amplified by being parroted in internet discussion.')
