Assuming a 75 kWh battery in the car, charging in 10 minute means providing 450,000 watts for 10 minutes. At 1000V (higher than any DC charger today) would require 450 amps of current. The wire needed to provide 450A would be unmanageable for a car charger. And this is all assuming 100% efficiency, when in reality there will be various losses from charger to battery.<p>Battery tech aside, how does any auto maker plan to get 10 minute charge time when just getting they much power through a cable is a huge challenge.')
