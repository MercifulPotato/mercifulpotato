It&#x27;s never as simple as a bare majority imposing its will.<p>Ironically, it leads to the exact opposite, where certain minorities express disproportionate power. For example, the rules always favor the status quo, so a minority in power can retain power, and subvert even largish majorities from passing rules they favor.<p>Democracy may well be the least worst form of government, but it&#x27;s even worse than I think most people give it credit for. The assumption is that at least half the people are happy with at least half of the results, and it doesn&#x27;t even guarantee that much.')
