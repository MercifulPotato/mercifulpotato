In summary, it is hard to get data from the real world into the blockchain. Even if you put it there, why should anyone trust you. A way around this is to get many credible parties to input the &#x27;state&#x27; from their perspective and then blend the inputs. Once you have a data stream that you can trust (relatively) on the blockchain, you can make non-custodial trustless (or trust-minimized) smart contracts (bets, predictions, derivatives, etc.) based on the original variable in the real world.')
