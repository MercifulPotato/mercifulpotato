What they would give to live our lives! Toil? Are you kidding me? We have it better than some 120 billion human being before us. Concepts like basic freedom, education, healthcare were not a right that most ever had.<p>Watching half of your kids die before age of 5 from something a set of pills cures now? Your wife risking her life with every delivery? Dying of very minor wounds, when flu is killer that covid can only dream about?<p>I could go on like that for very long time... No, our life isn&#x27;t a misery and toil in any western society, unless we make mistakes and chose such a path. My isn&#x27;t for example, nor is most people I know.<p>Its kind of sad to see how weak we have become. 100 years ago a mutated flu killed 100 million people which was significant chunk of global population, right after the most horrible war mankind has ever experienced, and people got through. We can get through almost anything. Its properly sad what&#x27;s happening. As a nature, travel and adventure lover my heart weeps, but I have no doubt mankind will get through this. There is still <i>so</i> much beauty out there. I am not naive anymore we will get much wiser while getting through this, but somehow we will manage. Till then, taking it day by day, enjoying the little things life so often gives us, enjoying friends and family... that&#x27;s still a great life to live. Only few in the history had such a luck. I am definitely not terrified for my kids.')
