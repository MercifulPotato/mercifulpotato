Item(by='chokeartist', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607354144, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25332124, text='&gt; Commented out code is a terrible idea.<p>I have no idea what your context for such a statement is but I can tell you in my career as both an IC and now as pseudo-Management (Product Manager), commented out code has saved me many a times.<p>Why? Very simple scenario. We hit issue X, dev Y has what they think is a fix... but they are not super familiar with the code base. They put the fix it, and keep the prior function&#x2F;logic commented out. If dev Z needs to review this (assuming dev Y has left the org), the history is right there.<p>The inverse is I have had to contact former employees to help me&#x2F;us understand X. And anyone worth their salt isn&#x27;t going to consult for free :).')
