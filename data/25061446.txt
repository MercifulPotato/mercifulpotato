Most recently (older, but not senior, couple married for decades), one party did not agree with the other (amicable party offered 50&#x2F;50, other party was spiteful), and ~$200k in value was destroyed through legal fees...to arrive at a 50&#x2F;50 split.<p>Divorces <i>can</i> be amicable, but the frequency of this happening is not insignificant. Without a prenuptial agreement, you&#x27;re rolling the dice. Do you feel lucky?')
