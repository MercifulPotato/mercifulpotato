The thinkpad screen at 14&quot; is wide enough for me to have two things side by side, often a command line and a file or two files, or (shocker) code beside documentation.<p>Whilst vertical space is appreciated, the fact is that practically everything is taller than your screen. You are going to be scrolling vertically and everything supports that as an essential feature. Horizontal scroll is a  nighmare however.<p>It&#x27;s also worth noting that Lenovo&#x27;s 4k screen on the 15.6inch actually fits more pickels vertically than Apple&#x27;s 16inch despite physically being shorter. Obviously YMMV with regards to what actually gets represented on your screen.')
