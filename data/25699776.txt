Usually later in the application life cycle you have a hard time refactoring stuff when working with e.g. JS or rails. Without tests you will definitly break stuff. With haskell you can confidently refactor your code without worrying about breaking stuff, the compiler will tell you.<p>The way data structure are declared in haskell is also very nice for domain modeling. You don&#x27;t have as much boilerplate as e.g. when using PHP with doctrine.<p>The performance is also pretty good compared to python or rails.')
