Item(by='hardwaresofton', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608562564, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25493635, text='Typescript fits my sensibilities and desire for expressive type-systems much more than Dart.<p>Back when I tried it, it also had a much more incomplete ecosystem, though the google marketing machine was in full swing. I remember not being able to even use the sqlite library without actually spinning up an emulator (as in, I couldn&#x27;t use it with just plain dart). Dealing with generics was actually difficult&#x2F;painful (as in just something simple like printing JSON). BLoC seemed like a hack and was more complex than I was comfortable with for using at large scale. Maybe it&#x27;s better these days.<p>I will take Typescript over Dart all day every day. I would even take JS with all it&#x27;s warts over Dart.<p>That said, Flutter I think is amazing because it is probably going to be hands-down the easiest way to write apps that hit a large number of screens. I think Google will get there first-ish (they have a lot of money and a lot of platforms to support).')
