If it&#x27;s the majority with a different truth I&#x27;m honest enough with myself most of the time to realize it&#x27;s probably me who&#x27;s wrong. But sometimes I will stand my ground anyway, not usually out of stubbornness, but because I&#x27;m confident that my analysisis correct. I don&#x27;t think my odds are actually great in these cases, but just occasionally I might have found the truth before the rest of the world, and that can be valuable.')
