Even CS undergrads start with toy operating systems that they fill in the parts for (adding a filesystem, writing a compiler for a toy language, etc). There&#x27;s simply no better way to learn.<p>&gt; These students are obviously smarter than the average student, and therefore I would expect more of them, like inventing new OS concepts instead of mimicking age-old designs.<p>You can disagree but here are the facts:<p>1. The students completed the task.<p>2. The professor had intentionally built slack into the schedule to let ambitious students take this further to play around with the tools &amp; their knowledge to try doing creative things.<p>3. The students used this to recruit others students to form a larger team around a more ambitious end goal<p>4. Self-organized to distribute work &amp; build a schedule that minimized interdependencies<p>5. Completed their goal.<p>Aside from the technical stuff, these all sound like valuable soft skills that were learned&#x2F;applied in addition to the technical achievement. I&#x27;d say both the professor &amp; students did a good job here.<p>What&#x27;s hard for me to say is what year this is. In my old engineering school there was a final project in years 3 &amp; 4. Your team would pick some kind of vague final project (with consultation from your teacher), you&#x27;d get a budget for materials + connections to companies&#x2F;vendors for sponsorship, &amp; then go about building your concept. That&#x27;s a bit more complex than this but also lasts 1.5 years and happens largely outside of school. This blog post is about a project done within the context of 1 subject AFAICT. That makes it way more impressive.<p>Students at this level simply don&#x27;t yet (at least generally) have the experience nor a good understanding of the space to understand what are more significant problems to go tackle. From what I&#x27;ve seen you usually start that journey as a masters&#x2F;PhD student.')
