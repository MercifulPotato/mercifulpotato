It would have to be part time &#x2F; remote because I&#x27;m not willing to stop working. The only suitable thing I&#x27;ve come across is Georgia Tech&#x27;s online masters.<p>I considered the Open University but their CS courses look poor and it has become too expensive for something that would be a hobby.<p>However, I&#x27;m not really sure what FernUni would offer over just buying OU books on Amazon and working through them.')
