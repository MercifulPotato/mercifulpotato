Item(by='trsohmers', descendants=None, kids=[25946492], score=None, time=1611856575, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25945679, text='Even though robinhood is claiming to allow people to close their open positions, I have been trying for hours to close two options contracts and continue to get error messages saying that I &quot;don&#x27;t have enough buying power&quot;, which is insane since I am just trying to sell my already owned contracts! I was up over 300% earlier this morning when I wanted to sell, but now overall down ~15% in large part due to Robinhood&#x27;s either incompetence, neglect, malice, or some combination of the three.<p>EDIT: By the off chance anyone from Robinhood is reading this, it would be great to get back to one of my multiple support emails or request for phone support. While I am understanding of the fact that Robinhood is probably being bombarded at the moment and I am sympathetic to whoever is handling the support line, this is a self inflected wound by Robinhood that has resulted in a lot of their customers losing money and now despising them.')
