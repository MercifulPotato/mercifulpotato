Primarily for two reasons: aesthetic relativism (&quot;Beauty is just an opinion and all opinions are equally valid&quot;) and cost (&quot;Why design beautiful buildings when ugly ones are cheaper?&quot;) Rather than pay more money to ensure that the market for craftsmen is stable, we&#x27;d prefer to save $20 and buy some plastic junk. Ditto for other art forms.')
