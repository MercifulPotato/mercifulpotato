In fact, intelligence research was always on the forefront of using cutting edge methodology and some tools that are used in psychology were invented specifically to research intelligence. Spearman invented factor analysis to measure cognitive performance, to this day this test is still used in behavior research.<p>If you think that IQ studies are inadequate, donâ€™t even look at other fields that study humans (aside maybe from double blind trials in medicine), you are going to have a heart attack.<p>By your standards we need to ignore 90% of academia and solely rely on physics research to guide our policy.')
