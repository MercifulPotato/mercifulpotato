Item(by='ardy42', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611089060, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25838454, text='&gt; If most people live in the cities, I don&#x27;t see an argument for letting rural areas have more than their proportional share of representation.<p>It does act to prevent the rural areas from becoming totally neglected hinterlands, help them implement polices that may be necessary because of the different conditions of non-urban areas.<p>That said, I do think the current bargain tips the balance too much, so I&#x27;m now in favor of abolishing the Electoral College, and giving the House an advise-and-consent role (in addition to that of the Senate), at least for judges.  These smaller states can keep their extra representation in the Senate.')
