We&#x27;re all a month or more from our last haircut. We live in the homes we had when it all started. We don&#x27;t have control over that and it shouldn&#x27;t affect my perception of candidates.<p>Besides, it&#x27;s a remote job. You don&#x27;t need to look nice for it. You can work naked for all I care.<p>It made me realise how superfluous pictures on resumes (Germany), LinkedIn profile photos and video calls are in a neutral hiring process. Even without them, the WhatsApp or Skype profile photo betrayed their looks.')
