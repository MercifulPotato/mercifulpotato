Item(by='vikramkr', descendants=None, kids=[24761550, 24761671, 24761631, 24761624, 24761541], score=None, time=1602552076, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24761116, text='Other than the part about reproducing from seeds, this is a pretty standard plant patent situation in the US. There are all sorts of restrictions on what you can patent, and the plant patent landscape is quite reasonable (unlike software patents). Plants like the cotton candy grapes in this post are really difficult to develop, and 20 years of legal protection is pretty reasonable. Remember this is agriculture- things move relatively slowly, and you cant corner the market of a variety in 20 years - you probably won&#x27;t have patent protection by the time a plant reaches max market penetrstion anyway, but you&#x27;ll have made your money during the first few years. And if you purchase patented varieties of fruit for your home garden (you might already have a couple!) you&#x27;ll notice the patent fee for them barely registers - shipping costs are probably higher than the patent cost for your new citrus.<p>As I was alluding to though, there are restrictions, including that the plant has to be asexually reproduced and the infringing plant has to be identical to the parent, which does not apply to seed born progeny. Maybe there&#x27;s some aspect of the plant variety protection act in play - I&#x27;m not as familiar with that - or maybe they&#x27;re referring to using tissue from the aborted seeds present in seedless grapes to tissue culture out a clone, IDK.')
