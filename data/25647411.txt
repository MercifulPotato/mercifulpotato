He was an Alaska native, living outside Seattle. He had been doing a lot of contract work at a large Urgent Care in Alaska, and talked about it with his family.<p>They talked about making him full-time. Negotiated an offer, relocation package, etc., all good. He set about selling his home, finding his kids new schools, etc. And then about a week before his start date, he got a phone call.<p>&quot;The clinic has been sold to new owners. They are reviewing finances and rescinded any job offers, including yours. They will allow you 30 days to repay your relocation assistance.&quot;<p>Oh hell no. He lawyered up. He&#x27;d sold his home. Had a whole bunch of language in the employment contract that the new owners were unaware of, to ensure things went &quot;smoothly&quot;.<p>He didn&#x27;t end up repaying his relocation assistance. And his &quot;new&quot; &quot;employer&quot; ended up paying three months salary and the closing costs on his house for the inconvenience.')
