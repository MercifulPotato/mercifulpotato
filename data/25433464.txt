Yet the day after I felt &#x27;replenished&#x27; of somethings. As if my internal world couldn&#x27;t satisfy me fully and even dreaded parties were benefitial.<p>I&#x27;m the same way towards social gatherings. As a result, I try to remind myself before going to one that I may hate that feeling of dread leading up to it, but that on the other side of it I am going to feel great. That doesn&#x27;t mean I can be social all the time, but I think even introverts need that regular dose of social activity to feel whole. If anything, it makes those alone times we enjoy even more valuable as there&#x27;s a contrast.')
