There&#x27;s been a huge uptick in that over the last several months, and with the disgusting episode in Washington, it kicked into high gear these past few days.  It&#x27;s affecting people who have very little in common with the people who engaged in illegal acts there, too.  There are topics that correlate with disfavored political views but are not directly related to politics that have practically been eliminated from Facebook, Twitter, and other platforms.  It&#x27;s probably not illegal, but it&#x27;s disturbing to watch.')
