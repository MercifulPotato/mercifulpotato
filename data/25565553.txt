The assessment begins with the following and just gets worse.<p>&quot;SMS is the only option (unless you want to donate, which would reveal your personal information of course); therefore their claim that &quot;ProtonMail does not require any personally identifiable information to register&quot; is a shameless lie. Update: a contact told me that Proton now includes the option to solve a recaptcha (still an evil) for confirmation; however, the option disappears while using a VPN. They must really want that damn phone number if you are using anonymizers! And the claim that you can sign up without personal data is still false.&quot;')
