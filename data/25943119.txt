I&#x27;d just really like someone to show off a nice neat counter example, that demonstrates the true beauty of Python OO, and is &quot;unrefactorable&quot; to a data types + functions equivalent.<p>Pathlib is a great example, maybe a canonical one, of:<p>&gt; Very occasionally, you come up with a core type that&#x27;s used so often, it&#x27;s nice to have the cutesy stuff.<p>Django&#x27;s class based views I think could probably reasonably refactored into data types + functions. I&#x27;m not too au-fait with Django or its internals, but if someone could send me a &quot;demonstration Django clone in 800 lines&quot;, I&#x27;d give it a go.<p>&gt; What if client_a and client_b write to different APIs? ...<p>Then you use an if statement to split at that point. Again, given a specific toy example, I&#x27;m fairly certain a reasonable refactor is possible.')
