Item(by='TylerJewell', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605975927, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25169621, text='I got my pilot&#x27;s license and instrument rating along with endorsements for mountain flying and high performance airplanes. I&#x27;ve now started studying for my commercial pilot&#x27;s license and may pick up a multi-engine license, too. Took about 2 years to accomplish all of these tasks.<p>Studying for the license felt like I was back in university. So I treated it as a goal, studying ground materials consistently every day while blocking out 2 lessons every week. It was effectively a job on top of the work I was already doing.<p>Most shocking was how much longer it took me to absorb the materials vs. studying equivalently complicated topics 25 years ago. Not to understand what they were, but to be able to have instant recall with precision.')
