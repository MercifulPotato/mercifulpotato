More often than not, the people kicking up a stink return a perfectly working product, and they just wanted to make sure we&#x27;d accept it by them being as foul as possible.<p>Sometimes we&#x27;ll get people just asking for more information on an item we sell.\nUsually you can tell whether or not these people are actually interested in the product or not by how they ask the question.  If they&#x27;re asking about a specific detail (for example, if they&#x27;re looking for a particular serial number range on a console), they&#x27;ll usually follow up if you give them a positive response.\nPeople asking less specific questions (such as asking for &quot;more photos&quot;) are often just bored and have nothing better to do and will either disappear or ask more questions.  You can waste literal hours serving these customers and in the process lose thousands of dollars worth of actual sales.<p>The worst group are just really badly socialised people - often people with serious mental health or drug-related issues.  If you engage with them, they will demand massive amounts of your time and have absolutely zero concern for your feelings (let alone your business goals).  If they feel you have slighted they, they will respond in the most foul and violent way possible.\nJust today, my wife was publicly berated by an incel-type guy because she didn&#x27;t respond to a message he had sent over a week ago.  There are at least 2 other occasions I can think of in the last year where this happened.<p>I think the thing to remember is that the average HN reader (and, by extension, most people that the average HN reader knows) is educated, values their time, and is socialised well enough to the point that they can hold down a job and maintain basic interpersonal relationships.  The type of person who contacts customer support for products that shouldn&#x27;t really require support are absolutely not like this.  Mostly it&#x27;s just people that don&#x27;t value their own time (or the time of others), but multiple times every week we&#x27;ll come across people with _serious_ social issues (I don&#x27;t mean socially awkward, I mean &quot;unable to regulate emotion like a healthy adult&quot;) and no-one to talk to about it.')
