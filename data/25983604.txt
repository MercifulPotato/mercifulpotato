No-one is saying that infections are driven by Mexican immigrants.<p>Rather they’re pointing out the obvious: if you’re trying to get to <i>zero</i> COVID, all it takes is <i>one</i> person to start the chain. Thus you cannot have ANY illegal immigration.<p>FWIW I strongly oppose the “zero COVID” goal because it’s completely unrealistic. We’ll see if the island nations can maintain it long-term but certainly in the US it’s a non-starter.')
