Code is only valuable when used in the right place on the right data for the right people. Otherwise, it&#x27;s just more meaningless binary floating in the void. A developer&#x27;s particular source isn&#x27;t all that interesting. In theory, with the same idea kernel, another developer could build a similar thing. The only value someone&#x27;s new, closed source project has is that it works <i>right now</i>. That&#x27;s the only leverage in a negotiation.<p>All of these talks over OSS have programmers power-tripping over their supposed influence in the world.')
