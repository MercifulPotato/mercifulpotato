Of course people used their senses to determine the qualities that\nwe measure today with instruments [1] but if something like wine couldn&#x27;t be\nmade to work without today&#x27;s technology, then it would never have been invented\nin the past, when that technology didn&#x27;t exist.<p>It used to be that people stored wine in big clay jars -pithoi (singular pithos)\nand amphorae- when glass bottles were very rare. These would have been sealed\nairtight but the pithoi in particular could take literally tons of wine. I guess\nit would be possible to come up with some complicated procedure to keep a pithos\nalways full to the brim so that the least amount of air would enter, but I\nstruggle to believe that, e.g. ancient Roman taverns, would have a system like\nthat in place.<p>More to the point, my friend&#x27;s dad makes wine (I help pick the grapes most\nyears) and he bottles it with a machine that simply inserts a cork. No inert\ngases. It&#x27;s good wine, too. He sells it to a very successful restaurant owned by\nhis partner. People drink it. I don&#x27;t reckon anyone complains - partly because\nthey get to drink the wine while seated right next to the vineyeard, which I&#x27;m\nsure would improve the taste of even vinegar.<p>Even more to the point, the dad sends me and my friend a few bottles of his red\neach year (we&#x27;re flatmates). We both drink very conservatively so a bottle can\nlast us a month or more even. We just put it in the fridge. I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve\never detected any deterioration in taste. On the other hand I&#x27;m not the person\nwho drinks wine and waxes poetically about tones of banana and caoutchouck etc.<p>The dad&#x27;s wine is a strong red with a hefty tannine kick. Personally I like it\nvery much that way. He also makes white, which I don&#x27;t like much, and a moschato\n(a kind of red aromatic Greek wine) that is delicious. And port, occasionally.\nI&#x27;ve never detected a hint of going-off-ness in any of those that I&#x27;ve drank\neither at my friend&#x27;s house or from a batch sent to us by the dad.<p>So what&#x27;s up? Is my olfactory system simply defective? I know I can detect\ndifferences in acidity between say 6.0 and 5.8 pH, most of the time, so I don&#x27;t\nthink that&#x27;s the case.<p>I don&#x27;t like to make an argument from nature, but it&#x27;s true that the dad makes\nhis wine in a very plain, traditional way, with no additives of any kind, except\nfor some extra yeast in years when the weather is inclement. They even press the\ngrapes manually, or rather by foot (they have a hand-cranked machine to do the\nfirst press, then someone big gets into the big wine bucket thing and steps on\nbags of grapes to squeeze out the last few drops). I&#x27;m aware that industrially\nmade wines sometimes have additives of various sorts. Perhaps these end up\nmaking wine more susceptible to oxidisation and fermentation?<p>________<p>[1] I learned recently a heuristic for yogurt making, from a friend who makes\nyogurt. She says, once the milk is heated to near boiling point, you wait until\nyou can stand keeping your pinky in it while counting up to 9, I think. I reckon\nthe actual number is subjective, you just need a way to have a ballpark figure\nfor the duration. I reckon also you learn the right temperature by feel without\nhaving to count, once you&#x27;ve repeated the process a few times. I found out from\nthe internets that the right temperature is 45 degrees Celsius. I told my friend\nand she didn&#x27;t know that. She just knew when her pinky feels it&#x27;s ready.')
