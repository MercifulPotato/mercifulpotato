I see this kind of response a lot, particularly on the left to people like PG (who I have mixed opinions of) when they have the audacity to write about something they don&#x27;t have qualifications in (such as economics), or when you just don&#x27;t like what he&#x27;s saying on an emotional level. &quot;Oh he thinks he&#x27;s so clever&quot; is just a childish insult, you&#x27;re not refuting his central point. You&#x27;re also second guessing him.<p>&gt; pretending to be a deep thinker:<p>This is just an insult. PG clearly reads more than most and is a thoughtful writer.')
