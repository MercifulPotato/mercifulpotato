No, of course not. it wouldn&#x27;t take a second for you and I to even consider it. No rooms for critical thinking there.<p>What you want people to do, is based on a slow thought process and careful consideration, but nobody have such time.<p>Disinformation agents can just keep spamming us with even more facts to consider since they can make up anything they want. Gish gallop as it were. Verification is slow, even just surface level check to make sure the facts match up.<p>So how did we not become fooled? Because we trust certain authorities and reject other out of hand.')
