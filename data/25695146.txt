Love him, hate him, Trump <i>is</i> the President of the United States and nobody on either side of the political aisle is going to forget that an unaccountable group of people silenced and censored the President of the United States.<p>While this may seem like a victory in the short-term, I do not think the power structure in Washington is going to just going to move on after Trump is out.')
