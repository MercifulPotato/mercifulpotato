It involved applying econometric analysis and doing simple statistical testing on the player data sets.  I realized quickly that knowing how to do statistical testing was only a very small portion of what it took to create value in such a role.  At the time, I didn&#x27;t even know (but learned) SQL.  Everything I wanted to do involved teaming up with a developer, which wasn&#x27;t efficient in a small operation.  So I learned to program.  I continue to enjoy skilling-up, most recently learning cloud-tech to enable me to deploy data tools I develop.<p>The most valuable people in the data chain will be those that can take idea to near-production.  Running ML libraries over clean datasets is overrated.  The fact is, 80% of the value of &quot;Data Science&quot; comes from KPIs and basic stuff.')
