I seriously wonder what the design consideration for the API of the XML decoder in Go was that they thought it was a good idea to simply ignore the stuff which is clearly invalid XML instead of erroring out. If I recall correctly it&#x27;s even invalid XML to have a line break before the xml document declaration. But I guess in Go that would also be valid?<p>These are exactly the kind of gotcha&#x27;s in API&#x27;s and languages that create security issues like these.')
