Item(by='cptskippy', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604513760, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24988891, text='&gt; Renewables are not a panacea and may never be able to power a modern economy as they will probably always require fossil fuel baseload<p>This is completely fallacious.  There will always be outliers but the overwhelming majority of power needs, both residential and commercial, can be addressed with renewable energy and battery solutions.<p>&gt; not to mention that because renewables are a diffuse energy source, they require HUGE land areas which makes no different for CO2 emissions, but makes a huge difference for environmental collapse.<p>Can you cite anything backing that up?  Hydro electric does dramatically impact the environment but other renewable sources have no such impact.  Wind is negligible despite the fanatic ravings of one fat orange lunatic who doesn&#x27;t like it&#x27;s aesthetics.  Solar is easily deployed on rooftops and along transit corridors which has zero impact.  You don&#x27;t have to consolidate all the renewable energy sources in one location.<p>I have a solar array that covers less than half my roof, produces 1.5x my energy needs annually, it stores reserves in a battery, and back-feeds excess into the grid. The cost to operate the array is less than the cost of grid power, and my excess production results in a payout from the power company.<p>The excess production from residential and commercial arrays can be captured and distributed to outliers who are unable to directly leverage renewable energy and completely offset the need for polluting energy sources.')
