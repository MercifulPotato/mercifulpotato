(C.f. boss makes a dollar, I make a dime.) They claim that it&#x27;s unfair that that product of labor goes to the company&#x27;s owners â€” hence, to fix this, leftists want to &quot;seize&quot; or &quot;democratize&quot; the means of production. (Sitenote: this a core tenet of capitalism: value going to owners.)<p>Others would disagree that this is exploitative because they believe that wages should be set by the market.<p>It&#x27;s clear that workers are not compensated for all of the value they produce, and that the excess value goes to owners. The disagreement is whether this is exploitative. Leftists argue that it&#x27;s not fair for owners to capture value without contributing any work. Rightists argue that capital is a scarce (i.e. limited) commodity, so owners deserve to be compensated for providing capital. Who you agree with is up to you to decide.<p>Pg&#x27;s blog post strawmans &quot;exploit&quot; because he uses a different definition of exploit than leftists use. This might be because he misunderstands leftism, but the cynical believe that he is deliberately strawmanning them for his own gain (since pg benefits from capitalism). A more honest blog post would examine whether value going to owners or founders is exploitative or not.')
