It&#x27;s technically not at all standardized, or if so by some private non-officially or only locally recognized institutions. Unlike other languages, say French and German, that are strictly maintained and rules set by an official institution that may even be cross-border (Germany-Austria). These haven&#x27;t been shy to institute bigger changes just to make the written language more coherent.<p>Really this just shows how the British empire managed to spread it&#x27;s word (literally) but not manage to manage it properly. We now have a litany of different English language versions, which is interesting from a cultural perspective but entirely contradicts what a language is made for: communicating.<p>We really ought to start officially standardizing the English language and untangling the current written mess. That way we&#x27;d make 10% of English speaker&#x27;s lives much better...')
