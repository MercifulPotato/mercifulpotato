A new water heater when mine went out. Taking loads to the town dump during spring cleaning. There is always something here to do. Not to mention the times I&#x27;ve been in the store looking at a new TV, lawn mower or anything else that I would like to take home immediately (I realize that delivery exists but the convenience is what a truck provides). I&#x27;ve also had times where I&#x27;ve gone to pick such things up and the local truck rentals were out which is super frustrating.<p>I also don&#x27;t currently own a truck, but a small sedan so all of these recent things I had to wait&#x2F;pay for delivery, borrow a truck, or depend on rentals so I&#x27;m familiar with &quot;truckless&quot; lifestyle and can say I would prefer at the least a beater truck for these tasks, at which point trading my current car would come out equal to a standard truck in that scenario.')
