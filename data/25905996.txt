IME most non-rowers won&#x27;t touch an erg without significant instruction&#x2F;encouragement as they&#x27;re technique dependent.  Any that do will quickly figure out from anyone who has rowed that C2 is the standard and everything else on the market is flaming garbage.<p>Add to this that I could recreate this business using the C2 API in a couple weeks and suddenly have a market of everyone who owns a C2 (all the people in this thread complaining that it doesn&#x27;t support their machine) along with a literal potential customer list available through C2.')
