He didn&#x27;t have a vision or courage to push Microsoft in some other direction, and my impression was that all good things that started under his regime (Azure, more openness) was either reactionary or he simply didn&#x27;t care (most of early open source push was from his lieutenants).<p>At the end of his regime MS lost top-tier tech place (when someone says &quot;big tech&quot; it&#x27;s Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon, not MS), he lost the main Microsoft advantage - an army of Windows programmers. MS under Ballmer lost couple of generations of programmers, to the point where MS needs to ship Linux kernel with Windows just to get cosy with programmers again.<p>Another example of such uninspired CEO that keeps making good quarters but tarnishes his company advantages is Tim Cook. I can&#x27;t wait for him to be replaced.')
