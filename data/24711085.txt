I came to say exactly that. Think a hypothetical of when you&#x27;re a child and your mom has to decide how many cookies your mom gives you and your brother:<p>* Should mom give you equal cookies?<p>* Or should she your brother 2x the cookies because you&#x27;re 5 and he&#x27;s 15 and has 2x the caloric needs?<p>* Or should she give you 10x the cookies because he&#x27;s had so many cookies in his life and you&#x27;ve had comparatively so few?<p>* Or should he give you more cookies because you&#x27;re 1&#x2F;2 his weight and we want to equalize those.<p>* Or maybe she should give you less cookies because you&#x27;re fat for your age and he&#x27;s not.<p>* Or maybe she should give you more cookies because you like them more than he does and would get more out of them.<p>* Or maybe she should give you chips because you&#x27;re allergic to the chocolate in cookies and it would kill you. But what&#x27;s the right chips to cookies ratio that is fair? And what if your brother also wants chips too, but we only have so many cookies and so many chips and him eating chips means less for you and he can eat cookies, so why should he get chips? But if you&#x27;re getting 10 chips, and he&#x27;s getting 0, how is that fair?<p>WTF is &quot;fair&quot;?')
