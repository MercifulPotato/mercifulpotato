Which also means it won&#x27;t accumulate dust inside, assuming the keyboard is hermetic.<p>- it actually feels pretty heavy for its size.<p>- the edges are very sharp. Too sharp. Not cutting sharp, but uncomfortably sharp.<p>- it&#x27;s cold to the touch (except after using the cpu for a while).<p>- leaving it unplugged and sleeping (lid closed) consumes more battery than on a MBP late 2013.')
