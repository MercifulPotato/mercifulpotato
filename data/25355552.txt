The resulting document doesnâ€™t have to be XML, though. I remember being assigned a task of parsing and importing a large XML document into a MySQL database. This was supposed to be done on PHP. I kind of felt repulsed by the idea of writing the parser in PHP (it would have been horrible). So, I used XSLT to transform the document into CSV and then just imported it using LOAD DATA. Worked like a charm.')
