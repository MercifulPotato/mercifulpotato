Anandtech has the A14 within a few percent of the 5950X on single threaded workloads. Power consumption is 5 watts (entire iPhone 12) versus 49 watts (5950X package power).<p>Normalizing for performance (say A14 vs 5950X at 4.5GHz instead of 5GHz) would close the gap somewhat, but it&#x27;s still huge. Perhaps 4x instead of 10x - those last 500MHz on the AMD chip cost a ton of power.<p>Of course, none of this is particularly surprising considering Apple is using both a newer process and gets nearly 60% higher IPC.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.anandtech.com&#x2F;show&#x2F;16226&#x2F;apple-silicon-m1-a14-deep-dive&#x2F;4" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.anandtech.com&#x2F;show&#x2F;16226&#x2F;apple-silicon-m1-a14-de...</a>')
