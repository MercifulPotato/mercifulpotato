This version, and its implications, have been a lingering wondering for me for quite a while. Are you aware of any research on 3-layer networks where the unknown transfer function is also learnable? I suspect such an approach does not result in good models (otherwise we would have known about them!), but I can not articulate why. Where exactly does the K-A reasoning fail when we try to apply it in practice?')
