Nothing else touched it when it comes to balance. Gameplay is debatable, but Id say no other RTS touched it too.<p>Also the author completely omits the thing that made StarCraft Brood War relevant: the map editor with custom games. Those were and still are revolutionary, since they allowed the players to create their own maps with own rules. Things like Turret Defense, or whole MOBA genere came out from custome StarCraft maps. Thousands such maps were made and played by players - the game gave the relatively easy to use map editor that also provided a relatively easy to use (and primitive) programming language. That added to the game&#x27;s longetivity.<p>WarCraft 3 had it too -&gt; the whole DOTA was probably more popular than the game itself.<p>StarCraft 2 didnt have real custom maps - as Blizzard didnt know what to do: they wanted to monetize them, yet didnt, so effectively they killed this mode with their wrong decisions. If SC2 had a decent ability for custom games from the start, the game would be much more relevant today. The whole paragraph about &quot;ladder anxiety&quot; goes away, if you can play custom games all day. As many player in SC1 did. But couldnt in SC2.')
