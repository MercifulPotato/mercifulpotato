(150Hz is 227cm long.)<p>If OP is listening in the nearfield, that dip will be obnoxious.<p>On the other hand, if OP is listening at a distance of two meters, the dip will be LESS obnoxious because there will be dozens of dips and peaks in the response, contributing constructive and destructive interference, simultaneously.<p>This is one of the reasons that loudspeakers are generally measured under two conditions:<p>1) very very close. For instance, a woofer can be measured with the microphone less than a centimeter from the cone<p>2) But the preferred method of getting a full range measurement is to measure the speaker outside, far away from any reflective surfaces.')
