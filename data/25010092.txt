The videos in question had 10&#x27;s of thousands of views but were produced in such large quantity that the sum of all videos was in the millions of views.<p>By law of large numbers even if you educate 95% of the population how to notice when something&#x27;s not right, an exploiter like this can still just keep getting views from the other 5%.<p>And the channel in question was in Vietnam, very likely views were coming from all parts of the world. It&#x27;s not like adding critical thinking to US school curriculum could have stopped this anyway<p>EDIT: Rereading your comment I realize you were talking about how this gets shared at all and the algorithm that&#x27;s used to make these videos recommended. My guess is that the channel had a couple dozen or hundred subscribers, and they maybe did some advertising on r&#x2F;aww or something similar. I don&#x27;t think it would be hard to get the numbers they were getting even if YouTube wasn&#x27;t recommending these videos to anyone at all')
