Item(by='kentonv', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605376113, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25093680, text='That approach -- sending the schema with the message and having the receiving end use it to reconcile version skew -- seems extremely expensive.<p>For it to be a win in terms of message size, the message has to be pretty large, or the schemas have to be negotiated at the start of a session that lasts a while. Maybe it would be a win for some use cases, but there&#x27;s certainly plenty of use cases where the schema would end up much larger than the actual payload.<p>The bigger problem, though, is complexity. Code at the receiving end has to parse the schema, diff it against its own expectations, build the proper tables to translate the message content to the desired version, and then apply that.<p>I admit I haven&#x27;t actually tried building something like this nor have I looked much at Avro&#x27;s implementation, but this all sounds really slow and error-prone to me.')
