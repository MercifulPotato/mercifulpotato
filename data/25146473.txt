Thanks to the team at Tailwind.<p>I migrated a big-ish project to TailwindCSS about a year and a half. I like it for the fact that I can train juniors to be productive and part of the big project quickly while the experienced developers can graduate to using it as a utility for their styles.<p>For those worrying about not being able to work on the type scales, etc. I would suggest trying to use Tailwind as your utility and write your own SCSS.<p>Try this out for your Styles.<p>1. Includes Tailwind CSS.<p>2. Create separate components for repeatedly used set of Tailwind classes. See examples at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;valinorearth&#x2F;valinor.earth&#x2F;tree&#x2F;master&#x2F;src&#x2F;css" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;valinorearth&#x2F;valinor.earth&#x2F;tree&#x2F;master&#x2F;sr...</a><p>This is our Startup&#x27;s website built in the open. A bit overkill but was our attempt to do a multi-lingual Static Site with 11ty + Tailwind + AWS s3 + Cloudfront + Github Actions&#x2F;CI and other interesting toolsets.<p>For instance,<p><pre><code>  .button {\n   @apply inline-block py-2 px-4;\n   @apply no-underline bg-water-600 text-white;\n   @apply border border-water-600 rounded;\n   @apply transition duration-100 ease-in-out transform;\n   @apply leading-tight;\n  }\n\n</code></pre>\nFor any number of team-size, I suggest maintaining design-tokens in the Tailwind Config. Of course, do post-process your styles with the likes of PostCSS — postcss-import, autoprefixer, etc.<p>For those asking for simpler CSS&#x2F;Styles, I believe Tailwind might not be the right one for you. I don’t really write codes these days (quite a few years actually) but I tend to do a lot of marketing landing pages, brochures-types for prospective customers, and throw-away prototypes.<p>These days, I like the plethora of classless CSS available for me to choose from. I might have even created one for our internal use based off the NordTheme color palette (will try extending it with TailWind). Here are some of them for you to start off - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;dbohdan&#x2F;classless-css" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;dbohdan&#x2F;classless-css</a><p>I have come back full circle and now just write in plain CSS for the marketing pages. I was once a purist and started with tools such as Hotdog Professional, Ultradev as an IDE.<p>Tools such as Tailwind has their places and we are standardizing it for all of our websites, customer dashboard, admin, etc. Check out the Tailwind’s own TailwindUI at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tailwindui.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tailwindui.com</a>')
