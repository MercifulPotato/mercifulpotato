Item(by='tomcatfish', descendants=None, kids=[25214882], score=None, time=1606337584, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25211855, text='This isn&#x27;t an ad, I&#x27;m not affiliated with the program.<p>I recently tried <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;obsidian.md" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;obsidian.md</a> and found it really helped me overcome my laziness and take notes down. Another thing I have found that helps is to <i></i>just make the note<i></i> and deal with organization later. I started by making several unconnected notes, but they quickly grow into small graphs.<p>IMPORTANT WARNING: This is not FOSS and has a weird licensing model. You don&#x27;t have to worry about this too much since it just makes markdown files which are easy to move between different note programs. If they do not open-source it, I am feeling fairly optimistic on making my own (if no one beats me to it, in which case I would just want to contribute to theirs).')
