It&#x27;s a crucial intersection for the East Bay so when a tank truck caused a fire that collapsed it, the tender issued provided a massive bonus for each day ahead of projected schedule you achieved.<p>The winner completed it far faster than similar projects, and under projected budget, taking it all in from the bonus. Every day he was slow, he lost money. So the incentives were great, and the winning contractor did a great job. So we have the construction technology and we have the policy technology.<p>But similar projects frequently take forever. Why is that? We know how to make them fast, cheap, and good, clearly. We know how to set up the incentives on a per-task basis so we will do that as well. So I suspect it is because they actually aren&#x27;t crucial. So you sell the buyer (the populace) on the price tag based on the supposed importance, but you actually do the work on the real importance. The gap between the two allows for profit for politically connected contractors like Tutor Perini and also for make-work for powerful groups like construction unions. What we don&#x27;t know is how to set up the incentives such that good per-task incentives will be put in place.<p>In fact, I&#x27;d say that the true importance of any slow project is likely very low. In California, the following projects should not have started:<p>* CA HSR<p>* SF Central Line<p>During their lifetimes they will not yield positive economic utility.')
