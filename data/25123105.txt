Item(by='Traster', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605617339, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25121213, text='I think banning the books is obviously &quot;Bad&quot;, but what it sounds like from reading this article is that this school is incapable of teaching children about these books in a  productive way. If your teachers are so incapable of introducing the material in these books that students end up being subject to racist incidents then maybe we really are better off not having the school teach about the books at all. Obviously the ideal scenario is to teach the books but talk about their context, the issues that are raised and present some material that shows some other sides to the view of race in those books. But in reality, the people who are arguing against the ban are arguing against it on the basis of how they think the book should be taught, not apparently how they are taught.')
