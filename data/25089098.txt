This is not like the AIDS crisis; the medical system was not at risk of collapsing.<p>What of empathy for those who have and will needlessly die alone in tents and hospital hallways and their grieving families who don&#x27;t get to say goodbye?  What of empathy for the medical staff who are working 12, 24, or 36 hour shifts with no end in sight?  What of empathy for those who stock our shelves who are constantly put at risk?  What empathy for an entire generation of children who will have worse educational attainment because they&#x27;re forced to do a year or more of remote school?<p>But sure, let&#x27;s empathize with someone who keeps eating out and refuses to wear a mask.  It&#x27;s not like they could have done anything to mitigate the tragedy that&#x27;s going on, right?')
