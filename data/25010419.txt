Item(by='bigbubba', descendants=None, kids=[25010682], score=None, time=1604691304, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25009907, text='Consider this sentence:  <i>&quot;Covid19 has caused a great loss of life.&quot;</i><p>The word &#x27;great&#x27; is not simply a more emphatic word for &#x27;good&#x27;, though in some contexts it might mean that.  Great Britain isn&#x27;t great because it&#x27;s better than the other Britains, but because it encompasses all of the British Isles.  I think it may also be the case that people are called great when their impact on history seems to have a great scale.  For instance I think Catherine the Great is called great not because she was particularly benevolent (she personally owned half a million people), but because Russia became more powerful and expansive during her reign.')
