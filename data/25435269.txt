A dollar or two would be fine through.<p>My requirements are pretty much being able to make notes with pictures&#x2F;screenshots, search in notes, some basic formatting and that it can sync between devices (Android app), but nothing fancy extra on top of that.<p>Does anyone have any good alternatives to suggest here?')
