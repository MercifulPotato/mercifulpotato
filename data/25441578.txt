I&#x27;m a 100% time tabbed Sway user. I love the simplicity, lightness, and Wayland frame-for-frame correctness of Sway, but without having to do all the tiling stuff. I prefer all windows to be maximized all the time ala GNOME Shell.<p>For the uninformed, use Mod-W to switch windows to tabbed mode in Sway&#x2F;i3. You can also organize virtual desktops in &quot;workspaces.&quot; I keep web&#x2F;music on workspace 1, terminals and IDEs on workspace 2, and email&#x2F;msteams&#x2F;office on workspace 3.')
