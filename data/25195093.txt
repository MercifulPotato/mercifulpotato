In most developed countries you don&#x27;t have to worry about turning up to a hospital, for pregnancy or any reason. When a pregnant woman turns up to hospital in the UK (for example) she is absolutely not stressed about the potential cost of the care. If something goes wrong, she gets world class care at no cost to her. If some other medical problem is discovered while she&#x27;s there, it will be diagnosed and treated and she doesn&#x27;t have to stress about the cost.<p>Not so in the US. It would be surprising if that alone didn&#x27;t account for a significant number of adverse outcomes.')
