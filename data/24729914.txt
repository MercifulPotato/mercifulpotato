But they&#x27;re not. They&#x27;re pushing for narrow financial regulation. There&#x27;s no principled reason to think they&#x27;re doing this in furtherance of their personal politics, as opposed to, say, making their customers&#x27; lives easier.<p>As such, I don&#x27;t see the hypocrisy. Now, I&#x27;d be more inclined to agree if the &quot;politics ban&quot; covered activism around crypto policy issues. But of course, then management&#x27;s position is very easy to see. They hired developers to implement their vision, not to fight it.')
