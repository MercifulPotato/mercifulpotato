Perhaps with enough time and coercion I&#x27;ll find a reason to use it.<p>Or just don&#x27;t? Its like the validity of Rust is dependent on wether you use it or not. Try a different tone, and change a mindset from where yourself have to acknowledge&#x2F;use&#x2F;like something for it to be valid. If a fact based discussion about this is to be had you need to stop shoving your anecdotes and personal likings in the way. Its impossible for people to know whether Rust is right for you, and thats a pretty boring discussion by itself.<p>I&#x27;ve never moved past reading the rust docs, but I understand why people react on your comments.')
