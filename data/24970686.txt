There&#x27;s no display, so that &quot;everywhere&quot; is restricted to places that have an HDMI display just hanging out. Which is then a vanishingly small number of places. And since we&#x27;re talking about kids - places with a front panel HDMI port, which is even rarer. Or you have to pair it with a portable monitor, in which case you spent as much as an entry level laptop and got something worse in return.<p>This is a cute little toy, and I want one, but that&#x27;s all it is - a toy. Same as all the RPI&#x27;s before. Good intro to hobby electronics programming with the GPIO, but not a disruptive entry-level computing experience, either. That place remains in the realm of the ultra-budget laptops, as they require <i>no</i> existing infrastructure.')
