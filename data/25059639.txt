On the other end you have completely static languages like ML where the compiler knows all and it&#x27;s very difficult to escape its all-seeing gaze.<p>And then there&#x27;s this huge gulf in the middle where the language <i>leans</i> in one direction or the other, but programmer discipline is perhaps even more important. Python code that&#x27;s scrupulous about type hinting and doesn&#x27;t go hog-wild with the metaprogramming, for example, can be easier to refactor safely and with the support of tools than Java code that makes heavy use of reflection might be.<p>Source: I currently work with, and occasionally have to refactor, examples of both.')
