That means they are very good at snooping, on the other hand if I just bought a TV set then that doesn&#x27;t mean that i would need another one soon.<p>Funny that Goole&#x2F;Facebook currently don&#x27;t seem to be running ads for complements of products too often; Amazon is better at that (if you bought this book, then you might also want this one).')
