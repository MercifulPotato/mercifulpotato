But today, programming are becoming more social and open, and a lot of &quot;extrovert&quot; things are happening (especially in GitHub and others). There are many beginners today who want to be a programmer in the same reason why many people who want to be a rock star: to get noticed. In this situation, it becomes a kind of competition; People start gaming the system. But it only becomes a problem when you&#x27;re in the same competition with others. There are still people, I hope, who just follow their passion and inner aesthetics and keep producing ever strange software (TempleOS comes to mind, I guess), just like music and other forms of arts. Overall, I don&#x27;t think the current trend is that much concerning. There will be the Nickelback of Open source (I don&#x27;t really know the band well but I keep hearing their music being very generic while they&#x27;re making a lot of money), but we should keep searching and appreciating small artists. It can be balanced.')
