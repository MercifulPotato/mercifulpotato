I don&#x27;t know that their opponents were arguing that algorithms &quot;aren&#x27;t biased&quot; as much as for a clearer understanding of what is meant by the claim &quot;algorithms are biased&quot; because there&#x27;s no obvious definition for &quot;bias&quot; that lends itself to the conclusion that algorithms will always be more bias (or &quot;worsely biased&quot; in case that&#x27;s not the same as &quot;more bias&quot;) than people. The latter camp specifically argued that algorithms aren&#x27;t inherently biased, but rather they &quot;inherit&quot; any biases encoded in the training data, and thus the &quot;algorithms are biased&quot; group would do well to frame their concerns in terms of concerns about training data sets and focus on how we can mitigate those concerns.<p>Over time, as is often the case with healthy debate, the &quot;algorithms are biased&quot; people <i>did</i> start to frame their concerns this way and now we have robust and productive conversations about ethically training algorithms (instead of a strict prohibition on algorithms). This is strictly a good outcome, except that some people are misremembering the argument as one group arguing that &quot;algorithms can&#x27;t be biased&quot; in any sense of the phrase (although I&#x27;m sure there are some fringe few people for whom that&#x27;s true as well, but as you point out, that was never a prominent position) and we forget that the &quot;algorithms are biased&quot; people weren&#x27;t always making the nuanced arguments that they&#x27;ve been pushed to make today.')
