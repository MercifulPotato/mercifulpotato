More energy, lighter on my feet, less depressed.<p>This is a well-known phenomenon, believe it or not. Acute sleep deprivation has a strong anti-depressant effect in people suffering from depression. It can even trigger hypomanic or manic episodes in people who have bipolar disorder. Scientific American wrote a nice article about it several years ago: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scientificamerican.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;why-sleep-deprivation-eases-depression&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scientificamerican.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;why-sleep-depriva...</a><p>As you noticed, the effect is completely unsustainable. Chronic sleep deprivation will worsen depression, not improve it.<p>There has been some research into using acute sleep deprivation to kick-start treatment with traditional antidepressant medication. Results are mixed, but it can help some patients cope until the antidepressants start working.<p>There is also some [very] weak evidence that advancing your sleep phase (going to bed earlier, waking up earlier) can stabilize the acute antidepressant effects for a couple of days: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;12799743&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;12799743&#x2F;</a><p>Long term, treating the underlying depression with traditional methods (CBT, bright light therapy, exercise, antidepressant medications) is the only sustainable solution for most people.')
