It&#x27;s riskier to copy the media periodically as you might increase the chances of data corruption due to the fault in the copying process (faulty RAM, faulty software, not concentrating good enough etc). You periodically introduce possibility of user&#x2F;hardware&#x2F;software errors to the longevity of your backups.<p>Also, when others inherit the media they may not have proper equipment or skill to do it themselves as goal of the preservation is to get it 100 years ahead, not keep it always in a usable state per se. For example, I&#x27;d like my children to keep my backups until my grandchildren could access them 60 years later.')
