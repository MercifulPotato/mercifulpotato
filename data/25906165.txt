EXTRABACON was the codename for the SNMP exploit using a buffer overflow.<p>This was an interesting excercise because there were NO logs of this happening on the Cisco ASA, not even when ramping every loglevel to debug. Well only on the console port. Exception in readline() or something like it. Doing stuff for security monitoring in daily life this ehm was alarming, but not unexpected. Fixing “No logs” is often a challenge for blue teams.<p>Anyway it was alarming enough to find and read through the Common Criteria EAL4+ certification docs for the Cisco ASA only to find that SNMP was excluded from certification scope. I still have the idea in the back of my head to explore scope exclusions in other certification docs for other unfortunate exclusions.<p>Also the lack of mitigations like stack canaries, ASLR or others was quite surprising for a certified black box security device on the network perimeter.')
