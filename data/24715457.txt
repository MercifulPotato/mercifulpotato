They would contact high school women who were very good in STEM subjects and their parents, and send someone to visit them and try to convince them that Caltech was the place to be.<p>Once they applied, gender wasn&#x27;t a factor in deciding whether or not to admit them.<p>The top tech companies could do something similar for both race and gender. They have the resources to draw from the entire country. It wouldn&#x27;t work so well for companies that only have the resources to recruit locally.')
