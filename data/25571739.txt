The stomach turning aspect of real violence&#x2F;torture&#x2F;murder&#x2F;rape is its bland mundane banal nature. No dramatic music, no redemption, no happy end, no heroism. So raw.<p>I&#x27;ve seen quite some real gore online, similar to many online people. I don&#x27;t know how it affects my psychology. I like to think it has at least some positive effects, like not fainting and less of a shock if I need to act in such a situation. But maybe real world violence seen through my eyeballs not through a screen is a whole another thing again. Maybe hearing and seeing real abuse is not something you can &quot;prepare for&quot; through gore videos.')
