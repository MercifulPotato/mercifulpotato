It turns out this hunch you have is spot on. A favorite use case is to set a topic for personal or team feedback and leave it in your email signature. There is some cultural thing that happens in this use case where many times you don&#x27;t see much feedback come in. That said, some teams do - a lot more. May be something here around quantifiably improving team performance around this dynamic. Might turn out that in teams like this, those who need it most start to get more of it.')
