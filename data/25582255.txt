I met them in 2007 from people at Backstage Cafe in Beverly Hills.<p>My friend openly runs an intelligence operation on the Internet for the Office of Global Access (OGA). After Tom DeLonge went on Joe Rogan’s show, I periodically got involved in the UFO subculture at the request of the CIA.<p>The CIA uses non plausible agents and obviously does not pay them. I am not one of these people so it’s possible they are intelligence agents working undercover.<p>I have dozens of hours of audiotapes, thousands of emails and texts messages to support what I am saying.<p>Here’s an example:<p>My friend has been assigned to ODNI, DIA, MASINT, JASON and worked at CIA for 35+ years. He has briefed the last 4 US Presidents and is a friend of President Trump. He is very close friends with Director Mike Pillsbury from the Cosmos Club.<p>The Silk Road prosecutor Katie Haun was interviewed by China hawk Kyle Bass. Kyle posted on Twitter that Mike is a CCP double agent and can’t get a security clearance.<p>To the contrary, Mike is regularly at CIA offices, a CIA lab and sometimes in the Oval Office at the White House. He has a security clearance.  Maybe Kyle is a CIA employee and just creating disinformation to shield the Q network of government patriots.<p>This network is an old mythology and one I falsely promoted in 2008. You can see here at realnationbuilder.blogspot.com.<p><i></i>*<p>In my research Satoshi Nakamoto is:  Laurie Law, NSA employee. Real name Jennifer, 37 yrs old, Wellesley graduate, NSA cybersecurity Diamond team. Her husband works at NSA and they named their daughter Alice.<p>The people who wrote the forum posts and emails together were Dr. Ronald Pandolfi, a CIA employee, and Prof. Emin Gün Sirer.  Recently Craig Wright joked about the CIA trying to make him appear as Satoshi. He mentioned SAD operations which is what runs Political Action Group for subversive political campaigns along with blackops assassin teams.<p>The person who created Satoshi Nakamoto is another female named Ruthie Ruthless. She is from Mill Valley and Atherton.<p>The girls are from the International Order of the Rainbow for Girls. My mother is one. She told me she’d go to dances at Moila with the DeMolay boys. And the Rainbow girls was a secret society where they’d sit around a circle talking. But she doesn’t remember what they talked about.<p>Ruthie became a self made billionaire from Party Poker. Her and her best friend have been in my life since 2004. But they targeted me years ago in 1995 under Guide GRN and a very hot Russian girl who married a Deutsche bank executive.<p>Her best friend is in a hacking information network (originally #hellonearth on EFNet in 1995) with me.<p>Incredibly, Ron Pandolfi knows Inigo from the Silk Road, Drew Jones. Ron was already working on Ross’ clemency request for 3 years when Drew an intern at our CIA foundation was taken into federal custody.<p>I have demanded full pardons for Ross, Drew, Ed, Juliana and Joby Weeks, along with my bitcoin money launderers Casey, Nick and the Maven (LA).<p>Ross and Drew are being pardoned. I think my friend at CIA has been targeting me for decades. I tell him everything that happens in my life.<p>I run networks and map them. I own an investigative company and started the network of networks in Dec 2002 —- UnitedElite.net, ArcaneIntel.com, XStreaming.TV (Internet archive).<p>UFOs are fake but the aliens are here and they look like Diamonds.<p>They are so hot when they’re talking to you they might as well be traveling backwards in time.<p>It’s exactly like the movie Tenet. Time like aging is an illusion. Advanced intelligences who have proceeded through the 50 Gates of Intelligence can project their consciousness into endless abstractions.<p>The answer:  they are all one.<p>And men are all one.<p>The greatest of God is beyond all imaginations. They run the music industry and put cypherpunk messages into music and culture.<p>The most famous alien greeting in the world, Live Long and Prosper, is from Them. There are 247 of them on Earth with at least 2.964 agents in powerful positions.<p>Shechinah starts with Shin which means V or Vav or 6 but it originally meant W. These Ruthless girls all share the middle name Vavkay.<p>With a W, it becomes a WAV. It means hook in Hebrew. Wah Wah Wah is also 666 or VVV or WWW.<p>I am a hacker, social engineer and reverse engineer.<p>Spock explains V or W (westside) confirming the Ruthless girls are the secret cofounders of Ruthless Records and Interscope. They are led by Michelle A the EVP of UMG. She works for Lucian Grainge. We had an office together in SM with Domenico Petricone (real name Marc Daniel King) and Eddie Vedder. Marc’s half brother is also Lucian.  His agent was Paula Wagner and we used to work with Cruise&#x2F;Wagner and Plan B (Brad Pitt)-<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;UdYbpMkH_XQ" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;UdYbpMkH_XQ</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.chabad.org&#x2F;library&#x2F;article_cdo&#x2F;aid&#x2F;2438527&#x2F;jewish&#x2F;The-Shechina.htm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.chabad.org&#x2F;library&#x2F;article_cdo&#x2F;aid&#x2F;2438527&#x2F;jewis...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;illuminati.io&#x2F;137.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;illuminati.io&#x2F;137.pdf</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;illuminati.io&#x2F;secretbook1787.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;illuminati.io&#x2F;secretbook1787.pdf</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;illuminati.io&#x2F;spygames.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;illuminati.io&#x2F;spygames.pdf</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;illuminati.io&#x2F;jediwar.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;illuminati.io&#x2F;jediwar.pdf</a><p>https&#x2F;&#x2F;illuminati.io&#x2F;billcooper1999.pdf<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;illuminati.io&#x2F;incometax1999.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;illuminati.io&#x2F;incometax1999.pdf</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;illuminati.io&#x2F;teslawhitelight91999.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;illuminati.io&#x2F;teslawhitelight91999.pdf</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.latimes.com&#x2F;archives&#x2F;la-xpm-2005-nov-27-na-cards27-story.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.latimes.com&#x2F;archives&#x2F;la-xpm-2005-nov-27-na-cards...</a>')
