I didn&#x27;t look into the course materials, but I wonder if someone learning &quot;how computers work&quot; would benefit from a casual introduction to a simple microprocessor hardware architecture.<p>For me, it was the Z80, because there happened to be a book at Radio Shack, published by Howard Sams, that was extremely well written. But since this is about x86 assembly, the old 8086 isn&#x27;t <i>all that bad</i> in terms of grasping how the different kinds of instructions actually play out in the registers, memory and i&#x2F;o busses, and so forth. And it&#x27;s not so bad to learn about the features of modern processors in light of how they compare to early chips. For instance in the 8086, a pointer is not an abstract concept, but a real physical thing!<p>Despite modern microcontrollers being much more sophisticated than the Z80, that foundation has helped me learn and understand things like how to read the documentation for special function registers and advanced peripheral chips.')
