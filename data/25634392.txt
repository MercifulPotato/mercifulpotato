I haven&#x27;t used Facebook in over 6 years and don&#x27;t intend to. Everything Facebook is piholed on my network. But I&#x27;m glad they&#x27;re starting to kick out trash content producers.<p>And yeah, like others have said, if you spend ~$60M on Facebook ads (among others), I don&#x27;t think you can call yourself a small business. This is like those 6 year old companies that still consider themselves startups.<p>If you make enough revenue from content farms to spend that much on ads AND getting kicked off of Facebook jeopardizes your &quot;business&quot; that much, I&#x27;m gonna assume you engage in some dark patterns to collect&#x2F;sell data of your visitors, or to place ads in shady ways, or some form of SEO pollution. At the very least, you run native ads disguised as content. I wouldn&#x27;t want to have any business with you either.')
