Large electric boilers &#x2F; hvac heaters etc and appliances like washing machines and refrigerators use 240v.<p>However, it&#x27;s important to note that for those claiming &quot;oh just use a heat pump&quot; that simply is not an option for high density residences or high rise buildings.  Also, the efficiency of heating water with electric heating elements does NOT improve with scale, hence forcing buildings to purchase enormous electric boilers will again, just increase energy consumption AND net carbon emissions.  But god knows that in CA, the gov&#x27;t will just use tax payer money to pay rich developers and building owners to replace multimillion dollar hvac equipment (because &quot;muh environmental impact&quot;).')
