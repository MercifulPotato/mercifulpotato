As a business owner I can claim back the VAT, but the import duties are a non-trivial and non-recoverable extra.<p>If buy a synthesizer from Thomann in the EU, I can also claim back the VAT. And there are no import duties - at least until January 2021 in the UK.<p>So the final cost for a UK business buyer is 20% less than the nominal price.<p>Does the US charge import tariffs on these items? I have no idea. But if it does, that would explain some of the differences.<p>And it usually works the other way. The standard price in pounds for US tech sold in the UK is 1:1 with the US dollar price.<p>The base iPhone 12 Pro Max is $1099 in the US. In the UK it&#x27;s £1099, which is more than $1400. Even without VAT it&#x27;s more than $1200.<p>In Spain it&#x27;s €1259, which is closer to $1500.')
