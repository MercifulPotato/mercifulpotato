Item(by='foldr', descendants=None, kids=[24717967], score=None, time=1602152968, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24717715, text='The article says the following. &quot;Trained logicians should know that semantic meaning is arbitrary...Abortion is the canonical example of [a semantic] argument: once you have decided what &#x27;life&#x27; is, there’s really not much else to discuss. It’s not a political argument, not even in theory.  It’s purely a semantic one.&quot;<p>So the author does seem to be saying that the whole abortion debate is purely a debate over arbitrary definitions, not merely that it&#x27;s important to clear up semantic issues before getting into the meat of the debate.<p>If the issue were purely semantic, it would be possible to resolve the debate simply by introducing unambigious terminology agreed on by both sides (e.g. using &#x27;alive*&#x27; and &#x27;alive†&#x27; rather than &#x27;alive&#x27;). If this doesn&#x27;t satisfy both sides, then they aren&#x27;t really disagreeing over the meaning of the word &#x27;life&#x27;, they&#x27;re disagreeing over the nature or essence of life itself. Informally we can say that they disagree over what it means to be alive. But philosophically it&#x27;s important to be clear that this isn&#x27;t just a semantic issue about the meaning of a particular word.<p>Another way to bring this out is to think cross-linguistically. Do we really have to have the abortion debate over again for every one of the world&#x27;s ~6500 languages and their corresponding words for &#x27;life&#x27;? I think not, because at heart the debate isn&#x27;t a debate over word meaning.')
