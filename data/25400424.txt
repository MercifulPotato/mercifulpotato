This is true even of things like music and art.  Not saying you _will_ be able to do it for a living, but it is normal that if you&#x27;re interested in X for its own sake, you would at least investigate whether you could make that your full time job.<p>Now, in regards to things like an IPO specifically, I think it would depend on whether or not you need a lot of other people to help you get X done.  If you need to hire a lot of other people, then you might need an investment in order to do that if you cannot rely on getting that many volunteers.  And in that case, to get the investment, there probably has to be the prospect of an IPO.<p>My observed experience is that trying to get grants for something, is not materially easier or less political than trying to get investments to fund it.')
