So far as I can tell, the tree-notation thing is a declarative DSL for grammars and textual &quot;compilers&quot;, like maybe a very simplified ANTLR? Dumbdown is a ~100 line example, so even if it&#x27;s not useful as a &quot;real&quot; format, it does seem illustrative of the tooling. And that tooling makes me think ... maybe we would have been better off if markdown (and extensions like GH-flavored markdown) had been implemented and shared as declarations in a language-description DSL.')
