The point that 538 have tried repeatedly to make is that firstly: if you&#x27;re conservative in your level of confidence you&#x27;ll give a higher likelihood to outliers, and secondly: It&#x27;s not particularly useful to focus on whether X has a 3% or 4% chance.<p>If Trump wins California, we aren&#x27;t going to be talking about whether the chance was 3% or 0.3% we&#x27;re going to be talking about that Nuclear explosion that wiped out 25million Californians.<p>For the same logic the reason that Trump winning Alaska given winning New Jersey is lower than given losing New Jersy is because your sample size is rubbish. The chance of Trump winning Alaska given losing New Jersey is an accurate number, the number of Trump winning Alaska given winning New Jersey is like saying &quot;How likely is it Trump wins Alaska given the UK gains US statehood&quot; it&#x27;s like.... well... if that happens then we&#x27;re so far outside of what the model thinks can happen then you should be that we&#x27;re just gonna say it&#x27;s 50:50 - because who the hell knows.<p>It&#x27;s not like saying &quot;Oh well if X swing state goes blue, Y will probably follow&quot;, the scenarios in this article are so bizarre that the model should rightly be very cautious and probably default to either refusing to give an answer or just default to 50:50 or the same probably ignoring that data. The implicit bias in this analysis seems to be that if NJ went Red that would be because Trump won by a big margin, but that&#x27;s not a likely enough scenario to actually get numbers for, and is so unlikely that things like &quot;The supreme court threw out all the ballots for inner city areas&quot; start to become valid possibilities.')
