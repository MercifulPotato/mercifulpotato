I can&#x27;t speak for everyone, but I&#x27;m also not comfortable being that close to an animal from random people, especially ones that have proven they can be dangerous.<p>If I was encountering a service animal every once in a while from a disabled person, it might be okay.  But it feels like everyone other person has one, and I have no idea what the owner or trainer is like and that raises the risk profile quite a bit.<p>There&#x27;s a very high likelihood that the same people that ignore leash laws are on flights with an animal in close quarters to me.')
