Here&#x27;s a relevant quote from him about tolerance:<p>&gt;  If we extend unlimited tolerance even to those who are intolerant, if we are not prepared to defend a tolerant society against the onslaught of the intolerant, then the tolerant will be destroyed, and tolerance with them.â€”In this formulation, <i>I do not imply, for instance, that we should always suppress the utterance of intolerant philosophies</i>; as long as we can counter them by rational argument and keep them in check by public opinion, suppression would certainly be most unwise. But we should claim the right to suppress them if necessary even by force; for it may easily turn out that they are not prepared to meet us on the level of rational argument, but begin by denouncing all argument; they may forbid their followers to listen to rational argument, because it is deceptive, and teach them to answer arguments by the use of their fists or pistols.<p>I think it&#x27;s safe to say that the extent of censorship perpetrated by the big tech is <i>not</i> limited to the voices that teach others to &quot;answer arguments by the use of their fists or pistols&quot;. They of course ban some of that too, but they ban <i>quite a lot more</i>.')
