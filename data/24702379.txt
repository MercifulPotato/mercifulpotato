In order to do that we needed a good reason why all the other project maintainers would want to spend time discussing a feature with us. Wayland is the future, yes, but currently a lot of users are still on X which makes our argument much less convincing. Now we can say that touchpad gestures will soon be available everywhere and get their attention this way.<p>I agree that X is legacy platform. Unfortunately it may still be used for quite some time. Core functionality such as screenshots and input record&#x2F;replay is not universally available on Wayland. So X will still be used for significant amount of time.<p>Please tell me what else I could explain to increase the transparency of the project and I&#x27;ll try my best to do so. Thanks!')
