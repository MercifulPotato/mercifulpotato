I’ve seen people who work like that. Copy-paste a bunch of stuff that they don’t understand and betting that the people that read it don’t understand or don’t care either. And worse yet it turns out that often they are right. No one cares anyway. So the people that do this get away with it. And the people that do care are spending their time writing stuff that in the end most other people that don’t care aren’t even going to give more than a cursory glance anyways.')
