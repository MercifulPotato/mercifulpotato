Initially I was annoyed about this; there were efforts to run Ruby on .NET via IronRuby and thus get a nice rails-on-windows environment, and ASP.NET MVC came along and sucked all the wind out of that like a tent collapsing. Controllers, Views, Routing are all the same, and like rails can be reconfigured if you prefer.<p>Later on though, I’m happy with it. A new blank project doesn’t quite have all that stuff, but you can add the postgres driver, migrations, etc with a few lines of code.<p>You do lose out on all the more advanced Ruby meta-magic things that rails does like with_scope on ActiveRecord, but in exchange you get a 1000x performance boost, and static typing - especially now with null safety in C#8 is really helpful as your codebase grows. The productivity hit you take compared to rails is actually pretty minimal I think, and those other benefits outweigh that and some. I would chose ASP.NET core over rails for any web project at any time these days<p>Good luck!')
