With tabs it’s right there where I left it. Same scroll state, same visual content. Why go through the hassle of bookmarking if tabs are already built in and work well?<p>With bookmarks you lose so much important context. Our minds just don’t work well on lists of links<p>As I said it’s important the OS works the same way. I always have on the left most space my utility window for example with messengers and mail tabs open<p>I always have localhost for development for each project on the left most tab followed by the most common docs and tickets I need throughout the project. And then over time I build up tabs to the right. And naturally the ones in the far right are the latest ones so when I come back to the project that often helps recalling what was done last<p>And if it becomes too much and the tabs are still relevant then I just extract the middle part between localhost+docs on the one side and the latest research on the right and out it in its own window in the background<p>So essentially I use all the dimensions there are:<p>- within the tabs there is an order<p>- within the space there is an order (left half, right half on 34” wide screen)<p>- in depth there is an order (windows all the way to the back are the oldest and will be culled from time to time)<p>- and then there is the spaces themselves which are mainly for different projects')
