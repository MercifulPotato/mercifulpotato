They need to get better at weeding out fake&#x2F;scammy listings, that tend to plague many online marketplaces where things can be listed for free. Maybe some in-person verification system, or a fee that gets refunded if you have a certain number of guests. There are plenty of listings with huge&#x2F;exclusive homes, yet no reviews and extremely cheap prices. I don&#x27;t know what people get out of these listings, but it&#x27;s really weird and makes the user doubtful about the authenticity of the marketplace.')
