They do sell our &quot;private&quot; data, they do foster bad behaviors in humans. They monopolized whole industries and cemented bad ideas everywhere.<p>But if we would assess them overall - they indeed has changed the world for the better (in my opinion). The communication benefits provided by them to humanity is immense. Nokia&#x27;s slogan - &quot;connecting people&quot; is the important thing, which force accelerated a lot of things on the planet.\nYeah, maybe in some other timeline different companies may have done it better, but we are not debating hypothetical, we just observe what has already happened.')
