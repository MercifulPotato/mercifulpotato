In these type of situations, they are either lending at negative interest rate from the central bank, or they are paying interest to central bank for &quot;safekeeping&quot; (central bank is at negative interest rate) or consumers are keeping money in banks at negative interest rate (less likely).<p>What makes money for the bank is the difference of interest rate between money they buy and money they sell. Whether one or both are negative or positive doesn&#x27;t really matter. Relative difference is what matters.')
