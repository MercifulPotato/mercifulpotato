I&#x27;m not saying that it&#x27;s appropriate to be completely blind&#x2F;unaware of what you&#x27;re using, but there&#x27;s a line somewhere that&#x27;s surprisingly difficult to draw in 2020.<p>I don&#x27;t think anyone would argue that learning more is a bad thing. But the more salient point is that for many, it&#x27;s just not necessary.<p>If you&#x27;re doing work that requires a deeper knowledge of the thing, then of course you should learn it. If you&#x27;re not doing work that requires this knowledge, it&#x27;d be a waste of time, the most precious commodity available to us.<p>Others have made the comparison to learning assembly. Useful? sure. Necessary in 2020? Usually not.<p>&gt; <i>It isn’t rocket science. I literally explained it in one sentence, and I’ve never used docker in my life.</i><p>This is what you said:<p>&gt; <i>... if docker ran “natively” it’d mean using kernel hooks provided by xnu, which means you’d be able to run another instance of macOS in a container.</i><p>Not only does this tell the reader nothing practical about how Docker actually works, it doesn&#x27;t even address the parent comment in a useful&#x2F;informative way.<p>You followed this up with a statement that is a borderline personal attack on the parent comment.<p>I mean this as constructively as possible, but you need to work on your delivery, and ask yourself what you&#x27;re trying to accomplish with these comments. So far, they&#x27;ve been unhelpful and borderline abusive.')
