But I must say, he asked for a protest, not for them to storm the Capital.  He probably wanted to stir it up, but never thought it would go that far.  I have not seen any explicit tweets where he asked for that.<p>The other thing I want to mention (in demonstrating the two standards) is that the dem leadership cheered on protests in the summer  with battle like language which turned into far larger and more consequential riots that somehow we dont talk about anymore.  Many lost their livelihoods and some their lives.  These went on for months, not 6 hours.   Those riots by the way were encouraged by dem leadership but somehow have not been penalized on twitter or even critiqued. The unlevel playing field that essentially a cartel is laying out which we see time and time again is what people are getting fed up with and I can sympathize.<p>mullingitover - You might be correct that the claims were hyperbole.  But I don&#x27;t see a difference between the two sides in falsely justifying a protest that turned into a riot.  For instance, the police brutality is not acceptable (and the imagery was terrible), but it was also mostly an astroturf and amplification of reality before an election to rally voters when you actually look at the FBI statistics of racial deaths in the hands of police.  Both sides encouraged protests with battle like language.  They both turned into destructive riots. One side was penalized.')
