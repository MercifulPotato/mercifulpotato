Drag and drop could cause all sorts of compatibility issues if you try very hard to generalize, sure.<p>I wrote my own as well, not in 100-200 lines granted. Dependency free ~300-400sloc using basic mouse events and element calculations were enough to implement advanced behaviors such as snapping, collision detection, free movement, packing, swapping, containerization. I had lots of freedom on how it behaves and was able to tweak it to what I wanted, something probably impossible with general dnd libraries. It works the same in most modern browsers I&#x27;ve tested, since it&#x27;s only using DOM apis for basic events and style modification.<p>Libraries are great if you need established algorithms and data structures. Building out custom UX interactions, presumably like interacting with DOM objects, DIY was easier since there&#x27;s actually very little work to do.')
