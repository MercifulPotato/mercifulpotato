It also added an extra cognitive step on each card to have to consider it, which over time was an annoyance.<p>I don&#x27;t have any scientific proof that judging response time is better than self-reporting, but my thinking is self-reporting accuracy is low enough and forgetting curve is approximate enough for each card that in aggregate it doesn&#x27;t make a huge difference. It would be interesting to have real scientific tests, but I think it would be difficult to set up.<p>I considered adding a way to self-report your score, but it didn&#x27;t make the MVP and I&#x27;m really trying to target less technical users and not people who are already familiar with Anki. I might add it one day as an option since the underlying design of app can handle it.')
