There is a whole specter of opinions.<p>Between &quot;I support what facebook did&quot; and &quot;I do not support what facebook did&quot;, or &quot;I support Trump&quot; vs &quot;I hate Trump&quot;. if I were to take a side right now I would not be able to. Regardless I find it interesting, much of the discussion I&#x27;ve heard in the last 24h is very interesting to me.<p>FWIW I am not American nor do I live in the USA.')
