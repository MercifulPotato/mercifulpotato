Going from zero humans on mars to 100’s of millions is a massive bootstrap problem with minimal incentive for the the people involved or the multiple years worth of earth’s GDP to get to that point.<p>It’s like the “self replicating” 3D printers where they can produce 98% of the structure by weight and approximately 0.001% by complexity.  A base that’s producing it’s own food is doable, shipping machines to say build solar panels or a specific chip isn’t a problem.<p>However, even just the effort to figure out a minimal slice of earth’s technology to be self significant is hard.  Aka building even a single type of LCD requires a massive number of different components, and the ability to build all the machines to make those components, and machines to make those machines, ... Now realize that’s just for an LCD, manufacturing every type of Medicine is a whole other list.<p>Finally you need to accept everyone on Mars living in relative poverty for generations due to the inefficiencies involved.')
