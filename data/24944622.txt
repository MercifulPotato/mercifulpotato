Rattlesnakes sure as shit know they can&#x27;t eat humans and would never attempt it.  They are named for the mechanism they use to scare us away and bite when that fails.  A huge number of rattlesnake bites are to the face or hands because it happens when some moron ignores the rattle and picks up the snake.<p>Wolves, unlike rattlesnakes do <i>sometimes</i> deliberately attack humans with &#x27;malicious&#x27; intent.  Rattlesnakes never do.')
