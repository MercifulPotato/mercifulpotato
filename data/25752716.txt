(Edit: by which I mean I think emacdona was talking about the protocol in general, and if you meant to object to that admittedly-debateable choice of focus, you should probably explicitly point out the distinction between the protocol (that anyone can use) and the canonical system (that is run by (tautologically) malicious corporations).)<p>0: Although it could use some cryptographic additions for better security, and it has problems with global uniqueness in the face of malicious actors pushing records to the effect of &quot;sci-hub.org IN A some.fbi.ip.addr&quot;. But if you can find a trustworthy (possibly-suffix-indexed collection of) root server to start from, the protocol itself works fine.')
