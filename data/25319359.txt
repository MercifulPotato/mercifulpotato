I made myself an old fashion and watched Citizen Kane tonight, and I have to agree with your review. It&#x27;s a fine piece of art, certainly well produced for the time, but frankly I just didn&#x27;t really get into the story. It doesn&#x27;t feel like a cohesive whole.<p>The prologue was so long and on the nose that it was pretty clear from the get go that rosebud was (spoiler alert!) the sled, and then I felt the rest of the movie was just an overly pretentious attempt to convey that it doesn&#x27;t matter how rich you are if you never get to have your childhood, or something.<p>I quite enjoyed Welles performance though, and in fact I quite enjoyed the performance of most of the characters, especially Bernstein and Leland. The scenes when they arrive at the inquirer we&#x27;re brilliant.<p>Well, I&#x27;m glad to have finally seen this movie but – fully appreciating that I probably have no clue what I&#x27;m talking about – I wouldn&#x27;t place it in my top 10 favorite movies. Probably not even top 100 to be honest.')
