Being able to take a step back - even if only a bit at first - and see that we are all quite often over-reacting, or responding in ways that are inbuilt &#x2F; learnt - is a really good starting point IMO.<p>I&#x27;ve been interested in how quickly this comes about. I&#x27;m not claiming to be any kind of guru (I&#x27;m about a decade into a fairly irregular practice and maybe 2-3 years into something more routine&#x2F;structured) but even after a few months, you start to become aware of how you immediately react to things.<p>This doesn&#x27;t mean that a meditative approach makes you become some kind of sage - you still get cross, still react in bad ways - but it&#x27;s more fleeting, less likely to affect your whole day or cause longer term anxst.')
