What is there to take seriously?<p>&gt; When Trump won in 2016 there were claims of fraud for that in addition to claims of support from Russian hacks into voting machines. None of these were taken down.<p>I don&#x27;t think those ideas were mainstream at all on the left, and even if they were, they weren&#x27;t being made by people in positions of power.  There&#x27;s a difference between someone anon on the internet claiming fraud (because that&#x27;s meaningless) vs the sitting president doing so.<p>I don&#x27;t call Barack Obama spending the time between Nov and Jan drumming up support for an insurrection against the government.  Can you show me where that happened?<p>I don&#x27;t recall Hillary Clinton ever making the claim of election fraud, or <i>any</i> elected official saying those things.<p>Right now you have the majority of Republicans in the House making those kind of claims, in addition to the President and several Senators.  The fact you would equate the two shows you are too deeply biased to talk neutrally on this subject.')
