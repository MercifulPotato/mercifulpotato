It contains this sentence: &quot;But it is a meaningfully distinct kind of type safety from the one I highlighted a year ago, one that is far weaker.&quot; The antecedent of &quot;one&quot; is &quot;type safety&quot;, which is being provided, just, weaker, not &quot;not type safety&quot; as you claim.<p>As for whether the example is being &quot;dismissed&quot; or not, I also think that&#x27;s manifestly false. See: &quot;[this tradeoff] is often a very good one!&quot; while still diving into exactly what the tradeoff is.')
