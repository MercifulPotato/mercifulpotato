Which is a win for immigrants because they no longer can be threatened with losing their job <i>and deportation</i>, meaning they won&#x27;t work for far lower wages than citizens. That&#x27;s also a win for citizens, as now their aren&#x27;t competing with an underclass forced into worse working arrangements. And it&#x27;s also a win for companies, as they don&#x27;t have to try to find local talent before hiring an immigrant.')
