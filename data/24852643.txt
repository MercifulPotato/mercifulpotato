Your cat comes pre-wired in such a way that it understands certain things about its environment and has certain innate biases that allow you to train it to do simple tricks with relative ease through a reward mechanism.<p>A more analogous example would be building a cat-like robot with four legs and a neural processor then switching it on and expecting to be able to train it with treats. Without a useful initial neural state (founded with an understanding of cognitive psychology and neuroscience) it would be almost totally useless.')
