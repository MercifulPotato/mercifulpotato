Twice the population doesn&#x27;t need twice the songs, so more people leads to fewer music jobs per capita. That alone is going to make it harder and harder to make it as an artist. Exponential population growth is probably making it exponentially harder to compete.  I really feel for these super impacted fields everyone wants in on.<p>That probably applies to our field eventually too. You don&#x27;t need twice the google workforce to serve twice the population. Hopefully by the time it&#x27;s relevant to us, population growth isn&#x27;t particularly exponential.')
