I am looking at the form right now and there is no way to either cancel or request a replacement ballot online.<p>To request a replacement ballot you have to fill out a form and send it to your county clerk, and the form asks you for a lot more info than your DOB.<p>As far as cancelling your vote, when has that EVER been an option and what purpose would it serve?')
