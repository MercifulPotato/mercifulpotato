Pence would only have done this if (besides an inclination to &quot;kill democracy&quot;) he had secured the allegiance of a number of institutions and set in place the actual conditions for a functioning Trump dictatorship.<p>Coups are frequently preceded by mass demonstrations clamoring for something radical to be done. But these are not &quot;the seizure of power by a political faction&quot;; they&#x27;re (1) a symptom of the generalized social dysfunction under which a coup is even thinkable and (2) a legitimizing excuse that new rulers-to-be can invoke to minimize general opposition to their claim to power. The seizure of power takes place elsewhere. Sometimes this is even gradual -- in preparation for a coup, loyalists are put in charge of major institutions, particularly security ones: National Guard, branches of the military, intelligence agencies and so on.<p>What you had was a <i>protest</i>.
