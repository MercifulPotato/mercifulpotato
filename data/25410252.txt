Thanks for fixing that up - I had an 18% failure rate (368&#x2F;444) and lost the list of failures when I clicked away, so given this I&#x27;m now trying to flush&#x2F;reset my library. I&#x27;d recommend (a) logging the import task to a logfile for the user to review failures, and (b) providing editing at scale (list view with checkboxes -&gt; action), as I&#x27;m sitting here clicking &quot;remove&quot; hundreds of times to reset book by book. :-&#x2F;')
