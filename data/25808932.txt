I never see bitcoin as an investment. TSLA stock in my opinion is just hype. They make nice cars but TSLA is a very different story. People who don&#x27;t know anything about cryptocurrencies and how they work are buying bitcoin and treating it as an investment. I see the same situation happening with TSLA. People open brokerage account just to buy TSLA. Maybe the bubble will never burst but I don&#x27;t like taking risks.')
