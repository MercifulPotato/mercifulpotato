Item(by='jholman', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607211655, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25311444, text='&gt; Is that what you truly believe I did above? That I am labeling you, and think you to be a white supremacist?<p>Looked like it to me, an uninvolved curious third party.<p>&gt; the very real reality that these are uncomfortable conversations<p>Huh, that&#x27;s what the poster that you replied to said.  Weird that you got all up in their grill about it.<p>Let me just attempt to paraphrase the initiating series of comments, <i>seeking only to illustrate how your comments looked to me</i>, not attempting to do justice to the full meaning of each commenter.<p><i>nickff</i> &gt; advice on how the manager should do power dynamics<p><i>saagarjha</i> &gt; &quot;strange power dynamic&quot; [followed by lots of savvy commentary, irrelevant to my point here]<p><i>free_rms</i> &gt; CRT is all about power dynamics.  That&#x27;s the point.  I find it exhausting, but me being exhausted is not the point, the point is that it&#x27;s about power. [bit of a reductionist take on the parent comment, but probably correct?]<p><i>dvtrn</i> &gt; Are you exhausted because, as a beneficiary of oppression, you&#x27;d rather the oppression continue?  Or is it because you&#x27;re just too lazy to care about fairness?<p><i>free_rms</i> &gt; See, I dunno where you got that I&#x27;m an oppressor, where did this threat come from?<p>Yikes!  And free_rms didn&#x27;t even say that your implication that she&#x2F;he is an oppressor was <i>wrong</i>, nor were they defensive about it.  They just said that it&#x27;s <i>exhausting</i>!  I mean, it would be!  Who would not be exhausted by that, whether or not it&#x27;s a fair accusation!<p>I mean... now, at the bottom of this thread, you imply that you were seeking to know more, and not trying to imply that the exhaustion is evidence of being a bad person.  Okay, <i>I believe you</i>, and nothing in your <i>first</i> comment belies that reading (though some of the intervening comments, hmn not so sure).  But I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the natural read of what you said, at least it wasn&#x27;t the natural read <i>for me</i>.<p>Me personally, btw, I dunno what CRT is, so in my privileged ignorance (enabled, of course, by my general white privilege) I&#x27;m immune to the exhaustion.  I read this whole thread to see if I could learn something useful.  Not so far, though I don&#x27;t regret the time spent.<p>I dunno, is this helpful?  Maybe I&#x27;m not being helpful.')
