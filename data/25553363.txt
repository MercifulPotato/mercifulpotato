We&#x27;re a team of 3 with full autonomy over how we structure ourselves and the tools we use. Also, the bureaucracy is little to none.<p>Based on what I&#x27;ve read here, other sites, friends and colleagues, I should have changed jobs at least a couple of times by now but I&#x27;ve been here almost 4 years now and don&#x27;t regret it. If you&#x27;ve found a place that you find fulfilling then I don&#x27;t think I need to follow conventional advice. The downsides are less exposure to different project types and not working with a bigger team of experienced devs. I need to compensate for this by putting in extra effort on my side but I still think I&#x27;ve made the right choice for now.<p>I think if I ended up in a commercial dev job, I would have started looking at other options as well. It makes a real difference when you see you work being used for a greater good.<p>While you&#x27;re considering other options, maybe also consider joining a smaller dev team where you have more autonomy and less red tape.')
