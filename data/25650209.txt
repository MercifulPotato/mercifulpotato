And 107 million underwent tubal ligations or, as is commonly said, got their “tubes tied.”&quot; Most of those cannot have been Uyghur women, since those figures vastly exceed the total Uyghur population.<p>So other parts of China simply suffered their sterilization campaigns much earlier. Birth rates in Xinjiang only dropped slightly from 17.57 per thousand in 2000 to 15.88 in 2017, but then to 10.69 in 2018 and further to 8.14 in 2019: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;data.stats.gov.cn&#x2F;easyquery.htm?cn=E0103&amp;zb=A0302&amp;reg=650000&amp;sj=LAST20" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;data.stats.gov.cn&#x2F;easyquery.htm?cn=E0103&amp;zb=A0302&amp;re...</a> , which <i>is</i> a fast drop; but in Beijing, the <i>maximum</i> birth rate over the past 20 years was 9.32 in 2016, and their 2019 birth rate was still below Xinjiang&#x27;s at 8.12: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;data.stats.gov.cn&#x2F;easyquery.htm?cn=E0103&amp;zb=A0302&amp;reg=110000&amp;sj=LAST20" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;data.stats.gov.cn&#x2F;easyquery.htm?cn=E0103&amp;zb=A0302&amp;re...</a>')
