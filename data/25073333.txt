(I believe other well-liked dependency managers like cargo are largely based on bundler&#x27;s semantics).<p>Perhaps ruby was more &quot;hackable&quot; by bundler. (Bundler has now become part of ruby stdlib, but didn&#x27;t start out that way, it definitely started hacking around the way the more fundamental stdlib &#x27;rubygems&#x27; worked).')
