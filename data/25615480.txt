This makes sense, the reason your images look &#x27;off&#x27; is that the normal thermal pallets (such as the one in your colorbar) are typically a roughly constant (or at least smoothly varying) luminance with the thermal information stored in the chroma. Your images have that multiplied by the visible light image intensity which gives a very surreal effect. Fun stuff')
