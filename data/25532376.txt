It’s a great balance between modeling semantics the computer can understand and offering a WYSIWYG UI for users. I built an in-browser editor for a client project that worked this way back in 2014, and open-sourced the core[1]. It worked really well. However, at the time our users (professors) had difficulty understanding what was going on when it didn’t work identically to MS Word. Specifically, to them, Word was “correct” and anything that worked differently was “wrong.”<p>I quit using that model in future projects as I just assumed that block-based editing would always be too “programmery” for users trained on and anchored to Word. I guess I was wrong :)<p>1: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;burlesona&#x2F;nib" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;burlesona&#x2F;nib</a>')
