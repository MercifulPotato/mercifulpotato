You should get the habit of doing this even if the customer only want to know the hours. Paperwork matters.<p>* invoice details. Try not to go overboard here. Split per project, total number of hours, make a SUM and you are done.<p>* work status updates. Don&#x27;t keep the customer guessing. But also, don&#x27;t allow the customer to manage your every 15minute increment. You are a 3rd party not their employee.')
