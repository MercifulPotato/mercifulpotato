(Public censorship schemes that incorporate movie ratings, and thus delegate to movie raters the role of public censor, are common.)<p>No doubt they are part of &quot;schemes of censorship&quot; in some literal sense, but if someone publishes a rating and another chooses to use that rating as the basis of censorship, the onus is still squarely on the part of the censor and not the rater.<p>&gt; Censorship by a third party equally impacts the rights of the parties on both sides of a potential transaction; broadcast media censorship restricts the freedom of both massive media companies and millions of private citizens.<p>You&#x27;re conflating several things. Yes, censorship by a third party has similar effects to government censorship, but we treat them differently because the government is a special entity (ultimately because it enjoys a monopoly on violence and force). There are legitimate questions about when a third party becomes so powerful that it can unilaterally affect government (as with social media companies being a vector for the manipulation of elections), but this is the purview of anti-trust as I understand it (and I strongly support anti-trust action against social media corporations for precisely this reason).<p>The other conflated issues are &quot;freedom to speak&quot; vs &quot;freedom to hear&quot;. Yes, restrictions on the content of broadcast media corporations limits the &quot;freedom to hear&quot; of millions of citizens as it does with restrictions on social media; however, restricting social media also infringes on millions&#x27; freedoms to speak.<p>Indeed, when you consider that the <i>volume</i> of communication in a social media network is combinatorial, the impact on regulations is far greater than for restrictions on traditional broadcast media.')
