There is no problem with their wine, it&#x27;s fine wine (the one time I had it).<p>It&#x27;s just NOT Champagne. That doesn&#x27;t make it bad wine, but it&#x27;s just distinctively not the same product. Just like Prosecco is also not Champagne.<p>And if you don&#x27;t protect your name soon &quot;Champagne&quot; doesn&#x27;t mean anything anymore, including for the original, quality maintaining, wine makers from the Champagne region in France.')
