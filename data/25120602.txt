Hiding controls is literally the opposite thing of making them discoverable.<p>&gt; I strongly recommend disabling buttons instead of hiding them. It makes it immediately clear that the action is normally possible but not available for some reason.<p>100% agreed. To go the extra mile, put a tooltip that appears on hover&#x2F;click that actually states _why_ the button is disabled.<p>Seeing &quot;You don&#x27;t have permission to perform this action&quot; lets me immediately go ask an admin (or if I have access, to go check permissions&#x2F;configuration myself).<p>Not seeing the expected button makes me hunt around for several minutes thinking I must be doing something wrong, then get angry that the software is making me feel stupid, which in turn makes me hate the software.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.interaction-design.org&#x2F;literature&#x2F;article&#x2F;make-it-easy-on-the-user-designing-for-discoverability-within-mobile-apps" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.interaction-design.org&#x2F;literature&#x2F;article&#x2F;make-i...</a>')
