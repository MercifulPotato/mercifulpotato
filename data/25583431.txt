When I initially looked at HTML&#x2F;XML parsing libraries for Rust, there didn&#x27;t seem to be a standout library such as serde_json for JSON data. I was also considering using scraper + html5ever. However, I&#x27;m curious if scraper adds enough to warrant the additional dependency as opposed to directly using html5ever.')
