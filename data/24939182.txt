Try a bunch of stuff.<p>Conntrack is pretty simple though; if you&#x27;ve configured your firewall rules for low performance, Xtables keeps track of each of the active connections, and there&#x27;s a limit. If you hit the limit, it won&#x27;t track anymore connections and you&#x27;re stuck. Try to configure stateless firewall rules instead :)')
