Unless you&#x27;ve lived in Trump country for a while there&#x27;s no way you&#x27;ve met enough hard core Trump supporting rednecks to make any kind of accurate generalization about them.<p>&gt;Your comment reinforce my point instead of refuting it.<p>I live in one of the reddest states in the nation and come from a family full of those Alabama rednecks you talk about, and I voted Republican in every election before 2016. If you think I represent the liberal elite, you&#x27;re dead wrong.<p>Good luck trying to get along with the rednecks you&#x27;re talking about. Most of them don&#x27;t want you here, and if they had their preferred immigration policy you wouldn&#x27;t be allowed in. Many of the family members I talked about wouldn&#x27;t even allow you to marry a person outside your race, and they&#x27;d prefer if schools were still segregated. Though they&#x27;d never say that to an outsider&#x27;s face. And the majority of them outright support requiring Muslims to register with the government so they can be tracked.<p>This has nothing to do with the South btw, it&#x27;s more of an urban rural divide.')
