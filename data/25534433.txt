For a few reasons:<p>1 - I actually need to learn through work so I have to take as much work as possible. My biggest complain so far is that HQ took some of our work so there is not that much ownership left.<p>2 - If you count meetings as work, and taking rest 90% of the time during a meeting as work (10% of the time you are asking meaningful questions and getting feedbacks), then I&#x27;m actually working 8-10 hours per day and don&#x27;t really feel huge strain.<p>In general I&#x27;m OK with others with shorter period of work, as long as I get more responsibility and tools to play with :D')
