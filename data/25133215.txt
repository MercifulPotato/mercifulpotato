My team also has to work in a mixed group where a few folks were hired by another, very senior manager. He knows how to hire. The guy is a legend.<p>Those hires I made from far away were much more carefully thought out and turned out to be much stronger. Equivalent to the ones the senior guy was hiring, if not stronger. I think it&#x27;s because I couldn&#x27;t delude myself into thinking &quot;They&#x27;re fine, I don&#x27;t need to waste time interviewing. I can just groom them, get them to where they need to be.&quot; I had to, absolutely, consider these people as full time remote workers, several time zones away. They had to be crack engineers and crack communicators. And I had to enforce those standards from the get go.<p>Watching everyone else go through the shift to remote work was fascinating. The pandemic caused us to change nothing.')
