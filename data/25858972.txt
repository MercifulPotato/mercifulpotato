The kangaroos scattered, as predicted, and the Americans nodded appreciatively . . . and then did a double-take as the kangaroos reappeared from behind a hill and launched a barrage of stinger missiles at the hapless helicopter. (Apparently the programmers had forgotten the remove “that” part of the infantry coding).<p>Source: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.snopes.com&#x2F;fact-check&#x2F;shoot-me-kangaroo-down-sport&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.snopes.com&#x2F;fact-check&#x2F;shoot-me-kangaroo-down-spo...</a>')
