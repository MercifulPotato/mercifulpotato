We use it user-facing for suite of niche vr&#x2F;tele-op applications and it works wonderfully. We have support for Korean, Japanese, Hebrew (serious issues with right-to-left in our implementation though).<p>The thing about ImGui is it puts devs on steroids - adding gui is just sooo fast. And fun. And easy to tweak. And easy to debug. 10X, maybe?<p>I get that for a game maybe the user facing gui is less of an issue - it needs to be really polished and maybe there isn&#x27;t as &quot;much&quot; gui anyway? But for indie-games and productivity apps, it seems like having a gui option that offers 10X faster development - wouldn&#x27;t that be really convincing? Even if it isn&#x27;t 10X, maybe only 1.3X, it still seems like it would be easy to motivate some missing functionality. And I would argue it is way more than 1.3.<p>And looking forward - IME, emoji, right-to-left: those are just PR:s waiting to be written :)<p>I&#x27;m incredibly bullish on ImGui paradigm. If programmers gravitate towards it and prefer it as much as they do then there is some real power there.<p>The only bad thing about ImGui is that the Rust port of it... well... sucks. At least the way it handles strings at the moment. Then again I always found Rust&#x27;s handling of strings to be one of the negatives of that language.')
