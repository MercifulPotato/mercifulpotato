This compares favourably with the 2600 Russian tanks, and with proper logistical backbone, advanced air support, infantry support, and competent missile defence systems, is way more than necessary to stall a Russian offensive.<p>Of course, once the Russian offensive is stalled, Germany alone can vastly outproduce Russia, and that&#x27;s the worst case scenario.<p>The US is not necessary for Germany to defend against Russia.')
