The White House was never “stormed” – the Secret Service made the decision to move him into the bunker when some protesters went around temporary barriers in the park space by the Treasury Department but at no point did the protests come closer than the gates to the White House complex.

I bike or walk through regularly and you’ll almost always see someone at the fence with a sign about something.<p>This is in sharp contrast to the coup attempt where the insurgents quickly blew through areas which are never open to the public – think about how many of the videos have alarms ringing in the background.<p>Note also that I’m not faulting the Secret Service – it’s not hard to imagine someone trying to breach the gate and it’s their job to protect the President. My objection is entirely due to presenting these as equivalents.')
