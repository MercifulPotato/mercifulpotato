For me the urge is often triggered by an aversion to what I should really be doing at the given time. Thus not acting on the urge isn’t a complete solution, because it still leaves me with the aversion and has me seek some other avoidance behavior. Unlike the urge, which goes away by itself by “surfing” it, the aversion tends to subsist much longer, because you can’t sidestep the object of the aversion (unlike the object of the urge).')
