Sometimes you don&#x27;t have the option of freeing your hand right away, and at least in the meantime (however long that lasts) some painkillers may be a lifesafer.<p>* I take your example metaphorically because active, serious self-harm is an exception to usual norms. One would likely jump to remove someone&#x27;s hand from a hot stove without thinking, but even taking away an addict&#x27;s cigarette or drink would generally be a faux pas. Having an AI that allows you to fall in love doesn&#x27;t fall in the active self-destruction category, in my opinion.')
