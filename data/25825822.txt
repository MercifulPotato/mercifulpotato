Item(by='raiph', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610999512, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25783866, text='&gt; When jnthn&#x27;s grammar debugger got really buggy and less actively maintained, that defeated one of the biggest reasons I had to use the language.<p>I created a couple PRs for the grammar debugger, one that fixed a bug, another that dramatically sped it up, but neither were merged. But imo that was appropriate; spending time on that debugger wasn&#x27;t a good use of his time.<p>And now jnthn&#x27;s work on grammar debugging in Comma is so vastly superior to the old debugger that it would imo be especially silly of him to use up his limited time continuing to pay attention to the old code. I&#x27;m curious whether you agree with that?<p>&gt; Raku is different, and it deserves to see top caliber core development. It doesn&#x27;t have that yet, and that&#x27;s sad.<p>I agree it needs <i>more</i> than jnthn, but surely you agree that jnthn is top caliber?<p>He has a degree in CS, specializing in PLs, compilers, and VMs, so exactly the right focus for his core dev work. And the university he did his degree at was <i>Cambridge</i>, one of the world&#x27;s top universities, especially in CS. And he was awarded the degree <i>with honors</i>.<p>In addition, he is a highly successful, highly paid enterprise systems consultant whose work on Rakudo in his limited spare time, in recent years augmented by occasional grant supported projects that pay less way less than his commercial rate, has always struck me as extraordinarily good.<p>I&#x27;ve always thought it would be wonderful to have two jnthns, but that we have to respect and appreciate what resources we do have, and let him work at a pace that doesn&#x27;t burn him out while he continues to mentor the other core devs, as he has now for many years.<p>Would you say I&#x27;m missing something?')
