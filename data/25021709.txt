Item(by='h0l0cube', descendants=None, kids=[25022530, 25022707], score=None, time=1604797495, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25021233, text='&gt; Is there really any common ground?<p>Some policies, when detached from political partisanship, could be appreciated by voters on both sides.<p>For instance, for those who believe in human rights and social justice (a supposedly &#x27;left&#x27; concern), there&#x27;s good cause for opposition to China.  In terms of jobs and national security, wresting some of China&#x27;s high-tech manufacturing capability back within US borders would be a boon for employment across &#x27;middle-America&#x27; (a supposedly &#x27;right&#x27; concern).  More importantly, I think both the concerns of human rights, and the employment of your fellow citizens, should not be a partisan issue.<p>I think most people want the world to be a better place to live, with better human rights, and a wage.  Allowing China to gain leverage on the world, despite a track record of human rights abuses, and building a trade deficit with them, isn&#x27;t really in the general voters interest.<p>And this is just one example.  I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s more common ground if you look just at policy.')
