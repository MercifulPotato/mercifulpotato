Item(by='patrec', descendants=None, kids=[24993585], score=None, time=1604527253, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24989361, text='&gt; I&#x27;ve been testing out both the 8GB Pi 4 and the new Pi 400 overclocked to 2.2 GHz. For many things, both are perfectly adequate.<p>I wonder if I&#x27;m doing something wrong. I have a 4GiB pi 4B and have found it laggy enough to be basically completely unsuitable for even the most lightweight interactive computing tasks, e.g. basic (ad filtered) web browsing. I think there might have been a bit of intermittent laginess in typing into an xterm in a bare bones tiling window manager with basically nothing else going on, but I&#x27;d have to check again. After the initial hickup on full-screening, did the video play back properly for you? For me it was not possible to play 480p youtube videos.<p>All in all this was much worse than I expected from a quad core machine with 4GiB.<p>Now I haven&#x27;t got the fastest micro-SD card, and I&#x27;m running with Ubuntu 20.04 64bit server rather than raspian, but is this just what I should expect, or should a different configuration of the 4GiB 4B handle light web surfing and fullscreen video playback?')
