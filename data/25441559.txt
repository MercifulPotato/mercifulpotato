Understanding every line of .emacs was indeed the intention behind the line-by-line explanation.<p>If one does not wish to understand the customizations completely, then Portacle is a great starting point. However, my intention here was to promote a DIY approach to customizing Emacs into a CL dev environment.<p>I believe that with something like Emacs which is so extensible, it is good to promote customizing it to one&#x27;s own taste and preferences instead of installing a readymade customized distribution of it. This project is meant to be a quick starter kit to quickly do these customizations without having to spend too much time on it.')
