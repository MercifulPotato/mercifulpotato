The American middle class has gotten absolutely wrecked over the last few decades while eerily similar promises about globalization have failed to deliver -- <i>except</i> to the owner class. I think this is just another instance of that, and I think many of us are in denial because it&#x27;s much easier than acknowledging that we&#x27;re next on the chopping block.')
