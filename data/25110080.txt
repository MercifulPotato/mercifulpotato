That&#x27;s it.<p>Client A may want to retrieve the User type along with a collection of recent Searches and PageViewed results, all in one request to reduce chattiness.<p>Client B (or even Client A in a different workflow) might want to retrieve the User type alongside MatchedProfiles or whatever. Again in on request to reduce chattiness.<p>GraphQL allows for this kind of flexibility, whereas in REST you&#x27;ll need to either get chatty with the APIs or build and maintain a large number of boilerplate endpoints.')
