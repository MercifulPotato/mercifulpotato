I don’t do much photography and only use about 10 apps. It’s just big enough to use for Kindle in a pinch.<p>The biggest reason, though, is the headphone jack. $160 for wireless headphones is ridiculous. They’re easy to lose and constantly having to recharge is just fucking stupid. Modern earbuds are horribly uncomfortable for me by putting pressure in the ear canal to hold them in place, so I have to use the older earbud style.<p>I like Apple’s stuff, in general, but I curse the day that their asshole product designers went totally wireless.')
