I can’t tell you how many times we heard that,” said one employee. “It was certainly a toxic work environment”</i><p>&gt; <i>the office began to fill with people who had nothing to do. Many just sat in their cubicles watching Netflix and playing games on their phones</i><p>Well its obvious: politic and corporate are at fault: should have hired at least some people who actually know what the  job is they got hired for, not just slackers and slavers. This is far too typical for large corporations: no real plan, hire cheap, have n-layers of management where everyone pretends everything is going well, but since no one has any clue the whole thing grinds to a halt, fails and burns once the initial inertia runs out.')
