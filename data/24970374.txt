R2 then became the second autonomous vehicle to receive a driverless testing permit in California. When the COVID-19 pandemic hit, we set up contactless delivery services with R2 at temporary care facilities in California to carry food, water, and medical supplies to patients and doctors with the goal of decreasing points of contagion.<p>Today, weâ€™re excited to announce another first for Nuro. For the past few months, R2 has been testing on city streets fully autonomously in three different states. No drivers. No occupants. No chase cars.<p>R2 on the road: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;nuro&#x2F;r2-on-the-road-295dedacebeb" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;nuro&#x2F;r2-on-the-road-295dedacebeb</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=yFYljZc968I" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=yFYljZc968I</a><p>Open roles include:<p>* Full-Stack Engineer<p>* Robotics Reliability Engineer<p>* Perception Sensor Engineer<p>* Software Engineer, Mapping &amp; Localization<p>* Sr. Software Engineer (Backend), Operations Platform<p>* Software Engineer, Perception Infrastructure<p>* And many more!<p>To apply or view all open roles: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nuro.ai&#x2F;careers#see-open-roles" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nuro.ai&#x2F;careers#see-open-roles</a>')
