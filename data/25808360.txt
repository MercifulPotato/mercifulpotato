Item(by='ww520', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610860516, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25807936, text='Quaternion is a 4D complex number representing rotation in 3D space.  It has the form of: w + xi + yj + zk, where w is the real scalar value and x, y, z are the values of the i, j, k imaginary axes.<p>Complex number is a natural fit for rotation because operations of unit complex numbers end up on the same complex unit circle&#x2F;sphere.  e.g. Multiplying two quaternions performs two rotations one after another.<p>Of course, there&#x27;s the octonion complex number with 8 axes for representing rotation in 4D hyperspace.')
