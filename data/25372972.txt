People usually try the local language first, if they can speak it at all. At that point they don&#x27;t even know what each other&#x27;s languages are. So two British people meeting for the first time in Germany may well start off by speaking German to each other. I&#x27;ve seen that happen a few times.<p>But I&#x27;ve also seen a German speak bad English to someone just because they looked foreign. They were foreign, but having lived in German for a while they could speak German better than they could English, and after a while they politely pointed this out. It was a bit embarrassing. It is definitely better to try the local language first.')
