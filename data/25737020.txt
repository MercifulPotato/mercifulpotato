Item(by='aidenn0', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610399374, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25719178, text='I run Nix on my workstation and on my laptop, and have been doing so for a couple of years.<p>Most of the issues I ran into were just nix being different from other distros I use, so I did have to relearn a few things.<p>The remainder of the issues are the sorts of things one runs into with a non-rolling release distro.  For example, a program I use got a feature I want last September.  I&#x27;m going to have to wait until March for it to hit stable, since NixOS is on a September&#x2F;March  biannual release schedule.<p>The good news is that I am running the latest version of that package just fine now; Nix lets you install &quot;overlays&quot; of the package system into your home directory (or globally), and I just copied the package definition into the overlay, updated the URL and SHA256 sum to point to the new version and it &quot;just worked.&quot;<p>Downside of course is when I upgrade to NixOS 21.03 (the march release), I&#x27;ll have to remember to remove my overlay version of the package, or I&#x27;ll be frozen on that version.  There may be some fancy way to work around this which I haven&#x27;t discovered, but since I have like 1 or 2 packages in that state at any time, I just manually do it when I upgrade.')
