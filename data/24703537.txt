Even though hogs are starting to show up in and around cities (I have personally seen them right next to I-45 in The Woodlands&#x2F;Conroe area immediately north of Houston), it&#x27;s illegal to shoot them there. And there are only so many people willing to spend their own time and money to leave the city and go kill them.<p>If we&#x27;re talking straight theory (and this is HN so why wouldn&#x27;t we), all it should take is enough predators to reduce&#x2F;eliminate any given prey population to the desired number. The predator count that is needed could itself be reduced if more effective predation methods are available, but it&#x27;s still a numbers game.')
