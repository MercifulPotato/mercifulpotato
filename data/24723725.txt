I also use a 3970X and can&#x27;t get it to 4.4GHz even with all but one CCD disabled (much less all-core).  I am on air cooling, though, and suspect that switching to water cooling would help a lot.  I hit 90C almost instantly under load.  (I use the automatic overclocking and can do 4.2GHz all core; much better than the specified 3.7GHz all core.)<p>Since I don&#x27;t run into Threadripper owners very often, I&#x27;m wondering if yours also has a pretty high idle power?  Mine idles at 80-90W (reported; 200+W from the wall) which is surprising to me coming from the Intel world.  So much electricity wasted simply because I am too lazy to turn off my computer.')
