Item(by='EvanAnderson', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609215720, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25562090, text='I did a similar thing (the evolution of corewars code bit-- not the light fixture bit) after reading Steven Levy&#x27;s &quot;Artificial Life&quot;[1] in the early 90s. The chapter on Tom Ray&#x27;s Tierra[2] really excited me.<p>Some people say that reading Richard Dawkins caused them to become atheist. For me, it was very clearly &quot;Artificial Life&quot; and the code I wrote playing around w&#x2F; &quot;evolving&quot; Corewars code.<p>I managed to eek out a little &quot;evolution&quot; in my experimentation. I was never particularly religious to begin with. My simulation code caused me to deeply consider the power of evolution. Here was this tiny change, evolved from randomness in a minuscule virtual &quot;petri dish&quot;, out of a tiny amount of ingredients that were brittle and unforgiving of the slightest change, on a time scale that was the smallest fraction of a fraction of the age of the universe.<p>Observing the sheer magnitude of the chemical &quot;parallel computing substrate&quot; at the scale of atoms and molecules, interacting in real time, across a space as large as the Earth, in a timescale measuring billions of years, and over a wide variety of temperature and energy gradients made me aside any concerns that all life couldn&#x27;t have arisen from randomness.<p>I didn&#x27;t need an &quot;intelligent designer&quot; after that. Nature, the vastness of space, the minuteness of atoms, and the overwhelming scale of time were enough.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Artificial-Life-Frontier-Computers-Biology&#x2F;dp&#x2F;0679743898" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Artificial-Life-Frontier-Computers-Bi...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Tierra_(computer_simulation)" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Tierra_(computer_simulation)</a>')
