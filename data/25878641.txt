It&#x27;s water. The same as all other water and it&#x27;s the same price. It&#x27;s called Google water, it&#x27;s right there at checkout, you can pick up unlimited quantities&quot; - and if you prompt, and ask about it, you may find out that there are &#x27;other brands&#x27; of water available, and yes, it&#x27;s probably of the same quality, but if you wait a few minutes, the clerk can go into the back and maybe find some&#x27;.<p>Google owns all of the shelf space.<p>In a close real world analogy - it&#x27;s for the same reason that you can only get &#x27;Coke&#x27; or &#x27;Pepsi&#x27; in many situations, and for the same reason there is no &#x27;3rd Cola&#x27;.<p>Contemplate the situation with that question: &quot;If DDG etc. produce the same results, why does everyone chose G?&quot; because that will unpack a lot for you.')
