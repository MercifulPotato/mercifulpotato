What makes it easy is the ability to customise parameters like screen transition, method monitoring, API, FPS and Memory leaks. Developers can add them to their dev or the test build to capture performance on the background which means there js enough context &amp; helps developers to identify performance bottleneck even before hitting the playstore. All this without impacting the app performance &amp; making it close to real time.<p>We are brining a lot more important metrics to understand activity life cycle management, ANRs, In-app feedback etc,.<p>Feedback would be much appreciated &amp; we are sure to help the dev teams by adding performance optimization as part of the future sprints.')
