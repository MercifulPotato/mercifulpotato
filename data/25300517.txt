But it&#x27;s bigger than zero.  And compared to humanities historical average before the industrial revolution of basically 0%, 1.1% is enormous.<p>The much vaunted industrial revolution had Britain at not more than 1.25%.  Boring by today&#x27;s standards, but absolutely game changing compared to what came before.')
