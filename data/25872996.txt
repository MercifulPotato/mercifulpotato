Crude example: If you hash your pincode I still have only 10^4 values to try.<p>The easiest way to fix this is to add an access token column that is cryptographically random and use both the ID and the token in the URL.<p>If you trust the 80 bits already in the ID the token only needs to be 80 bits for a total of 160 bits of entropy. But if you do that you have to make sure that a missing ID and invalid token are handled identically from the attackers perspective (same reply, same timing).')
