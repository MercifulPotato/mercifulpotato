These days nearly everything uses HTTP. Changing HTTP is almost as big as adding another option to TCP&#x2F;UDP<p>Everything that touches HTTP connections. Proxies, transparent proxies, web application firewalls, every network analysis and debugging tool, layer 7 load balancers.<p>There&#x27;s probably half a million hardware firewalls out there that won&#x27;t ever get a software update. As soon as http&#x2F;3 is released, they&#x27;re useless. The ones that can be upgraded need downtime and people time to do so. Just in firewalls this change could cost 400 million.<p>Realistically, the consequences of HTTP&#x2F;3 will cost billions. Is 4% faster speed worth that? There&#x27;s a lot of other ways to increase speed 4% without spending any money. Like turning on profile guided optimization in the browser, or just waiting a year for CPU and network speeds to increase that much.<p>I&#x27;m not being defeatist here, a maximum of 4% performance increase is just not very good. Nobody would switch a video or audio codec for a few percent, why is HTTP considered easier?<p>I say to Google: come back with something better. 20-30%? Totally worth it. If HTTP&#x2F;2 is truly within 4% of optimal we should never touch it again')
