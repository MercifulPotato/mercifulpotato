Ask any waiter whose base rate is below minimum how this works.<p>The problem is that this is only done when the base wage + tips over a period falls below minimum wage. So itâ€™s less likely that the employer will make up the difference, and more likely that other people around who are following social conventions will make up the difference, and the waiter will simply earn less money on days when you show up, and you will pay less money for food, because your food is partially subsidized by people who tip.')
