One could generally assume that the environment is managed by the city and state, so that floods would not reach your home and wildfires would be stopped at the city limits; insurance was for accidents and freak events (hailstorms, quakes, electrical fires).  Due to both developmental sprawl and the decay of state and federal infrastructure, one can no longer assume a home is in such a controlled environment so, buyers (and insurers!) have some lessons to learn.<p>A good example of the kind of change Iâ€™m talking about is development in 100-year flood plains in Houston[0].  30 years ago, a naive home buyer would not have had to worry about it, because flood plains were off limits.  What changed?  Greedy developers?  Ignorant planners?  More population?  Perhaps all of it.  But now you have to be educated to make the right call.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.houstonchronicle.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;houston-texas&#x2F;houston&#x2F;article&#x2F;Even-after-Harvey-Houston-keeps-adding-new-homes-13285865.php" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.houstonchronicle.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;houston-texas&#x2F;houston&#x2F;...</a>')
