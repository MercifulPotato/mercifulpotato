Item(by='JoeAltmaier', descendants=None, kids=[25555547, 25555532], score=None, time=1609115318, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25555217, text='Farmers aren&#x27;t &#x27;average people&#x27;. A commercial-scale farm requires millions in investment. It runs on small margins, and is run like a factory. A modern 1000-acre farm can be operated by one or two people. That&#x27;s been the trend for 200 years. America for instance has gone from 50% farmers to under 2%. Arguably the reason we were the superpower we were - so much more manpower for other things.<p>And to create a fancy mechanical robotic wall-farm to produce commodity products like lettuce seems folly. I&#x27;m sure they chose that because it comes to maturity in a score days, not weeks or months. And the &#x27;floor space&#x27; per plant has to be enormous for that farm-of-the-future.<p>The article belabors the &#x27;less land used&#x27; argument throughout. Perhaps because that&#x27;s the only place they win (not on price; not on investment cost; not on variety or flexibility?) While that&#x27;s important, the issue is not running out of farmland. The American farmer has gotten so efficient, doubling output per acre repeatedly for a century now. Iowa could feed two United States. The US could feed the world. With old-fashioned land-intensive agriculture.')
