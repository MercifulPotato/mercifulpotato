You need about ~600-800 US$ worth of raw coca leafs to produce 1kg base cocaine (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.businessinsider.com&#x2F;from-colombia-to-new-york-city-the-economics-of-cocaine-2015-7?r=DE&amp;IR=T" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.businessinsider.com&#x2F;from-colombia-to-new-york-ci...</a>) - and make ~25-27k US$ once it&#x27;s on US streets. A vertical cartel that controls everything from the leaves to the sellers can capture all that 41.000% profit margin for themselves!<p>When the biggest markets US and EU &quot;dry up&quot; for illegal sales of cocaine, the gangs literally don&#x27;t have anyone any more to extort for money - the population of South America is dirt poor. And also, they can&#x27;t afford running militia that are more capable than some nations&#x27; armies or bribing the utter majority of the political class any more once these tasty US dollars vanish.')
