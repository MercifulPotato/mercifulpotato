From 1971 until housing crises in 2008 personal savings diminished.\nWhile top 1% earnings increasing.\nIf you look at housing price index Vs salary then real estate rose by 250% while salary not some much. Rent increase proporsonal to housing prices. It just generates so much cash from those who can&#x27;t buy it.
