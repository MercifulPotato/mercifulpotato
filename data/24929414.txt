Instead of looking for possible solutions. It downplays the worst case scenarios by having &quot;Too Many&quot; educated people. Both the article and the study. Instead of asking why we should fear having too many educated people. Shouldn&#x27;t we instead be asking the question why should we fear them in the first place?
