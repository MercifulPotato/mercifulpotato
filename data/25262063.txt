As the site mentions, we&#x27;re still in beta, so feedback is super helpful.<p>1. Yes, it&#x27;s forked from Firefox, this is a fairly common starting codebase and compatible license for making a browser, Brave does the same thing. Also, I used to work at Mozilla so I trust their codebase a lot as a starting point.<p>There&#x27;s a lot more that Insight can do that Firefox doesn&#x27;t but that isn&#x27;t apparent, then I think the onus is on us for communicating that to new users better.<p>2. The AdBlocking ruleset is actually a superset of Firefox, but it is still limited by Safari&#x27;s 50k rule limit — <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.zdnet.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;apple-neutered-ad-blockers-in-safari-but-unlike-chrome-users-didnt-say-a-thing&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.zdnet.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;apple-neutered-ad-blockers-in-...</a> The main thing we can do to get in addition to this is the ability to inject JS (this is a class of extension) to block anything else you see fit.<p>3. Apple enforces OS and API level restrictions on a browser, (e.g. must use WKWebView). There&#x27;s some things you just can&#x27;t do that you could if you say forked Chromium or Firefox on desktop.<p>In general, we&#x27;re trying to make a browser within the UI and technical constraints of iOS that is<p>1. very easy to build extensions for (usually no code)\n2. has an easy to use interface without the complexity of desktop extensions<p>In order to achieve that, we did have to simplify compared to WebExtensions. Even though the basic interface is IF-THEN (we adopted this so the easiest level of making extensions can be no-code), you should be able to do a lot with it via JS.<p>Let me know if there&#x27;s important use cases you have that you have for a mobile browser that you feel is impossible within our framework — that&#x27;d be really helpful feedback as well.<p>Thanks for trying it out!<p>&gt; Money got us into the mess we are in[1], it is up to the real[2] community to get us out.<p>I would state this as - enabling businesses to be as extractive as they currently are got us into a difficult place. People I know hold views on what can get us out on the full range from:<p>a)the solutions having to be structurally decentralized to\nb) only heavy centralization can  wield enough distribution power to mount a strong opposition.<p>The position we&#x27;re taking as a startup with this product is that we have to walk the walk of making the web actually more user-centric than the app alternatives because there&#x27;s really no reason to adopt us unless we deliver on these promises.')
