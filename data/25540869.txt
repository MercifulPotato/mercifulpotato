I doubt it but come Monday Morning if a bunch of bank vaults in the area are cleaned out, it would be a pretty amazing heist plot for sure. But they would have to have some inside info because most C.O.&#x27;s have diesel generators so if the AT&amp;T C.O. there depended on Natural gas, someone would have to know that. Also, most of them have 4 - 8 hours of battery so the AT&amp;T services went about that long after. I am sure the cops are standing guard in front of the banks right now I would guess.')
