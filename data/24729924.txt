(Think like ISO standards) as API is not a program itself, it&#x27;s a rule-set how two programms can interoperate.<p>Patenting API&#x27;s imo is like patenting a rule set for a game (say like football). Imagine someone patenting rules for a football and afterwards it&#x27;s allowed only to play the game if you are &quot;licensed&quot; by the patent holder.<p>anyways- the Googles defense team seems bland. Not sure whether they really understand the idea of what API is and what&#x27;s it&#x27;s purpose and that API&#x27;s textual representation is absolutely non-essential.')
