I don&#x27;t think that a star emits much radio waves at the same frequently range you choose for your radio transmission, and especially has the same modulation side bands.<p>That said, MW-class radio transmittets are not heavy, their cooling systems are. You also don&#x27;t need to transmit continuously, you can send bursts as long as your thermal budget allows. For energy, you have unlimited sunlight.')
