I intentionally added references to my original post as to avoid such criticism... for all the good it did me!<p>And please feel free to express yourself, I have upvoted you also :)<p>[0]:<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.journals.uchicago.edu&#x2F;doi&#x2F;abs&#x2F;10.1086&#x2F;468111?journalCode=jls" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.journals.uchicago.edu&#x2F;doi&#x2F;abs&#x2F;10.1086&#x2F;468111?jou...</a>')
