A warning already comes up explaining what happened that a user can click through. Unless the website has opted into strict mode, in which case warnings cannot be bypassed, which seems very reasonable.<p>I&#x27;m saying load the website by default; just display a warning that isn&#x27;t too intrusive or alarming. As a starting point (not suggesting this is peak UX; it&#x27;s just a starting point for the discussion): it could be just a small balloon notification on the padlock with black text, nothing in red or otherwise alarming (or maybe becoming more red as more time has passed). A little bit like the balloon Chrome displays for &quot;Disable developer-mode extensions&quot;. It still lets you use the browser but also gets its point across.<p>&gt; Try crossing the border with an expired passport and see how non-exact expiry dates are.<p>You couldn&#x27;t think of expiration dates for things that <i>aren&#x27;t</i> at the extreme? Maybe for actions whose gravity is a little bit more comparable to visiting a website than, say, crossing an international border?')
