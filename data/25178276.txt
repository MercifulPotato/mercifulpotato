If that went away, it could perhaps pave the path to less tipping overall<p>But I&#x27;m not defending the argument, just adding to the debate. I&#x27;m fine with tipping, personally, because I think it aligns incentives to encourage good service. That good looking people get better tips doesn&#x27;t bother me in the slightestâ€”life isn&#x27;t fair.')
