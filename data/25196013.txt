Maybe it will eventually center around one subproject and become mostly associated with it (Guix as THE GNU OS).<p>The problem is that the Guix maintainers want to remove Stallman from his own project while he is alive and active, and they pursue their intention with methods that are unethical, disrespectful and destructive to the community.<p>&gt; Even RMS never suggested they leave the GNU Project (to my knowledge) &lt;...&gt; what makes you think it’s a good idea?<p>I don&#x27;t really want Guix to leave GNU, I&#x27;m questioning the motivation of the maintainers.')
