I was just starting out and had NO idea on what was good programming practice.<p>In the second firm , we had used schema to type the codebase partially and it worked. But the type checks weren&#x27;t compile time , but rather during unit tests and when running with type-checking enabled (I think this is the same for spec as well)<p>I think the advantage of TS comes from the static types (+ checking). You get immediate feedback before you can even compile it into javascript.')
