It&#x27;s hard for either internal or external forces to spread non-governmental propaganda for very long. Also, these governments are less reserved and more brazen; NSA surely has private emails of Russian politicians, but it&#x27;s unlikely they&#x27;d ever release them publicly to influence an upcoming election.<p>In China or Russia, the government can just decide to ban access to Wikipedia, Twitter, and Facebook on a whim. Governmental spies and informants watch chat groups and national social media. Journalists and citizens fear repeating any claim that may upset the government.<p>However, in the long-term, authoritarianism is probably not very sustainable in peacetime. As education and information increases, it becomes harder to prevent people from wanting more liberties. The US may have collapsed by then, but whether it is or isn&#x27;t collapsed, assuming no global catastrophes (a big assumption, I know), I predict that in the year 2120 Western ideals will have won globally, and China&#x27;s and Russia&#x27;s political systems will be a lot closer to liberal democracies than they are now. If there is a global catastrophe, then the reverse will probably be the case.')
