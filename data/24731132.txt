If your employer disagrees the burden of proof is on THEM to proof that your job would not be doable part-time.<p>This (and to be honest also fiscal policy) has resulted in the largest part-time workforce in the world. In Dutch e-mail it&#x27;s very common to find the days people work in the signature at the bottom.<p>Even though it&#x27;s not mandatory most people will start by taking Wednesday and&#x2F;or Friday off. So over time the work culture here became to plan meetings on Mo-Tue-Thu, along with drinks on Thursdays in stead of Fridays. As someone who works 40h still this is such a net-positive for me as well, I love that people don&#x27;t really plan meetings on Wednesday and Fridays and you can just work.<p>73% of all women work part-time, as do 23% of the men. Only half of all working Dutch people work fulltime.<p>Part-time is anything between 12h and 32h a week.<p>I hope this would become the norm everywhere as it truly frees up everyone to suit their needs.')
