If either of these series&#x27; seasons dropped all at once, I&#x27;m 100% certain they wouldn&#x27;t have been nearly as big.<p>BB Season 4 was the absolute peak of &quot;what&#x27;s going to happen next???&quot; for the internet communities I was involved in, my family members who were watching, my friends who were watching, casual chats at work. There was suspense in waiting week to week and discussions carried on while we waited.<p>Netflix releasing episodes all at once has completely destroyed momentum and build up. With everyone watching at their own pace, there&#x27;s no collective presence. The episodes might have your mental space for a couple days&#x2F;weeks while  you binge, and then it&#x27;s gone, and people who are also interested are going to be on different timelines.<p>You&#x27;re less likely to recommend the show to others 6 months later, because you literally haven&#x27;t watched or thought about it for 6 months.<p>I like AppleTV+&#x27;s move of doing weekly episodes. Everyone is on the same page again, and you get to share something together.')
