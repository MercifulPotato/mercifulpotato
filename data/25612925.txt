He considered himself an anarchist, before settling with the social-liberal-democrats.<p>In schools he is often represented as &quot;anti-soviets&quot; but that is a simplification. He was a very political intellectual who cared far more about the patterns of government and the structures of society in general. Sure, he did despised stalinism, but he did so, because it was a tyrannical, totalitarian system. In the long run it is wiser to read the fable and consider if your own government is run by power hungry pigs.')
