Instead they don&#x27;t let migrant construction workers nor gardeners nor cleaners etc into the country, which is worse for global inequality. But, out of sight, out of mind. (There&#x27;s more to say about income distribution in Singapore, but having migrant workers, even if badly paid, is a plus in my book.<p>I also think low-skilled migrants are ok, to a degree. Migrants from EU can travel and work in Finland freely without visa. There are many Estonian, and some Bulgarian etc construction workers - but there also legally enforced minimum salaries for everyone. In Singapore there is no minimum salary and that is one of the causes of their extreme income distribution.<p>&gt; With kids: I think it&#x27;s mostly expensive if you are an expat and go the expat route with everything. If you go more local and earn a decent amount of money, the amount you save in taxes should more than make up for some extra costs.\n(There&#x27;s also a breakeven point for expats with kids at private international school, but it&#x27;s obviously much higher.)<p>This is true - but getting a space for a foreign child in local schools in Singapore is really, really difficult. So you almost have to factor in private school fees. Other costs are fairly comparable to Helsinki, except health care, and cars are <i>even</i> more expensive in Singapore - you don&#x27;t really need one though. But you&#x27;re right, post-tax income quickly becomes attractive in Singapore for people on higher levels of income.')
