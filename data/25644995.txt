I have paypal accounts in 3 countries. One my home country. Since I haven&#x27;t lived in my home country for 10 years, I never use the account. However, some day I got an email asking me to login and do something, so I went to PayPal.com and logged in using my password manager (Bitwarden). But then they thought it was suspicious that I was logging from another country and they wanted to send me an SMS to my old phone, which I no longer have. In the end, I let the account die.')
