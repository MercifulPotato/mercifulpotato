The first locks out people who want to contribute, which kind of removes half the reason you&#x27;d open source something in the first place, the second feels like you could leave in bugs and ransom them for support money, and in the third you are introducing your own subjectivity in ways which frequently do not go as planned. I totally understand why people would do all three, but for me personally they just aren&#x27;t for me, and I hope you can understand why some people would be turned off by such projects.')
