My personal purpose is for learning so I&#x27;m also willing to pay a fee, say a thousand USD.<p>The only requirement is that I&#x27;m able to do real life PB level DE work, preferably with someone guiding (but I&#x27;m fine if none). My own experience with &quot;big&quot; data is limited to Vertica&#x2F;SparkSQL(on Databrick) and some Python + Airflow pipelines that consume data from advertising platforms (think Appflyer). Our main pipeline that really deals with big data (tens of thousands of events per second) is coded by HQ so we don&#x27;t actually get any chance to do real big data work.<p>Thanks for any help!')
