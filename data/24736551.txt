There&#x27;s no labels on the beat grid. For sample type on the 808 and notes on the 303, there&#x27;s no start button on the 303 side so you have to slide back to the 808 to start the beat to hear any changes then go back to the 303 side to tweak it. A BPM indicator would be nice, though I know the originals didn&#x27;t have it.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t pick so much, but you advertise this in the about as a &#x27;professional sounding online interface&#x27;, the sounds are decent, but the interface is sorely lacking as far as professional goes.<p>I have to say though, I did find the knobs to be nicely responsive on the 303 side with a touch screen. Something i&#x27;ve found lacking in a lot of apps.')
