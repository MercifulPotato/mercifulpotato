I&#x27;m pretty sure if I started clearing snow in my neighbourhood with a DIY snowplow, I&#x27;d get in trouble with the housing cooperative, as they&#x27;re already paying someone else to do that (however shitty job they do). Police may eventually get involved too, as I&#x27;m pretty sure that operating a car-sized robot on a road is illegal in more than one way.<p>Now if I <i>really cared</i> about doing this, I could probably follow some legal procedures to get my snowplow registered, and I could probably convince the neighbours&#x2F;co-op to let me play with it. But it would all fare better if I formed a company around it and enter the discussion as a legal entity. At which point I may as well start a real snowplow business - which is way beyond my hobby interests.<p>And this applies to a lot of meatspace innovation - unless you own (and not rent) a home with a large backyard, and confine the scope of your experiments to just your backyard, pretty much all interesting ideas I can come up with require enough red tape that it&#x27;s not even worth it, unless you&#x27;re doing it for money.')
