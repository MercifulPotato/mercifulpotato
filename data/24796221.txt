I don&#x27;t have clear evidence for this other than that personal experience writing code that utilized the API looking at the outputs it gives on the playground defaults extensively. This looks exactly like what GPT output looks like to my eyes. If I&#x27;m wrong I apologize for the insult but the article doesn&#x27;t appear very cohesive or coherent in my opinion and immediately jumps out as being written by GPT.<p>The other articles on the website it should be noted, are written in a style that looks very different from the style of this article.')
