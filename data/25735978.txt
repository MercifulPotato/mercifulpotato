I found your post interesting.<p>The paper you linked to is limited in scope to the browser itself calling home with unique identifiers. The paper says nothing about what happens when the browser visits say Facebook.<p>In terms of the browser calling home and uniquely tracking you all by itself, the paper says Brave does a good job.
