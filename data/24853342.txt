Nomad is very nice, much smaller in scope than k8s, and saved us a lot of effort.<p>We don&#x27;t use any of Nomad&#x27;s networking stuff, really, so all the BPF work was relatively easy to bolt in. All our Firecrackers get tun&#x2F;tap pairs we manage outside of Nomad, it&#x27;s reasonably simple to make them do what we want.<p>I think we&#x27;ll ultimately move off for custom orchestration but we want to wait as long as possible before we do that.')
