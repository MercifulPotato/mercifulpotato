Isn’t the site clear?<p>I (still, 5 years later) have `14.01 Timesheets`, and within there I have `yymm` folders which contain each entry.<p>14.02 is still free. So yep, a ‘wasted’ category there ... but I have a hundred to play with, and really rarely use more than about 30 in a complete system.')
