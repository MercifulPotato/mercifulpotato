But the problem-space of programming is very complex. So while a new language does something better than some existing languages the language designers do not foresee all problems that may arise in actual use.<p>Maybe a way to proceed would be to have a common set of code which every new language would try to rewrite, and thus see how much better it is, or is not,  than the existing ones.
