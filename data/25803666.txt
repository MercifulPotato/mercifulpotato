It&#x27;s a perfectly cromulent car at this point: including a couple features Tesla 3 doesn&#x27;t have like hatchback and headlights that steer into curves.<p>But despite Mary Barra saying they&#x27;re all-in on electric, it&#x27;s still a gesture at ~20k sold&#x2F;year. It&#x27;s partly on the channels: I had to argue with several dealers to get a test drive because many are both threatened by the Bolt and ignorant of it. I finally found a good dealer with stock and knowledge to give me a test drive last year.  Mary has been open that half the company is a liability, as well.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.barrons.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;mary-barra-on-general-motors-all-electric-future-51605317984" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.barrons.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;mary-barra-on-general-motor...</a>')
