That&#x27;a a distinguishing characteristic of this one.<p>Edit: here is what the curve looks like without suppression measures in place. In NYC they came essentially to capacity very quickly. Imagine if that curve had of kept going, it would have been very bad.<p>It&#x27;s the same R0 everywhere, the &#x27;effective R&#x27; will come down to the difference being the age and relative health of the population, and of course other suppressive measures being taken.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forward.ny.gov&#x2F;daily-hospitalization-summary-region" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forward.ny.gov&#x2F;daily-hospitalization-summary-region</a>\n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www1.nyc.gov&#x2F;site&#x2F;doh&#x2F;covid&#x2F;covid-19-data.page" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www1.nyc.gov&#x2F;site&#x2F;doh&#x2F;covid&#x2F;covid-19-data.page</a>')
