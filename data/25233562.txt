All I was meaning was that many publicatons (especially N American), write stories about EP votes as if they were closer to &#x27;national&#x27; votes.<p>You make my point exactly by saying &#x27;If MEPs want something badly enough&#x27;. Yes, they will get their way if it is of &quot;important&quot; European interest, but I sincrely doubt that the EP will bring the comission to a standstill over USB C charging for phones or right of repairability.<p>My point really was these stories often get published without caveating they are basically non binding votes with no real meaning.')
