So, all the additional work beyond design and coding also falls on the owning engineer. And since we are frugal that engineer is happy to get maybe 1 additional engineer assigned to help. But often that one will also have their own project they own or need to prepare for owning.<p>So the lead&#x2F;owning engineers turn into mostly product and project managers but are still expected to do the down to earth construction of the product which means to get anything done in the expected time frame engineers need to put in long hours.<p>I just don&#x27;t get it. It seems utterly wasteful use of resources. I&#x27;m not saying engineers cannot be good at these things, but generally speaking product and project managers cannot and do not need to be able to code in addition to owning a project&#x2F;product. Adding&#x2F;hiring more project managers to projects would be the single most effective way to speed up project timelines as it frees the engineers, the producers of tangible product deliverables to focus on that.<p>In no way do I mean engineers should be cloistered away from dealing with product or project decisions or even chatting with users. But it needs to be in the correct proportion to the actual engineering work.<p>Add to that the addition of duplicate processes (e.g. we are dealing with 3 right now that cover the same ground but are ever slightly different in what needs to be done to cause triple effort) and everything grinds to a halt. A project manager could also be the right person to push back on management and dedicate resources to improving project management overall.')
