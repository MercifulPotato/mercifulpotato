The business is a separate legal entity with its own income, expenditures, and assets that is under the control of its owner.  <i>Assuming</i> that you want to continue owning the business as a going concern, it makes sense to maximize expenditures (by investing in the future) and minimize profits when tax rates are high.  But if you&#x27;re happy entering and exiting the business as a whole, it makes sense to sell it (transferring money equal to its value to your personal balance sheet) when taxes are low and about to go up, and then just not work while taxes are high.<p>Inflation can put a bit of a wrinkle in this, since if you get $20M for your business and then you find that that&#x27;s worth the equivalent of $2M in 5-10 years it can crimp your early retirement.')
