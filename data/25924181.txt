Mine was that millions of people choose from a variety of treatment options and that there&#x27;s no clear evidence that a pill is vastly preferred to an injection or even some more invasive delivery method. I think my link about birth control usage just shows that the more options, the better. Presumably we&#x27;ll cover the at-risk population better if there are more good options.<p>I think this is a wonderful thing and that we should spread the word when these new treatments are available so that more people know they have options if they like the sound of occasional injections but don&#x27;t like daily pills or vice versa.')
