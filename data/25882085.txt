However, everyone seems to believe things will get better in spring and summer. I would consider it &quot;safe&quot;, but opportunities to meet (new) people or to travel and &quot;do tourism&quot; will be very limited to non-existent. This could continue into 2022, with another &quot;isolation winter&quot;.<p>At the moment, several areas with high rates of infection are enforcing a &quot;15 kilometer radius&quot; around the county you are living in that you are only allowed to leave &quot;when necessary&quot; (e.g. for business). Some have a curfew after 9pm. There is no strong enforcement however, and it unlikely you are going to get asked what you are doing outside during the day. In general, you are more or less not allowed to travel for recreational purposes, and only &quot;necessary&quot; shops are allowed to open.<p>That said, it is not totally crazy to move to Germany at the moment, and plenty of reasons to do so. It is not &quot;unsafe&quot;.')
