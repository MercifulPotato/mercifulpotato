I cannot do a monthly dance of &#x27;library blah is no longer maintained, please try library vlah which, by the way, is completely incompatible API wise!&#x27;. I need stuff that runs fine in a decade and where the maintainers respect backwards compatibility. I have not been let down by the past decades of JVM (and PHP but I never used many libraries there, so not a good example) and last decade of .NET in that regard. I carefully make sure i know my dependencies (read the code, check maintainers; ecosystems that have millions of tiny libraries cannot work for me; I like my sleep). Things simply work and they work, without much issues, after major upgrades of libraries and runtimes throughout the years. My business goals clash with fast moving things; my clients don&#x27;t want them and I don&#x27;t want to maintain them. And yet my software runs under the hood of &#x27;hip&#x27; companies; they build fast moving stuff on top of it; I like it that way.')
