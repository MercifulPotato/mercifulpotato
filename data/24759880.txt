When I compare the attack surface area of us deploying our own OS in the cloud vs just a handful of lambdas, it seems like a great way to let Amazon do the security work for us. If we were doing more in the cloud it may make sense for us to own that, but otherwise it would require us to spin up a whole set of dedicated devops just to maintain it and monitor it that we can avoid with serverless.')
