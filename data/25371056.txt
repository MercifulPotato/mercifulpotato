Rees is not a population. the Law of large doesn&#x27;t apply. He might have been too optimistic. Even if he is overly pessimistic, maybe the inflation of risk isn&#x27;t that significant. Or it is significant, but the risk is so great, that even after subtracting the inflation, it is still dangerous.<p>The point is, applying a statistical heuristic without supplying the actual parameters is meaningless. The heuristic itself is not bullshit. The application in this case certainly is.')
