You are comparing people protesting against a constant threat to their lives from law enforcement - ask any black parent about &quot;the talk&quot; - to people protesting losing an election fomented by lies.\n\n  On one side you have a real issue impacting the life of millions of people daily, on the other you have an issue artificially created based on lies, falsehoods and misdirection.\n\n  These are not even remotely similar events, not by any measure. The response to these events from law enforcement was not close, nor comparable.\n\n  Stop this false equivalence.</code></pre>')
