Sorry to hear about your experience with university and debt. At least, now that it&#x27;s paid off, you can start building up something, instead of working for nothing.<p>&gt; to pay off that debt, it felt like literal slavery<p>This is what I feel is almost criminal about systematically committing university students to years-long debt. Education shouldn&#x27;t have to be traded for years of someone&#x27;s life - especially when most of the labor market expects them to have at least a degree.<p>I think the root of the problem is deeper than education (as a business) though - it&#x27;s how society is organized. To have a minimum standard of living, one must eat every day and have a place to stay - which is already a kind of debt, a constant need for money. Poor people are essentially enslaved to dead-end jobs, just to be able to survive.<p>Hopefully, in a sensible&#x2F;utopian future, we will look back on this social arrangement as barbaric, inhumane and uncivilized. Until then, best of luck navigating, adapting, flourishing despite the setbacks.')
