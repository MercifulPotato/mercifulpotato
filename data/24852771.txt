Not that the vdom is an implementation detail. But to me, the fact that there is an immediate-mode rendering API for the web is far more notable than &quot;Components&quot; take the place of HTML elements.<p>Everything interesting &amp; notable about components relates to the fact that they are immediate-mode things. Nothing else is particularly notable or interesting or important about them, has parity with what HTML Elements did&#x2F;do.<p>Regardless of intent or deliberation, this, to me, is the clear &amp; obvious technical difference that underpins whatever goals the team thought they were shooting for. It&#x27;s the major characterization of how React was different from other webdev we&#x27;d tried. Everything else is downstream of that specific choice, for how to &quot;draw&quot; HTML: immediate-mode.')
