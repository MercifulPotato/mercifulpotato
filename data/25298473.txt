Item(by='jedimind', descendants=None, kids=[25298559], score=None, time=1607051492, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25293372, text='&gt; Users could, of course, still overdose if they mix cocaine with other drugs, but education campaigns should hopefully mitigate that risk, and in any case it won&#x27;t be any worse than what happens when those same people mix effectively unknown illegal substances.<p>I highly doubt that young people who take cocaine to party will be type of people who will listen or dedicate their time to education campaigns.<p>&gt; in any case it won&#x27;t be any worse than what happens when those same people mix effectively unknown illegal substances.<p>That&#x27;s a bold claim which I would like to see substantiated with evidence. How could one possibly foresee the potential damage that could be caused by cocaine going mainstream once it is legalised. I&#x27;m just here to have a conversation and ask questions, just so the downvote trigger people don&#x27;t lose their minds in anger because someone dares to question their narrative.')
