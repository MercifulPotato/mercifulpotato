Isn&#x27;t that the very reason you gave for why Twitter is not removing those hate speech filled posts? Because they are surprise, surprise low engagement posts.<p>Nope. You see you tacked on your own little part that changes the meaning in a HUGE way.<p>Parler eschewed censorship <i>period.</i><p>You&#x27;re slowly inching towards getting this<p>No matter how much engagement a post had, how much vitriol someone spewed, literally the first page is promising there is no deplatforming a user for their speech.<p>So when your differentiator is you don&#x27;t censor <i>at all</i>, you become a lightning rod for things like hate speech!<p>-<p>I mean seriously this applies to ANYTHING: imagine a burger place called &quot;WcDonalds&quot;<p>We have an 1:1 equivalent to menu to McDonalds.<p>But we&#x27;re lesser known, long term prospects are unknown.<p>Despite that we aim to be functionally equivalent to McDonalds with one small twist...<p>We allow drug use in our restaurants.<p>Let&#x27;s say it&#x27;s a state that decriminalized drugs, we allow you to toke up in line, as you eat, we&#x27;re saying its your right.<p>-<p>Who do you think ends up going to our WcDonalds?<p>If someone claims WcDonalds locations are just full of drug users, are you going to go &quot;you have no proof of that!!!!&quot;? Isn&#x27;t it common sense that&#x27;s the outcome?<p>That&#x27;s Parler and Twitter. The biggest draw to Parler is that you have free speech regardless of engagement, where Twitter is limited speech. Anything that doesn&#x27;t fit in the Twitter limited speech, including hate speech and racism, is going to be attracted  to Parler.<p>And in Twitter when you see it you can report it and there&#x27;s a reason for it to be removed! Even if it fails for old low enagament posts!<p>But on Parler, <i>by design</i>, that content will not be removed. No matter how big it gets, how many reports it has, by design, the user won&#x27;t be deplatformed.<p>-<p>Also seriously I want you to clarify if you actually think Twitter only deletes Right Wing comments, it&#x27;s a pretty off the wall claim that harms the weight of any further discussion')
