But my money is on the Debians - and more specifically, on Ubuntu.<p>For server stuff, Ubuntu is great - commercial support with various cloud providers, lots of prepackaged software (including the commercial software I use).<p>For hiring, a lot of students run either Debian or Ubuntu on their own computers - meaning I don&#x27;t have to teach them the intricacies of rpm like apt search is rpm -Q, apt install is rpm -i ...<p>Icing on the cake is ZFS as the rootfs filesystem out of the box since the last few Ubuntus.<p>RedHat was innovative, like when they replaced ext4 by XFS as the default filesystem, but that was like 15 years ago.<p>Still, big money make miracles happen. If IBM can arrange some relicensing of ZFS with Oracle, they could use it on RedHat, but it&#x27;d take me a lot of cajoling to even consider switching back - much more than a filesystem that&#x27;s the minimal prerequisite to just put RedHat on the list of options. Bitten once, twice shy you know?<p>Anyway, given how it&#x27;s favored for WSL, Microsoft will eventually fork or buy Ubuntu from Canonical or just buy Canonical outright, which will make it even more of a rival to RedHat in the long term.')
