The pieces are out there where someone else could put together an ARM based package that&#x27;s more competitive with Apple. In retrospect, maybe it&#x27;s more likely to see something like this from Nvidia than Qualcomm.<p>Even then, it&#x27;s hard to say how competitive that CPU would be. Just based on Microsoft&#x27;s Surface with it&#x27;s half-assed Qualcomm CPU, it seems feasible though.')
