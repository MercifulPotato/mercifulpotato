We&#x27;re already seeing the world of Linux according to Microsoft now. It&#x27;s one where Linux is ideally on Windows with WSL, uses proprietary stacks like DirectX and of course Edge.<p>What I loved about Linux was that it was not encumbered by attempts to lock in intellectual property (with the idea of future monetising, of course). Yet all the big players are pushing lots of kernel patches to suit their own cloud-based use and ecosystems. Distributions are trying to lock-in like all the commercial players now. Consider Ubuntu with its snap store that can only be run by Canonical.<p>I really don&#x27;t like where Linux is headed now that Microsoft and the other big players love it so much... I&#x27;m strongly considering moving back to FreeBSD for a desktop. Yes there&#x27;s Netflix with some input but that&#x27;s about it.')
