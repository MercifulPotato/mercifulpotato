Personally I&#x27;ve not seen a huge amount of apps on linux that cater for different user audiences.  As technical aware users we vastly over-estimate the amount of technical knowledge and patience an average user has to figure something out.<p>* Apple is now offering an audience from a multitude of devices.  You can build your app for a watch, phone, tablet or desktop.  e.g. if someone buys your app on the iPhone they are more likely to be interested in your apps for other devices so there&#x27;s more opportunity to cross-sell.<p>Ubuntu is probably the closest I see to being able to set some proper direction here.  But I&#x27;ve yet to see them double-down and really set their mind to it, they seem to set a direction hold for while then back-down and go another direction.  From the outside, it seems like anytime they&#x27;ve really tried to do something different or _the horror_ make some money it seems to just rile up the vocal linux community.')
