We take this for granted elsewhere in our lives.<p>You buy a refrigerator, the fridge company doesn&#x27;t get to tell you that too bad you&#x27;re only allowed to keep soda in their $80 dedicated &quot;Soda rack&quot; and that little shelf is only for vegetables - you can just put your soda there anyway, and if you want you can even make or buy a gizmo that dispenses cans just the way you want, screw their $80 plastic garbage, you made one from stainless steel scrap at community college.<p>You can take Free Software like pass to pieces to understand how it works too.<p>The thing I keep coming back to is how it uses &#x27;tr&#x27; to get random passwords, because it&#x27;s so simple and yet when you step back it&#x27;s obviously the correct design. The method goes like this:<p>Unix &#x27;tr&#x27; has a mode where it just ignores all input except the character classes you selected which pass through. So e.g. you can say you want passwords with just A-Z0-9. Hook it up to &#x2F;dev&#x2F;urandom and the device spews random bytes into it. All the ones that aren&#x27;t acceptable are just thrown away. Then you catch the desired length of output from &#x27;tr&#x27; and you&#x27;re done.<p>I&#x27;ve seen software attempt to try to bodge a budget of random bits into a fixed character set, which is very difficult to do safely and correctly - but &#x27;pass&#x27; just doesn&#x27;t try to do that at all, why bother when you can make as many random bytes as you want anyway?')
