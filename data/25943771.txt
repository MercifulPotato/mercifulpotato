It might never happen in practice, but it’s a risk. And in practice, the cost of a small&#x2F;medium server on a VPS is anyway the same (or higher) cost you would pay for a paid plan on Github which comes with much better uptime overall.<p>&gt; Time to clone, fetch, push, will be much faster, it&#x27;s common to find dedicated servers with at least 100Mbps of dedicated bandwidth<p>This depends on the number of users who use your Gitlab instance. It would not be the case for medium sized companies. For your own use case, fine. But for a project like curl? That might be pulled constantly from all around the world?<p>GitHub best feature is, actually, the amazing user experience it provides, which is often overlooked and compared against the myriad of features Gitlab provides - despite Gitlab being way, way less user friendly than Github.')
