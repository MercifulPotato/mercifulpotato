China is the perfect example to show how ridiculous this is - even with the 1-child policy for 30 years, China&#x27;s population is 1.4 billion people.  Imagine what that would be if such a policy hadn&#x27;t been enacted.  For many countries (and the Earth as a whole), making it easier and less expensive to have more children is exactly the wrong thing to do.')
