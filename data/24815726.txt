The caveat is - the type of data matters quite a bit for the data architecture. There&#x27;s another thread that mentions sensor data as a source of complexity since the data has a theoretical delay between events (i.e. period) of 0 - something few systems are built to handle, even if you sample approximations at some fixed frequency. Algorithmic trading is a similar domain that still has a huge bar for entry - a sign that _this isn&#x27;t easy_.<p>The fidelity of the data is of course important, but I would claim it&#x27;s not a blocker. Yes, you need to trust the data you collect. That&#x27;s table stakes - if you can&#x27;t collect data correctly at all, even without worrying about the past, you&#x27;re in for a world of hurt. It&#x27;s P0. That said, a lot of people assume you also need to do this historically - and that&#x27;s not the case - at least for ML.<p>Reinforcement learning has been making great strides in recent years. If you&#x27;re in this situation - you have a flow where you want to use a model without having any past data to train with - use something like VW&#x27;s contextual bandits [1]. You don&#x27;t need historical data to build your model, just real-time decision point &amp; reward signals. Once deployed, the model converges over time to the optimal model using real-time feedback.<p>All that said - baby steps are important. If you&#x27;re in this situation, start by getting fidelity and then expand scope slowly without sacrifice to fidelity. It&#x27;s a lot easier to backfill than to &quot;fix&quot; data - get that right and it get&#x27;s easier from there. You&#x27;ll need fixups regardless - mistakes happen and requirements change - but you have to start with something you trust, at least in the moment it&#x27;s deployed.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vowpalwabbit.org&#x2F;tutorials&#x2F;contextual_bandits.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vowpalwabbit.org&#x2F;tutorials&#x2F;contextual_bandits.html</a>')
