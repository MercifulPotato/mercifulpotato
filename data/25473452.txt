I would consider buying an A1 if such a thing were possible. But I&#x27;ll buy AMD and build a desktop even though that&#x27;s not ideal when I travel (I&#x27;ll have to downgrade to my old MBP). But if I buy a system I want to run Linux for work and windows for games. Apple and I will just never get along if they can&#x27;t open up their hardware.')
