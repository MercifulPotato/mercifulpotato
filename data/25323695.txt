What choose boring technology really means is choose boring technology for anything not related to your competitive advantage. It is the engineering equivalent of MBA advice to differentiate between core and context, and choose boring technology for anything that fits in &quot;context&quot;. Maybe your business&#x27;s competitive advantage isn&#x27;t related to your technology stack, in which case, all of your technology had better be boring.
