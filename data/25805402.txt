Points of contention:<p>1. It&#x27;s not <i>necessarily</i> interesting to point out what JavaScript <i>was</i> as a rebuttal of what it <i>is</i>. This is a genetic fallacy. If you think that some mistakes are baked into the cake - you&#x27;re probably right, though you&#x27;d need to expound on that point. However, if you compare JavaScript today to the original JavaScript spec, it&#x27;s not even close: modern JavaScript is profoundly more suitable as a language for the web.<p>2. I appreciate the hybrid style of JavaScript.<p>3. The small JS std-lib problem is only partially true nowadays, and it is a problem easily fleshed out with tried, tested utility libraries, like lodash.<p>4. TypeScript&#x2F;jsdoc do not change JavaScript into the language you want it to be, but simple type hints, in my experience, give it some of that expressiveness of a strict type system with most of the power of a dynamic, loosely typed language.<p>5. I feel profoundly productive in JS. That is, as opposed to other, more &quot;robust&quot; languages, and many developers feel the same way. In fact, I probably feel most productive in node, though I probably could be close in golang with more practice. As a productive tool, it fits the bill, not just for me, but for many programmers. For this reason alone, I don&#x27;t see any kind of paradigm shift forthcoming, especially if your alternative is something like Rust, which is a strawman position that I won&#x27;t knock down.')
