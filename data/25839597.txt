The easy charges come first, because the evidence needed to make them withstand a probable cause hearing is trivial.<p>&gt; They weren&#x27;t even charged with rioting because<p>...For the people (those charged only in D.C. Superior Court) for whom more serious charges weren&#x27;t already clearly available, the unlawful entry charge is open and shut for arrest and extra charges while investigation continues as to the full set of charges each should face doesn&#x27;t actually do anything. Also, riot in the D.C. code <i>isn&#x27;t</i> a more serious offense than unlawful entry on public property.<p>While for those already charged in US District Court for US Code offenses, most of which are felonies, the D.C. Code misdemeanor for rioting is an irrelevancy.')
