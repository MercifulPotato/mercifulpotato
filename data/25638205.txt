Item(by='flagrant', descendants=None, kids=[25638496], score=None, time=1609795081, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25638114, text='&gt; In [0] it states that 2020 is an average year in deaths<p>It does not.<p>&gt; In [1] it shows averages for the previous years in numbers summing while years up.<p>This still has no relation to deaths in the year 2020. You cannot tell anything about deaths caused by coronavirus from data that only goes up to 2019.<p>&gt; &quot;The growing spread of Coronavirus in the community is not year showed any change in the number of deaths in Sweden&quot;<p>My translation is &quot;The increasing spread of the coronavirus in society is not yet visible in the number of deaths in Sweden&quot;, meaning, &quot;there may be more coronavirus cases than we can tell from just looking at deaths&quot;. A significantly different meaning to &quot;coronavirus did not cause any change in number of deaths&quot;, which is in any case flatly contradicted by the same article which describes increases in excess deaths in the second quarter.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, I am willing to believe that despite the massive increase in excess deaths in the second quarter, it could be offset by reductions in excess deaths in other quarters. So if you do have data that specifically compares excess deaths for the last few years feel free to share it. Currently you haven&#x27;t got anything to support your statement.')
