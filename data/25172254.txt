For example in the case of Rubocop, when all of the sudden cop was a loaded word. The developer seemingly got harassed when he didn&#x27;t want to change the name.<p>I think we are losing more than we are gaining by going through with this. Not because of master or main but because we are seemingly not assuming best intentions when communicating anymore.')
