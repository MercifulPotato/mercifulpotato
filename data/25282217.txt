This includes a staggering amount of items: food, clothes, containers, cookware, makeup, cleaning supplies, paint, home goods, medicine, electronics. It&#x27;s an impossible task, but I see a lot of people doing the same: building a personalized set of things to watch out for. (Buy organic, wash produce&#x2F;grains&#x2F;beans, avoid anything scented, avoid homeopathic, avoid styrofoam, avoid hydrogenated oil, avoid Teflon&#x2F;PTFEs, avoid perc, avoid food dyes, avoid plastic fabrics, on and on)<p>Government has a role in making this information accessible at the time of purchase or use. I can read the food ingredients, the fabric material, the cancer warning, the VOC rating. And I can make a simple decision about what to buy if I so desire.<p>But there are untold cases where the information is not easily accessible, where it&#x27;s difficult to identify a trustworthy source, and where we are advertised products that actively hide their harm.<p>I would like to have more confidence that I&#x27;m buying safe products. I don&#x27;t know what the solution is, so I just keep adding to my list.')
