Since, presumably, all straight couples can do so, Facebook would effectively imply that gay couples are somehow &quot;wrong&quot; and should not be shown to people. I would find that deeply immoral because gay people are not worth less than straight people.<p>I&#x27;ll just change a few things:<p>Well, it depends a bit on what is meant by &quot;banning womens nipples&quot;, but suppose that a woman wouldn&#x27;t be allowed to post their nipple pictures. Since, presumably, all men can do so, Facebook would effectively imply that womens nipples are somehow &quot;wrong&quot; and should not be shown to people. I would find that deeply immoral because womens nipples are not worth less than mens nipples.<p>You&#x27;re basically saying iran is right to jail women not wearing headscarfs, because their culture and morals say that it&#x27;s somehow wrong for women to go outside uncovered, while man can do that.... oh wait... replace &quot;iran&quot; with &quot;facebook&quot;, &quot;jail&quot; with &quot;delete photos&quot;, and &quot;headscarfs&quot; with &quot;nipples&quot;.<p>So basically, by your logic, discrimination is ok, as long as it&#x27;s nipples, and not anything lgbt related. I mean, showing womens nipples is immoral in america, showing womens faces is immoral in iran, and women kissing women is immoral probably in iran too... as a not-american, it&#x27;s interesting to me, that you&#x27;re against respecting what&#x27;s im&#x2F;moral in iran, even if it&#x27;s clear discrimination, but don&#x27;t care about discrimination if it involves american morals.')
