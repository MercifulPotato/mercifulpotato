The &quot;git experts&quot; that I know of are no more productive than me and more often than not do annoying things like rewriting commit histories after I made comments in their PRs, that I&#x27;m not convinced it&#x27;s worth the day or two I need to learn it fully. In the end git is not in production, it&#x27;s just a tool to manage code, I&#x27;d rather be an expert on the code than the coding tool. This is probably akin to trying to understand how your car works when all you need it to do is get you to work. Changing tires is about as much as anyone who&#x27;s trying to be productive should know about their car. Call a mechanic for anything else.')
