Those are the most obvious things that you can change with no experience.<p>I also gave him a first mental model of how it works. You have a genie, he sees you want to make a label called &quot;height&quot; and put a integer, 5, in it. He decrements it by 1, places a tower of the height, walks over, etc... until you have a 5,4,3,2,1 triangle.<p>But I don&#x27;t try to push it too much. I think it&#x27;s good at age 7 or 8 to be exposed slightly, but unless your kid is a prodigy it ain&#x27;t gonna click for a while. We just want to marinate them gently for a bit until it hits them.<p>MC is good because he plays it a lot and occasionally it comes up that you want to be able to do something quickly instead of placing hundreds of blocks. Or you want to copy something you built. The MC Python code allows you to write a script that does this.')
