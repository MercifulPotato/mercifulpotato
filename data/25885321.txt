Recent studies were pointing results almost too good to believe (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.medrxiv.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;10.1101&#x2F;2020.11.08.20222638v2" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.medrxiv.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;10.1101&#x2F;2020.11.08.20222638v...</a>), but a big-scale clinical trial is still needed to confirm such a cheap and and effective treatment. I know all hopes are put now on speeding up the vaccination rate, which is great, but it&#x27;s honestly hard to believe the lack of quality in the discussion of scientific controversies like this one about VitD. To begin with, even after millions of euros having been put into research of the VitD deficiency pandemic (for instance: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;28516265&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;28516265&#x2F;</a>), it&#x27;s almost impossible to find comparable, raw data to independently re-analyze previous studies... The practice of science nowadays really sucks. For sure, science-deniers suck even more, but that&#x27;s no excuse.')
