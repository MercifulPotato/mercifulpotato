Every time they get caught they feint an apology and proceed to either ignore the issue, continue that same practice but in a different way, or engage in some new abusive scheme. It is foundational to them because it is fundamentally part of Mark Zuckerberg’s ethics, or lack there of as the case appears to be.<p>So... in my opinion anyone going to work for Facebook, or continuing to work for them is no different than someone doing the same at a tobacco company. They know what is going on at those organizations and they are choosing to look the other way. That in and of itself is not illegal, of course, but they can’t cry foul when they get accused of doing immoral and unethical things while employed there.')
