If any of the emails you sent were modified by Google, you would be outraged, but we should just accept &quot;editorial control&quot; over Twitter, Facebook, HN, etc.?<p>I think that&#x27;s the real debate happening here. It&#x27;s not just about censorship, it&#x27;s about exercising control over the content. Many feel strongly that this sort of control should be in the hands of the creators of that content, not editors&#x2F;moderators&#x2F;site owners&#x2F;etc.<p>&gt; This site also allows us to edit our comments, without the explicit consent of every person who responds to them.<p>I would be ok if the person who originally submitted the article made that change himself and there was a history associated with the submission that showed the change. That&#x27;s the creator exercising control.<p>&gt; This isn&#x27;t a direct democracy, it&#x27;s a news aggregator.<p>It&#x27;s kind of acting like a newspaper though? If content is being edited, that&#x27;s the job of an editor. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s such a far stretch to imagine top comments being edited to improve the conversation, etc. at that point, what&#x27;s the distinction with a newspaper?')
