Development got a whole\nlot simpler, everything is more enjoyable and to date there&#x27;s\nbeen exactly one noteworthy issue which was resolved after a\nquick search and 10 minutes.<p>And since then I&#x27;ve never seen a &quot;new update available&quot; popup\ndialog, no ads, no Cortana, no &quot;smart&quot; features, and most\ndefinitely no need to install third-party software to actually\nhave a usable file search. I even update much more frequently\nthan Windows 10 every forced me to, because for some reason I\njust never have any issues and I can just do it in the\nbackground.')
