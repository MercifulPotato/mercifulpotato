And if you know exactly what the end product will be then designing the car is not fundamentally different from building it since in essence the car is already designed, you just hammer out the details. A programmer who just picks tasks from a kanban is not creative, he just adds code to do the thing the board requests. Doing more stuff from the board all else being the same is always better, he is an additive worker. If he does it faster but produce shoddy work it is the same as if a factory worker works faster but produce shoddy parts on the car, meaning he will get fired because he ruins it.')
