I didn&#x27;t change the Sidekiq configuration, which still uses concurrency: 25.<p>Strangely, tonight I&#x27;ve seen the first exceptions like `ActiveRecord::ConnectionTimeoutError: could not obtain a connection from the pool within 5.000 seconds (waited 5.000 seconds); all pooled connections were in use` in many, many years.<p>All of these exceptions came from within Sidekiq Workers, which is strange because, like I pointed, I didn&#x27;t change the Sidekiq concurrency, only the database.yml pool, which shouldn&#x27;t affect workers.')
