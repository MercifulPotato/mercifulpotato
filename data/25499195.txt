Why is dying due to an explicit action any more of a free choice than dying of an explicit inaction?<p>Because one is coercion and the other is simply an economic system. Which by the way is also used for all the other necessities of life too. How about food?<p>The whole point of a free market is competition, so if you were at least arguing for emergency situations there&#x27;s be something to talk about since it&#x27;s rather hard to shop around. But we&#x27;d still need to compare it to how well the government handles economics of emergencies.
