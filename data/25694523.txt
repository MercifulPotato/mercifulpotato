We can do it with phone numbers, we can do it with banks (at least in Europe). I don&#x27;t see a reason why we couldn&#x27;t apply the same on social media and auth providers.<p>Banned from &quot;login with apple&quot;? I should have a right to transfer my account to &quot;login with google&#x2F;facebook&#x2F;my own server&quot; and it should work.

He should be able to transfer his account to Parler and I should still see his tweets in my Twitter feed, be able to retweet it to my followers, interact with it, etc. Twitter wouldn&#x27;t be able to influence tweets from Parler so it would show in timeline. But they could decide to not display it in proprietary parts of their system (search, trending topics, whatever)<p>This way we would prevent echo chambers and deplatforming, while simultaneously allowing companies to maintain their freedom to moderate their own space.')
