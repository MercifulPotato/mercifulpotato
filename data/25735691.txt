Item(by='JabavuAdams', descendants=None, kids=[25735936], score=None, time=1610395671, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25713808, text='Agree with most of what you&#x27;ve written -- thanks for the thoughtful response. Was going to respond that I recall the F-35 uses C++, but that&#x27;s probably not a good argument ...<p>Regarding choice of language, I&#x27;ve reached a level of general competence where I don&#x27;t really find any intractable problems that I can&#x27;t handle with my toolset. So part of this may be just personal preference where there&#x27;s no justification for slogging through the cost of learning yet another language, especially if I don&#x27;t find it fun to program in. I used to invest a lot of time in learning new languages but I no longer find this a good use of my time.<p>I own a handful of Haskell books, and I was originally interested in Haskell for abstraction &#x2F; DSLs. One idea was to go directly from a human-readable binary file-format description to an importer&#x2F;exporter for that file type.<p>Questions on a couple of themes:<p>1) I have gone back to uni to study biophysics and learning biology deeply as well as previous machine-learning experience is making me think that fuzzy &#x2F; probabilistic &#x2F; redundant is actually the way to go for reliable complex systems. What we consider to be complex computer systems are actually ridiculously simple compared to biological mechanisms.<p>2) Are we in a transitional phase such that inventing better programming languages is an inefficient (though of course interesting and possibly instructive) path? Do we get machine-programmers soon enough that programming-language design stops mattering? By analogy think of all the effort still being spent on machine-readable data formats when we&#x27;re close to having machines that read. At that point anything human-readable becomes machine-readable and your schema doesn&#x27;t really matter.')
