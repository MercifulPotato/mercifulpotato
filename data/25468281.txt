I simply cannot follow &quot;the flow&quot;.<p>I expect an RSS style newsreader. I just want to see what&#x27;s new, in order.<p>IMHO John Carmacks&#x27; old school finger file updates was the pinnacle of human achievement. Just aggregate everyone&#x27;s finger updates into a swanky offline mail reader style UI. Heaven.<p>I don&#x27;t understand why links aren&#x27;t links. eg Open this in a new tab.<p>I don&#x27;t understand why pull quotes are images.<p>And tellingly, I don&#x27;t care enough to figure it out, find a better way.<p>PS- One thing missing from Twitter is the drive-by downvote. Too bad.')
