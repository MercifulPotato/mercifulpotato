Some people will check those facts, many others won&#x27;t. If what is written is patently false this will come out soon enough.<p>You call to &quot;stop requiring individuals to verify truth&quot; can be phrased in another, more honest way: <i>support specific organisations to decide where the truth lies</i>. For simple facts - the current temperature, the price of petrol at the pump, the energy content of a portion of a given food - this works. For disputed facts - nearly anything related to SARS2, nearly anything related to climate, nearly anything related to nuclear power, nearly anything related to migration, the veracity and validity of identity politics, the absence or presence of &quot;systemic&quot; racism - this patently fails since the gatekeeper gets to impose its own views on the public. When that gatekeeper happens to be the 500lbs gorilla in the field that means the public has to do exactly what you decry to be <i>ridiculous</i>: they have to go check whether the presented facts are true or just the result of the gatekeeper projecting its opinions, a task made harder by that gatekeeper - the 500lbs gorilla - blocking opposing views from its platform.<p>On your measuring tape comparison I can state that measuring tapes sold in e.g. the Netherlands clearly state that they are not to be used for trading purposes (&quot;niet voor handelsdoeleinden&quot;) since they are not officially calibrated. Just like scales, pumps and other measuring equipment measuring tapes&#x2F;sticks&#x2F;etc. used for trading purposes need to be calibrated, get stamped that they are, complete with a calibration expiry date. So, yes, if it really matters you <i>do</i> ask for a calibrated measuring device.')
