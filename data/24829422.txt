I leave the Nvidia off permanently because it&#x27;s the only way I can have a laptop that supports multiple monitors and doesn&#x27;t fucking chew through battery. I couldn&#x27;t give a toss about graphics performance, this is a work machine so I&#x27;m not playing games on it. Fuck Nvidia, and fuck Lenovo for making the Nvidia necessary in order for the hdmi port to work.')
