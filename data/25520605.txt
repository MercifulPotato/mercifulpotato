Item(by='bavila', descendants=None, kids=[25520665], score=None, time=1608748754, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25520032, text='I recently had a technical interview where I stumbled the whole way through, but I kept my attitude lighthearted, asked plenty of dumb questions, and am pretty sure I even said &quot;Oh, geez, I&#x27;m an idiot&quot; at one point. They acknowledged that I was a weak candidate, but they liked me enough to extend an offer amounting to a 33% salary increase over my current job--and with an additional 33% bump after 6 months if I can prove that I am actually not so much of an idiot. :)<p>Humility and earnestness can go a long way. A big ego never helps.')
