If anything, it&#x27;s pretty explicit.<p>If you try to install apk from say, your browser (the most likely \nscenario for Fortnite), the system would ask you to give it the privilege to install &quot;unknown&#x2F;unsafe app&quot; or whatever it&#x27;s called. And you only need to change this setting once. Later you can just directly install any APK from this app (browser).')
