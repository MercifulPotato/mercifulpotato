Since 10&#x2F;10 sounds good, but doesn’t actually mean something is safe.<p>Also the name is “scorecard” that again connotes that a high score is good. I don’t get a 10&#x2F;10 on my assignment because I did my homework, said hello to the teacher each morning, and was polite to my classmates.<p>Those are all positive things and if I wanted to measure students they may be a part of the grade. But if I only graded on these factors that’s not terribly useful.<p>Process measures are good when it’s not possible to measure outcome, but I think in this situation more outcome measures could be factored in.')
