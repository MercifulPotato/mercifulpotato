I really wanted to quit, be my own boss, and have more impact on the world around me.<p>In a lot of failure stories, I have seen a similar starts. Entrepreneurs wanting to be their own bosses and hoping that they will stumble on to a problem that will change the world. If you don&#x27;t have a problem already, it&#x27;s a brute force approach that takes a lot of resources including your health. I believe one should always start with a problem.<p>Secondly, being &quot;my own boss&quot; is really impossible if you are working on real and hard problems that succeed. Often times, your customer is your boss. To solve for motivation, you need to give sufficient autonomy and ownership to your team.')
