Today we already have large scale automated scams via email and robo call. Less scalable scams like Tinder love catfish scams or Russian&#x2F;China trolls on reddit are now run by real people, imagine it being automated. If human moderators cannot distinguish these bots from real humans, that is a scary thought, imagine not being able to tell if this comment was written by a human or robot.')
