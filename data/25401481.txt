I also want to play Celeste[0] because it looks beautiful.<p>But i have to say lately i dislike posts written in this command tone. Like &quot;Do this to become X&quot;&#x2F;&quot;Use this technology for Y&quot;&#x2F;&quot;Don&#x27;t do Z&quot;. Most of the time i end up feeling bad for not knowing something and therefore not being 10x programmer or even feeling antipathy towards the topic or author as i have different views. But in reality these things often don&#x27;t matter or rather it can vary a lot person by person and context by context. You just don&#x27;t need to be a shell literate to be a successful programmer. I wonder if more subtle introductions aren&#x27;t better. Some which would spark interest but wouldn&#x27;t leave a person with a bad feeling if he can&#x27;t get into it right away.<p>[0] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.celestegame.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.celestegame.com&#x2F;</a>')
