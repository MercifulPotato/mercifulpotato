In this personal opinion I see a lot of things I don&#x27;t agree with, but I am old in a sense that I have seen better from Apple and automatically expect more (which is unrealistic at this point in time). In this personal and biased view Desktop Computing is optimisation for interaction real estate, when I work on big screen I expect &quot;more space&quot; for window management and the idea of larger target is some kind of funky experiment with visible goal: to merge desktop and mobile interaction and I don&#x27;t see it usable at all. This approach is &quot;Design for Design&#x27;s Sake&quot; (we don&#x27;t touch MacOS, we use cursor interaction). It heavily reminds me of auto industries approach to replace every physical controller with touch interaction (because its cheap and people like their smartphones).')
