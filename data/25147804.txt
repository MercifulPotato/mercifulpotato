Item(by='ordu', descendants=None, kids=[25148240], score=None, time=1605778965, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25146824, text='I do not know why Google blocks pro-russian sources, but I know why I&#x27;d blocked them, if I could. They are not &quot;pro-russian&quot;, they are all &quot;pro-Putin&quot;. Any &quot;pro-russian&quot; source that is not &quot;pro-Putin&quot; will become &quot;anti-russian&quot; in a short time, because of activity of other &quot;pro-russian&quot; sources. They just forcibly stick &quot;anti-russian&quot; label on such a source, and here we are. Putin do all he could, to draw an equality sign between &quot;Russia&quot; and &quot;Putin&quot;. And it works. Now no media needs to do nothing, &quot;anti-russian&quot; label sicks to any &quot;anti-Putin&quot; media all by itself. I know this, because I&#x27;m russian, I&#x27;m anti-Putin, and I tried to find a &quot;pro-russian&quot; and &quot;anti-putin&quot; source. I tried and failed. There is not such thing.<p>When a media use any material to promote it&#x27;s propaganda ideas, doesn&#x27;t bother with truth, use any dirty trick to mock opponents, it should be blocked.<p>But if Google blocked such dirty media, then what is to remain? Only &quot;anti-Putin&quot; media, which is all marked as &quot;anti-russian&quot;.<p>I repeat: I do not know, why Google blocked &quot;pro-putin&quot; media, maybe due to reasons I described above, maybe because of order from a masonic lodge or from USA government. But the result is the same: all that is not blocked is &quot;anti-russian&quot;.')
