You&#x27;re reading a lot more into my comments than is there. There are a lot of things in life that I don&#x27;t think are OK. I also don&#x27;t try to stop them.<p>Plenty of standup comedians use humor that I find distasteful or even offensive. I just read a book instead of watching them. Plenty of bars are frequented by people I don&#x27;t like. I just go to a different bar.<p>No one has to visit WSB, but I&#x27;d prefer to live in a society that errs on the side of allowing people to congregate and communicate as they see fit.<p>As an aside, I&#x27;ve had to deal with two kinds of assholes in my life: people who use offensive language, and people who get offended at everything. I&#x27;d rather deal with neither, but if I had to chose, I much prefer the former.')
