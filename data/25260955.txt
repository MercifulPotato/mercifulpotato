I put my money where my mouth is and rented in high density new builds in downtown SF for 3 years.  It was utter crap.  There&#x27;s no community, no shared story, and literal crap on the streets.  I&#x27;ve also seen what happens when urbanites move out to the country; they don&#x27;t know how to respect the space of others.  They build monuments to anti-Native American racism right up to the edge of their property line, when they have 10 acres they could have used to gap out like everyone else.<p>The ethos of a place is provided by the people who&#x27;ve lived there for a long time.  That ethos can only be preserved when growth is carefully considered, and doesn&#x27;t screw over the people who&#x27;ve cooperated for a very long time to make the place what it is.')
