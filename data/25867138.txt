Then when when you ask them a question there&#x27;s a 2-second pause while they figure out how to unmute before answering.  Or worse, they start talking without realising they are on mute.<p>Suppose that a user has two microphones - a headset microphone and a microphone built into their laptop.  Is there a software product that would do noise-cancellation of background noise by taking the headset mic signal and subtracting the in-built mic signal?  That would allow the user to leave their mic on without adding background noise to the Zoom call')
