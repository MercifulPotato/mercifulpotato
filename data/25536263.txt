I had gradually reduced contact to everyone who at that point was still trying to stay in touch, getting people used to me not answering the phone or replying to their messages for ever longer periods. I figured noone would be shocked this way when they finally learned that i&#x27;d ditched life.<p>I was in a state of permanent daze and confusion then, lots of drinking and whatever substances I could get my hands on.<p>While I had plans made, I had this spur of the moment idea that seemed pretty sane while I was high: I&#x27;d at least get a kick out of my life being teh suck, so I got myself into a situation with basically 50&#x2F;50 chance of dying and beyond my control. I lived and one of the worst hangovers ever. Since I wasn&#x27;t exactly thrilled with the outcome, I repeated this kind of coin toss with different setups, in total two more times.<p>The experiences were definitely less shit than my reasons for getting to this point in the first place. In fact, I&#x27;d never felt so alive. My problems were not magically gone but now I was curious what else in life I had never thought of, what else I might be missing out on by taking an early exit. I was pretty young and suddenly realized that as of yet I had no idea what to even expect of the future.<p>I regard everything I&#x27;ve experienced since then as bonus time. I got over the reasons for everything being shit and feeling like shit. Turned out it was mental illness responding well to medication.<p>Since then, a lot has happened, both good and bad, but it was worth the ride. I have no more reason to fear death, a luxury few are granted early in life. I know there&#x27;s always an exit option but so far, I&#x27;ve been too curious about what happens next to consider it again.<p>Now, I won&#x27;t tell you bullshit like &quot;hurr durr, life is so beautiful, don&#x27;t throw it awayâ€¦&quot;. The world can be an utter pile of shit and so can the people it spawned and if you go on living, the only thing certain is that you&#x27;ll have to deal with more world shit and more people shit.<p>But consider, if you&#x27;re a curious person, that you&#x27;ll be missing out on a once in a lifetime experience. You&#x27;d be surprised.<p>I don&#x27;t regret having stayed for the encore.')
