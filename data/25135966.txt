This happens when you count and not weigh things.<p>If you are doing GTD, you probably also want to looking in to &#x27;next tasks&#x27; and weekly reviews. Also get out of this habit of trying to fill up your diary with tasks.<p>More importantly opportunity identification and even creating them proactively is easier said than done.<p>GTD is just a process.
