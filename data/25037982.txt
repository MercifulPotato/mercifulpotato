I see the government using &quot;hate&quot; as a reason to implement backdoors and monitor citizens, just like the Patriot Act.<p>Whenever I bring this up, I&#x27;m accused of being &quot;for hate&quot;, when I really just am a big fan of Snowden and don&#x27;t people to give up safety for security. Most people would see a measure to combat hate on the internet and vote for it, not realizing its giving the govt the right to monitor all data or crack down on something that isn&#x27;t even hateful (e.g. Free Palestine, Hong Kong etc).<p>Give the local &quot;community government&quot; the right to run the internet and now the federal govt will be spidered throughout all local govt ISPs.<p>&gt; The bar for restricting what you can access, and for what reasons your service can be cancelled, becomes much higher when it&#x27;s governed by the constitution<p>I wouldn&#x27;t put it past Biden or Harris to issue and executive order for the sake of &quot;hate speech&quot;. I couldn&#x27;t imagine Sanders or even Trump doing that.')
