We can&#x27;t do anything but treat it as a market priced entity - but I wish there was another way - a way to own but not own. Something between rent and own. Maybe if a non-profit organization could somehow start &quot;owning&quot; a bunch of homes and people buy into the organization. For each &quot;owner&quot; they are allocated a house. And then to move is to just find someone else that is moving within this large house owning organization. Kinda like a vast distributed network across the country that owns houses and people pay a standard rate to live in it. If you can&#x27;t pay, you&#x27;re out of the network until you can again.')
