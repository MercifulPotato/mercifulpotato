Item(by='kofejnik', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605478084, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25104839, text='&gt; I wish there was a better support framework in the US for people who want to quit their jobs and work on ideas. I really, really hate working for other people but the things I would like to work on instead are time-consuming and the core work is not easily farmed out.<p>I&#x27;m sorry, did I misread you or are you saying that work for hire is beneath you and so you you should be able to work on your ideas (which are all brilliant, no doubt), while being supported by other people, aka peons?')
