But from my limited traffic website where I sometimes look at individual requests by hand and see that it&#x27;s my friends from residential Dutch IP addresses loading the page, I&#x27;m quite sure these are no secret masqueraded internet robots. Hence I conclude that, since much of the traffic (in periods that I look at randomly, the vast majority I never look at) is identifiable as human or as clearly a crawler, such unidentifiable bot traffic is a very tiny percentage.<p>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll be there, lots of people will be interested in what differences a page shows from different vantage points or to robots, but it&#x27;s probably less than a percent of all robot traffic.<p>Though checking the thread above mine, I&#x27;m not exactly sure what I was replying to. Didn&#x27;t it say something about robot traffic that wasn&#x27;t identifiable as such? I don&#x27;t see that anymore.')
