It&#x27;s always been this way since it first started. Even in the 90s, &quot;censorship&quot; like what we see today happened. The actions haven&#x27;t changed. The scope is what is different. Instead of affected a few hundred people, it&#x27;s now affecting hundreds of thousands of people, if not millions.<p>&gt; internet hacker personalities I used to align with have turned so pro-censorship<p>I don&#x27;t see that having changed. Obviously I don&#x27;t know the specific people you are thinking of, but judging by your comment here and the timeline you are mentioning, I don&#x27;t see much as change beyond scope.<p>Honestly, if people think people are becoming pro-censorship, I think it&#x27;s more a case of ignoring everything that was happening before.')
