They&#x27;ve executed the number of trades they&#x27;ve executed, DTCC raises the collateral requirement for meme stocks, and now they&#x27;re on the hook, whether stocks were purchased on margin (implicitly or otherwise) or not. You&#x27;ve got the rules in front of you. They seem to plainly say that Robinhood has to put up collateral regardless of whether margin is involved.<p>Again, I think the margin stuff is mostly a red herring?')
