We call it the Pythagorean theorem and not haltingproblem&#x27;s great amazing proof ;) The earliest discoverer is given the credit as long as there is some evidence of the dissemination of the discovery.<p>The Kerala schools shows infinite series with limits and there is transmission as the article documents to Europe. Newton&#x2F;Liebniz surely formalized and greatly advanced state of the art but what is the harm in giving credit to the Kerala school for the earlier discoveries.')
