That&#x27;s part of the job of a code of conduct: to <i>establish those norms</i>.<p>Here, the norms were surprising (a back-and-forth between two presentations is a perennial seat-filler at tech conferences) and poorly communicated. That&#x27;s a problem. But &quot;banning criticism&quot; isn&#x27;t necessarily a problem.<p>We have a shade of that norm here, in Show HN posts. Restricting criticism on generic HN posts would be stifling and unproductive, but in spaces where we ask community members to be vulnerable and where part of the point is to allow the community to be encouraging, it makes total sense.')
