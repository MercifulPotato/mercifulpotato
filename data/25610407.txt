Item(by='roenxi', descendants=None, kids=[25610651], score=None, time=1609561993, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25609719, text='&gt; Think back to the toilet paper shortage, or the mask shortage, or the hand sanitizer shortage, and how long it took the market to respond to those events.<p>Not long? Toilet paper distribution recovered quickly, little old ladies are now knitting masks and I hear distilleries have started converting into hand sanitiser plants. There was a month of confusion then in my experience everything started snapping back to normal. I&#x27;ve never seen so much hand sanitiser as is now available.<p>&gt; My point is it&#x27;s still very slow, and if you&#x27;re saying that days matter, the market is not the tool we want.<p>Yet if we don&#x27;t go with the market I bet a worse alternative will be chosen. Back in March-February people would have argued in February that the US CDC was there to overrule greedy companies rushing out coronavirus tests and make sure that there are high quality standards. Then the CDC shipped a test that didn&#x27;t work and scuppered the US&#x27;s opportunity to nip the pandemic in the bud. That instance alone is a damning indictment of a government-first response to a healthcare emergency.<p>People can keep making a big song and dance about how <i>this</i> time the market can&#x27;t possibly work because it is different to all the other times the market worked really well. Then the government will implement something slower than just letting people buy vaccines like everything else. In time the complete screw-up of the response will be used as evidence that there is no way a free market could have handled something so complicated.<p>Pretty much every time a free market has been used to solve a problem, the problem gets resolved as fast as possible with minimum fuss. The only exception is problems that poor people have. Coronavirus is not a poor-person-problem. Leaving it to the market will get great results.<p>&gt; That said, throwing the military at this problem seems fine to me, honestly.<p>It&#x27;ll be slower than letting people buy a vaccine off the shelf. The military has no special advantage here. There are great reasons that the military isn&#x27;t left in charge of running a countries logistics networks - they are competent but not the best at it.')
