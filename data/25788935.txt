I currently use Zoom once a week for a music lesson. The latency is poor but my friend is not super great with computers so it&#x27;s a reasonable compromise.<p>Now _playing_ together is much more challenging, and not something especially viable for students (which is why it&#x27;s a bit weird targeting this at Zoom): you definitely need a proper audio interface, most likely with ~5ms of latency. You then also absolutely have to be on a wired network connection, which on most modern laptops probably requires another adapter, as wireless introduces too much latency. Overall you need &lt; 25ms of latency in order to be able to play &quot;live&quot; together. This is doable but you need the right tools.<p>I&#x27;m a folk musician who plays in pubs and you can even see the effects of latency in a real-life setting like that - if the room is too large then people on the other side start to drop out of time. What I do in this situation is follow their hands rather than what I can hear. Unfortunately this too doesn&#x27;t work online due to video latency being even worse. Metronomes don&#x27;t really work for our music because it doesn&#x27;t follow a standard BPM, it can and should vary.<p>We did manage a few sessions using JamKazam (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jamkazam.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jamkazam.com&#x2F;</a>) which works well enough with the tweaks listed above. It&#x27;s largely restricted to people who know what they&#x27;re doing, sadly.')
