I&#x27;m 38 with a spouse and two small children. I&#x27;ve been a CTO of two SMBs over the last few years and needed to build something of my own. It&#x27;s the craziest thing I&#x27;ve ever done.<p>The industry is end-of-life IT assets. It&#x27;s a big industry with a lot of steak dinners that you can make a decent living at by grinding. I was introduced by a buddy of mine who&#x27;s managed to build a good no-tech business in the niche.<p>My thesis is that there&#x27;s opportunity around &quot;platforming&quot; the service with integrations and automation. Compliance and convenience are big drivers for customers, so traditional marketplaces have failed to take off.')
