I don&#x27;t believe premature reopening is one of them.  Bars, indoor dining and gyms have been shut down for pretty much the whole pandemic.  Outdoor dining was banned (again) about a month ago.<p>My take is that L.A.&#x27;s issues have more to do with housing density, high number of people living with roommates and high number of multigenerational households.  Also perhaps some some challenges communicating with an extremely large and diverse immigrant population.')
