If Google didn&#x27;t pay anyone to be the default search engine, didn&#x27;t require Android Phone makers to pre-install Google apps and make Google the default search in order to get access to Google services and the store, etc then there&#x27;s no problem.<p>The complaint also says that one of the reasons Google&#x27;s results are better is the network and scale effects that come from owning 80-90% of search. A competitor has a very difficult time no matter how good their algorithm because you need insights you can only get when people use your service at scale. I don&#x27;t personally know if that is true but that&#x27;s part of the complaint.<p>The proposed antitrust violation is likely the combination: using their dominant position to outspend any other players when paying for default placement to ensure they&#x27;re the only one with the scale to have the best search results. That forms a self-reinforcing cycle: users who do choose pick you because you have the best results and you use that fact to fund no-compete and default placement agreements to ensure you have unmatched scale which further reinforces your ability to deliver the best results.<p>Again: I don&#x27;t know if this is true or a valid argument, but it seems to be what the complaint claims.')
