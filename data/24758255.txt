The authors were intentionally deceitful. Co-authors of the preprint requested that they be taken off the pre-print because they had warned that the statistics were bad. Prior the the prevalence study, they had cherry picked weird data sets and published an editorial. They are clearly trying to bend the data to their preconceived notions, in a really public way.<p>To see journalists pick up their work again, just because they are at a big name institution, is a huge betrayal of the public trust.')
