Trump is dead politically, but the dissatisfaction that made his brand of populism electable is still there.<p>And if Biden - or Harris - don&#x27;t take steps to address it by 2024, someone much worse than Trump will appear.<p>And they may well win.<p>The reality is voters on both sides vote how the various media outlets tell them to vote. There&#x27;s plenty of media noise, but the available narratives are carefully curated, and voters don&#x27;t get to generate their own from the grassroots upwards.<p>This has become far more dangerous as Facebook and the various other online platforms have moved towards microprofiling and microtargetting.<p>This was a huge issue during the Brexit campaign, when disingenuous single-issue ads aimed at very narrow demographics with specific vulnerabilities put the result over the top.<p>Trump spent more on social in this election than Biden did, and the result was a good collection of surprise wins in states like Florida, and the second biggest voter turnout in US history.<p>If Trump had been even slightly more competent and focused and if Covid hadn&#x27;t been happening this would have been a bloodbath for progressives.')
