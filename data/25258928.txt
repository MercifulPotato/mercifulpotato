Where we as humans have reasonably found that e = mc^2. However AI would gives us e or m but backboxes us away from seeing that c aka the speed of light was involved(unless we implied that before). There might be interesting relationships that are useful that AI unintentionally masks that could be ground breaking if we could only understand process more holistically. I think a different commenter eluded in this case we think we understand protein folding well we just struggle to synthesis it in a compact mathematical way even though with AI we can simulate the process well for known examples.<p>The issue with AI is we don&#x27;t know if our current example set includes every case what if there is a strange sequence of amino acid that causes something &quot;weird&quot; to happen that we have haven&#x27;t seen. AI cannot predict something novel it or us haven&#x27;t seen which is the issue. The process(if it exists) of how one could solve this problem might also be exportable to other fields if it was formulized with math rather than estimated with AI.')
