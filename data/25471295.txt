There was about 20yrs of research on using mRNA for gene therapy before the CRISPR&#x2F;Cas9 discovery. It was abandoned as a route for gene therapy specifically because it wasn&#x27;t long lasting. The mRNA isn&#x27;t incorporated into the DNA, so it isn&#x27;t reproduced by the cells and eventually breaks down. Things inside of cells are flying around at high speeds and constantly colliding, so it&#x27;s not a very stable environment.<p>There are people that this was tested on still hanging around with no lasting negative effects (to my knowledge).')
