I was not able to find this in the documentation, but I only spent a few minutes scanning it.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.oreilly.com&#x2F;radar&#x2F;the-world-beyond-batch-streaming-101&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.oreilly.com&#x2F;radar&#x2F;the-world-beyond-batch-streami...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.oreilly.com&#x2F;radar&#x2F;the-world-beyond-batch-streaming-102&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.oreilly.com&#x2F;radar&#x2F;the-world-beyond-batch-streami...</a><p>Also &quot;Materialize&quot; seems not to support needed features like tumbling windows (yet) when dealing with streaming data in SQL: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;1905.12133" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;1905.12133</a><p>Additionally &quot;Materialize&quot; states in their doc: <i>State is all in totally volatile memory; if materialized dies, so too does all of the data.</i> - this is not true for example for Apache Flink which stores its state in systems like RocksDB.<p>Having SideInputs or seeds is pretty neat, imagine you have two tables of several TiBs or larger. This is also something that &quot;Materialize&quot; currently lacks:\n<i>Streaming sources must receive all of their data from the stream itself; there is no way to “seed” a streaming source with static data.</i>')
