With sufficient economic freedom competition can arise naturally. Unfortunately when a company becomes very powerful You will start to see behaviors like rent-seeking, regulatory capture, and cronyism.  These artificially raise the barriers to entry for plucky startups. This is more a reflection of poor or corrupt governance than capitalism though.')
