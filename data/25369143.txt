Sometimes it&#x27;s quite right to have views outside the social norms.<p>Now remember this thread started because you specifically raised an issue with being called far right. Do you think that maybe you do have views outside the norm. Note that i&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s right or wrong nor do i even want to know what your views are, i&#x27;m just pointing out that you might just fit the description of far right&#x2F;left if your measuring stick for normal is to compare your views to those of a decade that started over 30years ago.')
