Item(by='cweagans', descendants=None, kids=[25142607, 25141483], score=None, time=1605724904, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25139899, text='Don&#x27;t get me wrong: I&#x27;m not suggesting that this program (as it&#x27;s currently structured) wouldn&#x27;t be beneficial to the student. There&#x27;s no substitute for real experience working with a real team on real projects with real clients.<p>I appreciate the level of qualification that you&#x27;re doing -- I think that definitely protects against (at least to some extent) predatory&#x2F;exploitative behavior and it&#x27;s great that that process is part of the program from day one.<p>That said: if a company is getting free (or negative cost) labor for real commercial work that they would otherwise have to pay a substantial amount of money for, there is a clear, material benefit to the company. If this program were ever considered in court, I suspect that it would boil down to figuring out what the ratio of benefits is (is it 20% company and 80% student, vice versa, or closer to 50&#x2F;50?) and that&#x27;s a really risky proposition to consider.<p>From my standpoint, the thing that would make this program essentially risk-free is a requirement to pay at least the minimum wage for whatever jurisdiction the company is operating in. That may significantly reduce the number of companies that can&#x2F;will utilize this program, but it sends a very clear message: Lambda grads are worth paying for, even in an apprenticeship role. Another model would be to have the grad work as a contractor for a flat, predetermined fee on a project identified and scoped at the beginning of the engagement.<p>Additionally, rather than selling this as a mentoring&#x2F;apprenticeship&#x2F;internship program, you could consider selling it to employers as a _hiring_ program. For instance, something along these lines:<p>* Work with a Lambda grad for 4 weeks\n* Employer does all of the vetting steps you mentioned before and pays $x&#x2F;hour\n* At the end of the 4 weeks, employer is obligated to hire the grad, try a different grad, or close the role req for x days (or something like that -- maybe if n grads don&#x27;t work out, waive this requirement or something)<p>Structured like that, it changes the _hiring_ process in the same way that Lambda is trying to change the education process. Best case, I&#x27;d be looking at $1600 for the cost of acquisition of a new employee. We have a fairly rigorous interview&#x2F;hiring process. I&#x27;m not sure exactly how much it costs, but the amount of time and attention required from various members of the team is certainly above $1600, so this would be a bargain for me.')
