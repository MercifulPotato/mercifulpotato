I have many fond memories of that.<p>I also bought my last guitar there, and some audio&#x2F;recording equipment. It&#x27;s one of my favorite retail places, especially since I don&#x27;t like shipping acoustic instruments if possible. Although I have started to order more of my stuff online through Sweetwater. With the pandemic I try to avoid brick and mortar stores as much as possible. Although I do still occasionally order from them if they have what I want in stock and other places don&#x27;t.<p>I don&#x27;t order audio gear from Amazon due to the proliferation of counterfeits.')
