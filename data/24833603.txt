Item(by='hombre_fatal', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603163482, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24830499, text='&quot;Remaining&quot; is a pretty weak consolation. Is that all that matters? The biggest Freenode channel I&#x27;m a part of is #nodejs. It has maybe 10 regulars. All of us probably 30+ years old, only clinging to the corpse of IRC out of old habit. And in 10 years we will all be 40+, and in another 10, we will all be 50+.<p>On the other hand, in 10 years if Discord pulls the plug, you&#x27;ll have a community of people that can migrate elsewhere. To any other solution that will pop up. Because it&#x27;s the people that are the community, not the platform. Whether I have to use Discord or Slack or future solutions is merely incidental and entirely swappable.<p>One example that comes to mind is <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thedonald.win&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thedonald.win&#x2F;</a>. Reddit killed their subreddit (r&#x2F;the_donald), so they just moved elsewhere.')
