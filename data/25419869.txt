You get consenting actors. You get releases from the participants. You keep track of who is in the videos.<p>If you are hosting third party content, you verify they do the above.<p>This isn&#x27;t like hosting a Disney movie on YouTube. If you screw this up, there are real victims here. There should be some weight and repercussions to posting child porn, revenge porn, or any kind of porn where some of the actors have not signed off on it.')
