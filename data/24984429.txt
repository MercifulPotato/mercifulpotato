I was wondering the same thing hehe):<p>maybe one big part involves the landing &amp; takeoff:<p>for plane-like drones both are a lot more dangerous (therefore more difficult to be automated) and need a lot more space than quadcopters (and the likes). Saying this because I remember that, when I was a kid, my RC-plane (which took weeks and $$ to build) crashed 1.8 seconds after the first take-off attempt (damn, I got so angry &amp; depressed...).<p>I guess that soon or later we&#x27;ll see mixed designs that can take off &amp; land like a quadcopter but which can increase their range&#x2F;efficiency by &quot;transforming&quot; in mid-air into an airplane-like form? (something similar to <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Bell_Boeing_V-22_Osprey" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Bell_Boeing_V-22_Osprey</a> or maybe just a passive design that works by changing the fixed orientation of the whole drone from horizontal to almost vertical, or the opposite depending on the form of the drone?) In any case complexity would increase, therefore more specific demand for long-range capability is probably needed to go towards developing something in this area?')
