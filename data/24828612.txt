Just because there is a slippery slope argument to be made doesn&#x27;t mean we have to actually do what it says needs to be done to get to its theoretical end point.<p>Sure, we _could_ remove everything until there&#x27;s one left, but why would we? If you just want a smaller, publicly vetted list of roots that you can trust because the org that curates that set is explicitly on a mission to keep the internet free, open, and safe for all, then there is no &quot;next step&quot;, this is the first and also last one.<p>Is it a good idea to do this? Highly depends on what you do and what you need, but the idea that &quot;we can just keep doing this until there&#x27;s only one&quot; is super flaky: how many more sets of root certs, vetted by orgs that can be trusted to have privacy and security in mind, are there? Because no org that fits that bill will have a list that is &quot;just the one&quot;. There&#x27;s going to be 100+ certs in their lists.')
