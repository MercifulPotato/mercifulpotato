It&#x27;ll be useful for embedding content in pages; if you have complete control over the page then that isn&#x27;t especially helpful, but if you don&#x27;t (many teams contributing to a site, accepting user defined content in to a page, enabling an admin to define page styles without breaking important elements, etc) then it&#x27;s <i>very</i> handy.<p>My inner pessimist does wonder if Google are driving this because it&#x27;ll somehow make it harder to block adverts, but <i>for now</i> it looks quite useful in for the obvious use cases.')
