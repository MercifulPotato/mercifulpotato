It benefits a few (lambo money) to the detriment of the  many.<p>And let&#x27;s not forget Bitcoin made the Silk Road and its successors possible.<p>And meanwhile, so many smart people are wasting their life on crypto currencies. And meanwhile, so much energy is wasted on this.<p>[0] I still don&#x27;t understand why HFT is not illegal and there are many more things that are terrible, but this is not about Traditional financial systems right now.')
