I checked it and I am 100% sure it was garbage in my case. I am imagining this type of people that maybe have some connections or some money to get this shit software sold  and innocent people getting threaten that they downloaded copyrighted or illegal stuff, that would cause a lot of suffering and drama in a family.<p>I hope you do not make the point that the seller has the &quot;capitalistic obligation&quot; to misrepresent his shit and the buyers have the duty to triple check.<p>There should be strong laws, like if your software promised something that is not true in real world situation then the people that sold it should pay, no loopholes.')
