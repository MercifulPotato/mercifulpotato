Then the right would find some tweets and call it &quot;incitement of violence&quot;. Then Trump could enact the Insurrection Act, call people domestic terrorists, and censor for public safety reasons. Your argument then would be undoubtedly for &quot;free speech&quot;, and you would have to rely on the good nature of the aggressor to provide that to you. Yes this is far-fetched but it&#x27;s not unusual in other countries and throughout history.')
