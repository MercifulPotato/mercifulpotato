In the outer &quot;real world&quot; the bartender will give the programmer a drink for a joke. It could be a knock-knock joke or anything, but the programmer makes it recursive. Thus making the whole thing a joke to us, otherwise it would be a knock-knock joke embedded in a pointless programmer&#x2F;bartender reference.<p>In the first joke level, the bartender will give the programmer a drink for a joke; it doesn&#x27;t work to arbitrarily end here because &quot;a programmer asks the bartender for a drink and the bartender gives him a drink&quot; isn&#x27;t anything like a joke to qualify at the parent level.<p>The next level is another layer of recursion and here the programmer can literally ask for a drink and get one even though that isn&#x27;t funny in itself because it can be funny in the context of the outer joke using &quot;he asked for a drink and got one&quot; as a cheeky way to tell a joke to get a drink, and because it&#x27;s a reference to recursion, the reason for Chekhov&#x27;s Programmer in the opening sentence, so making something that qualifies as a joke to get the real world programmer a real world beer.<p>Seems to me like it&#x27;s the earliest point it could return and still potentially work, rather than an arbitrary point?')
