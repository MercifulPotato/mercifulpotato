And that means that while I do know several general legal principles, I am generally ignorant on how those legal principles actually get applied in boundary cases.<p>Answering this sort of question likely requires digging through cases at the district and circuit court level to find people who made this kind of argument, and seeing if the court bought it or not. I&#x27;m not paid to do that, and the people who are are paid big bucks to do so.<p>But my suspicion is that you have to draw a pretty strong link between the actions of the defendant and your losses, to the point that you really no had other option than to eat the losses. In the case of the pier collapse, you might be able to swing that if there were nowhere else you could fish from. But in the case of Robinhood, I&#x27;d be surprised if you  could sustain that argument, especially because you&#x27;ve signed this pesky contract.')
