Does this really look like progress?<p>I mean... what does progress look like? The old syntax is less words, but it&#x27;s still something you have to memorize. Why is this new syntax worse?<p>FWIW, I believe the newer syntax more closely resembles what you have with Cisco network equipment. It also supports newer functionality like net namespaces, and uses newer kernel interfaces. None of those advantages are mentioned in the article that I can see...<p>&gt;autoconf has its warts<p>This is the single most charitable interpretation of autoconf&#x27;s problems I&#x27;ve heard in my life.<p>&gt; in fact according to this[1], meson authors claimed it to be one of their goals to force users to have a bleeding edge version of python3 installed so it can be universally assumed as a given.\n&gt; [1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kevstras.com&#x2F;programming&#x2F;2017&#x2F;12&#x2F;18&#x2F;meson.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kevstras.com&#x2F;programming&#x2F;2017&#x2F;12&#x2F;18&#x2F;meson.html</a><p>I tried and was unable to figure out what they mean by that. Am I stupid or does that article not say that?<p>&gt; Built with debug information, it takes up 434 MB of my harddisk space as of version 3.9.3.<p>Then... don&#x27;t build it with debug information?<p>&gt; It&#x27;s primary raison-d&#x27;etre is its support for the Microsoft (TM) Visual Studio (R) (TM) solution files, so Windows (TM) people can compile stuff from source with a few clicks.<p>It exists because it was created to be the build system for a specific project. I don&#x27;t even know if it began life with Visual C++ project generation support.<p>--<p>All in all this feels like run-of-the-mill cynicism. Some valid points but a complete failure to acknowledge why things are the way they are. Some days I wish HN had a downvote button.')
