Granted it’s not what I would describe as “insightful content” but at the same time, I’m never going to be upset for something my old aunt said. Twitter and Reddit on the other hand were having a really negative influence on my well-being. I’m sure you can use them in a “sanitised” way and avoid the trolling and hate, but it’s hard and requires a lot of self discipline. I’m not sure why I don’t get the “bad part” of Facebook, I’m starting to think that it’s cultural - Facebook is the only social network that I use, that still “thinks I’m Italian” and pushes me localised Italian content. On Twitter and Reddit on the other hand I exclusively follow content in English and&#x2F;or related to Australia, the country where I now live.')
