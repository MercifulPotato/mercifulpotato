Had that brief inversion not occurred, I think the whole idea of RISC would&#x27;ve never happened.<p>For evidence that code density is still important, there is this interesting study from a few years ago where the &quot;purest RISC&quot; MIPS is solidly beaten by ARM and x86 despite having several times the instruction cache:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.extremetech.com&#x2F;extreme&#x2F;188396-the-final-isa-showdown-is-arm-x86-or-mips-intrinsically-more-power-efficient" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.extremetech.com&#x2F;extreme&#x2F;188396-the-final-isa-sho...</a>')
