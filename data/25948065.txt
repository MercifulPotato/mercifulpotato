That&#x27;s all. I&#x27;m a lot more sympathetic to arguments about how Google and Facebook have a worrying amount of control online, because services owned by them are used by an absolute majority of English speaking people.<p>Twitter is only used by 22% of Americans as of 2019 [1]. It&#x27;s important to a certain kind of &quot;very online&quot; person but from my POV it&#x27;s as inessential as Pinterest or Twitch. If Twitter banned me I wouldn&#x27;t even <i>know about it</i> for several months because that&#x27;s about how frequently I log in.<p>I think that Twitter&#x27;s perceived importance has been exaggerated beyond its actual user numbers because the previous US President used it so heavily. And because it became such an easy, cheap, reliable way for other publishers to churn out content. &quot;Trump Tweets Something -- We React&quot; was a bread and butter staple for TV and written publications for 4 years. But 78% of Americans get along just fine without using Twitter itself.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pewresearch.org&#x2F;fact-tank&#x2F;2019&#x2F;04&#x2F;10&#x2F;share-of-u-s-adults-using-social-media-including-facebook-is-mostly-unchanged-since-2018&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pewresearch.org&#x2F;fact-tank&#x2F;2019&#x2F;04&#x2F;10&#x2F;share-of-u-...</a>')
