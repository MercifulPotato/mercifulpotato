It&#x27;s not one of the most complex by any metric.<p>I don&#x27;t know people bother to defend billion dollar corporations in the habit of lying and misrepresenting their products. People paid them money for a product that was misrepresented in false advertising, I don&#x27;t know it could be clearer than that as to why they&#x27;re justifiably outraged.<p>99.99% of the criticism did not include intimidation, death threats or anything along those lines. CDPR used it as a deflectionary tactic from their own business practices.<p>And no, delays like this are not common. Games get delayed when they&#x27;re many months away from release (it&#x27;s obvious then that it&#x27;s not done). Less than a month? They&#x27;re either lying or so incompetent they don&#x27;t know their own progress. Neither excuse the false claims.<p>It&#x27;s a billion dollar publicly listed corporation.
