Certainly not to support their politics, but to restore some sense of stability to my world view--that people are generally sympathetic. This especially hit home when hearing my wonderful parents&#x27; supporting Trump&#x27;s hateful rhetoric.<p>I&#x27;m now starting to think that his message is in fact too dangerous to even try and rationalize. The people that follow them are feeling something I don&#x27;t understand, but there&#x27;s just no excuse to humor them any longer. His rhetoric is tearing us apart, and it needs to end.<p>For god&#x27;s sake, the hate needs to end.')
