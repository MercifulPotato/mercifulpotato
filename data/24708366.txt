If Oracle wins, you couldn&#x27;t reimplement a compatible version of anything that&#x27;s not open source. You couldn&#x27;t make a third-party implementation of a corporate-owned programming language without putting yourself at risk.<p>Imagine you&#x27;re a company using some Oracle database, and you want to reimplement some component of that system in order to migrate and escape their vendor lock-in... You can&#x27;t, not without taking a huge legal risk.<p>In the short term, it&#x27;s a victory for huge litigious corporations like Oracle. The good thing, I hope, is that in the long term, this will make people distrust closed source software even more. What Oracle wants, and has always wanted, is to bind you in the worst possible form of vendor lock-in. Open source and open standards are the answer. Refuse anything else.')
