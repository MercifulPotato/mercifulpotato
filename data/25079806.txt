I&#x27;ve already heard of friends at big-tech companies where network admins are applying corporate wide VPN policies to block apple&#x27;s ocsp.apple.com requests after the outage that happened yesterday and basically nuked productivity for hours. In some cases it meant engineers _could not_ deploy code due to an apple outage because `terraform whatever` wouldn&#x27;t work, which is pretty outrageous.')
