In other words, adding games could actually make their market <i>smaller</i>. This is similar to Nintendo&#x27;s rigourous curation of their platforms - allowing the latest Call of Duty game on the Switch might add a few million in sales, but only at the cost of losing tens of millions of people who like the fact the Switch doesn&#x27;t have that sort of game. Their market is bigger if they say no to things the market doesn&#x27;t want to be associated with.<p>This is a pretty classic problem in product management - you have to avoid adding features what could drive your largest market away from the product.')
