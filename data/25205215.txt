If they&#x27;re committing zillions of lines of code, it&#x27;s maybe an efficiency or expectations problem. If they never push commits before noon it&#x27;s maybe a motivation problem.&quot;<p>Though he backtracks a bit regarding his own personal approach:<p>&quot;But it&#x27;s always just one data point, and almost always one that colors a response to an issue that exists independently. I&#x27;d never <i>determine</i> that someone was an under-performer <i>based on</i> their Git commit history.&quot;')
