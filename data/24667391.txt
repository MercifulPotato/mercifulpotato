Item(by='npunt', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601675558, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24663514, text='&gt; Excel is an incredible enabler, and unfortunately it is indiscriminate in that it also enables people to do the wrong thing. The solution here is education I feel.<p>As someone who&#x27;s both worked in education and is a designer for a living, I&#x27;ve seen this argument a thousand times about a thousand things, and while there&#x27;s sometimes merit in it, it&#x27;s usually a cop-out.<p>Why not bake some of the education <i>into</i> the product, rather than treat them as separate? You probably can&#x27;t have finance 101 in there, but excel is an example of a product whose internal documentation is rarely sufficient to answer even basic questions. Most of it is also at the basic level of <i>what</i> some function is, rather than <i>how</i> to solve higher level problems or <i>why</i> you&#x27;d choose one approach over the other.<p>This approach isn&#x27;t unique either, there&#x27;s lots of education technology exploring the overlap between learning and doing within a single tool. The reason we don&#x27;t see this more is it involves a different team composition than traditional software teams, which tend to not even consider documentation a central part of the product experience, let alone teaching.<p>I agree with any tool capable of doing complex enough things, there&#x27;s a discipline and an art to its use. But to say Excel doesn&#x27;t really have a place to improve here is false, it&#x27;s just stuck in its ways like lots of mature software is.')
