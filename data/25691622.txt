I was mostly responding to this bit:<p>&gt;they weren’t given the time or resources for discovery or developed argument that would provide any type of closure. In many cases the remedy may be worse than the outcome.<p>I&#x27;d only add (and I should have in my previous reply, mea culpa) that given the known time constraints that <i>any</i> post-election lawsuit carries, election lawyers and campaigns are used to acting quickly.<p>What&#x27;s more, in all 3,193 elections (one in each US county) every election day, there are polling&#x2F;canvassing observers for all candidates on each ballot present.<p>And almost all states have either paper ballots or voter-verified paper audit trails[0], creating a physical record of each vote.<p>And since there are 3,193 <i>separate</i> elections, each with their own administrators, poll workers and polling&#x2F;canvassing observers, literally tens of thousands of people are involved.<p>In order to commit fraud at any scale would require the complicity of <i>thousands</i> of people.  And while a bit hyperbolic, as Ben Franklin is purported to have said, &quot;three can keep a secret, if two of them are dead.&quot;  Thousands of people?  Not so much.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ballotpedia.org&#x2F;Voting_methods_and_equipment_by_state" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ballotpedia.org&#x2F;Voting_methods_and_equipment_by_stat...</a>')
