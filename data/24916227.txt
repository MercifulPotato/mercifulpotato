They are very much willing to built Fabs if their customers are committed to it. But no company other than Apple has ever done that. AMD could have place a large order over the course of the year. Basically a bet that they will sell that many chips. And TSMC will adjust or built accordingly. That problem is no company is willing to place that bet. What if they dont sell and stuck with big pile of chips?<p>This is simple Supply Chain Management, it is the same principle in every other industry.')
