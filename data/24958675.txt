The new one is slightly younger, come the next election he’ll only be in his early 60s.<p>Lib Dems had a young leader who (aged 39) managed to convert from being second in the June elections (led by a 70+ year old) to losing her seat in December, with a 7 year old and a baby.<p>There are relatively young leaders - Finland and New Zealand come to mind, but leaders tend to be reflections of the population.
