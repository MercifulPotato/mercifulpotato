You need a far broader base of benchmarks for a decent comparison (for one thing CoreMark won&#x27;t give the memory system much of a workout).<p>A big red flag is the Cortex-A9 comparison that is used, being described as the faster arm processor for CoreMark, if you go to to EEMBC&#x27;s CoreMark score database (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eembc.org&#x2F;coremark&#x2F;scores.php" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eembc.org&#x2F;coremark&#x2F;scores.php</a>), search &#x27;arm&#x27; a Cortex A9 part does indeed take top score. Note this are just user sumbitted scores without any real curation, searching &#x27;arm&#x27; isn&#x27;t guaranteed to give you all arm cores in the database, plus results could have errors in.<p>Given the age of the core (it was introduced in 2007) I&#x27;d be rather surprised if the A9 was the best performing arm core on CoreMark. Though From a quick google I can&#x27;t find CoreMark numbers for other arm A-class cores.')
