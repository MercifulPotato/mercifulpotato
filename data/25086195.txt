The best leaders are the servant ones, who see leadership as a burden to bear, and to assume only begrudgingly as need thrusts it upon them. Those who look to it for the ability to change the world, even with the best intentions, are imminently corruptible; they&#x27;re already approaching it with the idea that they know best, and others who disagree are wrong and need to be kept subservient.')
