It took a while to get there. I learned to drive with it.<p>It was quite a challenge to pass other cars on a 2 lane blacktop. The trick was to back off about a quarter mile, then floor it. By the time you reached the passee, you hit 65 and could swerve into the left lane then back again.<p>If you were unfortunate enough to get an oncoming car in the meantime, you stomped on the brake, slid back the quarter mile, and tried again.<p>The bus was also highly susceptible to crosswinds. Going in and out of cuts in a crosswind could blow you into the other lane. Had to anticipate that with the steering wheel.<p>Eventually my dad decided to sell it, and I took care of that for him. He asked me if I missed the bus, and I said no, I thought it was a minor miracle we never died in a crash in it. I understand the nostalgia for those cars, but they belong in a museum, not on the road.')
