Item(by='anfilt', descendants=None, kids=[25965360], score=None, time=1611972674, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25965247, text='8 bit per channel is already enough to avoid banding. However, if you are editing content with 8 bits per channel its pretty easy to reach a situation when mixing colors or applying numerous effects will create banding. So ideally you convert to a much higher bit per channel or floating point. Then perform all editing in that that higher precision format and then once you have applied everything to the channel finally convert it back to 8 bit.<p>TLDR; If you display something and thats it, 8 bits is enough (generally). Start feeding it through mathematical functions you need more precision otherwise error compounds.')
