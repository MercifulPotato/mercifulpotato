Meritocracy in this case was in reference to the company&#x27;s internal competition (organic or not) for top spots at the company.<p>I completely understand there are certain jobs where you need a degree. Bar even. A lot of software engineering doesn&#x27;t fit that mold. I&#x27;m 100% behind requiring an advanced degree if you&#x27;re writing software that controls: lives&#x2F;property&#x2F;money in any meaningful way.  Money in this case being large capital investments, not consumer payments. I&#x27;m a big proponent of hiring people who need a second chance, who maybe are down on their luck, or otherwise have a different path than suburban white America or the H1B visa mills they created (caveat, I&#x27;m white).  I think there are plenty of opportunities for software engineers without degrees to build web apps, mobile apps, services, integrations, automation, etc.')
