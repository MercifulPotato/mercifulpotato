If your job can&#x27;t exist without in-depth tracking of how a shown ad influences purchasing behavior, maybe your job <i>shouldn&#x27;t</i> exist.<p>Seriously, ads would work plenty well enough by just showing the same ads to all users based on the contents of the page (or search query). Honestly, I&#x27;d be all for a legal framework that completely outlaws any &quot;personalization&quot; on the internet unless a user clearly and optionally opts in.')
