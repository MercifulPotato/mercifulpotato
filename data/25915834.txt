I haven&#x27;t given Neovim a chance yet and I&#x27;m not a huge fan of Lua but it would certainly be a pretty good upgrade compared to clunky Vimscript.<p>Vimscript feels like a configuration file format gone wild (probably because it&#x27;s sort of what it is) and it&#x27;s really annoying to use in my experience. Coming from Emacs it was really a bad surprise: say what you want about elisp, it at least feels like a proper programming language.')
