This argument usually arises in the context of high energy&#x2F;particle physics.  Unfortunately for those saying things like this particle&#x2F;high energy physics is not equivalent to &quot;physics&quot;.  Its not the entirety, nor the majority of physics.<p>Yet we keep seeing this discussed as if it is.  This isn&#x27;t an HN issue.  This is an contextual issue in the broader physics community.<p>I&#x27;ve raised this point here, and other places, before.  It is important to understand that people claiming an end to physics, are usually being hyperbolic about one specific subfield that seems to have run into a set of dead ends for the moment.  Not the entirety of physics.<p>As I&#x27;ve noted, this is a recurring theme throughout physics.  Max Planck was apparently told that there was &quot;nothing new to be discovered in physics&quot;[1].  There are other examples of this throughout history.  Some of these theories had the weight of government or religious institutions behind them (earth-centric view of the universe, etc.).  To question them was to be labeled a heretic, a blasphemer, or worse.<p>Physics isn&#x27;t over.  Not by a long shot.  If someone wants to argue semantics over &quot;fundamental&quot; vs &quot;non-fundamental&quot;, they are welcome to, though their argument will only contribute to hastening the heat death of the universe[2].  That is, energy will be expended for no useful work.<p>There are existing deep, profound questions, which are ultimately fundamental in nature, that we have not answered yet.  And our asking of these questions, has exposed other concerns over our understanding of &quot;fundamental&quot; ... really ... foundational ... physics.<p>Some of these questions are opening profound links between seemingly disparate fields.  That is, physics is getting broader and more intricate.  Just because one small (yes, really) subfield nears its end (really due to economic and time constraints, you can&#x27;t spend infinite amounts of money to build the next generations of colliders), doesn&#x27;t mean the rest of the subfields are.<p>[1] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pbs.org&#x2F;wgbh&#x2F;aso&#x2F;databank&#x2F;entries&#x2F;bpplan.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pbs.org&#x2F;wgbh&#x2F;aso&#x2F;databank&#x2F;entries&#x2F;bpplan.html</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Heat_death_of_the_universe" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Heat_death_of_the_universe</a>')
