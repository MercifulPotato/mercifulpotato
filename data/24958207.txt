I&#x27;ve eaten out a half dozen times only, in that time, and again people seem to be behaving and handling things admirably.<p>Looking around at the rest of the world, it&#x27;s equal parts encouraging &amp; astonishing just how well we&#x27;re doing compared to, well, not just the obvious examples, but almost everywhere else.')
