This is just because i have a decent bit of experience &#x2F;passion in 3D modeling and animation, but couldn&#x27;t draw a box to save my life hah.<p>So i&#x27;m going to mock 2D design with 3D models. Starting also with isometric, so it&#x27;s naturally a bit more visually 3D anyway - but still sprite based.<p>I&#x27;m also going to toy and learn a lot about the boundaries of where tons of 2D sprites become bottle-necked and instead 3D ends up being cheaper. As it stands i know nothing, but some of the things i&#x27;ve planned have quite an extensive set of assets - so i suspect there will be some limitations there.')
