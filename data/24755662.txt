Like all of us, I hold a number of opinions that many believe are incorrect or harmful so I feel the need to defend the principles of freedom of speech regardless of the issue at hand.<p>As for this policy change, I wonder what the limits will be here? Holocaust denialism isn&#x27;t something I know much about, but my understanding is that there are different categories of holocaust denialism. A lot of holocaust &quot;denialism&quot; isn&#x27;t strictly denial of the holocaust, but more the extent to which it happened. Many will argue that there were far less than 6 million deaths â€“ which as I understand it isn&#x27;t supported by the majority of academics.<p>However I do believe some denialism is academic in the same way a small handful of scientists disagree about climate change, there is also some academic disagreement about the treatment of Jews during holocaust and the total number of Jews killed. Are these kinds of discussions also off limits? Would I be allowed to share academic research which suggest 8 million Jews died, but not 4 million? Or is only discussion that centres on the 6 million number acceptable?<p>I suspect as usual any legitimate discussion that happens to fall outside the bounds of what&#x27;s socially acceptable to those enforcing this policy will be removed and the bounds of what&#x27;s acceptable will continue to shrink. I know Twitter and Reddit ban people for having the wrong academic views on race and gender these days so I assume this policy will be enforced similarly.<p>It does seem going forward only those with the correct views on race, gender, global warming, COVID-19, history, and social issues will be permitted access to digital communication platforms. I&#x27;m just thankful Facebook and Twitter weren&#x27;t around to police wrong think during the gay and civil rights movements tbh.')
