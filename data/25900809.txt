With PCR tests you can modify the number of cycles to fit your goals, from &quot;serious pandemic&quot; to &quot;we are almost case free&quot; within days. Also it seems like these tests test positive for people who have been infected months ago, so it&#x27;s more than likely to pile up the numbers of cases even though most of those aren&#x27;t really active anymore.')
