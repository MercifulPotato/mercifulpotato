DCMs have numerous uses, one of which is generating a clock signal whose frequency is some multiple of the frequency of a reference clock.&quot;<p>Related: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.xilinx.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;intellectual-property&#x2F;dcm_module.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.xilinx.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;intellectual-property&#x2F;dcm_mo...</a><p>&gt;&quot;The Digital Clock Manager (DCM) primitive in Xilinx FPGA parts is used to implement delay locked loop, digital frequency synthesizer, digital phase shifter, or a digital spread spectrum.

A digital clock manager is useful for manipulating clock signals inside the FPGA, and to avoid clock skew which would introduce errors in the circuit.<p>Uses<p>Digital clock managers have the following applications:[1]<p>o Multiplying or dividing an incoming clock (which can come from outside the FPGA or from a Digital Frequency Synthesizer [DFS][citation needed]).<p>o Making sure the clock has a steady duty cycle.<p>o Adding a phase shift with the additional use of a delay-locked loop.\no Eliminating clock skew within an FPGA design.<p>See also:<p>Phase-locked loop&quot;')
