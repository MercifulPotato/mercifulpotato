Only one of them quit &quot;because of&quot; him.

That makes no sense.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnet.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;mozilla-under-fire-inside-the-9-day-reign-of-fallen-ceo-brendan-eich&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnet.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;mozilla-under-fire-inside-the-9-da...</a>')
