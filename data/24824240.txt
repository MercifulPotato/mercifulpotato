You should be able to repair and fix damage. Most furniture can&#x27;t even become obsolete for technical reasons.<p>Instead Ikea use veneers and crumbling particle materials so you can&#x27;t fix it at all. Many people say you essentially can&#x27;t move Ikea furniture between houses because you can&#x27;t dismantle it and if you tried to it&#x27;d simply fall apart.<p>Ikea was a terrible thing to happen to furniture - disposable single-use furniture - madness.')
