SPX is market cap weighted, bigger companies get a bigger piece of the pie than smaller ones.<p>TSLA will be entering near the top.<p>Just SPY has ~$320 billion under management. If the rebalance were to happen today (to my best quick calculation), TSLA would make up 1.2% of the S&amp;P 500 index.<p>Just the SPY fund would have to buy just under $4 billion dollars of TSLA stock (more than 1% of the total shares) and sell an equal amount of the rest of their portfolio.<p>Many many other funds would have to do the same.<p>We&#x27;re talking about tens of billions of dollars of stock sell orders.<p>&gt;Why would they sell stock? You can buy shares with cash and you can source cash many ways.<p>The various funds are obligated to allocate their managed assets to match the index weighting.  We&#x27;re not talking about a small fund, but a significant portion of the entire market reallocating assets.')
