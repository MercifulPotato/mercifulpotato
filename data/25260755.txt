The Ryzen 4800U is within 20% on multi-core performance. Both are sustained ~25W parts similar to the M1. If you turned x64 SMT&#x2F;AVX2 off, normalized for cores (Intel&#x2F;AMD 4&#x2F;8 vs Apple 4+4), on-die cache (Intel&#x2F;AMD 12M L2+L3 vs Apple 32MB L2+L3) and frequency (Apple 3.2 vs AMD&#x2F;Intel 4.2&#x2F;4.7), you&#x27;d likely get very close results on 5nm or 7nm-equivalent same process. Zen 3 2666 vs 3200 RAM alone is about a 10% difference. The M1 is 4266 RAM IIRC.<p>TBH, Laptop&#x2F;Desktop level performance is indeed very nice to see out of ARM, after a few years of false starts by a few startups and Qualcomm. Apple designed a wider core they deserve credit for, but wider cores have been a definitive trend starting with the Pentium M vs Pentium 4. There is a trade-off here for die area IMO, AMD&#x2F;Intel have AVX2 and even AVX512 and SMT on each core, and narrower cores (with smaller structures, higher frequency). Apple has wider cores (larger structures, less frequency, higher IPC). It&#x27;s not that simple, but it kind of is if you squint a bit.')
