Item(by='erklik', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609384545, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25588901, text='&gt; Those are inherently &#x27;rules based&#x27; societies though where government also has an incredible amount of power to intervene.<p>Australia had a lockdown. The state I am in had a complete lockdown where our borders were even closed to other states in Australia. Melbourne had the longest, and toughest lockdown in the country. Since late August, the virus has been wiped clean from my state and there is no community transmission. This means that the lockdown was lifted, and businesses allowed to open as per normal except some slight contact tracing procedures in place. The story is fairly similar in rest of the country (except maybe Melbourne which had a second wave and needed another lockdown). While there is a small cluster in North Sydney, it is fairly small and hopefully contained. I go to work everyday, all businesses are open, and economy had one of the most minimal effects.<p>Australia isn&#x27;t a very &quot;rules-based&quot; society either so a counter-example to consider.')
