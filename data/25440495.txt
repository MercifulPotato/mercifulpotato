The way the american president travels can be both insane, and yet still &quot;slightly less offensive&quot; than a dude who flies around with 17 jumbo jets just for his luggage. At least the american president travels as big as he does because of all the security, armoured car etc - that dude travels that big because he absolutely must have a swimming pool aboard his plane and enough staff to serve his every need whever he goes.')
