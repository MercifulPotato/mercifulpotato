Python, for example, has the same problem. Historically, Python took the stance of providing a &quot;naive&quot; datetime module that provides a conversion API, but delegated the actual TZ conversion to external implementations (dateutil, pytz). Only recently (as of 3.9) have they added a stdlib implementation that uses system-level zoneinfo by default.')
