Sure, you can carefully build a team of 10 where they&#x27;re all above average.  I&#x27;ve even seen a team of 30 where most were above average, and none were clearly below.  But a team of 100?  That&#x27;s a lot harder.<p>This has serious implications for how you develop large systems.  Don&#x27;t try to get too sophisticated on a larger or longer-lasting project.  You&#x27;ll have people on it who won&#x27;t&#x27; be able to play at that level, and if you try to make them, they&#x27;ll make a mess.<p>The same thing happens over time.  Sure, your team is only 20 people... today.  But if the program lives for three decades, how many people will work on it?  100?  Will they <i>all</i> be superstars?  Even those maintenance people you hire 20 years from now?  Probably not.')
