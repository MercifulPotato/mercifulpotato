It&#x27;s the reason for my first startup failure too. You need to be generating revenue within a few months of starting. If your product solves a <i>real</i> problem people will pay money for less than the minimum product just to make sure your company survives long enough to build the minimum product.<p>Ultimately, money is the <i>only</i> thing that can keep a startup going. That means either sales and revenue or investment, and getting investment is <i>a lot</i> easier if you have sales and revenue.<p>Eating more healthily, getting more sleep, and doing some exercise are useful for staying focused and selling better, but the number of successful startups whose founders had horribly unhealthy lifestyles yet still managed to sell their product is <i>significantly</i> higher than the number of startups with healthy founders who didn&#x27;t sell anything.')
