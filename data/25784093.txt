I view the George Floyd protests as overall peaceful, but it&#x27;s good to question one&#x27;s understanding.  So for what it&#x27;s worth Wikipedia (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;George_Floyd_protests_in_Portland,_Oregon" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;George_Floyd_protests_in_Portl...</a>) lists one casualty.  I&#x27;m guessing that was the August 29th event, which wasn&#x27;t a police officer.<p>So yeah, seems you&#x27;re right, and that&#x27;s an important fact to keep in mind.  7 months of protests with only one dead, in an area people keep arguing is the worst of the BLM protests.')
