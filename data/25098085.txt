I could not get <i>any</i> work done. My sleep schedule was inconsistent. Some days I wouldn&#x27;t sleep till 4 am and wake up at 12pm. Other days I would sleep at 10pm and wake up at 5am. I couldn&#x27;t focus in any meetings, etc.<p>Thankfully I was a high performer pre covid so I didn&#x27;t get punished for this. It took me two months into covid to realize something was wrong. I scheduled a meeting with a psychiatrist and requested adderall. I was mostly trying to fix my issues with work.<p>Obviously he was hesitant to give me it and instead gave me prozac. Prozac was absolutely horrible, it made my apathy worse and heightened the intensity of my mood swings. I stopped after a week.<p>My next appointment I tried wellbutrin and I have to say this drug is life changing. It&#x27;s helped me regulate my eating and sleeping patterns, I can focus through entire meeting at work. I can actually get stuff done and Im not completely apathetic towards life.<p>Note: drugs affect people in different ways. My experience might not be yours but I recommend if you are struggling to try seeking help.')
