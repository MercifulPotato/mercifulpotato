Item(by='porpoise', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608644940, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25506044, text='&gt;  I find it interesting that we never list other country origins when discussing their issues<p>I don&#x27;t remember ever reading a headline, clicking into it, and  <i>discovering</i> that it&#x27;s about something happening in China. The country origin is almost always advertised right in the headline itself.<p>In fact, since I&#x27;m not a fan of most China coverage in mainstream media, the above fact allows me to filter much of it out simply by CSS (using uBlock&#x27;s implementation of the :has-text selector), with no need for JS (via userscripts).')
