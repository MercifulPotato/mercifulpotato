However in the US, getting people to learn the necessary skills and discipline to maintain such systems to the needed baseline operating standards will remain a significant challenge.<p>Water collection and sanitation could be automated into a closed-loop system, but I&#x27;ve yet to see a COTS solution. Even if you commercialized it, you just move problems around: there would be a significant waste stream of filtration cartridges to handle when scaled up, for example. Cradle-to-cradle design and implementation of such systems is neither easy nor cheap.<p>You don&#x27;t need the portability of lithium chemistry batteries, so I recommend redox flow chemistries, with some kind of solid state magnetohydrodynamic pump if possible.<p>While there are more active septic designs for smaller properties, they&#x27;re much more expensive, and require more maintenance to keep running. From speaking with septic engineers and techs over the years, Americans have awful habits in general around sewer systems, and a lot of that keeps the septic industry thriving. A sustainable on-site treatment of human black water into safe compost compliant as EPA Class A biosolids would require people be much more diligent about ensuring pharmaceuticals for example, don&#x27;t make it into the composting stream and instead go to incineration. <i>Even if</i> people do that, it gets expensive on a small scale. Or we come up with ways to automatically sample and test each individual deposit for pharmaceuticals. Which again, adds expense and more maintenance.<p>I have no doubt we can engineer the shit out the technical problems. I don&#x27;t have good solutions for the assholes who are The Reason We Can&#x27;t Have Nice Things, other than isolate myself into a Dunbar Number of like-minded and build our own systems.<p>Grids arose for a number of good reasons, and the systems design issues surrounding decoupling from them at scale are pretty thorny.')
