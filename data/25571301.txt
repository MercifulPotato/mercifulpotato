You would be forced to eat crickets and I wouldn&#x27;t (be forced to eat them). That&#x27;s the whole idea with feeding people &quot;efficiently&quot;. Piss-poor people who can&#x27;t get a living wage are already fed the most unhealthy food because it&#x27;s cheap and easy to mass-produce, whereas those who are well-off can eat whatever we want, whatever we think is healthy and nutritious, or just pleasant to eat. And all this talk of efficiency means is that more cheaply produced, low-quality food can keep being sold to those who need to watch their wallet more than they care to watch their waistline.')
