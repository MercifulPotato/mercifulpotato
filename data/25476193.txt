One thought:<p>&gt; These “scoped life-time” reference counts are used by the C++ shared_ptr⟨T⟩(calling the destructor at the end of the scope), Rust’s Rc⟨T⟩(using the Drop trait), and Nim (using a finally block to call destroy)<p>So Rust&#x27;s non-lexical lifetimes doesn&#x27;t remedy this? Meaning the actual drop of xs needing to occur at the end of the example in the beginning of section 2.2, as opposed to right after the map. I would have thought that ys borrows nothing from xs, and the drop can be inserted right after map? Perhaps it&#x27;s too early in the morning for thinking for me.')
