For 1 mb  that’s about 0.2%, a tiny number, also when multiplied with 1.85.<p>Next the argument is that x64 chips are better because they have less cache while before the Apple chips couldn’t compete because Intel had more. That doesn’t make sense. And how are you drawing conclusions on the design and performance of a chip that’s not even on the market yet anyway?')
