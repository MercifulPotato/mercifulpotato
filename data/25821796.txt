My observation is that I did not get better at switching, but once Iâ€™ve got used to timings of building&#x2F;preparing something, it greatly reduced the anxiety for not getting things in sync, which in turn removed a decision paralysis (a bit), which kicks in even if I have a plenty of time to plan ahead.
