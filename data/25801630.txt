You&#x27;re living dangerously if you choose to rely on their exact behaviour. The vendors really only expect you to use their API (Vulkan&#x2F;Metal&#x2F;Direct3D&#x2F;etc) because that abstraction layer allows them to radically and incompatibly change their hardware on a regular basis to improve performance or functionality.')
