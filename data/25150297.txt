Well it was, just not for good. Every single good thing gets twisted and perverted in the hunt for the Almighty Profit.<p>I remember my father complaining when I was young about money being the root of all evil, never be greedy, love your fellow man. But some time around his late 40s he became a republican, tax became theft, people he didn&#x27;t know personally could fuck right off. This all coincided with his opening his business and got worse as it became more successful.<p>The man who hated Reagan and Bush and my rich half of my family with a passion became a staunch Trump supporter.<p>We no longer speak for other reasons but I use it as a reminder of what not to be. It&#x27;s worked well for me, I&#x27;m not an abusive alcoholic, hopefully I wont become a selfish old curmudgeon over money either.')
