As the curves shift, if the price goes too high, then the lack of supply of people with sufficient money would cause prices to stall or come down.  But it’s apparent that the supply of people with a lot of money (or credit) is a lot higher than the supply of houses.<p>Maybe it’s even more accurate to say that the supply of inflation protected assets in stable societies is in low supply compared to the supply of capital trying to buy those assets.')
