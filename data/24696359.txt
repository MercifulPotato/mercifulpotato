These two facts are not relevant to my argument.<p>I changed the example from Chinese to Korean (not that it matters because the argument works the same with either), because China is larger and more heterogeneous, Beijing&#x27;s average height is quite a bit taller than Korea&#x27;s average height for example. It&#x27;s easier and safer (less prone to nitpicking) to make the point by using Korea as the example.')
