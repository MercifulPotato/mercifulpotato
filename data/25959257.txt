Similar efficacy numbers, but Astrazeneca is still banned and got terrible headlines. J&amp;J has all positive headlines. I don&#x27;t know if this is just because more time has passed and people realize it was dumb to not approve Astrazeneca? Is &quot;Supercovid&quot; just making people realize we can&#x27;t wait around?<p>I think J&amp;J, Astrazeneca, and Novavax all easily surpass the &quot;net expected benefit&quot; threshold and should all be approved immediately. In the US, this would allow us to end this thing within 90 days.')
