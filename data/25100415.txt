A newspaper editor censors their writers, your boss censors your reports, your friends censor your bar room bullshit by calling you out on it, your spouse tells you you will not argue with your brother in law again.   But this is all <i>implicit</i> censoring - adhering to social norms through social signals (a raised eye brow, being told to buy your round and shut up)<p>The thing is computers do not do any <i>implicit</i> censoring - and so we are expecting FAANG to step up.  But we need firstly a set of agreed rules, then the ability to automatically understand the rules before we even get to due process.<p>The issue is firstly one of scale - HN kinda sorta works because it had clear rules from the start, abs had a lot of moderation, from early users and mods.<p>Multiply by 1000x the volume and suddenly dang&#x27;s keyboard explodes.<p>Facebook is trying to produce moderation at scale with thousands of human moderators, but they probably will never &quot;succeed&quot; - because success is not defined well enough.<p>Let me restate that.  There are thousands of groups on FAANG - each one has its own evolving rules on what is and is not acceptable.  But facebook can only really deal with one set of rules.  It will try and manage the lowest common denominator - no child porn, no murder, but it slowly heads towards &quot;define free speech&quot;<p>The main indicator here is that both sides of every political debate think FAANG is censoring them.')
