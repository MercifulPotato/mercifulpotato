America is no longer a country where free speech is paramount. Atleast in other democratic countries Censorship happens through the elected Government. As a citizen you can always remove the elected representatives if you don&#x27;t like the Censorship implemented by your elected representatives for whatever reason. You can&#x27;t remove&#x2F;vote out Facebook, Google, Twitter, Amazon et all because of the powerful grasp they have over digital communications and media.<p>The very fact that Parler was banned by Big Tech and not by US Congress puts a very bad light on America. Why would any Government trust American Government&#x27;s word if a Private Company can undo it or act unilaterally without Congress approval? What does it convey to the World leaders? Is there 1 power center in America or 2? We used to mock Pakistan for having dual power centers (the elected Government and the military since their military doesn&#x27;t come under the control of the elected Government). It caused a lot of confusion for World powers to interact with Pakistan as no one knew who the controller was. Was it the elected Government or the military? I&#x27;m seeing the same thing happening in America. Why should my Government take US Government seriously if a private company can ban&#x2F;censor US Government communications?<p>Deleting a sitting US President&#x27;s account is not going to be respected by any Government.
