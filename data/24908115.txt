Many of those funds are single digit basis points, and Fidelity has some that are zero.<p>I have a 401k plan from a large financial services org, and the funds aren&#x27;t significantly cheaper (in my case, BlackRock LifePath Index 2045, with an ER of 0.09%) than what I can get through a discount brokerage (FIOFX, Fidelity Freedom Index Fund 2045, with an ER of 0.12%). We&#x27;re talking 3 basis points, even less if you&#x27;re selecting less &quot;automatic&quot; (versus a target date or other aggregator) funds like VTI (0.03% ER), BND (0.035% ER), etc.')
