The &quot;ff&quot; will now take up the width of a single character.)<p>I&#x27;ve run into a bug where certain styles of Courier Prime turns into ligatures in Google Docs. (Long story short, whether or not ligatures get enabled is a complex interplay between the OS, font, browser, and application, and not every layer always does it right.)<p>I&#x27;m not really sure why font designers even bother creating them in monospace in the first place though, I can&#x27;t imagine any valid use for them. The only thing I can imagine is if a badly written application forces a ligature character, at least the end result will be readable rather than an empty box or something.')
