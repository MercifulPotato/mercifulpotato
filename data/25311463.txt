Software development requires programming, among many other things. Programming need not be towards the acct of software development.<p>More specifically, I wouldn&#x27;t call solving Project Euler problems &quot;software development&quot;. It&#x27;s a game, a puzzle, that requires programming. And I wouldn&#x27;t call requirements analysis, UI design, testing, etc., &quot;programming&quot;, But they are fundamental aspects of software development.<p>It&#x27;s possible to treat programming as a calling and software development an occupation.')
