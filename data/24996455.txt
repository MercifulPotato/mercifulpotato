Spot can translate TypeScript models (they must start with the API definition, but that can be just a single entry point to the model) to JSONSchema, OpenAPI, and from those, to basically any language supported by them (Java, Kotlin, Swift, C# and many others).<p>Spot also can create a mock server to provide testing, random data fitting the model, as well as a server to view the OpenAPI definition online.<p>It&#x27;s really great.<p>The project posted here seems to not do any of the useful things I expect, which Spot does (though it&#x27;s still very new and there&#x27;s some bugs) so I thought others would like to know about it.')
