In the press, by regulators, by competitors, by the companies involved. There&#x27;s likely to be a lot more data involved. The scrutiny may ironically <i>increase</i> as it becomes safer, maybe becoming a lot like plane crashes, in fact, where each one is scrutinized by groups of experts and fixes are put in place to prevent that kind of thing from happening.<p>The safer it is, the rarer and more novel the fatalities are and therefore the more resources will be spent on fixing the safety issues.<p>That is, if autonomous driving is allowed. If it&#x27;s not allowed because overall irrational fear of autonomous driving, then that feedback cycle can&#x27;t happen.<p>So the paranoia isn&#x27;t necessarily a bad thing as long as it doesn&#x27;t cause paralysis.')
