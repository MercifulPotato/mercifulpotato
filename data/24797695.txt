The project is a pinning service where people submit a video URL so they can do things like manage lists of the videos they watch (think goodreads for web videos). I need to scrape the video description and tags for each submitted URL. It would be nice to just do it from the user&#x27;s browser, but the same origin policy won&#x27;t allow that. A browser extension is the next obvious route, but that has its own issues. I was thinking to first attempt the request via CloudFlare workers, then fall back to a residential proxy service. No idea how usable workers would end up being for this sort of scraping.')
