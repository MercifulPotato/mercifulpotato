The argument advanced by the OP is that floating point numbers are not intuitive to use for the general public because they don&#x27;t work like the unique complete ordered field up to isomorphism.<p>All I&#x27;m saying with the cardinality argument is that because real numbers are fundamentally unlike integers, obvious methods of doing things won&#x27;t work, and we are stuck (at least for the time being) with leaky abstractions.<p>I make no claim about the existence of better&#x2F;more intuitive solutions. My only counterpoint is that while the ideas outlined in the paper are certainly valuable, I don&#x27;t think the framework is mature enough to replace the default representation for real numbers in a programming language like Java, at least not without further work and&#x2F;or proof that it can be adapted to a more general setting without disastrous performance decay.<p>&gt; But, starting from a definition of the reals as a Cauchy sequence...<p>I trust that what you&#x27;re saying is true, but I&#x27;m not familiar with that topic, I&#x27;m sorry. Thanks for sharing the paper.')
