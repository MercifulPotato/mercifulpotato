Makes me want to take another swing at Infinite Jest.<p>With depression, we might take medication to grant us a seat at the table of recovery via a therapist. The hope is to get off of that medication eventually. Perhaps the same holds true with ADD&#x2F;ADHD? I am not a psychiatrist.<p>I&#x27;ve been wondering about this attention deficit and reading comprehension issue for awhile now. I would love to know how many of us adults actually read books anymore for longer than a thirty minute period? Any kind of book reading.<p>I like to think that I&#x27;m a somewhat experienced meditator by now. Having observed the mindfulness hype over the years I wonder if what people are really missing is just some silent focused time in general. If all you want is quieter mind, maybe you don&#x27;t need a ten day silent retreat but just an hourlong reading session?<p>I know the topic has been beaten to death but it is an important one. This constant context switching between systems and devices who have been engineered to sap your impulse control and short-circuit your core reward system need to be investigated on a personal level. So it isn&#x27;t just that you aren&#x27;t doing those hourlong reading sessions in silence but that you&#x27;re actively practicing a different kind of negative behavior.<p>This is just one uneducated person&#x27;s opinion. If we&#x27;re talking about a dysfunctional reward pathway would it not stand to reason that someone&#x27;s gravitation toward systems who provide thousands of small immediate rewards only reinforce this dysfunction? Think video games, porn, and instagram. Juxtapose this with reading a novel, painting a picture, or finally understanding recursion. I feel kind of gross typing that out because it feels like some sort of appeal to nature but I can&#x27;t shake it.')
