If we&#x27;re talking firmware updates, I&#x27;ve yet to have software stop working after a system update or upgrade. There have been random crashes that 9&#x2F;10 times clear up on their own after a couple of reboots, or needed to clear cached data and resumed working afterwards, but no show stoppers and certainly no software incompatibilities after the update was applied.<p>My most recent OS upgrade was on an LG phone with stock firmware (upgraded from Android 8 to 9). Flawless process, and this is on a phone that&#x27;s gone several other updates and upgrades (biggest one was 8 to 8.1 as I recall) and has been in constant use for 2 years.<p>Been an Android user since the Google Nexus One, which I got on release day as I recall. Weirdly enough, it&#x27;s the LED trackball I miss the most.')
