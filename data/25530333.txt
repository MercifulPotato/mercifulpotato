They had to make the service profitable, after all!<p>When YouTube first allowed creators to monetize their videos using ads, to support themselves, and youtube would pay them and also take a cut? I certainly didn&#x27;t mind. It promoted good content, and they&#x27;ve got to make money after all!<p>When YouTube decided I could no longer turn off my phone&#x27;s screen when I played a video, I began to mind. I thought it was a bug at first, but then I found out it was intentional. I guess they have to make sure we&#x27;re looking when they play ads. Gotta make money after all.<p>When YouTube made their terms worse for creators multiple times, I read on with sadness, but it didn&#x27;t really affect me, and they&#x27;ve gotta see revenue growth, or something.<p>When YouTube started actively screwing creators out of monetization for bizarre and arcane reasons, but would then still show ads on the de-monetized videos, and collect the full take? I felt miffed. They don&#x27;t need the money that bad -- if it&#x27;s demonetized, it shouldn&#x27;t have ads. But what could we do? Stop watching?<p>When YouTube started aggressively nagging me to sign up for their paid service to &quot;unlock&quot; those old &quot;features&quot; like no ads and playing videos when my screen is off, I was pissed off. They really gotta make money like this? I still see these nags daily.<p>When YouTube recently decided that on all videos, even ones the creators have chosen specifically not to monetize (e.g. because they&#x27;re intended as educational content), YouTube will force 10-15 seconds of unskippable ads for every 10 minutes of video, and then take all of that profit?<p>Fuck &#x27;em. They don&#x27;t need the money. YouTube is rotten to the core.<p>One of the richest corporations on the planet has forced these intrusive, shitty ads upon literally billions of people, degrading their hugely profitable service with no real alternatives, and you feel the need to defend YouTube here? You&#x27;re &quot;<i>worried</i> people have the <i>nerve</i> to complain&quot;? You tell us, &quot;you can all just pay up!&quot;<p>What a sickening disgrace! Collaborators are tragically easy to find.<p>To quote Pratchett, &quot;It was as if even the most intelligent person had this little blank spot in their heads where someone had written: &quot;Kings. What a good idea.&quot; Whoever had created humanity had left in a major design flaw. It was its tendency to bend at the knees.&quot;')
