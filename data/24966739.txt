We seem to have forgotten that this was the actual function of  old fashioned paper based telephone books.<p>As I see it, it&#x27;s imperative that something like this be established as it&#x27;s the first step in unshackling ourselves from being permanently locked in to Big Tech.  Similarly, we need portable email addresses and\nportable IDs that we can use anywhere and with any service.  As this HN news story illustrates, we need these more than ever and we need them soon.<p>These won&#x27;t be easy to implement as Big Tech will oppose them every inch of the way.  For starters, we&#x27;d need legislation that would enforce Big Tech to compulsorily use these IDs. As Big Tech is in the pocket of governments, this won&#x27;t be easy.')
