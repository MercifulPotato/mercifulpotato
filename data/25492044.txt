Claiming a new mutant covid enables them to tighten up restrictions while also pretending to previously have been right about loosening up restrictions.<p>It&#x27;s similar to how they can&#x27;t have a rational cannabis policy because of a nonexistent varient called &quot;skunk&quot; which is <i>so much worse</i> than the cannabis that nearly everyone has experience with that it has to be regulated exactly like all cannabis always has been (even back when they weren&#x27;t making claims about &quot;skunk&quot;.) This &quot;skunk&quot; conveniently <i>actually</i> has all the traits that they have always claimed that cannabis had.')
