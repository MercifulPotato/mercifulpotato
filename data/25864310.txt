And not just in a &quot;hey, I made that!&quot; kind of way, but in a &quot;I will sue people who say I didn&#x27;t make it. &quot; [0] kind of way.<p>This alone is enough for me dismiss his claims. Satoshi clearly intentionally wanted to remain unknown. It might be a real name, but it likely isn&#x27;t. There was plenty of opportunity to reveal himself. Now that BTC is suddenly valuable and Blockchain has taken off, it is inevitable that there will be opportunists who want to personally gain from it. CSW is just one of many.<p>Not to mention that CSW has made other false claims, such as claiming to hold a PhD when he actually doesn&#x27;t [1]. There is a lawsuit where his name is titled as &quot;Dr.&quot;. Again, alarm bells should be going off for anybody that sees that.<p>And of course, there is a very simple way to prove he is Satoshi, which is to prove he holds the private key for a known Satoshi public key. But he can&#x27;t do that, and almost certainly forged multiple keys he claims are Satoshi&#x27;s [2].<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.latimes.com&#x2F;business&#x2F;la-fi-bitcoin-craig-wright-20190620-story.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.latimes.com&#x2F;business&#x2F;la-fi-bitcoin-craig-wright-...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;mashable&#x2F;status&#x2F;675193059408265216?s=20" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;mashable&#x2F;status&#x2F;675193059408265216?s=20</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vice.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;article&#x2F;jpgq3y&#x2F;satoshis-pgp-keys-are-probably-backdated-and-point-to-a-hoax" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vice.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;article&#x2F;jpgq3y&#x2F;satoshis-pgp-keys-are...</a>')
