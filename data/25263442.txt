Then I immigrated to Canada and since I was not exactly Einstein science did not pay enough. So I&#x27;ve switched to product development since during my science days I&#x27;ve learned how to program computers, design mechanics and electronics for my experiments and many other interesting skills.<p>End result - been on my own for the last 20 years and develop products for living. From initial idea to successful production stage. Not always software. Sometimes it is also mechanics and electronics. Some I develop for my own company. Some I made for clients. Never had a single f.. up in regards to delivery and have very good references.<p>I do not get hung up on languages, technologies etc. To me those are just tools. What I am very good at is figuring out the most practical and fastest way to design build and deliver solid product. Sometimes I design and code most of it, sometimes I hire extra subcontractors. I get satisfaction from the end result and the pay of course. I&#x27;ve done just about anything from firmware and real time device control to enterprise systems for Telcos, etc.<p>So what do I call myself? No frigging idea but by word of mouth I get nice clients here and there.')
