It&#x27;s not about free market fundamentalism vs socialism, it&#x27;s just that in this case, this market is totally broken. Costs are completely out of control, and accordingly, access, that is, access without incurring crippling debt, is a huge problem.<p>Obama tried to address both cost and access. He went up against the insurance companies, and lost. He got somewhere on access, but even that is just access to insurance; insurance that may leave you with thousands of dollars to pay out-of-pocket if you walk into the ED with a complaint. So maybe you don&#x27;t go.<p>Socialized medicine, it seems, certainly won&#x27;t fly in this country. But socialized insurance, &quot;Medicare for all&quot;? We, the little people, have many reasons to support a multi-decade experiment with that.<p>There&#x27;s no ideology here. It&#x27;s just insane (unless you&#x27;re profiting!) given history for us to continue imagine that <i>in this case</i> the Invisible Hand is going to fix things.')
