Item(by='Cthulhu_', descendants=None, kids=[25344555], score=None, time=1607432352, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25340433, text='There&#x27;s a ton of padding in this article to be honest; the tl;dr is that the guy that found it revealed his identity because of impending lawsuits, notably one who claimed her text messages and e-mails were hacked to spy on her ideas of where the treasure might be.<p>The rest of the article is just a ton of fluff, repeats, and padding. I for one would just like to know where the treasure was located in the end (and I don&#x27;t understand why it&#x27;s not just revealed, given that there&#x27;s no treasure there anymore), and what was in it. Don&#x27;t really care about who found it.')
