My understanding is that it boils down to &quot;It helps those who are deficient but doesn&#x27;t do much, if anything, if you aren&#x27;t deficient.&quot;<p>Now, a <i>lot</i> of people are deficient -- probably more now than usual due to the lock down because people aren&#x27;t getting out much, so people are getting less sun exposure. So I tend to get downvoted when I say things like &quot;If you are deficient, you should redress that. If you are not, extra Vitamin D seems to do nothing and is potentially bad for you (because it is fat soluble and you can hit toxic levels in your system if you overconsume).&quot;<p>I think there may somewhat less excitement about it because it helps <i>if you are deficient</i> but not if you are not, so it fails to serve as a drug substitute. People tend to not get excited about the idea that treating nutritional deficiencies helps shore up your body&#x27;s ability to fight disease, even in cases where that deficiency is fairly widespread and the disease in question is fairly deadly.<p>Hoomans: Not the most logical species.')
