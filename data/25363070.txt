What relevance does it have?<p>Of course any open source project can have features added in private.  Those are not part of the platform.<p>It’s certainly not true to say those features already exist in the platform, as you falsely tried to claim upthread.<p>It also doesn’t mean you can add them to the platform if the maintainers don’t accept them.<p>As I say, you are confusing what is possible in some other reality with what is actually true.')
