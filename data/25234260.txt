It&#x27;s hard for me to overstate how bad of a choice Hungary is for anything remotely related to tech&#x2F;business&#x2F;trading.   Hungarian law is convoluted, and generally made by &amp; for large corps; taxation (outside of the small business sector which you don&#x27;t qualify for) is high, corruption is high, people are low and hopeless. Hungary also went through consequent phases of massive brain drain (2003, 2008, 2011). For the remaining people, Hungary&#x27;s USP is &quot;you can have sex here&quot;, which won&#x27;t be applicable to you. For anyone else, the lack of compelling things to do, intelligence to work together with, and a proper functional system that isn&#x27;t adversarial to entrepreneural action makes it an unlivably hostile system.  Strongly recommend leaving as soon as feasible.')
