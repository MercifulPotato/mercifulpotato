Item(by='ashton314', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611971851, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25964991, text='I like dynamic typing: most of my work is done in untyped Racket or Elixir. <i>Weak</i> typing is fun, but can be frustrating. My issue is that this single data structure functions like a list in some cases, and a map in others. Try piping the result of array_filter to array_map sometime. You canâ€™t do it without an intermediate call to array_values first because the result of passing a list to array_filter does not behave like a list anymore: it operates strictly like a map and cannot have map called on it. (Oh the irony!)')
