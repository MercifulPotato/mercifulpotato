For a programmer, this would be maybe 50-80% of the time.  This is where the monitors and keyboards and chairs are.  Personal tools and personal space.<p>But, there should be enough opportunity to socialize when you feel like it; ranging from sofas and coffee machines and team lunches to pool tables and movie clubs and parties and gardens and tennis courts and dinners and skiing trips or whatever.<p>Universities tend to be pretty good in this sort of thing, actually.

You also get a vibrant community of smart people with varying interests and a huge range of activities to pick from.<p>Most of us aren&#x27;t hermits, after all.
