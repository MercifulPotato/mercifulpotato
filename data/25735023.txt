If they are dropping them because of illegal activity being sanctioned on the service, that should be part of the record, maybe even along with evidence of their unwillingness to address the problem.  All of those things point to a client willing to abuse the service, thus justifying Amazon&#x2F;Apple&#x2F;Google cutting them off.  If however, the auditable trail shows that the service was making attempts to address the issue, that gives them some leeway.  All of this is under the false assumption that there is some unforeseen perfectly objective arbiter of disputes like this.')
