They also purposely don&#x27;t recycle because of &quot;O&#x27;Bummer.&quot;  I tried to explain to them that recycling existed before Obama but it fell on deaf ears.  My aunt literally dumped a giant bag of empty bottles into the garbage can and gave a little gleeful laugh saying, &quot;Haha, OBAMA!&quot; as the cans clattered down.<p>Meanwhile they have grandkids so I don&#x27;t really understand why they wouldn&#x27;t support environmental policies.  They&#x27;re basically brainwashed by Fox News and Rush Limbaugh&#x27;s talk radio show.')
