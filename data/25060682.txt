Toys less so.<p>I found that Ableton push was actually extremely helpful to take my understanding of Ableton to the next level. I then sold my push, and am more proficient with the software now.<p>If you don&#x27;t have the &quot;muscle memory&quot; of other DAWs then ableton will be a new paradigm and absolutely hard to use and understand. Esp the difference between midi and audio.<p>Edit: I had a long day, so I might sound harsher than you expect, but the core of my message is: learning new powerful instruments is hard. Best of luck learning ableton, it&#x27;s great.
