Item(by='pseudo0', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603693356, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24893103, text='Thanks for pointing that out, I&#x27;ve changed the link to a different article that has Bobulinski&#x27;s full statement. He verifies the authenticity of the contentious email referring to a &quot;10% cut for the big guy&quot; in the first paragraph of the full statement.<p>What exactly did the New York Post mischaracterize? I read the article and my general impression was that it was a bit sensationalized, but that&#x27;s rather typical when it comes to bombshell scoops. My understanding of the term misinformation is that it refers to presenting outright false information as fact, not the (unfortunately typical) narrative framing of factual information that happens in the news every day.<p>Regarding the provenance of the emails, the FBI subpoenaed the laptop over a year ago, and they&#x27;ve had the original in their possession since then. If their digital forensic experts haven&#x27;t found evidence of foul play, I&#x27;d consider that a good indication that the laptop is indeed Hunter&#x27;s and was found in the repair shop. Hunter&#x27;s lawyer allegedly also contacted the repair shop on Oct 13, in an attempt to recover the laptop.')
