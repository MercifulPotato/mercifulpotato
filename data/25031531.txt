Item(by='soraminazuki', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604897081, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25030731, text='&gt; I&#x27;ve yet to encounter another distro that deliberately breaks 3rd party software the way Nix did it to rebar3<p>Except that your anecdote is completely misleading given that the patched version was intended for creating Nix packages. You could&#x27;ve just used the unmodified version instead.<p>Furthermore, upstream developers complain about how distros are breaking their software <i>all[1] the[2] time[3]</i>. Again not a Nix specific problem. Nix even alleviates some of the problems because you can use different versions of the same software, meaning that different packages don&#x27;t have to share dependencies as aggressively as other distros do.<p>&gt; Which distros? Can you share a comparison in number of tests&#x2F;coverage?<p>Arch, Debian, CentOS, and Homebrew, though the last one isn&#x27;t strictly a Linux distro. I can&#x27;t possibly count the numbers given that the sheer number of packages available, so it&#x27;s based on experiences at looking at package definitions. I tend to check package definitions across distros a lot to write packages fir Nix.<p>&gt; It depends on your threat model. Mine is stricter.<p>If you have a problem with software projects accepting outside contributions even if they go through review, you have a problem with using free and open source software in general. It makes me wonder how you even manage to use the Linux kernel.<p>&gt; Once again, it breaks the cryptographic chain of custody set by the upstream. In my threat model that&#x27;s not acceptable.<p>Then use the unmodified rebar3 for your project instead. But anyways, if your threat model involves not trusting SHA256, you likely have a problem with your said cryptographic chain of custody too.<p>&gt; Nix not only doesn&#x27;t help, but also introduces additional footguns with world-readable configuration files.<p>&gt; FHS accounts for secret management, among other things.<p>That&#x27;s an outright lie. NixOS doesn&#x27;t prevent you from storing secrets in a file and applying your usual UNIX permissions. FHS has absolutely nothing to do with it.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;pypa&#x2F;pip&#x2F;issues&#x2F;5599" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;pypa&#x2F;pip&#x2F;issues&#x2F;5599</a>\n[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20181021091049&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;heroku&#x2F;homebrew-brew&#x2F;issues&#x2F;5" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20181021091049&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.co...</a>\n[3]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;videolan&#x2F;status&#x2F;1153963312981389312" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;videolan&#x2F;status&#x2F;1153963312981389312</a>')
