Inviting people is two clicks and a paste. Joining a server (once you have an account) is two clicks. It is so simple you donâ€™t even think about it.<p>...and then you have to delete that account because you&#x27;re not logged in on the browser, and log in to the main site with your browser, and click on the invite link again<p>I think there is a &quot;get verification link in email&quot; step somewhere in there for me too, it&#x27;s always a major pain in the ass to accept an invite for me and I kind of dread getting discord invites because of this.')
