I expect this is a common way to setup modem mode, and it feels like the &quot;correct default&quot; way to do it.<p>This makes basic connectivity between the Zyxel box acting as a modem and the TR069 server challenging, though perhaps not impossible (you could, say, allocate a small IPv6 prefix to the modem, but I&#x27;m not sure if A&amp;A&#x27;s TR069 servers work over an IPv6 only connection).')
