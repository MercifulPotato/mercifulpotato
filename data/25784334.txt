Parlor and gab etc have all the money around but no skills or mindset. Embarrassing.<p>The most ironic thing is that TPBs enemies include not just the US government but also many European and the Russian one. Compared to gab&#x2F;parlor which is supported by the current president of the US and probably liked by the Russian one too.<p>First time tpb got shut down was because a Mexican gang wanted some cash. Took a day to move. Second time was when the USG forced Sweden to send 50 cops and even arrest the lawyer. Took 3 days to get back online, 1.5 days was spent to get drunk and party.&quot;')
