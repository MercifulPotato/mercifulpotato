Their priority with the old versions is mostly to keep them working as-is, specifically to reduce the chance that things will break in subtle ways and then will need to be fixed later, because those issues can be hard to track down and can really harm backwards compatibility. If such a compatibility layer existed, it would not be something that needs to be part of GTK4 or hold up a GTK4 release in order for GTK2&#x2F;3 applications to make use of it. It would really not have been possible to even make this kind of compatibility layer before GTK4 was stabilized.<p>The GTK developers are just ordinary people like you or I who volunteered to work on it, if you want to change this situation then you or someone else can step up and become a GTK developer and work on this. Then you can say they care about it :) I think it is incorrect to say they don&#x27;t care about backwards compatibility anyway, you seem to agree that they would meet that minimum required to claim backwards compatibility.')
