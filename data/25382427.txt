They seem to be a better thing to address to address this issue.<p>Could there be long tail impacts? I don’t know, but “we don’t know” is not a terribly strong argument. Surely that could also be said for lots of things other than plastic.<p>&gt; * Plastic is a petrochemical product. Like all petrochemical products its extraction and production steps are environmentally devastating<p>That seems a plausible concern. We’d have to see the specific evidence about just how damaging that is, and how damaging it is relative to the alternatives.<p>&gt; * Current policies for managing plastic waste fall into two categories: we either put it in a hole and forget about it (see the long tail point above)<p>I’ve hear that this isn’t actually a bad thing. For one thing, it’s localized (as in concentrated in specific areas). And surely there are ways of ensuring minimal leaching of ‘bad things’ in surrounds (potential eg: choosing a spot with appropriate groundwater).<p>&gt; or we externalize it to a significantly poorer country for &quot;recycling&quot; (read: dumping into waterways, burning as trash, putting in their own holes in the ground). The former is an unknown, the later is bad and unsustainable<p>But then why aren’t these specific issues being targeted rather than plastics per se?')
