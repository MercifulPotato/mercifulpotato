I would love nothing more that to be proven wrong! Some common things that I do in VIM:<p><pre><code>  * Copy or cut everything between these quotes &#x2F; parenthesis &#x2F; brackets.\n  * Delete up until the next X character. Now delete up until the next X character again.\n  * Cut these rows then paste them over there.\n  * Change all instances of &quot;foo&quot; to &quot;bar&quot;.\n  * Show all lines with (or without) &quot;foo&quot;.\n  * Reformat a line like so, now do it to the 351 line following it.\n  * Reindent this section of text.\n  * Go to the beginning of this if() &#x2F; method &#x2F; loop.\n  * Go the the file where this Python &#x2F; PHP class is defined.\n  * In markdown files, open this hyperlink\n  * Search for the first occurrence of this token in this method.\n  * Search for the next occurrence of this word (actually learned to do this today, for the most part)\n</code></pre>\nThese were just example off the top of my head in a few seconds, none of which had an easy answer in Emacs. Sure, I could spend ten minutes each to look for how to do each one. I probably did that during the Clinton administration with VIM, before one could just google their problems away. But in VIM, each one has an easy answer and most are actually built right into VIM with no customization necessary. In Emacs, I could implement that stuff but then I&#x27;ll be implementing everything else I need.<p>So I use Evil!')
