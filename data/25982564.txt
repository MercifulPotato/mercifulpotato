I&#x27;ve tried a Lidar collar but the range is too low. The only other option is a cell phone in a case (which is used by search and rescue) but it&#x27;s to expensive since you need a cell phone plan, and it&#x27;s and too bulky to attach to a moving animal.<p>There is a market for this, I&#x27;ll help prototype it , someone start a company to track dogs and children (out playing, biking, skiing) :)')
