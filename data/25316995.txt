If you install apps there (ex: GIMP or VS Code) app icons show up in the ChromeOS launcher, and it uses Wayland forwarding to integrate their windows into the ChromeOS Window manager so they feel native.<p>And as far as tablet interface goes, the UI is a bit less polished than Android but similar and (IMO) very competent. Way better than Gnome and friends. Oh, and you can install any Android app you want!<p>I use my Lenovo Duet a ton now. Only thing holding back this particular device is ARM compat with some dev tools.')
