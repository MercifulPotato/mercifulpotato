I bet it&#x27;s more than 5 cents.<p>&gt; Bitcoin divisibility is limited, by design, to 0.00000001 BTC (1 Satoshi)<p>Not by design, that&#x27;s an implementation details that can easily be changed in the future if 1 sat starts to become valuable enough to make a difference.<p>&gt; and trades involving BTC slow or stop completely.<p>Do you have an example of a single commodity in the history of humanity that simply stopped being traded because it became &quot;too valuable&quot;?<p>I can&#x27;t even understand how that makes sense, if it&#x27;s valuable some people will want to sell it and get something that is more useful to them, like a house, a car, whatever.
