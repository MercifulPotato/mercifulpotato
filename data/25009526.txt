Item(by='Mountain_Skies', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604684864, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25009271, text='There was an episode of Night Court in which a group of attendees from a Star Trek convention end up in court due to fighting over Kirk vs Picard. While Night Court had its share of zany characters, including one whose actor would go on to play the part of Commander Data, it rarely, if ever, broke the supernatural barrier. That is until that episode when a few of the Trekkies appearing before the court beamed out before they could be held in contempt. While good for a chuckle, it seemed out of character for the show. Guess when writers are dealing with Star Trek, the transporter is simply too irresistible to use.')
