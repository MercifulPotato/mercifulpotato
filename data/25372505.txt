There are several studies and some division between the experts on the details, but there&#x27;s a strong case to be made for futures contracts reducing the volatility in these markets.<p>One thing that people don&#x27;t tend to realize is that speculation happens anyway, it&#x27;s just not made in a public manner and through other types of contracts.
