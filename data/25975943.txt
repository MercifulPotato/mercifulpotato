It&#x27;s certainly not the case that psilocyn suddenly transforms into new chemical compounds at will, it almost certainly happens through perception and most likely experience is needed.<p>&gt; You&#x27;d likely need to have already experienced the drug in question in order for this to work, right?<p>I am genuinely curious about this. It should be but I wonder if somebody who has never smoked a joint in their life would be comfortable with the idea of ingesting it to test this out.<p>Most people seem to have horrible first trips because they are probably worried about going crazy so they do it in the comfort of their rooms which almost always triggers existential panic.<p>I just happened to take it on a commute and walking to work, seeing nature, oh my, it was serenity, I felt like it was <i>repairing my soul</i>.<p>Looking to repeat this I took it in my room alone; big mistake, the trip was quite disturbing but perhaps because my own life experiences were disturbing and I was only waking up to it.<p>Thinking back, taking mushrooms alone in your room has consistently led to horrible trips but compensated by an overwhelming sense of healing and long lasting anti-depressant effect.<p>Perhaps it is the ego which is actively trying to resist the Psilocyn Programming. Ego death <i>literally</i> feels like you are dying but on the other side is the realization, it is completely an illusion!')
