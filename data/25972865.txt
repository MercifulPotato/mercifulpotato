Item(by='high_byte', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612039898, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25971888, text='&gt; This article hinges on the &quot;productivity is subjective&quot; argument, which isn&#x27;t true in all cases. There are objective measures for certain types of productivity: library downloads, Stackoverflow points, blog views, GitHub stars.\nLines of Code is not a measurement, why would lib downloads be? Remember the time some 30-line JS lib who just does &quot;split&quot; or something like that was removed and it broke the Internet? heavily relied on - yes (ie heavily downloaded), highly productive? doubtful.<p>You are referring popularity, which sure is part of the sum output of you as a person, but this article is meant to reference purely development productivity. Marketing or whatever is beyond scope. Maybe next post!<p>(popularity gauge != productivity gauge)')
