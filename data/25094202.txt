Likewise for my own productive output: the only code guaranteed to be bug free is the absence of code.<p>For any computer not attached to the public internet, I agree that you should be free to run whatever you want. For anything networked? That’s anarchy, and although I would like the freedom of anarchy I experienced in 2003, unfortunately I don’t like the consequences of <i>everyone else</i> having the freedoms of anarchy in 2020.<p>I don’t have any fun, easy, side-effect free, solutions.')
