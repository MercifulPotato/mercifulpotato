The key modifier there for me was &quot;nihilistic&quot; error theory, aka one that gives up on making sense of a world without an &quot;objective&quot; morality. No intention of calling error theory generally crazy or unhinged. In some ways I feel bad for OP - the view seems quite unhinged when read together, but really I would view it as one misstep&#x2F;lack of step on the way to interesting truth.<p>FWIW, my personal way forward is something like determinism + moral psychology + Rawls theory of justice if that makes any sense.<p>Based on this thread plus your bio Spinoza quote I&#x27;m guessing we likely align on a good deal :)')
