No one thinks about the risk.  Running a business, which in a sense you are doing by being a contractor, is all about managing risk.  When I ran a food business, that was 90% of my tasks, and I had to make sure that things continued to run no matter what happened.  When you start realizing how exposed you are to bad things happening, it starts to wear on you.  What happens if an employee gets hurt, or the food is prepped wrong (and someone dies)?  How much money is it going to cost and will it bankrupt you?  Companies like Uber and Lyft don&#x27;t explain that to people.  They don&#x27;t explain the risk they are taking on by earning a few extra dollars.  Will most people be ok, sure?  Bad things happen even to people who take all the precautions, and it is an expensive and extremely painful lesson to learn.')
