I know it&#x27;s not perl, but it&#x27;s similar. And it has similar conventions. And like Perl, it gets shit done pretty concisely. It&#x27;s also a write-only language (easy to write &#x2F; hard to read). I do find it interesting that bash has kinda become the DevOps root tool. I don&#x27;t think DevOps would have had it&#x27;s moment without Bash or if bash was similar to DOS Batch files instead, for example.')
