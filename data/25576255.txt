Are weâ€™re ignoring this gorilla so much that people need citations?<p>I&#x27;m going to push back on the tenuous link between the US being protectionist and the stimulus package. It&#x27;s not like protectionist policies directly led to the economic problems the US - and a lot of the world - are experiencing thus requiring the stimulus package.<p>Your argument is that if the trade war didn&#x27;t happen China would have been far more likely to help us. That&#x27;s not an unreasonable argument but even if they did do that how would that have prevented the economic damages caused by all of the lockdowns the US - and China - went through?<p>A reasonable argument could also be made that even if the trade war didn&#x27;t happen China would not have done what you described anyway. China and the US have always had a tumultuous relationship. Plus let&#x27;s not forget the panicked free-for-all when it came to PPE during the early days of the pandemic which many, many countries participated in.<p>So I would say the US&#x27;s bungled response to the early days of the pandemic are what lead to the stimulus package, not any sort of protectionist policies. If the US were on better terms with China perhaps it would have been slightly less severe due to Chinese supplied masks during the shortage and all that; but given how difficult its been to make people wear masks in general I&#x27;m not so sure.')
