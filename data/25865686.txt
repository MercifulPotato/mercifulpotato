I&#x27;m really thinking that I need an app like that one but how to justify the price ? I&#x27;m ready to pay for that kind of service but it&#x27;s seems too expensive to me. How an app like this can cost you 10$ per month and in comparison an app like Procreate (best drawing app on iPad) cost you only 10$ (not per month or year, just 10$).')
