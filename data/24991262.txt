The statements in the &quot;Why Sunsama?&quot; section are comically grandiose.  I sincerely doubt that people who are &quot;struggling to keep up&quot; are hindered primarily by  poor scheduling or, if they are, that they will listen to reminders coming from yet-another piece of software or that the software will magically know how best to prioritize tasks.  Based on these claims, I would easily toss this product in the &quot;snake oil&quot; category of products and services which promise to make my life awesome but which, at best, might make a marginal improvement.  If there is more to the software, awesome, but that should be front-and-center because as it stands I see no real value proposition.')
