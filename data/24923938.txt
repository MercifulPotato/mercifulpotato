Item(by='DCKing', descendants=None, kids=[24924655], score=None, time=1603917950, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24923306, text='Wayland is a display protocol.<p>X.org is a display protocol, its own server implementation of that protocol, and many utilities to interface with that server. And even more stuff.<p>To illustrate this: if you run Gnome on X.org, you will see you have an &#x27;xorg&#x27; binary running in addition to all the Gnome stuff. That&#x27;s the X11 server from X.org. If you run Gnome on Wayland, there&#x27;s no &#x27;wayland&#x27; stuff running. There&#x27;s just Gnome implementing the Wayland display protocol.<p>That&#x27;s why this &quot;switching to Wayland&quot; talk is just missing the point. You&#x27;re not really switching to Wayland, you&#x27;re just switching to a &quot;pure Gnome&quot; stack, or a &quot;pure KDE&quot; stack, or a &quot;pure Sway&quot; stack. These stacks all just happen to implement the Wayland protocol in their own compositors (i.e. Mutter, KWin, Sway) because they&#x27;re committed to standardization and all want to run GTK3+Qt5+Ozone+XWayland+etc apps built for Wayland.')
