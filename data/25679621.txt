Then if someone wants to go slow, they just have to contend with being passed and having to pull a side when someone behind them signals intent to overtake. The person overtaking will have to wait their turn to pass safely. Roads remain public and we likely reduce the number of accidents from unsafe passing&#x2F;overtaking.')
