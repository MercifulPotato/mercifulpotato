The obvious cheat with asynchronous test taking would be for one person to volunteer to take the test early and then send the questions to their peers,<p>This problem has been largely solved for a long time, because as you noted it is generally impossible to give a test to EVERYONE at the same time.<p>Thus properly written tests will draw a random selection of questions from a larger pool,  the ratio between Pool:Questions the better the security.  (i.e a 25 question exam using a 50 question pool is not as secure as a 25 question exam using a 200 question pool)<p>This method is also used for standardized tests given at the same time, as it cuts out the problem of shoulder surfing or other in-person cheating methods.')
