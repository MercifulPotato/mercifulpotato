If you think Fitbit is as revolutionary as you say, than you should be supporting every possible way to prevent Google from adding it to their graveyard.<p>You could be right about this, but Apple absolutely was cleaning FitBit&#x27;s clock and I think if they didn&#x27;t make a big move they might have gone bankrupt. It&#x27;s just so, so, so incredibly difficult to pack billions of pieces perfectly into a tiny device that people can wear all day on their wrists and make hundreds of millions of them. I hope it goes well with Goog. The world needs more of these.<p>&gt; I had a Fitbit Ionic,<p>The Ionic was good, the Versa 2 a big step up (haven&#x27;t gotten the new one yet but will soon).<p>I also have an Apple Watch SE. The Apple Watch is impressive, but for health I still prefer FitBit hands down. The sleep data is absolutely essential, and the ~1 day battery life in the Apple Watch pales next to the ~1 week in FitBit. I guess I <i></i>could<i></i> get 2 apple watches, and swap them before bedtime, but rather just wear the fitbit. I don&#x27;t care about having the web on my wrist or videos, I just want health stuff.<p>&gt; &quot;They are literally putting a doctor on everyone&#x27;s wrist&quot;<p>It&#x27;s all about the trends. At first remember, ~10 years ago, it was just step counting (and lousy at that). Now there are what, 15 - 20 sensors in that thing? Heart rate, blood oxygen, temperature, motion, etc.<p>Apple is doing amazing things here too. Garmin as well. And FitBit. They all are doing heroic work here. It&#x27;s changing healthcare, and we&#x27;re not even at the 1% level yet. I&#x27;ve spent a few years in medical research, this is the future of medical research.')
