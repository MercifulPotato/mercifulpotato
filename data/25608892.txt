I probably wouldn&#x27;t have been able to play it at a desk either. And BotW is better suited to the portability of the Switch as well. I can&#x27;t imagine trying to play Skyward Sword on the subway or in an airplane seat, but BotW works perfectly for that, and lets you feel like you&#x27;re roaming an open landscape even when you&#x27;re being crammed into a sardine tin.<p>But I miss being able to break into a sprint, then at the right moment, jerk my left hand to roll through an enemy&#x27;s legs and get behind them, spin around and draw my sword while they&#x27;re figuring out where I went. Or chase them off a cliff with my little remote controlled dronebug. The combat does eventually get a lot more creative than at the start, and the enemies in Skyward Sword (bokoblins especially) felt like they had a lot more personality.')
