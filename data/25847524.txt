My somewhat wishy-washy response. There are some differences in the situations. ES has always been a commercial enterprise; Linux is not. As I understand it, Linux basically has a functioning ecosystem that keeps its development funded (although certainly numerous issues exist there). If e.g. Red Hat managed to start threatening the linux ecosystem, and modifying their license gave them recourse to protect themselves, I’d be pretty sympathetic. Are there reasonable principles undergirding my position here? I can’t tell this morning')
