Amazon is in full compliance with the AGPL for example, so if ES had changed the license from Apache to AGPL, nothing would have changed - that is why they had to move to a non-free license instead.<p>Basically, their problem is that it&#x27;s impossible to compete with Amazon on delivering a managed SaaS, and most of their money was coming from that.<p>In terms of the software itself and user freedoms, the licenses used have achieved their goals - ES is free, people using it can control exactly what they are running, can patch it and redistribute etc. No one owns ES itself, so it is Free Software in your sense.<p>The people who are having a problem though are the project behind most of the work on this. Now, whether this is a real problem (the company is struggling to remain profitable because of Amazon) or just a fake problem (the company is profitable but it&#x27;s not growing as expected in some 5 year plan) I don&#x27;t know, but this is the reason for this type of change.')
