For each commit that is finished, I would create a new branch and cherry-pick that specific commit on it. I would create a PR for those branches.<p>Once the PR (possibly with some changes still) is approved and merged, I would rebase my &quot;work&quot; branch on top of the updated master. Since it was an orthogonal commit, you&#x27;ll typically see that the merged work just disappears from your branch during the rebase. If it really was orthogonal work, you&#x27;ll not have any conflicts.<p>This is an approach I&#x27;ve used whenever I need to work on something that depends on other work that was not merged yet. You have a work branch that includes all the work, since you depend on it, but you want to offer smaller pieces as PR to make the review process more efficient.')
