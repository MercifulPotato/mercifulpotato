I have talked recently to Persian coworkers about their nation&#x27;s history. They identify with the full length of recorded Persian history. That is, all ~5000 years of it. I have read elsewhere that this is possibly a modern trend, that is, they didn&#x27;t teach Persian history as the history of <i>their</i> current country at some points in the past.<p>I suspect their emotional attachment to events 2000 years ago feels a bit different to mine then. They might feel a whole lot closer to the Sassasinds than I do to Boudicca. But maybe that has not always been the case.')
