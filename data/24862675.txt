Then they came along and said, maybe they shouldn&#x27;t be doing that. Even Facebook came out and said they would be slowing down sharing of this story.<p>Now, if they did this for every kind of sensational story, okay, but this very clearly seems to be a partisan issue. There have been a few Trump stories that are similarly sensational and were not censored the same way.<p>By the way, I don&#x27;t know how much of that story is correct, but it&#x27;s pretty clear they treated that story differently than anything else, and it leads to people becoming very suspicious of what these companies are doing. It&#x27;s also very scary that Twitter or Facebook would just say, no this story from a newspaper can&#x27;t even be shared.')
