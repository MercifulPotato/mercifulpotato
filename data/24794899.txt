Assuming many of your clients are consuming Cloudflare and all of their backbone, security, networking, and remote work services.<p>Would I just have Boundary authenticate via Cloudflare Access and whatever identity provider Cloudflare One is integrated with and move to the RBAC policy phase of the authentication - is this where i am seeing that additional value from Boundary by having that additional on demand credential rotation to various internal Apps and DBs once i am past the SSO stage? CF One is more of a vertically integrated all in one service addressing all of my other networking and security needs so it&#x27;s not really going anywhere.<p>I think you guys could do well to release a Cloudflare integration paper, it might help with traction on on-boarding customers.<p>Thanks!')
