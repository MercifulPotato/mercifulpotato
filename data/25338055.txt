They just are focusing on their core competencies, I assume. To compete in the self driving space, you need to have 1) a crap ton of money and 2) the patience to wait 10 years before you see any ROI. Uber is not structured to do that this late in the game. They’ll probably get a preferred partnership for licensing the tech once it rolls out, if Uber still exists in 10 years.')
