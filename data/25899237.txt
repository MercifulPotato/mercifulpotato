Learning was slow, very slow.<p>When I got out, it took me 8 months to get a computer. I couldn&#x27;t afford to buy one, so I bought it part by part and built one myself, even though I never had done it before.<p>Fast forward 20 years, I&#x27;m a multimillionaire, successful startup founder, and two IPOs deep. I think my success came from the anger I felt in prison. Nothing could be worse than serving time, I told myself, and it made me very ambitious because of it.<p>Reading Travis&#x27; letter and seeing his DOC number at the bottom of it made me feel all those painful, frustrated moments I had while serving time.<p>Best of luck to Travis. I will be contacting his father and sending what is allowed.')
