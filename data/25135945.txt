They didn&#x27;t say &quot;standard&quot;, they said &quot;reasonable&quot; and &quot;ideal&quot;.<p>&gt; Apple are effectively an affialite for your app i.e. they drive traffic to your app through their store.<p>The problem is that they charge that fee no matter where the customers come from, and you can&#x27;t opt out either.')
