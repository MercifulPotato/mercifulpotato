Linux is more secure on the desktop because it doesn&#x27;t attract hackers with its 1% market share and because its users are more tech savvy.<p>Arguably otherwise Windows has better defense because it comes with built-in virus scanner. Also both systems pretty much don&#x27;t have any sane security policy for the end user at all by default, because they both are trying to defend from the wrong threat - privilege escalation, - which is irrelevant for desktop users 90% of the time.')
