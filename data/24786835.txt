Is the implication that AI researches invented Agile or something? Literally everybody does (or pretends to do) some kind of Agile these days. And I don&#x27;t mean this in a &quot;my enlightened startup does software dev like this&quot; way, big corporations have the actual job title SCRUM master for years now. I did mom-and-pop store Wordpress projects with &quot;machine learning methods&quot; apparently - nice!<p>After wording this out I brought myself to read the whole article, and, well, it is a marketing piece for their productivity tool Comet which solves all the problem you have by building AI, which does not have &quot;The provable correctness of software engineering&quot; (I wish software would be provably correct :| ).')
