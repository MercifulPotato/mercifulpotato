Names seem to serve as a way for the authors to avoid telling us exactly what the software does, instead referring to what the software &quot;is&quot;.  Horribly imprecise and the source of endless arguments.  The disagreements in this thread are but a tiny example.<p>This is nothing new and during the dot-com boom I think the naming nonsense spread to websites, in addtion to software.  Software people have been obsessed with wacky names as long as I can remember.<p>I find this so repulsive and unworkable (e.g., name conflicts, needless keystrokes) that on personal computers I actually name programs I write for myself using an alpha prefix and a numerical suffix.  For quick reference I keep a separate index of what each program does.  Every program has a unique, sequential number in its name.  Every name has the same number of characters.')
