The permanent buffs make your character damn strong relative to your first run.<p>My personal fave is Nuclear Throne. It&#x27;s not particularly polished, not does it have oodles of content, but the gunfeel is second to none, and the lethality is <i>very</i> high. Once you&#x27;re deep into a run, you&#x27;re a walking avatar of destruction, a glass cannon made out of guns, and I love it to death.')
