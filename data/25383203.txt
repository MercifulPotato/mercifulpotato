Most days if a meal is consumed at home it&#x27;s either cold (salads, something with-or-on bread), really quick (soups), or zero-prep (fruit or nuts).<p>Breakfast is usually at a nearby hotel which covers 2&#x2F;3 daily meals and associated coffee. Got a deal going so executable at less than walk-in expense, with zero lock-in (turn up or nay), transferable so also good for meetings on occasion. Heaps of fresh fruit, bit of protein, veg, coffee. Would be hard to match for cost let alone time at home.<p>My view is to look at quality food like insurance and invest in your health, or do the maths on the time. It&#x27;s worth it.')
