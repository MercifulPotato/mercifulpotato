For Apple however, these chips are completely structural, they already underlie huge amounts of their business and with the switch of Macs to ARM are slated to do so even more.<p>It may not be possible for x86 though, because of the architecture&#x27;s complexity limits e.g. how wide you can decode, and more generally how much hardware you can keep fed concurrently.')
