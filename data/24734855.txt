This eventually lead to me moving my account to E*Trade, where my company&#x27;s stock plan accounts are hosted.  Thankfully, that process was completely seamless, and I&#x27;ve had 0 problems so far, but I do wonder what would happen if I somehow discovered an issue at 3 PM that needed a timely resolution.')
