Some brokers will only let you sell the later due to the margin needed. With a covered call you have to own the stock and hold it in your portfolio. With a non covered call, if your option gets exercised you then buy the stock at market value and sell to the executor at the agreed upon price.<p>basically when people are saying they shorted over 100% of the stock they are saying that its a non covered PUT contract and there isn&#x27;t enough stock to cover the volume of all the PUT options contracts.<p>BUT what we don&#x27;t know is when this PUT options contracts expire, which could basically make all of this worth fairly worthless. If the shorts option contracts don&#x27;t expire til next year then this really doesn&#x27;t matter to them.<p>Generally the P&amp;L dept will make them stagger the options contracts over dates spanning the next year or so though.<p>I would recommend reading up on call and put options for more information.')
