Anymore, I still have the opportunity to build models, they just aren&#x27;t client-facing stuff, but instead are kind of Data Plumber Bots that help me do my job better so I can waste more time building other fun bots that I can&#x27;t otherwise be paid for.<p>Seems like a waste of resources, but my manager could have another DS tomorrow, but my role would take months to fill.')
