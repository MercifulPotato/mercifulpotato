It&#x27;s not clear that there would be any usable signal to act on, especially not one of sufficient confidence to ignore a giant red stop sign in the camera.<p>This isn&#x27;t a perception issue.  It&#x27;s an insufficient model for the world, and the software is obviously biased towards obeying critical traffic controls at lower confidence levels.  It would be interesting to see what would happen if a (higher) speed limit sign was flashed in the same way.')
