But even in the 60% there are a lot that are not meeting the skills required, but they are protected from any action by labor laws and unions, including forced salary raised based on how long they worked there, with no performance indicators.<p>In practical terms, over 50% of that large (many thousands) organization should not exist. Another 50% of what is left is only needed because EU bureaucracy requires them to cover work that can be avoided. That qualifies for &quot;too much bureaucracy&quot;.')
