You can never remove all stressors but you have way more control over your reaction than you think.<p>One example - people&#x27;s natural emotional reaction to work deadlines is something like &quot;I&#x27;ll die if I don&#x27;t make it&quot; which is almost never literally true, but your body and mind torment you as if it was. Everyone can learn to reframe it to something more healthy like &quot;I am a hard-working processional and I am driving myself to achieve this deadline as a matter of achievement and pride&quot;.  Then you can engage with it fully and then still go to sleep at night.<p>Here&#x27;s the key thing: whether you are able to change how you react depends on whether you try, and whether you try depends on whether you believe that you can. So at the start, you must believe that introspection will empower you to make changes, or you are doomed to be stuck forever.<p>The pit that many people fall into is that they take themselves very seriously and believe that how they feel about something is an objective representation of the severity of that thing. My example with deadlines above is one example. Another simple one is social anxiety. Someone can really believe and feel that  &quot;if I go to drinks with coworkers, they will judge and laugh at me and I will make an ass out of myself somehow&quot; - that feels super real to them but objectively it&#x27;s not real at all. So they spend hours of torment and lots of sleepless nights fearing and dreading and avoiding something that objectively is nothing. If they can reframe it (over the course of years, with a lot of help and work) the whole thing reduces to &quot;it&#x27;s just drinks who cares.&quot;. Same situation, but the person turner a stressor into a neutral or maybe even positive.<p>Don&#x27;t be stuck where you are, and don&#x27;t think you can&#x27;t change or feel differently unless the world does. And then expect the change to be hard work but worth it.')
