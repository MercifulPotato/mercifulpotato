This is especially true in the case of enormous corporations with many thousands of employees.<p>When someone is getting hired by Amazon, it&#x27;s literally a million versus one. That&#x27;s a lot of leverage to bring to a negotiation, so it makes sense that a union would be necessary to even the odds for unskilled labor.')
