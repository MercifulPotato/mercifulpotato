Signature match is the minimum filter to prevent outright fake ballots.<p>2. I believe there was a procedure for rectifying a rejected mail-in ballot. The person still could have voted, if they sent in their ballot on time, and rectified any mistakes.<p>3. Mail-in ballots are really an assault on the right to a &quot;secret ballot&quot;. There really is no guarantee that the mail-in ballot was filled out in secret. An abusive husband could for example coarse his wife to vote a certain way. A union boss, could coarse his workers to vote a certain way...and so on. This has happened in the past.')
