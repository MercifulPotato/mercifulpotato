I think there&#x27;s a way to make dummy X.org display devices without any extra physical hardware --  I&#x27;ve definitely done similar stuff when setting up headless automated E2E testing, before tools for this were widely available. Is the hard part connecting it to an existing session as a display? Or is it that cross-platform compatibility is what&#x27;s holding it back, since perhaps there is no equivalent for people running a macOS or Windows based OS?<p>All that said, this looks super cool! Congrats and thanks for sharing! I&#x27;m tempted to give it a shot. My current set-up is similar except I use Barrier to share my mouse and keyboard across 4 cheap (&lt;$200) laptops I&#x27;ve accumulated over the last few years.')
