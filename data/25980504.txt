Item(by='zaroth', descendants=None, kids=[25980624, 25980680, 25982228], score=None, time=1612113899, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25980399, text='Robinhood is on the hook to do their part in settling the trade and delivering the shares to their client and cash to the seller.<p>Obviously once funds are used to execute a trade, they are no longer client funds. It seems obvious that the cash at that moment would be held separately as the shares settle. That&#x27;s discretely identifiable hard cash that is fully funding that specific share purchase.<p>I completely grok the various ways that cash that &quot;looks like&quot; it&#x27;s in the account might not be; deposits that haven&#x27;t actually cleared, prior trades that haven&#x27;t actually settled.. and in those cases the brokerage is actually extending credit to their client, and that credit can run dry.<p>But if I have hard cash and a trade executes, that cash is gone from the account. The counterparty risk at that point is the shares not being delivered, which seems to me like it would be collateral that the <i>seller</i> needs to be posting to DTCC (likely DTC already holds the shares). The buyer needs to show they have the hard cash, and they can easily do that.<p>I guess I can&#x27;t get around the fact that if the purchase is fully funded with hard cash that&#x27;s in the account, that is cleared cash that can be sent off to DTCC&#x2F;NSCC during the end-of-day settlement via FedWire.')
