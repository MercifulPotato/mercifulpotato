I just turn the wheel some number of times. If I&#x27;ve driven the same route a hundred times and today one road is closed, I&#x27;m totally lost and need to pull over.<p>But when I bike or walk somewhere it makes so much more sense, I can actually navigate in real time and think about shortcuts or plan a route without having done it before. It&#x27;s one of many, many reasons why I hate driving.')
