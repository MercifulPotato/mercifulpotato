Piece of cake.<p>The only thing I am missing is tracking system files, like &#x2F;etc&#x2F;pacman.conf, and it looks like there&#x27;s a way to do it with yadm, but it looks a bit clunky and I haven&#x27;t tried.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;yadm.io&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;yadm.io&#x2F;</a>')
