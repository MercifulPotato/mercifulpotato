You either have a bugtracker or you don&#x27;t.  It&#x27;s supposed to contain a list of known defects or it isn&#x27;t.<p>&gt; After all it&#x27;s more burdensome for them than it is for me.<p>This is nuts.  This can only be true if there are much, much bigger problems afoot.  Most of this was figured out years ago and opened up to the public under Netscape.  Folks abandoning or ignoring those lessons is precisely why maintainers are burdened, burning out, and complaining about itâ€”they&#x27;ve fostered a culture that encourages outsiders (and the developer&#x27;s own process&#x2F;practices) to &quot;burden&quot; them.<p>&gt; If upstream says they can&#x27;t help me or fix the bug without further input from me, it would silly for me to become infuriated because my effort seems wasted.<p>You&#x27;re strawmanning.  Your job here is not to postulate the most convenient[1] circumstances that <i>could</i> be true and which would make it easy for the fury to seem &quot;silly&quot;.  It&#x27;s to deal with the concrete, non-hypothetical circumstances where people have responded in genuinely obnoxious ways to bug reports.  Imagining counterfactuals is easy.<p>&gt; If I&#x27;m <i>infuriated</i> that the maintainer responds as if I want something from them, and I didn&#x27;t bother to clarify that I don&#x27;t, then ironically that means I <i>do</i> want something from them<p>Sure, but the expectation that people not be presumptuous and&#x2F;or rude where it&#x27;s unprovoked is an expectation that runs through everything.  It should be regarded as axiomatic.<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.lesswrong.com&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Least_convenient_possible_world" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.lesswrong.com&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Least_convenient_possible_wo...</a>')
