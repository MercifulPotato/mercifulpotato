Every few years a new technology would appear to replace the previous half baked attempt at solving the same problem, or dropped completely and replaced by third party components. Long term I found the software very frustrating to work with since everything about it was so volatile and there were so many random gaps in quality and functionality.<p>Their database, Interbase, was pretty good; and well integrated into the language&#x2F;IDE. Open sourced and forked as Firebird SQL at one point.')
