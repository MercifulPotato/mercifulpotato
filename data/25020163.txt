This time, I don&#x27;t have to bus you to the polls... I can host a party at my house to request all of your ballots come to me, where I fill them out and copy your signature from the party &#x2F; event. OR I do this over the course of a few months, and still have all the ballots directed to me, still copy your signature from the form we filled out together. Or even worse, I use hacked data to request a ballot on your behalf because you never show up to the polls anyway.<p>To me, that&#x27;s an extreme vulnerability -- that means beyond it not being rate limited, the physical person is no longer needed to fill out their own ballot. Not only this... there was always the chance someone could go &#x27;off script&#x27; and vote for who they wanted for and just get the free meal. Now, they are guaranteed to be the way you wanted because you filled them out.<p>^ I&#x27;ve known people go on buses to get meals and vote &#x27;off script&#x27;<p>And finally, the reason &#x27;this hasn&#x27;t happened until now&#x27; is because most mail in voting was for absentee voting (in the battle ground states) and never done at this scale where you could have a whole community request ballots to one address almost undetected. (yes this is detectable post-fact, but damage is done and intent is there on both sides.)')
