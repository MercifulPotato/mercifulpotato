It used to be OK to say when people were wrong or get mad when programming errors lit the building on fire.   That started to become NOT OK in the past 15 years.  A lot of older engineers really had to to work hard to adapt because it&#x27;s so frustrating today when people make careless mistakes over and over again and no one can say a word without being accused of not being a team player or something.<p>People were more likely to admit their own mistakes then too.  In that environment it was better to come clean then try to hide a mistake even when coming forward can solve the problem faster.<p>We&#x27;ve overcorrected this stuff.. correcting it helps make the field more inclusive but at some point after we&#x27;re diverse and inclusive we need to walk some of this behavior back a bit.')
