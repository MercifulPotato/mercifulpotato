Due to the prevalence of steam heat most apartments I&#x27;ve been in usually open the windows when it gets too hot in the winter. Having a thermostat in such an apartment is a status symbol.<p>In short, combination of humidity plus tons of waste heat means you generally don&#x27;t get cold there (unless something broke or you don&#x27;t live somewhere with steam).')
