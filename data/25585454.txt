Fucking hell, think of a city like New York if NOTHING WAS DONE.<p>Subsequent lockdowns would NOT have been needed if people would have listened to basic fucking things like: wear a mask, try not to go out unless you really need to, and keep some distance.  But no, people are just selfish as hell and it&#x27;s making it worst for the rest of us.  Doesn&#x27;t help that you have some certain politicians who actively made people resist doing basic things to help out.')
