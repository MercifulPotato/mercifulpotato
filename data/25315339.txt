Item(by='OJFord', descendants=None, kids=[25315491], score=None, time=1607182988, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25312700, text='&gt; my mother&#x27;s ideas of &quot;proper&quot; attire are somewhat like the dress codes of British Royalty that you read about in gossip rags. (Not too much skin showing, no cleavage on display, don&#x27;t let your bra straps show, etc.)<p>This is an even more bizarre comment than TFA to me. Your idea of &#x27;upper class&#x27; and the royal family is... curious. You certainly don&#x27;t have to be <i>royal</i> not to want to wear (or your daughter to wear) a tracksuit with cash and a phone hanging out of visible &#x27;under&#x27;wear..!')
