If you are going for 8bit accuracy, the numbers would be higher but the 25x difference remains.<p>---------<p>Most likely, you will be using the ADC onboard your microcontroller as a hobbyist. Too much effort to wire on another ADC and read up on it&#x27;s documentation.<p>But a hobbyist will almost always have capacitors, resistors, and opamps laying around to make a butterworth or whatever you need.')
