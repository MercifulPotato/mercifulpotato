It could be a lack of imagination?<p>Sadly, it&#x27;s more likely that both political parties are simply comfortable with the status quo.<p>The republican party thinks they can gerrymander and voter-suppress their way to power.<p>The democratic party thinks they can let the republican party self-destruct, since most of their tactics to hold on to power are illegal, especially as the demographics of our country&#x27;s states become overwhelmingly out of their favor.<p>But regardless of which party you belong to, I think universal suffrage is one of those rare principles that every American grows up believing in.<p>As such, especially in 2020, it makes perfect sense to base federal representation on such a shared principle. It would definitely have the effect of moderating our society. It is a natural evolution of a concept we already have (proportional representation). It does away with the grimy roots of that concept (ceding representation to slaveholders).<p>So, maybe one day.')
