It&#x27;s free during the public beta; we&#x27;ll announce pricing soon.<p>Basically, the meeting host uploads a PowerPoint slide deck, we process it, then we provide a URL that the meeting host can give out to any blind attendees. As soon as someone hits that URL, we send in a bot that connects to the meeting, watches the screen-shared content, and tries to sync it with the uploaded slide deck, so it can show an accessible version of whatever slide the presenter is displaying.<p>Currently only supports Zoom. Support for Teams and other meeting platforms is coming soon.<p>I won&#x27;t share full details about how this is implemented, but I can talk a little about the tech stack. The web app is written in Elixir using Phoenix. I was especially attracted by Phoenix LiveView. We&#x27;re running on AWS.<p>Forgive the marketing copy on the home page; I didn&#x27;t write that part.')
