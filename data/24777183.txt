The kind of emotional depth and resonance you get with characters in the 4th and 5th season of a show is simply unparalleled -- we know their life histories, and the smallest of scenes can shake us with the amount of meaning they convey.<p>If you think of <i>Mad Men</i> or <i>The Sopranos</i> or <i>The Americans</i> or <i>Breaking Bad</i> -- my god, each season is better than the last because it&#x27;s like they approach infinite richness. The last seasons get to levels none of the first seasons were able to.<p>Also, it&#x27;s a huge rarity for shows to make it to 7â€“9 seasons. The ones that do are because they&#x27;re hugely popular and people want to watch them. If <i>Game of Thrones</i> had still had books to work off of, I think pretty much everybody would have loved 3 or 4 more seasons.')
