My job is to create software solutions for the company by using my skills, and lead a team of engineers to produce a better solution. The role I hire a junior engineer for is the same: a much lower requisite skill level, yes, but skill nonetheless. I am not in the business of education -- that is literally what educators like Austen are for.<p>While the time spent teaching a blank slate how to be an engineer might benefit the person, it is literally throwing money away from the perspective of the company because <i>it&#x27;s not what I was hired to do</i>.')
