Item(by='sigmaprimus', descendants=2, kids=[25439079, 25439300], score=3, time=1608092573, title='Ask HN: I have a game idea, would someone please make it so that I can play?', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='I know the most likely response will be &quot;There are lots of tutorials, make it yourself&quot; but I&#x27;m going to ask anyways in the hopes that someone is feeling kind.<p>What I would like to play is a Tetris&#x2F;Arkanoid&#x2F;Galaga based game that seemlessly transitions through all three game types by collecting different power-ups, I imagine flipping the play area vertically to transition from Tetris to Arkanoid, possibly after clearing 4 lines at once or clearing a special block. Then collecting the laser powerup in Arkanoid to transition to Galaga where the remaining cubes become ships. Finishing the Galaga waves would end the level or possibly another powerup triggering a transition to back to Tetris?<p>It has been on my mind since the Show HN post of the rotating tetris game last week.<p>Thanks')
