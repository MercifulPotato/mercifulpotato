He scheduled the rally to directly coincide with congress&#x27;s certification session.  He didn&#x27;t tell them to break into the Capitol, but he told them to march there.  He didn&#x27;t tell them to attack congress, but he told them they were in session trying to steal his election.<p>I don&#x27;t understand why people keep arguing that the incitement thing is blurry.  It&#x27;s not.  Any other speaker at that rally who had said the same things would be trivially charged.  This was a crime, in ways that BLM organizing a march isn&#x27;t.  (Maybe there are some other BLM-related actions where people called out a target like this, it was a big movement.  I&#x27;m not aware of one though.)')
