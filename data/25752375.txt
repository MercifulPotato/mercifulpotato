Statistically, it&#x27;s likely that several people in the channel either agreed with the protest, or at the least, have relatives who did. You essentially just called coworkers and their families Nazis.<p>&gt; In his final Slack message to coworkers, the employee said that his experience shows that the tech industry, and GitHub in particular, needs to be held more accountable for improving diversity and inclusion at the leadership level.<p>I&#x27;m fairly sure that GitHub&#x27;s own CEO is Jewish, and would see this employee&#x27;s perspective perfectly well. I don&#x27;t think this is an accountability issue so much as a social-cues-in-the-workplace issue.')
