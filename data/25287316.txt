It would break even after 22 years. That&#x27;s incredibly far away from the 208 years you have quoted.<p>The flaw in your thinking is that this setup wasn&#x27;t chosen for you. It wasn&#x27;t build in your country nor was it built by you so why would you compare it to your own needs? If you had to build your own solar system you would get a smaller one (which would decrease the breakeven duration according to your weird criteria despite not meaningfully changing the system) and you would probably install it yourself.<p>The reality is that wherever that solar system was built electricity costs more than $0.03 and the person needs more energy or feeds the the energy into the grid.<p>It&#x27;s like complaining about a family of five getting a Volkswagen Sharan when you are just fine in your Citroen Ami. It&#x27;s not about you.')
