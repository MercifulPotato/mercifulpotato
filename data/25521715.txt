Raid5&#x2F;6 still isn&#x27;t production ready and loses data with cheap consumer ssd which could to disappear&#x2F;reappear in a running system. On the other side raidz&#x2F;z2 works rock solid. Of course I could use btrfs with mirrors instead but that&#x27;s the reason why I use cheap consumer ssds. I can&#x27;t spend that much money just to use btrfs so I stay with zfs.')
