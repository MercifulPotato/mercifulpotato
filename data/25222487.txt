The code is not much faster, but there are no GC pauses whatsoever.<p>The app creates pools of the required objects and reuses them  as needed. Certain java constructs create objects and they can be avoided. For example;<p>for (final String myString : myStrings) {...}<p>... creates an iterator over myStrings. It can be recoded as<p>final int myStrings_size() = myStrings.size();\nfor (int i=0;i &lt; myStrings.size(); i++) {\n  final String myString = myStrings.get(i);\n  ...\n}<p>A java profiler will show where objects are created and that code can be rewritten.')
