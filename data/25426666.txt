If it isnt interesting, people should be rewarded and at least understand why they are doing something. The hedge fund, for example, was not terribly interesting for many years. But I understood the importance of the work, the drivers for it, and I got rewarded and so did everyone else.<p>A company or manager might say -- well continued employment <i>is</i> the reward. Yes or no, depends on the situation. It is common for companies to hire people and then cut benefits (less healthcare benefits, 401k matches cut, etc.) -- well then the rewards are not being shared, especially if the cuts are not universally applied.<p>It is also common for companies to reward unequally. For example, many companies reward salespersons or executives yet continue to tighten rewards for Engineers&#x2F;Ops&#x2F;Support.  As a result -- quite possibly not intentionally -- you have engineers like the ones on this comment section: noting they are finding 2 or 3hrs productive time. In an ideal world, rewards should be aligned to input and required effort -- and I&#x27;ve seen incredibly productive Engineers at hedge funds when they realize they have massive skin in the game with huge upsides.<p>Finally, with regards to respect and needs. I have never seen Engineers more unproductive than once they realize that all deadlines are false deadlines -- especially when these false deadlines are constant. I think people understand real urgency and real deadlines when they are explained, not &quot;do it because I said so.&quot;<p>The problem is -- even if you pay engineers, &quot;do it because I said so&quot; doesnt work since there is such a creative element and so much uncertainty. You end up with 8 &quot;productive hours&quot; full of unnecessary bug fixes and shortsighted design because people are not bought into the vision. <i>The worst situation is when management actually things that is real productivity -- then you know it is over.</i>')
