Apple&#x27;s pricing is high, but is even higher if you account for the hidden hand of future buying power you give them. It&#x27;s a brilliant business strategy as it limits your choice as a consumer for the lifetime of the headphones.<p>Say Apple decides to slow down your old iPhone again (what? no! [1])... Or maybe you just like the new Google Pixel. Sucks to be you, time to buy a new iPhone again ($$$) if you don&#x27;t want your headphones to stop &quot;just working.&quot;<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;technology-51413724" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;technology-51413724</a>')
