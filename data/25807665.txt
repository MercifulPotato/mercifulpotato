It was enormously frustrating, especially when I demonstrated real world runtime to the interviewer of two implementations.<p>If they need someone to actually make things work well on real physical hardware, they need to know how the claims map to the physical reality and the fundamental limitations of chalkboard optimization. The real world actually matters.<p>If he knew this maybe he wouldn&#x27;t be overbudget, overdeadline and trying to mad hire people like some parody of the mythical man month...<p>8 months later it still rubs me the wrong way - that is, a bad faith read on new information as obviously objectively wrong and the speaker (me) as misinformed even after it&#x27;s been demonstrated as accurate. Assuming everyone is stupid is a great way to hire, just fantastic.<p>I&#x27;d bet thousands the project is either still off the rails or they&#x27;ve overhauled the org chart.\nThe product hasn&#x27;t been publicly announced yet btw.<p>It&#x27;s really all for the best.
