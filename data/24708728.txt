Item(by='prawn', descendants=None, kids=[24709832], score=None, time=1602081673, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24708493, text='Rotating pressure sprays mounted about 6-7&#x27; up that spray the shower walls and bathroom floor, aiming diagonally down. Water would quickly drain via floor drains. Besides the toilet, it really only needs to deal with a bit of dust that wouldn&#x27;t be hard to dislodge if cleaned every few days. I don&#x27;t think it would need to be so hot that it was an issue if you were caught inside - just like being on the lawns when sprinklers go off.<p>Powerpoints would need to be sealed. Room would need to be slightly recessed (inch maybe). Cabinets would need some sort of seal.<p>Or it could just do the shower, which is generally already recessed, has no powerpoints&#x2F;cabinets&#x2F;towels. In my bathroom, that would leave the toilet (its own beast), floors (easy to do), basins (bit annoying around the taps) and benchtops (easy).<p>If a shower had a powered, pressure nozzle, it would probably be easy enough to do yourself once a week while in there.<p>The toilet is the thing to solve though. My kids are old enough to leave streaks but not old enough to reliably clean them without touching everything they shouldn&#x27;t!')
