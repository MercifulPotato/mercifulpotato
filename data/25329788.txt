For the first time, some disparately related notions in my mind ceased to be so and now make sense to me in that they&#x27;re integrally related in ways I&#x27;d not given much thought to previously.<p>Irrespective of whether he&#x27;s on the correct track or not, his explanation of certain phenomena, energy for instance, made complete sense. His way of using analogies to describe abstract processes is superb. By that I mean he is able to present one with conceptually understandable mental pictures or images of difficult physics that one would normally only understand through mathematical equations.<p>It&#x27;s a shame more physicists don&#x27;t take a leaf <i>[or do I mean branch - pun intended ;-)]</i> from his way of presenting these concepts.')
