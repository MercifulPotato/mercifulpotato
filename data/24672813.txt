Item(by='hirundo', descendants=None, kids=[24673455, 24673463, 24674951, 24677305], score=None, time=1601740427, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24672463, text='I watched a youtube video where a color blind guy in his 50s was given a pair of EnChroma glasses for color blindness, put them on, and had a strong emotional reaction, like a deaf person hearing for the first time.<p>Then I read the wikipedia article (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;EnChroma" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;EnChroma</a>) that says &quot;they do not restore normal color vision, and claims in excess of this by the manufacturer have been characterized as marketing hype ... They are simply a very expensive pair of hunting glasses ... How could they possibly work? The answer is that they can&#x27;t.&quot;<p>I liked the video and now my feed has dozens of similar ones with similar strong reactions. If they don&#x27;t work why the reactions? Am I missing the videos where they just say &quot;meh&quot;? Is it a placebo effect or maybe they&#x27;re just playing it up for the gift givers? I guess the test is whether they continue to wear the glasses for long.')
