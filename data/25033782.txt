Hang cleans and power cleans essentially have a deadlift as their first submovement, the difference here is in the weight. You can probably deadlift a few times more than you can clean, and that&#x27;s where the real issue lies â€” it&#x27;s a lot easier to get an injury with bigger weights, regardless of the exercise.<p>For any pro athlete, consistent work is far more important than any one workout, hence avoiding injury is instrumental in success. The same holds true for hobbyists as well, of course, but the topic doesn&#x27;t get as much focus there since many are self-taught. For consistent progress, work volume is much more crucial than work weight [0], hence doing an exercise with high risk and low volume isn&#x27;t the best option.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sci-fit.net&#x2F;scientific-recommendations-1&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sci-fit.net&#x2F;scientific-recommendations-1&#x2F;</a>')
