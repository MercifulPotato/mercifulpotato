In the UK a series is usually only 6 episodes and few shows last more than two or three series.<p>Compare the original UK version of the Office and its American facsimile and I think you&#x27;ll see it&#x27;s much better to go out on a high rather than drag on endlessly. If the Simpsons had ended after a couple of seasons it would have been one of the best shows ever, instead the brain dead drivel they churn out for it now just continually diminishes its early greatness.')
