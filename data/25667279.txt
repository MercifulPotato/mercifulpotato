Item(by='chordalkeyboard', descendants=None, kids=[25668118], score=None, time=1609993709, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25667160, text='&gt; The person doing the &#x27;healing&#x27; has met your personal standard for a &#x27;healer&#x27; - in this case foreign experience.<p>I&#x27;m not imposing my standards for a healer on a sick person in his personal quest for a healer.<p>&gt; Without licensing, I could, with no experience whatsoever, just cut you open and go to town.<p>Indeed, you could do the same thing absent a license in a regulated regime, and also you could get a license and kill me on purpose and say it was an accident or unfortunate outcome. What the requirement for a license does is create a class of people who are approved healers, and criminalize medicine outside of that state-sponsored context.<p>&gt; You would die, and then what? Who&#x27;s liable?<p>You&#x27;d be liable, just like you would if there were licenses and you either had one or did not. Or are you referring to the fact that physicians are shielded from liability if they meet industry accepted standards of care?<p>&gt; You assume the &#x27;healing&#x27; is successful. Does it become butchering if I fail to do so?<p>I don&#x27;t assume that. I&#x27;m just referring to the <i>telos</i> of the act. You&#x27;re allowed to give people free tattoos. You&#x27;re not allowed to give them a tattoo if you claim it is medicine. It doesn&#x27;t matter if its a drug or whatever. The intent to heal is what&#x27;s criminalized here.<p>&gt; So, to that end, while I may not agree with all aspects of licensing physicians (for instance, I&#x27;m with you on the foreign degree and experience limitations) I believe that on the whole it does more good than harm.<p>The problem arises when you enforce your values on other people who do not share those values because of your belief that &quot;on the whole it does more good than harm.&quot;<p>&gt; I will therefore be explicit and say, yes, I do &quot;agree with the criminalization of healing people without permission [of competent authorities],&quot; even if I do not today agree with all of their requirements, however I reject your framing.<p>Thanks for your reply and thanks for engaging my perspective directly :)')
