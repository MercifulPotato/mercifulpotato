My response wasn&#x27;t flippant, and I&#x27;m sorry it came across that way.<p>I grew up around (unlocked) guns and knew better than to even think about touching one of them while I was a child. I am aware that many children aren&#x27;t taught proper respect for firearms, which is part of why I recommended keeping them locked up. (The guns, not the children...)<p>My comment about soldiers is based on my personal interactions with them. I know they go through gun safety handling, but in practice they frequently have very poor muzzle discipline (&quot;But it&#x27;s unloaded!&quot;: I don&#x27;t care). I&#x27;ve also talked to a few soldiers who had never heard of the four rules of gun safety, either by name or after hearing them listed out, so I don&#x27;t think all soldiers have had gun safety drilled into them as strongly as you may have.<p>I don&#x27;t live in barracks, but my understanding of military life as a whole is that the military has to support the lowest common denominator in their troops. If you have children, you probably aren&#x27;t a hotheaded 20 year old anymore, and it seems like that should factor into your decision making process, no?<p>The other two points (being shot by a spouse or burglar using your own gun), frankly sound silly to me. You listed four categories, but only two of them are responsible for a large number of  firearm deaths. It&#x27;s extremely rare for a burglar to take and use a victim&#x27;s gun against the victim, and also pretty rare for a spouse to murder the other.<p>And just to reiterate what I said in my first post, if you&#x27;re even a little worried you might lose control and kill your spouse, or your spouse might kill you, you need to see a counselor right now regardless of whether you have guns or not. (Alternatively, if you do get along with your spouse, then I&#x27;m not sure why you factored that into your decision to not own a gun?)<p>I am making this post in good faith, and I hope you&#x27;ll respond.')
