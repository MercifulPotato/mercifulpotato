Why project a mission for supporting privacy when you sign a contract with your closest competitor who goes directly against your own mission? Especially as the default search engine? I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re quite serious about your privacy, more like they are focused on the &#x27;social justice&#x27; than generating their own revenue.<p>It seems that they either ruin their own credibility by being a hypocrite or they risk going bankrupt trying to fight for your privacy with products failing generating any sustainable revenue for themselves. Either way, it&#x27;s in Google&#x27;s hands.<p>As for the &#x27;social justice reasons&#x27; it&#x27;s a classic side example of going woke will make you and your business broke.')
