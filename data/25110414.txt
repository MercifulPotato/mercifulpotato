Recently I had to install Windows 10 on a computer at work, and was horrified that the thing has advertisements!!  Not only that, the level of manipulation to avoid you from just using a local user account (and get an online one instead) is terrible. You get two choices: \n1. Get an online Microsoft Account, \n2. Miss on all the great user experience!<p>Who wants to be a loser and miss all the great stuff?<p>Hence if I ever needed more reasons to prefer Linux over Windows now I have &quot;to prevent the creators of the software from manipulating me&quot;.')
