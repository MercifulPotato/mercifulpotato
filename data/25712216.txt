The left and right are technically in agreement on a huge number of issues and could easily compromise on many others. There has always been room for these discussions within civil society.<p>A major issue seems to be literal lies and disinformation spreading over social media which makes that divide appear\nto be much greater than it actually is. If these blatant lies can be prevented then the left and right will have a much easier time coming to political compromises when running the country. Having shared primary ballots would also help a lot to prevent the most radical wings of each party from dominating, because then each party’s candidate would have to appeal to <i>all</i> voters rather than their own.')
