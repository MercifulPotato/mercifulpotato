Collaborating is just made easier across document editing with Google Meet in-picture.<p>Now, one key field of &quot;Workspace&quot; in which Google is still nearly absent is PROJECT MANAGEMENT. Google Workspace targets millions of various companies of different sizes so it is tough to make a one-size fits all solution. I get it. But right now, Calendar is awesome, Docs are awesome, Gmail is amazing, but Tasks is subpar and too thin of a layer.<p>It is annoying to have your team do most stuff on G Suite (Workspace) but then orchestrate that somewhere else (Asana, ClickUp, etc). It&#x27;s just something that has been missing for a long time and I hope they are filling that void somehow soon.')
