One person even shouted they want to &quot;mow those niggers down&quot; because there were people with darker pigmented skin were merely existing out in public and we were driving by them - they were doing absolutely nothing, only breathing. You complain about something sad or tragic happening to you and their response is to suggest it must be the fault of black people, no matter what the problem actually is.<p>I&#x27;m not talking about one or two people here either, I&#x27;m talking about several people, family and former friends, many who don&#x27;t know each other and live in different geographic areas.<p>I just can&#x27;t with that shit anymore.<p>Honestly, the more time I spend with people who have different beliefs than me the more I dislike them.')
