Item(by='mindslight', descendants=None, kids=[24722057], score=None, time=1602178530, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24719896, text='&gt; <i>When it comes to election time, citizens are given one vote, a binary choice of two candidates. To make this choice, each individual voter crushes down all the dimensionality of their personal model of the world (which they mistake for shared reality) and out comes their decision who to vote for. The purpose of all the absurdity and chicanery in the interactive dance above, is to influence the manner in which each individual crushes their dimensions</i><p>I&#x27;m 100% in agreement on this. I&#x27;ve previously made the argument that one bit of input is small, thus the overall function of voting is actually to make winning voters think they wanted all their candidate&#x27;s policies. I formed during the Obama years, after arguing against blue tribe friends arguing for corporo-statist health care. To be clear, this is the first time I will be voting for a major party candidate for President.<p>&gt; <i>&quot;Donald Trump&#x27;s model contains a dimension labelled &#x27;Literally Racist&#x27;, and it&#x27;s value is &#x27;100%&#x27;.  Furthermore, </i>because(!)* anyone who &#x27;is&#x27; &#x27;racist&#x27; &#x27;should&#x27; &#x27;be shunned by society, absolutely, full stop&#x27;, <i>then therefore(!)</i> you must(!) vote for Joe Biden.&quot;*<p>This does not represent my perspective <i>at all</i>.<p>First, I&#x27;ve been slow to come around to labeling Trump a simple racist. As I said, my last straw was Harris&#x27;s &quot;birth certificate&quot;. Back in May, I was still arguing with a friend who was claiming Trump&#x27;s malevolence on Covid came from his desire to see brown people die. Focusing on race begets racism. I&#x27;ve been trying to find non-racial explanations the whole time.<p>Second no, I don&#x27;t think racists should be outright shunned by society. People that do must not love their grandmothers. Racism is like farting. Everyone is going to develop some of it, but we should try to keep it to ourselves and spare each other the unpleasantness. It&#x27;s problematic when people bring it up and make it part of their identity, either as oppressor or oppressed.<p>And lastly no, my decision to support Biden does not come from modus ponens on policies. Rather, I&#x27;ve been trying to find any reason why it would make sense to support Trump, to give his supporters the benefit of the doubt. For context, I was the one explaining to blue friends back in 2016 that Trump would likely win, because he was speaking to a lot of concerns that they casually wrote off.<p>While he&#x27;s still talking about red tribe concerns, he has done little to actually address them. If he had improved the economic situation in the middle of the country, I&#x27;d get it. If he were devoutly religious, I&#x27;d get it. If he had reformed some aspect of the healthcare system towards a functioning market, I&#x27;d get it. If his trade policies could actually preserve American jobs, I&#x27;d get it. If he had actually built that wall, I&#x27;d get it. I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily agree, but I would understand.<p>What <i>has</i> he actually done instead? He&#x27;s continued to reject expert advice regarding Covid, leading to 210,000 American deaths. Rather than trying to calm the situation after George Floyd (even if it just resulted in some token reforms), he drove the division. He&#x27;s setup tariffs that could only have worked twenty years ago, and has chosen to compete with China by adopting China&#x27;s app censorship totalitarianism. He has withdrawn from foreign diplomacy to let China and Russia conquer unhindered.<p>The only charitable narrative I can come up with is that his supporters are still buying into his narrative as an opposition candidate, despite his past four years of office and his lack of results on goals they claim to care about. As they continue to be directly harmed by his actual actions, that becomes less plausible.')
