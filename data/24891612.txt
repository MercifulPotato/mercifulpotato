Thermal rocket is going to loose to well designed electric one. Electric rocket can propel ions to huge velocities basically functioning as a small particle accelerator.\nThe issues currently are ability to get enough thrust (density of the particle stream) and preventing materials from decaying due to energetic particles.\nThermal rocket will be limited to very small, thermal velocities.')
