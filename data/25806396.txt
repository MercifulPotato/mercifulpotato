It&#x27;s really a workflow that facilitates thinking and creativity.<p>Notion is a place I keep tidbits of information... for example a database of my videogame collection, a history of all my previous addresses (I&#x27;ve globe trotted my entire life) or a repository of highly detailed professional notes on complex topics.  Even then I&#x27;m still not sure that Notion is really a good long term solution since their staff could theoretically access all my private information without me knowing (I&#x27;ve had this confirmed to me via a support ticket).<p>So, while Notion has extremely good problem solution fit for a lot of my use cases, Notion however doesn&#x27;t actually help me develop my thoughts on philosophy or help structure my thoughts on how to approach questions I have in my fields of enquiry or help me create content from original ideas.
