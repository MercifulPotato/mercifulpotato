Item(by='luckylion', descendants=None, kids=[24681998], score=None, time=1601834650, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24679918, text='&gt; If we can believe the research that there is a gender bias against males at the middle school level surely the opposite may also be true at the high school &#x2F; college level where there are more male teachers.<p>The sex&#x2F;gender of the teacher didn&#x27;t play a role at the middle school level though. I find it hard to keep up the narrative of &quot;society doesn&#x27;t want girls to go into STEM&quot; when there&#x27;s a lot of affirmative action, selective media representation, lots of programs etc. &quot;But it&#x27;s only to offset the invisible bias&quot; I&#x27;m sure some might argue, but I think they overlook the possibility that there is nothing keeping them down and they just make different choices.<p>I didn&#x27;t downvote your previous comment, but it did sound like you were a bit reaching for straws to turn an observation into the desired outcome by filling in the middle.')
