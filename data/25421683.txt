I&#x27;ve thought about it for a while but can&#x27;t quite wrap my head around an answer that feels obviously correct. It takes a lot of energy to raise the temperature of a house - more than to maintain a given temperature. Allowing for changing temperatures during the day, and concrete slabs and walls and the ground as heat stores, is it always the case that it uses less energy to have a lower set point while you&#x27;re out and raise it when you get home than to just keep it at the comfortable level the whole time?')
