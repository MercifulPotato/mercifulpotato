Where the code is running doesn’t really matter and there are a lot of good reasons to be executing on a remote machine that’s more powerful, closer to build cache, etc.<p>These experiences just remote access to it.  You still get a command prompt, you can still apt install, and it means the dev env can match prod (eg Debian) vs mismatches if you’re on OSX for example.  Also allows the base machine config (tools, scripts, etc) to be curated and centralized.<p>Gitpod and GitHub Codespaces are great.<p>I actually think on machine development for non-mobile experiences will be uncommon in a couple years.')
