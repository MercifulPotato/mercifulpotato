Ruffle has only a tiny skeleton of AS3 support (only the VM opcodes and some of the MovieClip class), while Shumway seems to implement a huge chunk of the library classes.<p>Maybe using wasm Rust with WebGPU acceleration will make it faster than Shumway. Remarkable to me how much effort must have been put into Shumway, though..')
