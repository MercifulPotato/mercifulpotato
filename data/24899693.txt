I wrote this the other day, but people have already pointed out tons of problems with it and I tend to agree with those issues: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;battlepenguin.com&#x2F;tech&#x2F;the-solution-to-big-tech-isnt-legislation-its-technology&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;battlepenguin.com&#x2F;tech&#x2F;the-solution-to-big-tech-isnt...</a><p>The reality is they have massive market share. Keep in mind, Facebook and Twitter prevented the spread of this story via PRIVATE DIRECT MESSAGES!<p>Imagine if AT&amp;T or Verizon started blocking texts because of their content. You can say, &quot;Well don&#x27;t use Messenger&quot; and you need to realize, a lot of us don&#x27;t have each other&#x27;s phone numbers any more. For my international friends, I might only have a Messenger or Hangouts connection.<p>And this is where the rub comes into play. At what point is one of these platforms so big that they become a regular communication utility? If you were paying for the service, that&#x27;s one thing, but in the case of Faceobook&#x2F;Twitter, they make money from you in more abstract ways (adverts).<p>People can still go to NY Post directly, and because we have such good freedoms in the US, we can route around the censorship to some degree. But at some point, this also becomes election interference.<p>Politicians don&#x27;t understand the Internet enough to get reforms right. (Remember Stevens and the series of tubes?). 230 Reforms would probably need:<p>a) Remove the algo Timeline entirely. Results should be the way they were in the old days: Reverse Chronological. (or baring that, inboxes with the default search order of names being alphabetical).<p>b) Don&#x27;t block any direct messages unless it&#x27;s clearly malware or illegal. (This can get super tricky. Look at the sad state of e-mail).<p>The real solution is to get people to use more diverse platforms, platforms people pay for (even $1&#x2F;month) and that distribute&#x2F;federate data rather than centralize it.<p>There are technological solutions around this. The problem is people and adoption.')
