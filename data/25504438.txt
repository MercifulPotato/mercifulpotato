Item(by='BrandoElFollito', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608628564, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25502505, text='You may want to hold on with the pitchfork for a moment.<p>TL;DR If @satellite2 is, like myself, French, we do not have separate words for &quot;murder&quot; and &quot;manslaughter&quot; in the everyday language.<p>Longer version: we have the verb &quot;tuer&quot; (&quot;to kill&quot;) which can be applied to people, flies, bears, time or boredom. It just mean to go from a state of &quot;live&#x2F;be&quot; to &quot;not live&#x2F;be&quot;.<p>We then have the noun &quot;homicide&quot;. It is never used in the everyday language (but would be in legal proceedings and sometimes on the TV news when they want to qualify the act). Its etymology is &quot;homme&quot; + &quot;occire&quot; (&quot;man&quot; + &quot;old French word for kill&quot;). It means &quot;to kill a man&quot;. There is no connotation beside that and you add the adjective &quot;volontaire&quot; or &quot;involontaire&quot; (&quot;intended&quot; or &quot;unintended&quot;) to make the English difference between &quot;murder&quot; and &quot;manslaughter&quot;. And then plenty of other legal qualifications (premeditation or not etc.)<p>Again: this is a word you would not use in everyday conversation. Please note that there is no verb derived from &quot;homicide&quot;. It is only a noun.<p>In many cases people will use &quot;murder&quot; to mean &quot;someone was killed somehow&quot;, while technically &quot;murder&quot; (&quot;meurtre&quot; in French) is an intended act. But since our &quot;manslaughter&quot; (&quot;homicide volontaire&quot;) is too long we use &quot;murder&quot;.')
