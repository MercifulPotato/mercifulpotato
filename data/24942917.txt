Eighteen of these events occurred in real life, while 29 were in simulation. “Nearly all” of these collisions were the fault of a human driver or pedestrian, Waymo says, and none resulted in any “severe or life-threatening injuries.”<p>While Waymo&#x27;s statements may have been technically true, the pedestrian blaming at least strikes me as a bit tone deaf. Of course, pedestrians can do really stupid things. But, generally speaking, drivers have a lot of responsibility to still avoid hitting them under most circumstances.<p>ADDED: The language that caught my eye is the Verge&#x27;s and Waymo is just the facts. But pedestrians and cyclists are in general concerning because it doesn&#x27;t take much. Even though a a pedestrian walking into the side of a suddenly(?) stopped vehicle is probably not generally a bad outcome.')
