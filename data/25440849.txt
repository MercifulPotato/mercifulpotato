In the Czech Republic (I&#x27;ve been here 16 years and work with a lot of lawyers) it&#x27;s normal for lawyers to be &quot;contractors&quot;, very few are salaried.<p>In fact it&#x27;s a funny rite of passage for most lawyers: after graduation they have to work for 3 years for a law firm before they are allowed to take the bar exam and become &quot;real&quot; lawyers. During this time they earn a salary. When they finally become &quot;real&quot; lawyers by passing the bar, they get fired. :) And immediately taken back on as contractors.')
