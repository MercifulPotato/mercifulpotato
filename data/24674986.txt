For use cases that are for non technical users to manipulate and maintain it makes sense to me.<p>In Emacs, org files are often used for configuration similarly.<p>While I&#x27;m a fan of EDN most of the time, which doesn&#x27;t suffer from the issues they mention JSON having, not having to wrap things in quotes for text, and using indent for nesting definitely would make it nicer for non technical people. So I can see a use case for this as a simple text interface for forms that is targetted at non-technical users.')
