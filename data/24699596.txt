I currently work in a midsized tech company but my experiences and numbers hold with my previous work at a non-tech enterprise.<p>In general, the numbers I see:<p>* Individual contributor salaries range from 80k to 120k, with a bonus structure from 6%-8% annually.<p>* Upper-tier ICs and people managers tend to be around 110k-145k with 8-10% bonuses<p>Currently as a principal engineer I make ~$165k with a 12% annual bonus target. Previously as an enterprise architect I was on around ~$155k with a 15% bonus.  A friend at a senior director level is around $185k and I&#x27;m not sure about the bonus but I know it is 15%+.<p>There are a variety of tech companies in the area, but many jobs are tech jobs at a &quot;non-tech company&quot;: banking, insurance, healthcare, manufacturing.  Even then, don&#x27;t underestimate the size and scope of what is done; my last job had an IT department of around 200 and was responsible for running a ton of complex systems.<p>You&#x27;ll probably skew towards midsized companies to large enterprises.  While there are some regional startup incubators you just don&#x27;t have the same access to capital that you do in the Bay area.<p>It&#x27;s ludicrously affordable to live here:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.realtor.com&#x2F;realestateandhomes-detail&#x2F;43-Fairfield-Way_San-Francisco_CA_94127_M25597-76882" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.realtor.com&#x2F;realestateandhomes-detail&#x2F;43-Fairfie...</a><p>I could find a similar home for around $75k.<p>There&#x27;s plenty of cultural activities, dining, nightlife - I couldn&#x27;t be happier.<p>The biggest risk is likely the limited amount of &quot;slots at the top&quot;: there are probably at most a few dozen top-tier positions to fill in this market, so job changes have to be carefully considered and planned.')
