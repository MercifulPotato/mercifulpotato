This means it can (potentially) do more operations per clock. Wider processors are harder to clock faster, but it works for Apple. Apple has no desire to put in the cooling you need to get chips running at 4+ GHz, so it&#x27;s not a big deal if their chips are clock limited. On the other hand, Intel and AMD like their cores to approach 5 GHz at the top end.')
