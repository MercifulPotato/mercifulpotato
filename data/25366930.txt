Spending time on pulling someone up is taking time from solving issues of others. Where their issues are probably more tied to job at hand and delivering value to the customers.<p>So what he means is that yes, one should help someone who falls behind but it is not fair to put too much effort that will be taken away from others. It is also not fair for the customers.<p>How can you judge what is fair share of time to help someone?
