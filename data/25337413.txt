I incline against blaming companies but additives is definitely an exception because those ingredients often aren&#x27;t evident to consumers. We know soda has a ton of sugar but baked beans...most consumers don&#x27;t know.<p>But it is also true that if you tried to sell those products in PL, consumers wouldn&#x27;t have it. Eastern Europeans tend to be very knowledgeable about the origins of food in a way that UK or US consumers aren&#x27;t. The difference between bread in PL and the West being the example I hear most about.')
