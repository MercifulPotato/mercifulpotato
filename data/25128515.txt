Drugs are selected based on cost-effectiveness analysis and subsidised price is negotiated with pharmaceutical companies.<p>If anything, Australia is quite generous to pharmaceutical companies. New Zealand&#x27;s Pharmaceutical Management Agency has much less negotiating power but still manages to obtain substantially lower prices.<p>For myself I can&#x27;t help but wonder if lump-sum licensing might not be more effective. Pharmaceuticals are a bit like software: very high R&amp;D cost, but the marginal cost to manufacture is very small. A one-time payment to sink a large chunk of R&amp;D for a drug might be quicker and easier than guessing at a price. On the other hand, I have no experience in health economics, so it&#x27;s possible this is a terrible idea.')
