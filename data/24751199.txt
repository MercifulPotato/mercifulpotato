(If so, I&#x27;m curious how he plans to launch his new world order scheme.)<p>I was watching this Michael Malice fellow on Lex Fridman the other day - very intelligent guy, knows his stuff (that which is in his bubble) very well, and he is <i>very</i> strongly of the opinion that not only can the common man not think <i>currently</i>, but that they are incapable of it at all.<p>Now, it is <i>possible</i> that this is the case of course, but forming strong conclusions about something for which there is literally no data (teaching thinking has not been attempted in any serious way) demonstrates a significant gap in one&#x27;s intelligence.  Although, about 90%+ of the population suffers from this (take the HN hivemind on political topics for example), so I guess one shouldn&#x27;t be too hard on him.')
