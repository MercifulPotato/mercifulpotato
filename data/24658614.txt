I don&#x27;t have more than a surface understanding of the religion or how devoted people tend to be, but if I think about the various sects of Christianity, many people of certain sects wouldn&#x27;t even consider switching to a different sect because they are so invested in their particular flavor of Christianity.  And I&#x27;d think being Hindu and considering converting to Christianity or Islam would be an even larger jump in belief systems.  It&#x27;s not like switching brands of car.<p>I guess in my experience (in US culture at least), &quot;just change your religion&quot; is actually a super big deal and is a huge decision that takes an extraordinary reason.  Even discrimination doesn&#x27;t pass that bar for many people.')
