None of them do, because they’re beholden to old paranoid execs who think that their shitty printer drivers or whatever somehow represents a competitive “asset”.<p>It’s our economic system’s biggest flaw, that old clueless people can fuck up things beyond recognition (mostly for their younger, more informed and more educated colleagues) just because they have  “seniority”, while being completely disconnected and ignorant of any relevant technologies past the fucking 1960s.<p>(Then, of course, they vote in fascists, and complain about young people not voting, as if that excuses the fascists they voted into office.. disgusting..)')
