Item(by='coldtea', descendants=None, kids=[25114989], score=None, time=1605542267, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25112265, text='&gt;* It is also revisionist history to say &quot;Apple was never about tinkerers and customizations&quot;, Apple was born out of the &quot;tinkers&quot; market, and did infact become popular pre-iphone days due to this hacker mentality, to deny this is to deny actual history*<p>I was there in the pre-iPhone days, and Apple was never about the &quot;hacker mentality&quot;.<p>In the early days (and up to now) it was all about &quot;computers for the rest of us&quot; (as the slogan famously said, which is also what the 1984 ad was about -- freeing computing from being a serious&#x2F;enterprise&#x2F;business affair, not about hacking ideal - the target was IBM and the PC).<p>During the Jobs-ousted era (Scully etc), it was mostly about selling expensive boxes to vertical markets (printing, design, and so on).<p>Their first popular post-Jobs products were the all-in-one iMac, the powerbooks, and of course, the iPod. And they always insisted on the vertical integration (they make the hardware and OS&#x2F;basic software) - with the brief pre-Jobs exception of the Mac-clones, which nearly killed the company.<p>&gt;<i>I fail to see the connection, today there are far better tools on both windows and make to backup and restore systems.</i><p>It&#x27;s not about backing up and restoring, it&#x27;s about third parties getting access to your documents, data, personal pics and videos, account passwords, files, etc -- which today are a much larger and more important part of your life and business than it ever was.<p>&gt;<i>Also to claim mac is &quot;Virus free&quot; is moronic, and implies a level of security that is not really warranted</i><p>I didn&#x27;t claim it, but now that you said, I will: Mac is, if not virus free, effectively virus free, and can be even more so. There has not been any major outbreak for the Mac (tons for Windows). The biggest outbreaks were confined to sub-10% of users, and were invariably trojans, not viruses (users had to actively run them).<p>&gt;<i>Mac like Linux is security through obscurity, Windows still has a 90+% market share, so of course threat actors will target windows more. Apple Mac is not target simply because there is not enough people to justify the investment.</i><p>That&#x27;s an old fable that doesn&#x27;t hold. In the 90s, when the Mac (Mac OS then, pre-OS X) had 2% to Windows 98%, it still had tons of viruses.<p>And of course iOS has 0 or no viruses and malware, whereas Android has a ton, and there are not only close (30-40% to 60%) but also richer people on the iOS phone side to justify resources. It&#x27;s just more secure, for various reasons (and no side-loading is one):<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pandasecurity.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;mediacenter&#x2F;mobile-security&#x2F;android-more-infected-than-ios&#x2F;#:~:text=Android%2Dpowered%20connected%20devices%20are,malware%20when%20compared%20to%20iOS.&amp;text=According%20to%20the%20whitepaper%2C%20Android,iPhones%20for%20less%20than%201%25" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pandasecurity.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;mediacenter&#x2F;mobile-security...</a>.')
