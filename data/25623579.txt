The code I&#x27;m running is not a <i>most case</i> code. A FPU heavy, &quot;I will abuse all your cores and memory bandwidth&quot; type, heavily optimized scientific software. I can sometimes hear that my system is swearing at me for repeatedly running for tests.<p>I don&#x27;t like to add this paragraph but, I&#x27;m one of the administrators of one of the biggest HPC clusters in my country. I know how a system can surpass its TDP or how can CPU manufacturers skew this TDP numbers to fit in envelopes. We make these servers blow flames from their exhausts.')
