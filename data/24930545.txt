The only reason why you would consider those hashes to be worth paying money for is the community belief that they have a certain value - nobody has any need to use it otherwise. That’s why Bitcoin is an especially pure fiat currency: the community consensus is quite literally the only thing backing it’s valuation. In contrast a currency like the US dollar has curbs on fluctuation not just from much greater usage but also because millions of people receive it from government salaries and purchases or need that currency to pay taxes — unlike Bitcoin, which has value only to the extent that you can find someone else who thinks it’ll be worth more in the future.')
