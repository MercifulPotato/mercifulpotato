Item(by='waterhouse', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606630852, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25240130, text='&gt; Purposely believing in something that you know is most likely to be incorrect<p>This makes me think of: acting.  One way to act like a character is to try to believe you are that character.  Or to believe everything the character believes.  Then you figure out the detailed implications: when you see x, you think y, so you feel z (which should show on your face and body language) and do w.  One way of finding the implications is to physically put yourself through experiences your character has had; if that is impractical, you can look for substitutes.  (There is a famous story[1] of an actor who gave a compelling performance of a character agonizing over killing himself with a revolver in his hand... by imagining he was about to take a very cold shower.)<p>Which then brings to mind an approach: imagine you <i>are</i> the person you would like to be, imagine how that person would act, and act that way. (I&#x27;m not sure whether, to the parent commenter, that would be &quot;a greatly successful person in the early stages&quot; or &quot;a person who will do the best he can—choosing the strategies with highest expected value—knowing bad luck may crush his efforts in the small or in the large, and won&#x27;t be bothered if&#x2F;when that happens because his choices were still the best&quot;.)<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rehearsalroom.com&#x2F;offcuts&#x2F;offcut31.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rehearsalroom.com&#x2F;offcuts&#x2F;offcut31.html</a>')
