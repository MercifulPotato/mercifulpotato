I am not a lawyer, but my understanding is that interns need to be paid for their work if they&#x27;re working on projects that have some commercial interest attached.<p>Austen DMed me about this on twitter a while back (presumably in search of pilot organizations to work with Fellows), and my response was this:<p>&gt; I am reasonably sure that’s not legal if they’re working on “real” client work since at that point, the company would be the primary beneficiary of that person labor. The DoL fact sheet doesn’t make it entirely clear (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dol.gov&#x2F;sites&#x2F;dolgov&#x2F;files&#x2F;WHD&#x2F;legacy&#x2F;files&#x2F;whdfs71.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dol.gov&#x2F;sites&#x2F;dolgov&#x2F;files&#x2F;WHD&#x2F;legacy&#x2F;files&#x2F;whdf...</a>), but HLR’s article about Glatt v Fox Searchlight Pictures, Inc summarizes it well (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;harvardlawreview.org&#x2F;2016&#x2F;02&#x2F;glatt-v-fox-searchlight-pictures-inc&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;harvardlawreview.org&#x2F;2016&#x2F;02&#x2F;glatt-v-fox-searchlight...</a>).<p>I know there are some Lambda folks around in this thread. Have you done any legal vetting or anything along those lines? I like the idea, and I think it&#x27;s worthwhile, but I&#x27;m not interested if it means putting the company at risk.')
