The N9 built on top of the N700 series, which was launched ahead of the iPhone. It was essentially Debian running in your pocket. It already had a huge &quot;app store&quot;, all Linux repositories. Polishing this was not that hard, given that they also controlled Qt. Qt also meant a simple migration path for Symbian applications.<p>People don&#x27;t realize how mature the N9 was. Read some reviews. Their maps application had incredibly good <i>offline</i> coverage and <i>offline</i> routing in 2011. So good, I&#x27;ve been using it for that purpose till 2020 as nothing compares. Mind that Google Maps still licenses lots of mapping data from Navteq, which was Nokia&#x27;s mapping spinoff.<p>Aside from this, even if they wanted to go with Windows Mobile, it sounds like a really bad strategic move not to have a backup. Especially because going with Windows Mobile was a bigger gamble, which ended up failing spectacularly. Going ahead with the N9 didn&#x27;t use many resources. Windows Mobile devices by Nokia would eventually reuse the same hardware. Why not selling both.')
