It would prevent to many customers from being able to give them money. Which would then make it pretty tricky for the merchant to make money.<p>Also Apple Pay and Android Pay don’t cost merchants more to implement or use (assuming they have the HW, which any card reader from the past 10 years will have). The card network rules also forbid merchants from not accepting them, but of course rules don’t mean much without enforcement.<p>Finally there is really only one company that can undercut Mastercard, and that’s Visa. It’s only a question of time before Visa bump their fees, there’s no way they’re gonna leave money on the table for long.')
