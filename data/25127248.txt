You can find countless examples of people in the USA going out of their way to speak an Italian, French, or Spanish word with the correct Italian, French, or Spanish pronunciation. SNL even did a skit about it.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nbc.com&#x2F;saturday-night-live&#x2F;video&#x2F;enchilada&#x2F;n9970" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nbc.com&#x2F;saturday-night-live&#x2F;video&#x2F;enchilada&#x2F;n997...</a><p>I know that skit is a joke but it came about because of events related Latin America being in the news and all the newscasters going out of their way to use the correct pronunciation.<p>It&#x27;s got absolutely nothing to with saying a word how it looks in English because there are plenty of European origin words that are pronounced far different than they would following English rules. &quot;Pizza&quot; being a simple example.<p>I still hear people doing in regularly in the news, bars, restaurants.
