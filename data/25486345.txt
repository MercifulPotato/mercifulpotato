Javascript was a pretty poor language added to the Netscape browser in a hurry, but since everybody hated Microsoft at that time it succeeded.<p>- The way old technologies remain relevant just because many people know about them and there is a good ecosystem&#x2F;large codebases. C&#x2F;C++ comes to mind.<p>- The way compensation is hardly tied to the value created. Often you can only advance by switching jobs all the time. That will not let you learn from your mistakes, and systems become legacy very quickly.<p>- The overkill of infrastructure in the cloud just to get a simple system running. This is the complexity the author mentions, which leads to huge and expensive support orgs and high costs. I still love building a system from the ground up as much as possible with very few moving parts instead of gluing together the latest AWS services. It&#x27;s shocking how many orgs believe they need to rely on K8S just because everyone else does.')
