UK had an exclusivity agreement with a private company (AZ). EU had their own agreement. There is now a contractual dispute between EU and AZ. In retaliation, EU wants to use export controls to prevent another EU company (Pfizer) honouring its legal civil contract with the UK. This is trade war sort of stuff. EU should go to court with AZ to settle the dispute. The UK isn&#x27;t a party here.')
