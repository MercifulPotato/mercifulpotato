If you like cyberpunk books or media, you’ll love it. The writing team put a lot of effort into crafting a backstory of the world.<p>Overall it reminds me of the original Neuromancer novel; moments of sheer brilliance mixed with moments of tacky, embarrassingly bad writing. That specific quality is part of the genre’s history, to me, and I think a lot of the criticism toward 2077 is from people who haven’t read much of the previous books.')
