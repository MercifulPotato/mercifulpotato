Item(by='ardy42', descendants=None, kids=[25641192, 25641490, 25641246], score=None, time=1609809328, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25640584, text='&gt; The lack of a monopoly creates competition which accelerates innovation and leads to cheaper, higher quality products for the consumer. The person who invents a product should simply be one competitor in the market, they can have the first mover advantage, but shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to control the market entirely.<p>But that obviously wouldn&#x27;t as work well, because:<p>1. The inventor would pay the R&amp;D costs with no good way to recoup them, because he&#x27;d be competing against knockoffs who didn&#x27;t have to make that investment, <i>and can price accordingly</i>.  You&#x27;d be putting the actual inventor at a disadvantage.<p>2. There&#x27;d be no incentive for inventors to actually publish designs for their inventions.  Most people who argue against patents as a concept forget is that to get one you have to publish plans for your idea openly, which makes it much easier to copy.  The limited monopoly is an <i>incentive</i> to part with that information.  You&#x27;d end up leaving the public domain poorer.<p>3. Invention and production are different skillsets.  For an author to get paid for writing, they shouldn&#x27;t need to own a printing press and distribution network.  It&#x27;s a good thing that good, successful authors can make their livings <i>by writing</i> and not always be forced to sustain themselves with a day job.<p>The original ideas behind IP are very, very sounds.  What we need is to roll back how the <i>implementation</i> of those ideas has been corrupted to society&#x27;s detriment.')
