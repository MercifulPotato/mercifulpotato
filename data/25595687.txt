If you don&#x27;t count every last penny, you&#x27;re not being fair to what it costs to cook at home. I get it, if you only count the receipts of your rice and bean purchases, it will be pennies a day. That&#x27;s not your <i>cost</i>, though.<p><i>&gt; The overarching point is that we&#x27;re still a long way from $60,000 for a kitchen.</i><p>I did mention that labour might be cheap where you are from. Prices can swing wildly from place to place. Labour is, by far, the largest cost in the construction, so it wouldn&#x27;t be too surprising to see the cost of the final product swing widely alongside that.<p>The good news is that I&#x27;m not sure the exact amount matters much at the end of the day as if labour is cheaper, restaurants will also be able to produce food cheaper. No matter how you slice it, you&#x27;re just not going to be able to compete with the economies of scale of a restaurant.<p>But ultimately it doesn&#x27;t matter as people don&#x27;t cook at home for rational economic reasons, they cook at home because it is an enjoyable activity. You definitely don&#x27;t have to sell me on that. I love cooking. I would never trade my kitchen for an extra dollar in my pocket.')
