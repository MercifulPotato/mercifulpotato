It is like there&#x27;s a general discourse that they are a bad thing, just like with &quot;that other&quot; thing (cough socialism cough).<p>I&#x27;m from the &#x27;birthplace&#x27; of US Auto unions. This part of your reply is actually a good place to start the explanation, because that&#x27;s actually the perception of some other unions, and at times there is <i>historical</i> context to that.<p>&gt; From my point of view actions of police union are usually borderline &quot;mob-like&quot; (as in, I mostly hear about them when they save the necks of abusing and &#x2F; or corrupted officers).<p>Two points:<p>- The UAW and Teamsters in particular had ties to actual mob organizations in the past. &quot;Jimmy Hoffa&quot; is a name to look up if you&#x27;d like an example of what some people think of when they think of unions.<p>- The examples you give of corruption&#x2F;status quo in police unions are present in the Auto shops as well; whenever I heard a story from an auto worker about why &#x27;they&#x27; did not like the unions, it was usually a story like what you said; a worker getting &#x27;protected&#x27; by the union when their actions were unsafe. IOW even some of the people -in- the union see it as a broken institution.')
