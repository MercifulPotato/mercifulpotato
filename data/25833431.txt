It does apply to DVB-T dongles though.<p>It used to be a separate tax, now it&#x27;s collected as part of the electric bill. You have to opt out explicitly instead of &quot;opting in&quot; by paying; this makes it much worse for people to evade the payment, since they would be making a false statement when opting out. So many people were evading the fee, that it has since been reduced by a third or so.')
