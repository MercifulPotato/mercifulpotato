If you are making lots and lots of money selling 3% organic food, but everyone keeps talking about the organic food, I&#x27;m going to wonder if you switched to prioritizing making lots and lots of money instead of selling organic food (which you are allowed to do, nobody&#x27;s going to stop you), and if the organic food is just a story, and if maybe we should stop telling that story like that, and at any rate when telling the history of your endeavor it seems worth mentioning.')
