Although I do agree - numpy should be in the stdlib, period. So many users come from the scientific&#x2F;data&#x2F;simulation communities. Itâ€™s just that there are no (or too few) core devs from that tradition. Python lacking numpy in the base language is as awful as Fortran lacking dict-like data structures in its runtime.')
