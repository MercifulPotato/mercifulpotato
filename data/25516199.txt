Surely inflation hawks would want generally <i>smaller</i> bills? But even then only the stupidest among them would also think this could be achieved via printing specific denominations rather than interest rate and other real fiscal policy.<p>My understanding as an expat was the same as alasdair&#x27;s - 2010-2015 I saw plenty of Germans drop a couple 500s to pay for hotel stays, major appliances, etc. Few people had a credit card and those that did didn&#x27;t want to use it domestically.
