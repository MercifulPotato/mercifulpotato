It will automatically create a builder pod for you if you don&#x27;t already have one, or you can specify one with whichever runtime that you want (containerd or docker). It uses buildkit to do the builds and has a syntax which is compatible with `docker build`.<p>There are also some pretty cool features. It supports building multi-arch images, so you can do things like create x86_64 and ARM images. It can also do build layer caching to a local registry for all of your builders, so it&#x27;s possible to scale up your pod and then share each of the layers for really efficient builds.')
