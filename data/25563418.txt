Especially now that we&#x27;re scrambling to grow, I need to constantly prioritize in order to just stay sane and get forward.<p>If I&#x27;ve interviewed 10 candidates in a week and there was one or two which were really interesting, that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ll be focusing on first. Whether I get to write 8 rejections in detail, it doesn&#x27;t matter for the company. At least in the short term.<p>And chances are &gt;50% that candidates don&#x27;t perceive detailed and honest feedback in a good way (even with the best intentions), so I might get stuck in a discussion about details going forward when nothing changes that &quot;no&quot;. Nothing good came from that for either me or the candidate ever. Rejections always feel like failure and honestly I hate writing them as well, as I know I&#x27;m always hurting someone.<p>It&#x27;s not a part of my job that I&#x27;m proud about (hence the throwaway too), but this is frankly my thought process around the whole thing.<p>I&#x27;ve been on the other side of the table multiple times, so I know how much the candidate experience sucks, but that&#x27;s how it goes.<p>If you&#x27;re searching for a job, just do yourself a favor and go broad while not taking anything too personal. It&#x27;s very much in your best interest to get the bidding war for your person on, so never fall in love with any single job offer.')
