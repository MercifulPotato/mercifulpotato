All you need is a way to display a buffer of pixels on the screen. No other communication with the video card required, it&#x27;s all CPU until the frame is ready.<p>Incidentally, I have an ongoing hobby project that does just that: a pure software platform-agnostic 3D renderer with zero non-optional dependencies written in Rust. It comes with a few example programs that use SDL2 and ncurses(!) to handle display and events. I&#x27;m planning to add a Wasm example at some point as well.<p>The project is heavily work-in-progress, and definitely not yet optimized nearly to Quake levels, but on the other hand the code should be relatively clean and useful for learning purposes.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jdahlstrom&#x2F;retrofire" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jdahlstrom&#x2F;retrofire</a>')
