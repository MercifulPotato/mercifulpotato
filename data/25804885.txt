(Facebook does not have to &quot;steal&quot;, people give their information to the Facebook middleman willingly.)<p>Why are WhatsApp communications encrypted.  What can they be used for.  Who can use them.  Note also that &quot;use&quot; and &quot;disclose&quot; may be two different things.  Something like scanning peoples&#x27; Gmail might be an example of &quot;use&quot; without &quot;disclosure&quot;.<p>There are only two other states that have a law similar to the one in Illinois.')
