I’ve been a professional wed developer (full stack from server installation to DBA to server side programming to front end development) for nearly 23 years. My company will pay my tuition for me to go back to school. I’ve considered getting a software engineering degree, but I need to do it while still working full time.<p>I’m not sure if it would be worth my time or what kind of program I should be looking for. I mainly want to get a better background on software engineering that I missed out on by not studying STEM in college. I should mention that I don’t know any math beyond high school algebra and geometry. I’ve never taken calculus or any higher math.<p>Is there anyone out there who was in a situation similar to mine who went back to school? How did it go?')
