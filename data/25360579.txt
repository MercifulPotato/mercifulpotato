Both of these people turned out fine, so if anything this seems like an endorsement of this vaccine for people with severe allergies. There is no guarantee any of the vaccines won&#x27;t have issues. Its much better to say: &quot;If you commonly get allergic reactions to medicines, you might get one here. Use your judgement or speak to your doctor about the risks of remaining unvaccinated versus taking this particular vaccine.&quot;<p>Let people make their own risk decisions. Banning the vaccine is how we got into this mess to begin with.')
