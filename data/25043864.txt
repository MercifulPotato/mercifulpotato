Item(by='brazzy', descendants=None, kids=[25044317], score=None, time=1604997129, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25042581, text='&gt; No, the comparison to an APC (armored personnel carrier) is apt- knights were armored enough to be nearly invulnerable to the weaponry a peasant would have access to.<p>No. A knight prone on the ground was very easy to kill very quickly - just stick a dagger through the visor. There is nothing comparable a civilian today can do to an APC.<p>Additionally, a single knight on a horse was not <i>that</i> hard to take down using relatively easily-available polearms, at least to a group of peasants. It doesn&#x27;t scale down linearly - 40:9000 is a very different matter than 1:200, because a charge of 40 mounted knights is still inescapable death to the <i>part</i> of the enemy force they&#x27;re charging at. A single knight would be much less terrifying even to a relatively group of peasants.')
