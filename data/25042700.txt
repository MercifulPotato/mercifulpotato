Which it&#x27;s fine. But then when you ask &quot;how to do X using locks,&quot; the only thing people respond is the mantra of &quot;don&#x27;t communicate by sharing, share by communicating&quot;. Which doesn&#x27;t help in any way. Then people ask complex questions about using channels and others say &quot;why don&#x27;t you just use locks?&quot; That&#x27;s why I think Go adds more instead of alleviating the complexity of writing concurrent programs.')
