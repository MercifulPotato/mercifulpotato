Reducing the NSAs workload by 99% makes the other 1% much easier because they have 100 times the resources to spend on it.<p>You should also consider as a swiss citizen that US law is increasingly world law.  If you sit in Switzerland and contribute to a project banned by US law, they may well have you extradited to spend the rest of your life in a US prison.  They&#x27;re doing that to Assange right now.  They&#x27;ve done it to others as well.  Locking up foreigners is quite in-style in the US at the moment... I haven&#x27;t read the bill, so I don&#x27;t know what the criminal sanctions are for failing to provide backdoors...<p>Best of luck')
