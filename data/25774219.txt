Now I have been working from home for decades so that hasn’t changed. I have an online business that went from slow decline to growing noticeably.<p>But the truth is I have thrived for kind of a dumb reason. I have been paranoid all my life and by the time Covid hit I was ready for everything. Somehow the fact that my family was totally prepared lifted me out of a depression I have been in for a long time.<p>To be clear, it is not that I am happy others are hurting. I think there was some kind of unconscious bit flipping where my slightly embarrassing habit of expecting the worst paid off.<p>Also I sold my office and bought an insanely beautiful farm 5 minutes from my house so I am over the moon about that.')
