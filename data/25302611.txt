You’re at 10% chance before even two billion, and 1% after 609 million. I wouldn’t care to play this random game with even a <i>million</i> keys, the 64-bit key space is just not large enough to pick IDs at random. UUIDs are 128 bits; that’s large enough that you can reasonably assume in most fields that no collisions will occur.<p>Storing a string is also inefficient, wasting more than three, and probably eight or more bytes (I’m not certain of the implementation details in PostgreSQL), growing index sizes and making comparisons slower. It’s more efficient to store it as a number and convert to and from the string form only when needed.')
