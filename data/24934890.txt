There are exactly 0 chips or even IP on the market with standard B  (which is really a family of sub-standards), but there are chips with pre-standard V (alas, a few of them aren&#x27;t compatible with the current draft - the perils of running ahead).<p>Overall, yes you are right, this is most useful for people interested in seriously evaluating RV64GC and&#x2F;or porting code.
