Even more dangerously, it&#x27;s inside of a game that appears to be largely vaporware, and has no high-profile company to give weight to the virtual items. At least you know Blizzard or Epic will be around for a while, these people could be bankrupt tomorrow and all you&#x27;d own is a worthless (and expensive) Ethereum transaction.<p>I&#x27;d also bet that this &quot;sale&quot; is an inside job, given that the virtual nonsense was purchased by another scammy blockchain gaming company via &quot;Polyient Games Unity Tokens&quot;, and the $800K is based on the market cap of some obscure, illiquid token.')
