Item(by='123randomacc', descendants=None, kids=[25058106], score=None, time=1605096461, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25046212, text='How &#x27;hard it is to &quot;know&quot;&#x27; is irreverent, and you agree to this when you accept the &#x27;contract&#x27;. This isn&#x27;t an issue of honesty, in fact; quite the contrary. They are extremely honest. It&#x27;s just in the fine print.<p>Legal &#x2F; Terms of Service &#x2F; Terms of Use &#x2F; Usage Policy<p>I find that a majority don&#x27;t even hide unreasonable conditions in &#x27;legal&#x27; terms anymore. Whilst there may be tens, hundreds, of pages in that ToS you tick before using the product - there&#x27;s a few solid, clear, one sentence dot points that protect from all issues. The best of these is similar to: &quot;We reserve the right to amend, change, or otherwise modify this agreement with - or without - notice.&quot;, or &quot;We reserve the right to withdraw services&#x2F;solutions with - or without - notice.&quot; Some, like the famous early React licenses (by Facebook), had indemnity clauses for simply using the product - even if your then legal engagement was entirely unrelated to your use of React. Impacted by Cambridge Analytica? Sorry. Many years ago you experimented with React. Immunity.<p>I don&#x27;t think a third party audit is a fix. Even dismissing these previous statements. The volume of &#x27;independent&#x27; auditors that are then found corrupt, or otherwise bias&#x2F;incompetent in result, is pretty regular news. More often than not. Based on some experience with how contracts and engagements go with big corporations - some even factor in known &#x27;expected losses&#x27; (such as fines, failing to meet SLA, etc) in their actual budget of contract.<p>The real fix is users taking responsibility. Don&#x27;t like the ToS (And, believe me; you won&#x27;t..). Don&#x27;t accept it.<p>(@USERS, not @_jal) But don&#x27;t complain that the product you did, or did not, pay a cent for - but blindly accepted the ToS - fails to deliver to your expectation. Sure.. It suggested, or possibly even states &#x27;end to end encryption&#x27;. But the ToS clarifies context of that.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;zoom.us&#x2F;terms" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;zoom.us&#x2F;terms</a>')
