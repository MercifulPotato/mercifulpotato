But once you start engaging with, say, some crazy cult, Facebook&#x27;s algo will pick up on that, and start prioritizing content from the crazy cultists. In time, you&#x27;ll get to the point where you&#x27;re <i>only</i> seeing content from the cultists, and come to believe that&#x27;s what <i>everyone</i> thinks, because that&#x27;s all you&#x27;ll ever see. YouTube suffers from this too.')
