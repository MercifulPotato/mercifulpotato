So based on that principal all the posts on StackOverflow[0] that describe the actual steps needed to take, and accompanying code examples, should be pulled under DMCA also.<p>[0]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;28006836" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;28006836</a>')
