I udnerstand that people try to protect their expensive devices, but it seems absurd to me to hide a beautiful device like an iPhone (particularly the 4-5 as well as the new 12 generation) in some form of mediocre wrapper.<p>However when carrying the phone in my pocket or bag I always use a fabric sleeve with microfiber inner lining. To me this approach is the best of both worlds: The pure device when in use, but protection when carrying it around - Plus, instead of having to put the device down on hard surfaces the sleeve serves as a soft bed for the phone. And the microfiber lining keeps the display clean.<p>All my past iPhones looked pretty much pristine when I sold them on ebay.')
