Item(by='timerol', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605884654, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25160643, text='This is another specific scientific communication, of the type that are widely misunderstood. Remember &quot;no evidence that masks reduce transmission&quot; and &quot;no evidence that immunity from COVID will last&quot;? Both were true statements at the time, and widely misunderstood. &quot;No evidence&quot; of X does not mean that X is at all likely to happen, based on our current understanding of disease.<p>Because of the test design, the test itself only measured people who got COVID. But based on current scientific consensus around disease, that means there is a very high likelihood that it also prevents asymptomatic transmission, as the immune system will generally fight off infection. One test being narrowly worded (as is correct scientific practice) does not overthrow our entire understanding of disease.')
