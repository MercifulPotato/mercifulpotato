Item(by='rbecker', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602033243, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24697456, text='&gt; You wiped them out.<p>Sorry, &quot;we&quot; didn&#x27;t have time to get any colonies - go find a Spaniard to blame. We were too busy getting raided by Ottomans, having our children kidnapped, trained as slave soldiers, and then used for <i>more</i> raids against us. Or sold into harems. But I won&#x27;t hold my breath waiting on any sympathy or condemnation of <i>that</i>.<p>And elevating the expansionist, slave-owning, human-sacrificing-on-unprecedented-scale Aztec <i>empire</i> to some pedestal of egalitarian virtue, just because they were later destroyed by the Spanish, could not be more ridiculous. How do you imagine China reached its size before it stopped being expansionist? What do you think &quot;subdue&quot; means in the following passage?<p><i>Though the unified reign of the First Qin Emperor lasted only 12 years, he managed to subdue great parts of what constitutes the core of the Han Chinese homeland</i> [1]<p>But I want to draw specific attention to your comments about India, since it&#x27;s a very common type of argument. From that same wikipedia page:<p><i>History: Vedic period (1500â€“1000 BCE): The dasas were frequent allies of the Aryan tribes, and they were probably assimilated into the Aryan society, giving rise to a class distinction. Many dasas were however in a servile position, giving rise to the eventual meaning of dasa as servant or slave.</i><p>Already they had a class system and oppression, yet the British Raj was still <i>three thousand years away</i>. But you are correct, contact with the British did change them. Contact of any two civilizations ends up changing them. So everything bad that is to follow, we can blame on the British.<p>Just like everything bad the Spanish did, we can blame on the Moors that invaded them. I&#x27;m sure if we dig further, we&#x27;ll find someone that attacked the Moors, so they aren&#x27;t at fault either. We just have to follow this chain of aggression, until one day, we&#x27;ll find the civilization that first attacked another, that first oppressed a class of people, and we can blame everything bad on them.<p>Or do you only apply this logic to Europe, and hold everyone else blameless?<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;History_of_China#Imperial_China" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;History_of_China#Imperial_Chin...</a>')
