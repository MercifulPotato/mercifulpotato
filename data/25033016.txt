It&#x27;s just a question of whether you feel your life is worth the rent someone is willing to pay.<p>The difference between this job and others is that you are subsidizing the higher rent by covering the cost of your hobby time for them. You should consider reducing your perceived life rental income by the amount you&#x27;re subsidizing and then compare jobs based on that unsubsidized amount.<p>You might stick with it anyways, or you might discover that there&#x27;s better value to be had elsewhere.<p>edit: clarity.')
