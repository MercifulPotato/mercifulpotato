This rate looks to continue with two new large Tesla factories slated to begin production in late 2021. So they could pass GM in sales quickly as GM sales are basically flat. Tesla also has higher gross margins than most other vehicle manufacturers. Plus Tesla does batteries and solar that look like high growth sectors.')
