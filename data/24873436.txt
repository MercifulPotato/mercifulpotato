You can&#x27;t teach this.  My mom has perfect pitch, and I do not.  I can play a record and move the pitch knob to make it play a bit fast, and it will bother her enough to get up off the couch and change it back.  No matter how much ear training I do, that will never be the case with me.<p>I have very good relative pitch, and a highly trained ear, and that you <i>can</i> teach.  If you play me C, I can tell you what the other notes are based on that, and my internal reference for what C is persists for quite a while.  If you play me a song, I can hear what the chords are -- the color (major, minor, dominant, diminished, etc.) and the degree of the scale.  But that is all relative to itself.  If I hear the same song played in C, and then in Db, the two of them will hit me emotionally the same.  Whereas for someone with perfect pitch, I understand it can be different.  And for someone with perfect pitch and synesthesia, I understand it can be different still -- notes and keys are perceived as colors.  And while I can imagine what that might be like, there&#x27;s no way for me to train myself to <i>be</i> that.')
