What do you forsee the issue being with where the money could be going?<p>If Jason is recommending a way to donate to the project, who cares where it goes? If he puts it straight in his pocket and uses it to buy pizza or a computer game, it&#x27;s still serving its purpose as far as I&#x27;m concerned. I have donated, and will do so again, and I&#x27;m perfectly happy with the money being used that way.<p>In a sense, for me, it&#x27;s a thank you for the work thus far, not an payment for more work.<p>I imagine many see this differently, so I&#x27;m interested to hear some other opinions.')
