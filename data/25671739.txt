They should ALL be prosecuted. Any violent protestors. Anyone that does property damage.\nAnyone protesting in a non-violent way should be allowed to do so.\nWhat we are seeing instead is peaceful, non-violent BLM protesters and journalists are shot and teargassed. Violent protestors are allowed to get away without prosecution. And Trump insurrectionists are allowed to walk into the most important federal building in the country, and then walk out.\nThis is insane. As a country, we no longer know wrong from right, or up from down, or true from false. That is the definition of a major mental pathology.')
