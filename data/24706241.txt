Item(by='mujina93', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602058229, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24701810, text='Question: how would you change your method if you didn&#x27;t have 3 hours to spend every day on pure, focused learning? What if you didn&#x27;t know how much time you had, or if you had time at all, and your time came only in very small bursts of free time?<p>When I was at the university I had all the time in the world for learning, and I was (artificially) incentivized to learn and retain a lot. Therefore my learning method was really different, rich, deep, optimized for the available time and the broad task.<p>Since I started working, my free time has shrunk by ~90%, and all the incentives for understanding deeply anything have gone to nearly 0. Now I can&#x27;t afford having a big time slot just for learning, and I changed myself from being engineered to learn and retain theoretical knowledge in bulk to just be able to learn on the fly only the things that I need to use (this has been a positive change, actually. It was a painful change but I realized university had me optimized for something useless for practical purposes).<p>More and more I&#x27;m not even trying to retain in any way the small bits of knowledge, documentation, etc., that I encounter. I just read something up, I use it, and I forget it. For example, sometimes I program in programming languages that &quot;I don&#x27;t know&quot;. I just read up the syntax for the constructs I need, search stuff on stack overflow, and then forget everything.<p>Before being able to consider applying your method as a learning method, one has to overcome the time scheduling problem of finding 3 straight hours. Your blog has a &quot;Why I wake up at 5 a.m.&quot; entry. I suspect that&#x27;s what makes it possible for you in the first place?<p>I&#x27;m curious! :)')
