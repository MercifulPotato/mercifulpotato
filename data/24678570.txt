I had been meaning to try it out anyhow, but being able to impress her with Linux skills was the trigger to actually get into it. Also Python; she was also into Python and so I started on learning that as well.<p>Took me a few months to get settled, initially using Linux Mint, but I never looked back. I actually tried going back to Windows when buying a new laptop and the latest hardware just wasn&#x27;t supported at all, figuring I&#x27;d just modify and tweak it in every possible way, but it is just too cumbersome and inflexible now that I&#x27;m used to Debian.<p>As for the girl, the impress-her part worked well enough I think but sadly we never got together and ended up losing touch. Sometimes I wonder if she&#x27;s alive: accounts on all social media are inactive since years and while she didn&#x27;t seem unhappy, she was an unusual person and didn&#x27;t easily fit in with society. I hope she&#x27;s okay.<p>Knowing Linux and Python are invaluable skills for the work I do now. If I hadn&#x27;t started then, I would have had to catch up later or maybe ended up in a more standard tech job, so a head start there was definitely good to get a foot in the door at places that use both extensively in pentesting.')
