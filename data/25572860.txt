I run a productivity software startup, and my cofounder brought up the 4-day week idea. We opted not to pursue it. It came down to a few things:<p>- Onboarding &#x2F; Collaboration overhead (this compounds)\nAn additional dev is one more to manage, one more to onboard, one more to <i>keep happy</i>, buy hardware and software licenses for, and all that for the same number of man-hours.<p>- Work compounds. A programmer working on a system or feature for 10 days does the deepest learning in days 7-10. The internals, nitty-gritty stuff. For a 3 day a week employee, the same insights are gained in week 4 (10 days) instead of week 2 (10 days). Of course, I used 10 days as an example, but true expertise is built and compounded over months. It doesn’t matter how many 3-day-a-week hires we have, this process won’t be sped up.<p>- Compensation &#x2F; Performance - how do we do this in an equitable way? Again, comes down to compounding impact. If 5 day a week employee makes 5&#x2F;8 of the impact at the same productivity rate as 3 day a week employee - does that mean they get promoted &#x2F; rewarded at a different rate?<p>- Availability &#x2F; Scheduling - \n30 hours is about 3.5 work days a week. It’s an added pain to manage and track who is going to be working when. If your company uses a system for taxes, payroll, vacation accrual, insurance, etc, chances are it is built for 8 by 5 employees first and foremost.<p>- Various laws around part time and full time workers, based on hours in some jurisdictions. I think 28 hours is the cutoff here in Ontario?')
