I’m not going to debate that, it’s common knowledge.<p>UUID was changed in the 90s to be a hash of this instead and later to just be a completely random number because there are so many bits the likelihood of a single duplicate being generated before the sun has swollen enough to consume the earth is slim so you don’t actually need these schemes to provide a unique number.')
