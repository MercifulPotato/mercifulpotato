Item(by='giantg2', descendants=None, kids=[25420450], score=None, time=1607960800, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25415835, text='Nice strawman argument.<p>The word &quot;binary&quot; is a modifier of the word &quot;tree&quot;. Anyone with a basic understanding of English knows that a binary tree is different from an oak tree. The modifier in &quot;ponzi scheme&quot; is &quot;ponzi&quot;. The very definition stated that it is a scheme related to financial investment and returns, which doesn&#x27;t fit the situation in the article.<p>If you compare the binary tree and ponzi scheme examples, you will find them quite similar. You have base word (tree&#x2F;scheme) and a modifier word (binary&#x2F;ponzi). So your tree example is actually a great point supporting my argument - this may be a scheme, but it&#x27;s not a ponzi scheme.')
