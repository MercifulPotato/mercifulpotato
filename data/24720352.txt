The contributors. They&#x27;re mostly paying with time, but there&#x27;s some direct cost too.<p>It&#x27;s why we want to be good users of open source and contribute back, whether that&#x27;s donating or helping write documentation, manage issues, etc.<p>The cost of open source is the direct cost - what it takes to build an adblocker in this case. The cost of a for-profit product is the direct cost and the profit margin - a higher number in every situation. Instead of the for profit company paying that, it&#x27;s some external party and if that isn&#x27;t you it&#x27;s.. well, still somebody. As the saying goes, if you aren&#x27;t the customer, you&#x27;re the product.')
