None have been proposed, and just as i expected, the commenter is pretending, and does not have the courage of  conviction.<p>Nothing in the comment faults my words. And what I&#x27;m saying is too important to tarnish with a dishonest discussion with someone being dishonest.<p>I know you hope you can dismiss this view with some metacommentary, but nothing raised has challenged what i said, and i think you&#x27;re wasting your time by continuing to comment because you&#x27;re not succeeding in dismantling the ideas i presented.<p>I have a solution for you, that i proposed initially. You don&#x27;t want to believe this idea, so simply don&#x27;t. Just refuse to believe it. That will be easiest for you and i really do not want anything to be hard for you.')
