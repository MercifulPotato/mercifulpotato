Parse the sentence. The &quot;this&quot; in &quot;I&#x27;m sorry for this&quot; is not for the dismissal, but for the reaction to it:<p>&quot;I’ve heard the reaction to Dr. Gebru’s departure loud and clear: it seeded doubts and led some in our community to question their place at Google. I want to say how sorry I am for that, and I accept the responsibility of working to restore your trust.&quot;<p>That is the only use of &quot;sorry&quot; or &quot;apology&quot; in the entire memo.')
