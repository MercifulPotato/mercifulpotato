Being an industrialized nation with modern technology and medicine doesn&#x27;t come as a single package with the nuclear family.<p>For example, I&#x27;m Mexican. Here it&#x27;s quite normal to spend plenty of time with your extended family, live near them, have your parents help you take care of your kids for extended periods of time, etc. at least in my experience. We&#x27;re an industrial nation and have modern medicine, but this is more a matter of culture and social attitudes I think.')
