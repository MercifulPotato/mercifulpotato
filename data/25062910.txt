You can rebase as long as it is in your repository and you didn&#x27;t publish anything, you are free to do whatever you want on your PC. But as soon as it becomes public, it is history, and you don&#x27;t change history.<p>Git is decentralized, and works kind of like a blockchain. With Bitcoin, the foundation is that everyone share the same history, no one should be able to rewrite transactions. I expect the same behavior from decentralized version control systems.<p>And if you make a mess, too bad, it is here to stay. It is ugly, but it is what really happened.<p>If it really is a huge mess, call the admin so that he can fix the thing, notify everyone that the history has changed, and have your name added to the hall of shame.<p>But that&#x27;s a personal opinion. I know some people prefer a clean (but fake) history over a messy (but true) history. Continuous integration tools tend to like clean histories for instance. You can even have both system coexist. A messy&#x2F;true history branch where developers work and a whitewashed version running in parallel for integrators.')
