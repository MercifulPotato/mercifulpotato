I have a custom script that encrypts all files, then rsyncs them to rsync.net, if I need them, rsync them back to a local machine and decrypt using GPG. A drawn out process that seems quite antiquated, especially seeing as my need to access these backups is maybe once per year. It would seem from initial (quick) reading, borg just basically makes this whole process easier and arguably even more secure?')
