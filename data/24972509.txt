Canada doesn&#x27;t have an institution like the US senate, where voters from the least populous state have over 80 times more power than those from the most populous state.<p>The spread in riding (electoral district) size in Canada only varies by a factor of 4.5 if the (mostly unpopulated) northern territories are included (the three territories have one MP, each, to represent populations of less than 30,000) and a factor of 1.5 among the populated provinces.<p>Canadian federal governments are generally comprised of whichever party received the largest share of votes nationally. This is not always the case in the US.')
