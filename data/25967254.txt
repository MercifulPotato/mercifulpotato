The past week has made it perfectly clear that Big Tech will close the circle and protect their own. Anything that appears to be censorship resistant, that allows the little guy to get ahead and compete, or that allows individuals to have greater levels of privacy and freedom, will be shut down and de-platformed.<p>As was predicted in 1948, &quot;hate speech&quot; has just become a smoke and mirrors term.
