I&#x27;m imaging the production of bricks of dry ice and comparing it to regular clay bricks since I&#x27;m in a hurry. Is dry ice easier to create than clay bricks?<p>World brick production is 1,500 billion bricks (source = Google). 2.27 kg per brick, that&#x27;s 3.4 trillon kgs of brick divided 907kg&#x2F;ton = 3.5 gigatons of bricks. I wonder how difficult it&#x27;d be easy to make a comparable amount of dry ice. Power it with cheap solar&#x2F;wind power. Maybe the dry ice can be rocketed to Mars or the Moon to begin terraforming an atmosphere?<p>OK, imagining over, I&#x27;ll get back to my day job...')
