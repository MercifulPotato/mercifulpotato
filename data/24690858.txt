I would guess that most drivers, and certainly <i>every</i> doctor who drives has “nodded off” at least once in their life. And you’re right, most of these situations are <i>not</i> indicative of a medical condition.<p>I think it’s true that every driver <i>should</i> take responsibility for their own internal state, and do whatever they can to ensure they don’t drive in an impaired state, whether that’s just getting enough sleep, avoiding alcohol or certain meds, or being prepared to pull off the road and nap.')
