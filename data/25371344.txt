For slightly older browsers, such as later IE releases, you need to try-catch that and use `scrollTo(x, y)`. And for older browsers still, not-the-latest IE, Opera mobile, that&#x27;s the rest of the 7KB â€” polyfills, hacks, wrappers and more. Shortly, for browsers that don&#x27;t have an animation API nor a proper scrolling API. It may be disproportionate, but for sites that want to target readers all around the world, on all devices, it can be a sensible tradeoff.')
