(That acquisition has not born visible fruit.)<p>My contrarian speculation is that this is a move driven by Xilinx vs. Nvidia given Nvidia’s purchase of Arm and Xilinx’ push into AI&#x2F;ML. Xilinx is threatened by Nvidia’s move given their dependence on Arm processors in their SOC chips and their ongoing fight in the AI&#x2F;ML (including autonomous vehicles) product space. My speculation is that this gives Xilinx an alternative high performance AMD64 (and possibly lower performance &amp; lower power x86) &quot;hard cores&quot; to displace the Arm cores.<p>Interesting times.')
