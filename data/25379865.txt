Google seems to prioritize and reward project completion (aka &quot;shipping&quot;) more than long-term project successfulness. Also it&#x27;s more advantageous to do whatever it takes to get a leg up and get promoted than it is to care about the long-term viability of a project.<p>So to answer your question, probably still at google, just not associated with the &quot;stories&quot; team anymore. It&#x27;s a game of hot potato where you don&#x27;t want to be stuck on a team not shipping&#x2F;innovating since those are the same teams that get spun down (though to be fair it sounds like they just get absorbed onto the &quot;google blob&quot; instead of being let go most of the time).<p>It&#x27;s sad that people that are the most passionate are the ones who suffer the most (suffer in terms of not getting funds&#x2F;time&#x2F;etc to expand a product they care deeply for and for their troubles get shifted to some other team when Google loses interest in their &quot;baby&quot;).')
