MS got caught treating user privacy in a particularly abysmal way, but it&#x27;s 100% in line with their general approach to user data.  The main difference here is the revelation that they&#x27;re sharing your personal data with your employer rather than keeping it to themselves.  Sure they rolled back their intrusive practice when they got caught with their hand in the cookie jar, but this gives me zero confidence that they are treating my privacy with respect in any other case.')
