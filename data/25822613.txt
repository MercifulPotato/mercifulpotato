It was doing a good job of ranking the initial drawings but after a couple of hours of people poking at the model they discovered that the best way to get to the top of the leaderboard was to write the prompt with the paintbrush (or add text labels to their drawing). This wasn&#x27;t the behavior we wanted so last night we updated our code to also compare each image against CLIP prompts like &quot;handwritten text&quot; and apply a penalty to their score based on how text-heavy CLIP thinks the image is. The leaderboards look a lot better after adding that feature and recalculating the scores.<p>* The Internet will be the Internet. If you put out a drawing tool there is a not-insignificant minority of people who will just draw dicks (and worse). Luckily, we were able to use CLIP to help with this too! We now run each image through a variety of prompts like &quot;Illustration of racist symbols&quot; and if the image scores highly we put it behind a [nsfw] blocker. We don&#x27;t penalize their score but they tend to naturally end up towards the bottom of the leaderboard anyway.<p>* People have been spending a lot of time on it! We already have over 500 drawings in the first 12 hours and some people are creating some artistic masterpieces[5]. Follow @paintdotwtf on twitter; we&#x27;ll be highlighting cool things we find over the next few days as people continue to experiment.<p>[5] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;sylviafysica&#x2F;status&#x2F;1351159548099391495?s=21" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;sylviafysica&#x2F;status&#x2F;1351159548099391495?...</a>')
