There is probably an almost universal consensus in the C++ world that the locale library is the worst standard library, immediately followed by iostreams. For small programs that&#x27;s annoying, although using libc IO is usually fine for them. However, C++ is probably one of the top 3 languages for developing large applications (Java would also be there, not sure which one is the third in that pack) and for these having to roll your own IO is usually no biggie, because it probably would have been done anyway (e.g. even if iostreams wouldn&#x27;t be so bad, it would likely have no place in the IO system of a content creation app or being used in HDF5).<p>In that sense, C++ is not batteries included, which can be annoying for small and medium projects.')
