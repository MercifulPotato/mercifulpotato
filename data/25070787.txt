The guy was both an insanely productive programmer and Ruby evangelist. He gave more to the community than anyone could repay. And what did he ask for in return? He asked to be the Lone Ranger.<p>All he wanted was anonymity. He wanted to be the masked hero who rides in, does a bunch of good, and then gallops off before anyone has had a chance to thank him. He was an eccentric, a romantic. That romantic eccentric was a benefactor who asked basically nothing in return.<p>And some nobody decided it would be fun to pull off the mask. Who was that? We&#x27;d have to look him up to know his name. He ruined it for _why and for the rest of the Ruby community. Why? What for?')
