Like, yes I bought that new power tool last week. Stop showing me the ad for the tool from the same store I already bought it from.<p>I&#x27;m pretty much convinced that apart from the people working in the ad business, nobody actually profits off ads. Certainly it&#x27;s close to impossible to prove that ads are effective, and people who sell ads to companies are good at cherry picking and suggestive correlations. Then in the end everyone tries to buy the same eyeballs by paying the same ad companies, and it all averages out to nothing except you spent a bunch of money.')
