That&#x27;s one of the dangers of revolutions and suppression of dissent.<p>I&#x27;m saying there is no reason to be surprised when you&#x27;re asking platforms to ignore Trump&#x27;s attempt to end democracy and they decline.<p>To give a hypothetical: if Trump&#x27;s followers were harassing Matt Prince&#x27;s family every day at home, work, and school there wouldn&#x27;t be any hand-wringing about &quot;free speech&quot; or &quot;censorship&quot; from Cloudflare. Anyone related to Trump would find themselves banned in short order. That would be purely a move of self-preservation.<p>Similarly a lot of platforms (and donors) realize these people are no longer useful idiots but deluded to the point of ransacking the house of Congress in an attempt to overturn the election. That&#x27;s really dangerous and could destabilize the country and even the world. When faced with an existential threat don&#x27;t be shocked when people are unwilling to sit down and debate on behalf of MAGAs&#x2F;Fox News acting in bad faith.')
