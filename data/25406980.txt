Most language tools are context free. How did we go so wrong?<p>We never did. We always knew that any real-world useful grammar is multi-level and attribute (well, it&#x27;s constraint-based, though depending on your definition of &quot;attribute grammar&quot;, those are equivalent). That&#x27;s why we so much like recursive-descent parsers: adding any multi-level constraints are so easy to them - you have a full Turing-complete language at your disposal, unlike simplistic 1-dimensional DSLs of most parser generators.')
