I know reddit pushes this idea but do people actually participating in communities with point systems see those with high karma points or whatever as trustworthy?<p>Personally, i&#x27;ve always assumed people with high amounts of karma or stars are just people who&#x27;ve spent a significant amount of their lives on a site and participated a lot.')
