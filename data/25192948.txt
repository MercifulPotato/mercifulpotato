Or desolder it if it&#x27;s a security concern?<p>It&#x27;s not that difficult, speaking as someone with three left hands when it comes to soldering (or drawing for that matter) and next to zero experience with hardware&#x2F;electronics. Recently took out the camera board from a webcam and added an LED: that consisted of removing a few screws, wiggling some plastic clips until it came apart, and finally a bit of yolo soldering an LED from an old keychain light onto the + and - pins of the USB connector. It&#x27;s almost certainly the wrong voltage but it works. I also removed a speaker from an annoying toy: undo a screw, wiggle, identify speaker (activate the toy a few times), and just hold the soldering iron&#x27;s tip to the pins until it comes off. With a 5 minute internet video on how melting solder works, I&#x27;d be fairly confident that my mom can desolder a microphone without damaging the webcam. (She&#x27;d just need more confidence in herself..!)')
