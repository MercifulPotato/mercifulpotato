Modern Western society has developed some very strict gender norms. We think we moved past them, but in many ways we&#x27;ve only strengthened them. I&#x27;m using the royal &quot;we&quot; but a significant part of that phenomenon is that Western <i>women</i> in particular have embraced, reinforced, and even created some of these norms; not only men. (Part of group empowerment is having greater control over the denotations and connotations of that identity, and sometimes that results in even starker, more rigid boundaries than before.)<p>In some other, especially non-modern societies, gender isn&#x27;t so binary or strongly delineated. In fact, this <i>used</i> to be a relatively well known factoid among open-minded, college-educated people, popularized by feminists intending to deconstruct pseudo-scientific linkages between anatomical sex and gender roles. But for reasons I really don&#x27;t understand at all[1], in the past 10 years or so American society (and I assume most of Western society) has elided this distinction between sex and gender, and thus biology and gender, leaving behind a culture that has partly retrogressed in terms of understanding the fluidity of gender and the degree to which it&#x27;s culturally informed. Today we conflate appearance even more closely with gender and pre-defined gender roles than we did a generation ago. And I have no doubt this has contributed to the experience of being transgender (for whatever spectrum of whatevers &quot;transgender&quot; encompasses--it would be foolish in any event to think it has a singular, simple, genetic root) even more stressful and painful than it would be in a vastly different culture. There&#x27;s unlikely to be a simple, biological &quot;solution&quot; of any sort. Rather, what I think should (and hopefully will) happen is that as we undercover more of our biology we&#x27;ll better appreciate the complexity of the <i>interplay</i> with culture.<p>[1] Okay, I partly understand it. Part of the motivation was that emphasizing nature over nurture was part of the rebuttal to those who denied the existence of or biological connection to the transgender experience. Much like during the gay marriage debates it was emphasized how you don&#x27;t get to choose who you&#x27;re sexually attracted to as a rebuttal to those who clung to the belief that homosexuality was &quot;against nature&quot;.')
