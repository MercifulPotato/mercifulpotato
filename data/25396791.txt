True that vscode and pycharm can give you something but I found that it&#x27;s very often crap.<p>I am writing a little bit of C# atm and astonished how you can just dot tab through your work (without ever having read a tutorial or book on C#) and all those other contextual information you get with &quot;full&quot; visual studio. Somehow feels like just letting you guide through the work :).<p>On the other hand, the students I teach really struggle when they don&#x27;t have all their IDE tricks. \nThey learn almost exclusively C# at their institution in the first year(s) while my experience is mostly playing with Unity ;).')
