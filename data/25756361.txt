Let&#x27;s try to be constructive and provide value to society and the future.  The next generation reads these threads, and they look up to you.  There&#x27;s no reason for you to change that.  And with that respect, not to sound all Uncle Ben on you, does come responsibility.<p>Either way, love you tptacek and appreciate your contributions to HN.  I can honestly say myself, that I&#x27;ve learned a lot by simply being audience to your conversation.<p>Cheers.')
