Keeping the drive off-site also helps to insure against fire, natural disasters or theft. Rotate drives regularly to keep the off-site backup fresh and to spread the (minimal) wear across several drives.  When used in this manner and stored correctly, a set of say 3 to 5 hard drives can be expected to last a _very_ long time.<p>* This is important, because solid state drives are not suited to long term offline storage, they can lose data surprisingly quickly if you leave them sitting on a shelf.')
