Old frames or ones with lots of drone cells. I have to check back in a few days to let the drones out or they die and block the excluder. Workers try to pull them though and jam them in the holes.<p>I’m currently using some nice American made excluders and they are really nice. They are made of wire and are quite quite rigid.')
