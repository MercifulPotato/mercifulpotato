They literally pushed a scanning service to billions of devices through &quot;Play Services&quot; for a product which was barely available. Sold my android phone and switched to iOS.<p>All these smart people they hire and amount of shit code in android is staggering. They never commit to fundamentally fix&#x2F;rebuild basics, it&#x27;s just library on top of library which need to distributed with every app to use basic stuff. (Why the hell is support library even a thing?, if they can push spying shit through google play services, they can push support libs too, and not have every app include it their builds). Kotlin because they screwed up with Java license, instead of building something ground up they take these ugly routes. Look at what Apple is doing x86-Arm, Swift in last 5&#x2F;6 years?. Google is still hacking around on top of Java language&#x2F;VM&#x27;s after over 10 years.')
