He told the following story about a magic trick that he worked on for years, which concerned guessing the timing of his death. I haven&#x27;t heard him tell that story elsewhere, so now seems like a good time to share it.<p>He said that for a good number of years, every time before going to bed, he would write on a little card that he predicted he would die that night during his sleep. In the morning, he got up and happily threw away the little card. Every day. For many years. His concept was that, on the rare chance that this actually happened to be last day, people would think that he pulled the ultimate magic trick. People would not suspect that he wrote this on a little card every day because, well, nobody does that.')
