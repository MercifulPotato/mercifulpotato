I went through the effort to get them upstreamed so other people wouldn&#x27;t have to make the same effort to debug and fix the same issues. Does that enable other companies to avoid hiring engineers to do the same work? Maybe, but it also enables everyone to benefit from things working just a bit better.<p>I don&#x27;t need a royalty from my fixes, I was compensated for my time. I don&#x27;t even care about a credit, but I understand some do.')
