While the consumer side really did not demand &gt;1Gbit speeds until very recently but even now the demand is still very low.<p>10Gbit network adapters consumer a lot more power and are a lot more expensive than 1Gbit chipsets. Consumers&#x27;s primary demands are things like better battery life, price, and smaller form factors so it makes sense to go with 1Gbit. Additionally, a lot of the most popular computers today don&#x27;t even include a real Ethernet port; it&#x27;s a folding mechanism which saves space but would make a 10Gbit spec Ethernet port (shielding, etc.) even more of a challenge.<p>Modern chipsets are starting to include 2.5&#x2F;5Gbit chipsets which benefit from higher speeds but are still much cheaper than 10Gbit. I think a lot of players in this space were expecting and waiting for 10Gbit to become much cheaper and efficient but that did not happen.<p>Many Ultrabooks drop the Ethernet port altogether forcing the use of USB-C adapters. USB-C&#x2F;thunderbolt has a theoretical bandwidth of 20&#x2F;40Gbit&#x2F;s which means you, in theory, could buy a 10Gbit ethernet to thunderbolt adapter.<p>I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a lot more on the technical side that has kept the price&#x2F;energy of 10Gbit high but I don&#x27;t know the details.')
