I really cannot express how much I don’t care. I’ve booted multiple OSes for learning, for fun, and for software support when the software wasn’t available for my preferred OS. But I use my computer for work (and some web browsing). Other than games, macOS has all the software I could think to need. I don’t like rebooting anyway. I can’t think of a scenario where I would ever need a device with another OS that wouldn’t be supplied by an employer. Some freedoms are sacrosanct (and if it ever comes to pass that macOS absolutely prevents installing unblessed end-user apps which deal only with public and supported APIs, that would be my deal breaker), but some freedoms seem so abstract and theoretical in their impact that I just can’t give them weight beyond a thought exercise. “You can’t install any other OS besides this one we offer that meets all your needs” is just... hardly even a thing I would even give much thought.')
