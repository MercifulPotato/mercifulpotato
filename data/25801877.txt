Here&#x27;s a summary of the best parts: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;starwarsfans.fandom.com&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Star_War_The_Third_Gathers:_The_Backstroke_of_the_West" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;starwarsfans.fandom.com&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Star_War_The_Third_Gath...</a><p>Related: a long time ago, in a country far away where I grew up, I had a videotape of Star Wars with Spanish subtitles. It was <i>awful</i>. I think it was done by someone who didn&#x27;t understand much English and knew nothing of Star Wars. I don&#x27;t have that masterpiece anymore (nor a VCR player, for that matter), but off the top of my head:<p>- They translated &quot;Millenium Falcon&quot; as &quot;Numidian Flot&quot;. &quot;She can outrun imperial starships&quot; somehow became &quot;it made two imperial starships run away&quot;.<p>- Chewie was Yuri.<p>- Near the beginning, Vader says something like &quot;send a distress signal, and inform the senate that everyone on board was killed&quot;. The translation meant &quot;send a distress signal, gather the senate, and kill everyone&quot;.<p>- Near the end, Luke is doing the trench run, Vader shoots and misses, and says &quot;the force is strong in this one&quot;. The translation meant &quot;what a strange swinging motion&quot;.')
