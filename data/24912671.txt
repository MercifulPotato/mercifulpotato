But, you have to realize, most hiring discussions on HN end up emphasizing the candidate&#x27;s perspective.  From my POV as an interviewee, I don&#x27;t actually <i>care</i> about any of these myths.  What I <i>do</i> care about is being tested fairly, using problems and scenarios that could come up in real work, not whether I can regurgitate some DP algorithm.<p>IMO, this is what&#x27;s lacking in most interview processes I have participated in, and most of these issues can be fixed by following a structured interview process.  As a side benefit, you may end up with better candidates, as well.  At the very least, you can actually <i>tell</i> if the candidates you choose to hire are as good or better than other people who have gone through your interview process, and that&#x27;s worth something.')
