AstraZeneca contract make its &quot;Best Reasonable Effort&quot; to meet EU demand, without compelling the company to stick to a specific timetable. The hangups seems to be if &quot;Best Reasonable Effort&quot; means includes invalidating contracts with other countries. I think this is a hard case to make. If EU manufactured vaccines are going to UK in substantial volume, I would say they are reneging by going above and beyond contractual obligations to UK, to the detriment of the EU. It makes absolute sense for EU to request this info.<p>&gt;at least if agree with the argument that AZ can&#x27;t just put their UK production outside the EU calculations<p>I&#x27;m not sure what you meant by calculations, but took my best guess above.<p>Another factor is that the EU doesn&#x27;t want to anger the UK by forcing AZ to break UK contract now, because in the long run, they want exports of UK production.')
