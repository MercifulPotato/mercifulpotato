While we are quite similar through facial features and such, we have quite different personalities, skills, even things like allergies and sexualities which one would expect to be more biological in origin. We’ve been involved in a few studies regarding these differences but the results are yet to be published  as the sample is populated. If you are a twin, I’d encourage you to get involved in research like that if you have the time.')
