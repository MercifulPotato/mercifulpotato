More people can afford to travel when rooms in far away places can be rented for small amounts. If the choice is not traveling at all vs. putting up with the friction of finding the property and getting the key, reviewing the house rules and then stripping the bed and taking out the trash before you check out, many people will choose the convenience hit and take more trips. Such as 260 entire place stays in London for under $60&#x2F;night.<p>Put that together with some ridiculously low international air fare, like, RT SFO LHR for $700, pre-pandemic, and many more people will travel.')
