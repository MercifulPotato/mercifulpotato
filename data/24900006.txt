It was designed to be used in industry so there&#x27;s people out there who are using it for real applications. Although I wasn&#x27;t a fan of the JVM I&#x27;ve learnt my bias was wrong and it&#x27;s given me access to an ecosystem of libraries.<p>As I&#x27;m more informed now I think that learning Racket, F# or one of the others would also have been fine. But, I don&#x27;t regret Clojure.<p>They&#x27;re all small(ish) communities so you have to be willing to invest in the community, be willing to put together solutions from bits of information and enjoy experimenting.<p>Whether that&#x27;s the best use of your time is up to you ;-)')
