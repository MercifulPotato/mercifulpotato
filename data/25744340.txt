Arguably worse, because there’s no legal recourse. I think that’s the point being made here.<p>What evidence can you provide to support your claim that various corporations are <i>colluding</i> to block folks?<p>What evidence can you provide that said corporations have a &quot;preferred political party?&quot;<p>You have no such evidence.  What&#x27;s more, whether or not the <i>nebulous</i> set of entities to which you refer (let&#x27;s have specific names and specific actions).<p>I&#x27;d further say that &quot;cloud&quot; (read: someone else&#x27;s servers) services, a few large social networking sites and a small subset of payment processors (I&#x27;m guessing that this is the set of corporations to which you were referring since you don&#x27;t bother to be specific) do not constitute an &quot;oligopoly.&quot;<p>I&#x27;d further add that there are <i>hundreds</i> of hosting and co-location providers, dozens of payment processors and a variety of mechanisms to share data, information and messaging.<p>I find your diatribe to be sorely lacking in evidence, reasoned argument and factual information.<p>Finally, your analogy concerning airlines is deeply flawed, as that isn&#x27;t even close to what&#x27;s going on.<p>Please provide some evidence for your claims.<p>Otherwise, I can only conclude that you are arguing in bad faith.')
