Tesla can promise an electric car but they can&#x27;t promise one that costs less than the lithium and metals required to manufacture it, let alone the cost of labor. Just like Tesla, a farmer can&#x27;t promise to produce vegetables for less than the cost of fertilizer. Based on the foods that the world prefers to eat, it&#x27;s just not feasible.<p>Take a look at the scale of fertilizer manufacturing and use in agriculture. The amount of power required to make that fertilizer is likely an order of magnitude or two <i>less</i> than the amount of power that the sun feeds into photosynthetic systems. Classical agriculture gets that massive power input for free by trading off land use, which also has important follow on effects for fertilizer use, compounding the advantage in fertile areas like California.<p>It&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s impossible if climate change gets really bad and we have to move underground with plentiful nuclear power, but it&#x27;s so far from economically viable at scale as to be a pipe dream.')
