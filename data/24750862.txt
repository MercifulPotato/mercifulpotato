Being a developer is not just about writing heaps of code.<p>Maybe the developer who volunteers at a local community centre is better at dealing with people. Sure, they might not code as much, but they might be better at teasing requirements out of BAs.<p>Or it could be as simple as the developer who does their work during the day, goes home, cooks a meal, plays with their kids&#x2F;socialises with their friends comes in the next day rested and ready to focus on their work, instead of trying to thinking about that problem in their personal project.<p>Or it could be that the guy who codes 24&#x2F;7 is a total rockstar. But maybe working on that pet ML project in Tensorflow at home isn&#x27;t really helping you write that REST endpoint in ASP.net at work.<p>There&#x27;s no guarentee either way.')
