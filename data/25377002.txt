There&#x27;s an obvious choice here. The virus spreads through social contact, so what&#x27;s needed to reduce spread and save lives is a sharp reduction in contacts between people. Closing places where people gather socially is a key component in any rational plan to reduce spread of the virus.<p>&gt; Oh geez why didn&#x27;t I or LA or the US think of that? Alright then, pack it in problem solved, let&#x27;s just make sure everyone&#x27;s compensated.<p>It is simple, and many countries have done it. I currently live in one that is doing precisely this - closing businesses and compensating them. The lockdown has reduced transmission without causing major financial hardships.<p>&gt; Australia and NZ benefit from largely homogenous cultures<p>Australia and New Zealand are extremely diverse immigrant nations. They&#x27;re very similar to the US in that regard.<p>&gt; There&#x27;s nothing authoritarian about the government imposing a lockdown?<p>There&#x27;s nothing inherently authoritarian about it. If the government were cynically using emergency powers to suppress political opponents, I would call that authoritarian. But in an actual public health emergency, a democratic government implementing rational, effective public health measures allowed by law is not &quot;authoritarian.&quot;<p>&gt; Sure, except none of your conditionals there actually get bourn out. Many people question the effectiveness (again not just of reducing cases, but on providing a net positive impact to society) and in the US stimulus measures haven&#x27;t been nearly precise enough to find themselves to the right hands.<p>First off, lockdowns are effective, so if people question them on that basis, they&#x27;re simply misinformed, or they have a strong interest in preventing a lockdown. The latter is the reason why the president of the US has militated against lockdowns. His #1 priority is the stock market, and if a few hundred thousand Americans have to die so the DJIA can break 30k, he really doesn&#x27;t care. And he&#x27;s not the only one who thinks that way, which is why there&#x27;s so much FUD around public health measures.<p>If there were a rational government that would explain the situation and the necessary measures, I believe there would be a majority in favor of a lockdown. And in fact, this spring, an overwhelming majority of Americans did favor lockdown measures (around 80%). Since then, it&#x27;s become a highly partisan issue. Support among Democrats has remained high, but it&#x27;s plummeted among Republicans. I think Trump&#x27;s vocal opposition to public health measures had a lot to do with that. Even basic measures like wearing a mask are now partisan.')
