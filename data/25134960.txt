GP comment was arguing TKAM belongs in this category<p>FWIW, upon re-reading the entire thread above our posts, I don&#x27;t see the extreme stance you&#x27;re suggesting. &quot;There are a ton of books that are inappropriate for use in the classroom.&quot; is the closest I see, which <i>could</i> be seen as a call for a total and extreme ban, but that&#x27;s by no means the only way to read that comment.<p>&gt; You can give teachers the freedom to modify their curricula while still mandating that some books make it into the curriculum.<p>I don&#x27;t dispute this, but you can also give teachers the freedom to modify their curricula while mandating that some books don&#x27;t. In fact, my understanding is that for most curricula there won&#x27;t be much of a difference between the two. High school literature curricula are wide, not deep. I originally had a few paragraphs here going through all the stuff you have to touch on in a high school curriculum, but suffice to say that you want a decent balance of books across american literary periods, as well as contemporary literary subgenres (southern gothic vs. Western, plays vs. poetry). And you have maybe a year to do it. If you force someone to include a contemporary novel on race, they&#x27;ll probably have to exclude the <i>other</i> relatively contemporary novel on race.<p>&gt; do you really trust that teacher to move in the correct direction when given the freedom to select any other unbanned book?<p>I perceive the major issue as more apathy and effort (some combination of &quot;well I learned it this way and I&#x27;m fine&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;ve been teaching the same novel for 10 years, I don&#x27;t want to change my curriculum&quot;) more than like, overt racism on the part of teachers. Like I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s <i>some</i> of that, but I expect it&#x27;s not the whole of the problem.')
