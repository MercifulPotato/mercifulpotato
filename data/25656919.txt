Rates are kept artificially low by central banks due to all the debt that has been accumulated the last decades. We&#x27;re at the end of a long-term debt cycle.<p>It&#x27;s quite easy to see how artificially low interest rates are increasing social inequality.<p>Just look at house prices, the older generation who predominantly own houses have had their wealth inflated by increasing house prices and that has happened due to low rates.<p>Younger generations are often priced out of buying homes.<p><i>What if you assume that this state of affairs is strange because new, but perfectly benign, and will last indefinitely?</i><p>You mean this time it&#x27;s different?<p>The current setup is not sustainable. Debt is growing faster than income&#x2F;GDP all over the world (since before Covid).<p><i>In a long term regime of zero rates, more of society&#x27;s wealth is going to producers (and risk-takers), less is going to people who just hoard cash.</i><p>Savings is not &quot;hoarded cash&quot;. Saved money is usually put to productive use by banks loaning it out again to other people.<p>Money spent on real-estate on the other hand, is not put to productive use and does not meaningfully grow the economy.')
