I mean, authors did not even intended to change peoples minds and the only thing the game had going for it was the controversy. And even that controversy was possible only because it was during gamergate years, the same game would not gain notoriority today. Had there been no controversy,  you would not know the thing exists even (and you could buy that game, while not being on steam it was easily accessible).<p>And it is completely odd to have &quot;change the world&quot; expectations on art form that has very specific demographic as an interest, is super time consuming to interact with and have tendency to create own world isolated from the rest of world.<p>In any case, it sounds to me that what you want is the major power institution using art to make change to society from top down rather then individual artists experimenting and rebelling.')
