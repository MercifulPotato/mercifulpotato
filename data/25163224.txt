But that &quot;viable&quot; word is important.  A business as lean as SourceHut clearly feels like it&#x27;s in the start up phase, it doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s reached viability to me.<p>With just 2 software developers doing this work, I wonder what happens when one of the them is hit by the proverbial bus (goes out on parental leave, takes another job, etc).  Because that&#x27;s a thing that happens and is handled in real, viable companies.<p>And I&#x27;m guessing these software developers have some ownership stake in the company and are accepting below market salaries for now, in the hope that SourceHut becomes valuable enough to cash in that way.  But folks won&#x27;t stick around for below market pay forever, especially if it gets to a point where it looks like the big payday is never coming.')
