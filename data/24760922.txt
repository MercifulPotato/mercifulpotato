Whenever I visited, I would often experience the usual - cupboard doors flapping open or shut for no reason, cold bursts of air, lights flickering, you get it. I&#x27;m sure one could explain it perhaps with an environmental variable such as the temperature or wind or the levelling of the foundations. My female friends would actually experience these occurrences with more intensity compared to my male friends, along with regular nightmares (again, which could be explained by certain physiological or environmental factors). When I looked up the house&#x27; history, turns out one of the earlier inhabitants was a woman who died prematurely after her fianc√©, a British Raj veteran, died in India (which is where I&#x27;m from, maybe this is important). Couple all of that and you&#x27;ve got yourself a nice ghost myth.<p>I ended up selling the place later to a retiree couple, who haven&#x27;t faced any issues&#x2F; were too old to sense them&#x2F; were used to this stuff.')
