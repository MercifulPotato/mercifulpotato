No professional player would take you seriously. Sorry.<p>This is the heart of the problem. Wanting to factor out unnecessary work isn&#x27;t lazy. Refusing to change a system, even when that change is a clear improvement is lazy.<p>It&#x27;s pretty clear that neither you nor the average &quot;professional player&quot; is actually sorry about it. By definition, &quot;professional players&quot; have gone through the effort of learning muscle memory to play 144 scales. By definition, they are not motivated to promote a system where only learning 12 is required.<p>Defining someone who would like to see or implement an improved system as &quot;lazy&quot; is an effective way to stifle diversity.<p>Do you take Jimi Hendrix seriously? Is Jazz serious?<p>This attitude that worships tradition is stifling innovation. I would much rather we stopped taking it seriously.')
