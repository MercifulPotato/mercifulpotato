Despite such software being heavily used in industry, there&#x27;s a lot that is funded from a combination of public sources (e.g., a side-effect of federally-funded basic research by groups with deeply-held open source convictions) and volunteer effort. This could be improved by direct public funding or by tax incentives for companies that contribute to independently-governed open source projects. Either way, it takes legislators recognizing that open source infrastructure has sufficient value to create policy that helps sustain it.')
