Maybe companies that are already using slack won&#x27;t switch, but if you&#x27;re using chat, which is free, are the executives really going to decide that it&#x27;s worth paying to switch to slack? I think it&#x27;s unlikely. Hard to see where the market is other than startups that are already using slack. Slacks revenue is currently nowhere near enough for this valuation and I can&#x27;t see it getting where it needs to.')
