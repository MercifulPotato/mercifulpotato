This is a requirement for both self-hosted and cloud-hosted installations. In many cases, we will be able to offer both licences under the same commercial agreement. In some cases, a separate licence will need to be procured from Harman. Leaning Technologies can make the right introductions and facilitate the conversation with Harman.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;leaningtech&#x2F;cheerpx-for-flash-now-generally-available-a20bc2a5eea6" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;leaningtech&#x2F;cheerpx-for-flash-now-general...</a>')
