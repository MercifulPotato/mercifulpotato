Amazon is almost certainly way better than a local smaller type company paying less less benefits and so on.  They have modern warehouses not the crap that is typically out there. I have worked in my earlier years in one of those. Nobody is forced to work at Amazon it&#x27;s not the military where you are drafted. And you will always have a small amount of people saying they are driven to hard and outlier situations (bosses and supervisors). Nothing is perfect. Small about of people dissatisfied creates a large amount of noise.<p>&gt; Amazon will control distribution and supply.<p>Ok so this happens and then if they get &#x27;to big for their britches&#x27; it opens up for others to nip away at what they do (craigslist as an example maybe?).<p>&gt; That is not a future I want so I put up with the inconveniences of not support Amazon<p>Your choice of course. I don&#x27;t think of buying from Amazon as me &#x27;supporting&#x27; them. I think of it as being able to get what I need for a reasonable price and very convenient. There are things I can order that I can have later in the afternoon and no hassle returns. Very generally I mean sometimes things are wrong but generally as we all know and judging by the business they are getting they did build a better mousetrap.<p>Guess what? I know they will raise pricing and I don&#x27;t even care. I often pay them more just for the security of the ordering and convenience and certainty. Not everything is price price price.')
