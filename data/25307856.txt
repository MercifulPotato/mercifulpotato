My initial stack used Web Components instead of Alpine.js, but after one year trying to make it work (using lit-element) I&#x27;m battered, bruised and I declare Web Components a failed piece of technology [1].<p>Alpine is interesting, but not powerful enough for my use case, which is encapsulating common UI behaviours in reusable packages. Stimulus seem to be the missing ingredient in the mix for me. Any other suggestion for lightweight rich JS components that do not require one to buy into Vue, React or other &quot;full-stack&quot; JS libraries?<p>Also, I wholeheartedly recommend Unpoly as well, fits nicely in the PETAL stack.<p>1: shadow DOM isn&#x27;t great on your OWN components, styling isn&#x27;t fun paired with global CSS&#x2F;tailwind, dealing with properties&#x2F;attributes&#x2F;observables&#x2F;reactivity in general is an absolute pain in the buttocks, good luck wrapping an &lt;input&gt; in a web component.')
