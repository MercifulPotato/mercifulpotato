Then he goes and buys parts piecemeal from eBay and builds again...<p>I bought a Dell PowerEdge R610 w&#x2F; 48 GB of RAM, two quad-core CPUs, and two 146 GB 10K RPM drives for $229 on eBay about 3 or 4 years ago. That system still functions as my development server for testing today, and will likely have enough oomph to do the job for another year or two.<p>At which point I&#x27;ll buy a Dell PowerEdge R730 with 192 GB of RAM, dual 8-to-12 core CPUs, and a few SSDs for $500 or so... maybe even cheaper.<p>I asked a lot of questions from IT friends of mine who work in enterprise before I purchase any enterprise-grade gear, and I also watch a lot of Level1Techs (since Wendell likes to repurpose enterprise stuff for home use as well) to get new ideas for cool projects.<p>You go halfass into any domain without even bothering to ask the journeymen and experts and then post about it <i>on their own board &#x2F; subreddit</i>, yeah, you probably will get made fun of.')
