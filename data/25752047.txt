Leftists? And which communists are you concerned about (e.g. council communism? Autocratic communists? Stalinists? Maoists?)<p>Wheeling out &#x27;communism&#x27; without qualifying who your bogeyman is based in a very, very shallow understanding of history.<p>&gt; communism has killed, by some accounts, at least 65 million people during the last century.<p>Ok, but so has capitalism? Millions killed by lack of health care, capitalism fueled famines, wars over resources, pursuit of profit over quality, etc. It also ignores the massive genocides historically in capitalism.<p>Again, you are evaluating some very surface traits and not really looking at holistic systems. Your argument is a vague sound bite, but isn&#x27;t really an attempt to meaningfully engage with the topic.')
