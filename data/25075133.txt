Item(by='horsawlarway', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605215580, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25063733, text='I understand where you&#x27;re coming from, but I think your misapplying some of his advice.<p>Funnily enough, I&#x27;ve read Emotional Design, It&#x27;s been a long time (I think it was back in like 2006&#x2F;2007) but my memory is that most of the focus of the book was on the design of <i>physical</i> objects. I don&#x27;t really think website design has the same freedom.  It doesn&#x27;t invalidate all of his topics, but it certainly limits how they apply.<p>But there&#x27;s a different angle here that I&#x27;d ask you to consider - Over the last 20 years, websites are eating up interactions that used to be conversations.<p>You might have walked to a bank and talked to a teller - Now you use their website.<p>You might have driven to home depot and asked a store associate a question - now you shop online.<p>You might have gone to blockbuster and rented a movie from the clerk - Now you browse netflix.<p>You might have gone to the post office to get some mail - Now that content is in an email instead.<p>Each of those interactions was just a conversation, literally just sounds coming out of a mouth, but they all achieved useful side effects.  While you might have a pleasant chat every now and then, the <i>goal</i> was not reflective&#x2F;emotional investment.  The goal was the utility provided by the service.<p>I think approaching the design of a site with the goal of evoking an emotional or visceral reaction (ESPECIALLY from the literal appearance of the site) is actually turning the advice of the book on it&#x27;s head - Put the user first!<p>If I&#x27;m interacting with your site to achieve a useful side effect, whether that&#x27;s order an item, get the news, see my mail, deposit a check, watch a show, etc - Then my emotional reaction is heavily biased towards how well and how quickly I can achieve my goal.  My emotions don&#x27;t care a flying fuck whether your button is red&#x2F;blue&#x2F;green or if your gray is #d3d3d3 or #878787.  And I certainly don&#x27;t want to have to navigate a crazy custom design, just like I don&#x27;t want to hit a detour while driving home - even if it happens to be scenic.<p>I do care, a whole lot, about consistently easy to use services, with a low barrier to entry.  On the web, that mostly means boring boxes.<p>---<p>As a thought experiment, I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ve been to the DMV before (I&#x27;m not actually, you might not be US based, but you probably have an equivalent).<p>Ever had that DMV trip that took 3 hours waiting in line before finally getting seen?<p>Not happy were you?<p>Ever had that DMV trip where it was basically empty and you got seen immediately?<p>I bet you felt thrilled. (probably an overstatement, but at least pleasantly surprised)<p>It&#x27;s the same building, same carpets, floors, columns, windows, roof.  The only change was how quickly and efficiently you accomplished the goal you had.  But your emotional responses were miles apart.<p>Apply that to websites.  I don&#x27;t <i>want</i> to be looking at my bank&#x27;s website - I do it because I need to move money or use their services.  Make that the priority. Make it with boring, easy to use boxes, and I will love it.<p>Bury it in menus, or add 10 clicks because &quot;that page looks a little cramped&quot; and I will not be happy.')
