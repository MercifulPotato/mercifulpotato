(Instead of displacing it or sucking it out.) I bought one and have used it a few times but its primary effect seems to be making the bottle easier to fit into the fridge. I bought it for this purpose but I always drink the wine within a couple days anyway so I&#x27;m not sure how much it really slows the process.')
