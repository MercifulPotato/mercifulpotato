Maybe it didn&#x27;t work for you in the past, is this still the case?<p>I mean, you have taken a perfectly usable system and decided to wipe and reinstall from scratch. That&#x27;s not a normal user experience.<p>Most users are NOT going to wipe a brand new machine. Should anything break, they will reinstall from a Time Machine backup.<p>Or, worst case, they will Command + R on boot and reinstall from remote recovery. Why isn&#x27;t that an option?<p>This can hardly be blamed on Apple. Before messing with the system, one should be prepared to spend time bringing it back up, including any mistakes made along the way. Last time I wiped a Windows 10 machine I had even more problems than that - made worse because Windows recovery is borderline useless (and can&#x27;t install the OS from the internet). But hey, I knew what I was signing up for.')
