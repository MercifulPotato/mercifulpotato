You can&#x27;t trust a chip to run a piece of code to introspect on itself; instead a more reliable characterization of a chip may come from examining how it fails when you throw it stuff that is out-of-spec.<p>For example, glitching the clock may lead to a repeatable behavior that could only be produced if no additional circuitry has been added to the critical path that leads to the glitch.')
