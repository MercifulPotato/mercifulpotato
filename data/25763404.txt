It&#x27;s just not necessary to be as big as it is.<p>Dropbox still has the best sync technology by far, however they failed to really capitalize on a single market. The consumer side cares more about value and it&#x27;s hard to compete with Microsoft&#x2F;Apple&#x2F;Google while the business side is already well-served by Box.com.<p>I still think there&#x27;s a good opportunity if they can build on storage to create applications like Asana&#x2F;Airtable&#x2F;Notion&#x2F;Slack but that seems to have failed with the Paper experiment and the strange &quot;dropbox&quot; app window that opens instead of a file explorer.')
