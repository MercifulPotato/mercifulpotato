Or the next government can if they don&#x27;t like my tax laws? Or charge MPs for libel or slander for saying their opinion about something? What if homosexuality is illegal and I say it should be legal, can I be charged then?<p>These laws exist for a reason. And just because Trump is Trump doesn&#x27;t mean it doesn&#x27;t work well most of the time. Remember this is the same man chanting &quot;lock her up&quot; and promised to change libel laws so he could sue everyone and their mother. Do you think he wouldn&#x27;t have gone after elected officials with lawsuits?<p>And for most countries these laws are very far from absolute, and&#x2F;or come with escape hatches.')
