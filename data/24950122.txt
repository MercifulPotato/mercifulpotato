The result in TFA breaks the entanglement between the Hawking pair, allowing the outgoing particles to encode the black hole&#x27;s information.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=_8bhtEgB8Mo" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=_8bhtEgB8Mo</a>')
