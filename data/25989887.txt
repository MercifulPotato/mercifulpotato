We’re hiring for a number of roles, like Senior iOS Engineer, Senior Android Engineer, Engineering Manager, and Back End Engineer. Our goal is to make access to primary care as easy as googling something, without needing to make a financial tradeoff. We were seeing exciting growth before COVID-19 and that growth has accelerated even more as we help support the response to this global pandemic in the US. Some quick mentions of the technology we’re using: all our infra is in AWS, IaC using CDK (and some Terraform), Typescript, Kotlin, DynamoDB, and PostgreSQL. We are offering roles as REMOTE or ONSITE. Remote must be based in the US. Onsite is in Seattle. Looking forward to hearing from you!<p>Recent press about our team:\n* <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thestreet.com&#x2F;investing&#x2F;walmart-sams-club-teams-up-with-telehealth-startup-98point6" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thestreet.com&#x2F;investing&#x2F;walmart-sams-club-teams-...</a>\n* <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.geekwire.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;virtual-primary-care-startup-98point6-raises-118m-pandemic-sparks-demand-digital-health-tech&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.geekwire.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;virtual-primary-care-startup-9...</a>\n* <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wsj.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;investors-bankroll-virtual-care-startup-98point6-with-118-million-11602761401" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wsj.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;investors-bankroll-virtual-care...</a>')
