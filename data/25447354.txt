I have a few questions for you if you donâ€™t mind.<p>A) In an environment where banks can lend every penny they have, is there a way to see how much of the money outstanding is loan money and vs how much is hard money? With a 10% reserve ratio, the theoretical max was $10 of loan money for every $1 of hard money. Therefore the ratio could be as high as 10:1.<p>2) What would happen if some banks wound up having -10% assets in reserve after a few defaults?')
