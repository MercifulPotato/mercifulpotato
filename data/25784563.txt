I&#x27;m a PhD student in CS and over the holiday break I finally sat down and wrote a book that&#x27;s been in my head for months.<p>The title is &#x27;Everyday Data Science&#x27; and it&#x27;s a collection of stories, methods, and tutorials on how to use statistical methods in your day-to-day.<p>It&#x27;s fun, about 100 pages long, and almost done at the editor.<p>I&#x27;ll launch in the next few weeks on Amazon and I&#x27;m pretty excited.')
