Systemd is great when it works. But, part of the value of the Unix philosophy is resiliency in the face of errors.<p>When my void Linux &#x2F; alpine Linux systems have internal failures, I can troubleshoot and solve them because the system is composed of minimal abstractions tied together - I can feasibly deduce the root of the problem, and fix it, even if half the OS is missing.<p>With systemd, it&#x27;s one big mess. Problems are far more opaque, and the pieces are far more interdependent: it&#x27;s easier to wipe and start over, thereby treating the os as a black box, than to dig in and find the problem.<p>I avoid systemd systems wherever I need to do anything with the os itself that isn&#x27;t extremely ordinary.')
