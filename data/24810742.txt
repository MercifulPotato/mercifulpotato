It&#x27;s out of reach for a lot of organizations and requires a substantial amount of organizational coding discipline.<p>It&#x27;s like the old saw that gets trotted out about C and C++; you <i>can</i> write safe code in any language if you&#x27;re disciplined about it.  The point of safe languages is to make it easy and accessible to write safe code; to design into the language a &quot;pit of success&quot; rather than requiring a big slog to make a flawed language usable.')
