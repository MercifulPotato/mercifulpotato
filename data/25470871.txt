There are plenty of perverse incentives to arrest people on trumped-up charges. Here&#x27;s an article about the war on drugs in Yunnan: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;madeinchinajournal.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;10&#x2F;25&#x2F;punish-and-cure%ef%bb%bf-forced-detox-camps-reeducation-through-labour-and-the-contradictions-of-chinas-war-on-drugs&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;madeinchinajournal.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;10&#x2F;25&#x2F;punish-and-cure%ef...</a> illustrating how the police are incentivized to polish their arrest quota, of drug addicts in that case. It&#x27;s unlikely that police in Xinjiang are acting with any more precision and accountability in the war on terror than their colleagues in Yunnan in the war on drugs.<p>&gt; What happened to your lies of genocide?<p>It&#x27;s also possible that the person you&#x27;re replying to never believed in the &quot;genocide&quot; story, but nonetheless thinks that arresting thousands of people based on mere suspicion of terrorism is unjust and unnecessary. Not everyone sorts neatly into one of two factions.')
