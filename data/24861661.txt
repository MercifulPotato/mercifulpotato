Item(by='TheDong', descendants=None, kids=[24862511], score=None, time=1603392019, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24861483, text='&gt; If you buy 100,000 shares of AMZN today, do you hope that IRS will come knocking on your door to take 1,000 or whatever number it is each year?<p>Yes, I would expect that if I had 100k shares of amzn (300 million dollars of net worth), and we implemented a wealth tax, the IRS would tell me &quot;You have to pay us $300k or so&quot; each year on that wealth. If that means I sell some stock, then sure. That means, btw, if I live 60 more years and gain zero more dollars of wealth, I still have 280 million dollars left of my original 300 mil. I still have plenty of shares left.<p>You clearly don&#x27;t understand the point of a wealth tax or how the rate rises progressively with wealth it is if you don&#x27;t understand why we&#x27;d be taxing ownership of wealth, and why this wouldn&#x27;t negatively impact most people.<p>&gt; If that is the case no one would ever buy any shares of any company...<p>I currently don&#x27;t have over 50M of net worth. A wealth tax would not impact me, so I&#x27;d still buy stock just as I do now, with no difference. If my stocks did so well that I had millions of dollars, I&#x27;d now be able to pay a wealth tax, and have on problem with that.\nI&#x27;d also keep buying stocks if they got me from a net worth of almost nothing to $50M, and all I had to do was pay a small percentage each year along the way.')
