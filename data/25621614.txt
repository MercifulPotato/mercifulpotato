The same effect is possible with dual rail channels using two\nwires per bit, or even fewer on average using Sperner codes and the\nlike.<p>&gt; computations go as fast as they can<p>Although asynchronous circuits might not have to wait for a clock,\nthey do have to wait for handshake completion detection in various\nforms. It&#x27;s more like a trade-off than a free lunch.')
