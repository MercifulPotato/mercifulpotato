It is a cause you can sue people for. That also means it requires evidence and convincing a judge and possibly a jury. Again, there is a due process. It&#x27;s not at the whim of a corporation. It also requires real damages such as a negative impact to someone&#x27;s career, not just hurt feelings.<p>That&#x27;s the case with all of the exceptions to free speech: there is a tangible, real world impact such as loss of income or risk of physical harm. &quot;Feeling demeaned&quot; is none of those things and is something that anyone can claim about anything. How you feel about something is also a choice. You can choose whether or not to let speech affect you like that.')
