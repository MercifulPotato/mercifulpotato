What I&#x27;m seeing from most media outlets are not claims that it didn&#x27;t or couldn&#x27;t occur, but simply that Trump is making the accusation without any evidence.  Add to that the fact that he&#x27;s been claiming fraud before the election even started, and it&#x27;s pretty clear this was his strategy all along to cast doubt on an election he expected to lose (just like in 2016).')
