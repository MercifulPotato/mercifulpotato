Like other said, k3s consume ~500mb of ram, so keep that in mind that if your vps has small amount of ram. Idle cpu usage is pretty small though, I only see ~5% or less on my small vps. Don&#x27;t use traefik because the documentation sucks for now, v1 and v2 has different configuration and google often return results for v1, making things harder.')
