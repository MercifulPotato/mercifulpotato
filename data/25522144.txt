I always see people trying to nail down a meaning but it always seems to little effect in day to day discourse.<p>I’m a fan of letting context infer meaning. And letting certain words just naturally grow to whatever the culture wants it to. It’s always hard to fight back against it.<p>There’s a million examples of this on the internet where people try to be pedantic about slang or word usage. All that matters is “we know what you mean”.
