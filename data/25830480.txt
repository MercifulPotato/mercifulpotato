I never said that. You as a patient would in fact be much more empowered to negotiate with those who provide you services, since you would actually know the actual costs available in the market.<p>However, if your point is that the current system would also be improved by the tiny change of allowing medicare to negotiate prices without any of my other ideal changes, then yes I agree that would be a change for the better.')
