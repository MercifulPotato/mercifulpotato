It&#x27;s from an article about a lifelong artist that never quite &quot;made it&quot; and I think it is a good answer to the question.<p><i>Compare him to Picasso. Picasso never said &quot;I had to pay the rent.&quot; He never considered earning money with anything other than painting. When he had no money he lived in friends&#x27; apartments. He faced and accepted poverty and hunger. Picasso did not compromise. Same with Van Gogh. Paintings on their own have no value. Buyers pay for the life story of the painters. The more heroic is your life the more expensive your paintings. Painter&#x27;s job is to market himself in order to create a life mythology. This guy just painted. He did not create a myth around his life.</i><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=16092168" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=16092168</a>')
