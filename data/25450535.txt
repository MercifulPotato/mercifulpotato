It doesn&#x27;t say.<p><i>False claims that COVID-19 is not real or not serious, and therefore that vaccinations are unnecessary</i><p>Given that &quot;serious&quot; and &quot;necessary&quot; are totally undefined here, this amounts to enforced and mandated panic. What does serious mean? Serious relative to what? What does necessary mean? Necessary for who? People who already had COVID and recovered? It&#x27;s certainly not necessary for them, not that it seems governments will care.<p>COVID-19 is serious in some ways, but is objectively not &quot;serious&quot; compared to the initial incorrect modelling by epidemiologists. Anyone can look at the data from places that didn&#x27;t lock down to see that predictions of huge death rates were wrong. Their claims about the level of seriousness were false yet they were allowed to spread them all over Twitter, the media and the world.<p>The establishment could not find a better or faster way to destroy people&#x27;s confidence in science than this. Literally make claims that everyone can see with their own eyes are not true, then ban anyone from disagreeing. Academics are not smart enough to deserve this kind of protection.')
