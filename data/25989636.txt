A lot of HTML templates just include &#x27;lang=&quot;en&quot;&#x27;, and developers rarely notice that, even if their website is in another language.<p>I find Gemini pretty accessible overall. There are no images, so including alt descriptions isn&#x27;t even a concern. There&#x27;s no CSS, so you can&#x27;t make controls that visually look like check boxes, but are much less accessible. In fact, it&#x27;s way harder to make an inaccessible Gemini site than to make an inaccessible website. The only gripe I have is the possibility to introduce ASCII diagrams, which usually aren&#x27;t accessible.')
