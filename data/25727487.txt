Cheap laptops of the day had a lot of tolerance for the housing that lead into the port so if your weekend misangled you&#x27;d fit it pass the chassis but hit the edges of the PCB recepticle. I think new decides tend to have a rounded lip or some mating feature between the chassis and the PCB mounted recepticle so it&#x27;s less of an issue. Higher end models often only have the tongue as part of the PCB leaving the outer bit to the chassis.')
