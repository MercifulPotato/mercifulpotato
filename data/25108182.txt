It is very interesting in terms of describing walls you hit at various code sizes, and it matches my experience. I&#x27;ve been thinking in similar ways, although in &quot;complexity&quot; rather than lines of code.<p>I think the whole &quot;10×&quot; programmer debate makes more sense when considered in context of Norris Numbers. If the task is on one side of the complexity wall, both programmers perform roughly the same. But if the task is on the other side, one programmer will flounder around while the other will succeed, resulting in the fabled 10× performance.')
