So I make more refined “products”. One that I’ve turned into a side business is making highly crafted wordclocks[0]. I’ve only sold a few, but enough to cover the cost of a cnc and other tools for my tinkering. Check my profile for link to my show HN from a while ago.<p>It’s since expanded to Etsy as well where I sell products based on gifts I’ve designed with my kids for their friends birthday parties[1].
