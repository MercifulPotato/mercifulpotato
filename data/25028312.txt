Why is it implied that her music is of lower quality that niche artists?<p>Well first of all, it&#x27;s illegal. Spotify&#x27;s TOS disallows you to play your 9,99 subscription for an audience of more than a usual household amount of people. If you&#x27;re entertaining a dozen guests or more 365 days a year and for commercial purposes, your part should be quite a bit more than ten bucks a month.<p>And so I get that people are unhappy that <i>their</i> individual subscription money goes to the entertainment of restaurant guests, background noise for a workplace, etc. because of the way plays are counted.<p>&gt; to each [her] own - and this is why niche artists are &quot;niche&quot;<p>Sure, I&#x27;m not saying that we should pay all artists equally right? Not like anyone above a certain (low) threshold of monthly playbacks should earn a minimum wage to support the niche ones. No, what people mind is that the money they pay to listen to artist B is instead sent to artist A due to a side effect of the revenue distribution model.<p>Artist A gets more playbacks not because they are better but because of, so to say, a runaway effect of being popular. Those popular artists would already earn enough if this distribution model would be on an individual user basis, but the current distribution system causes even less money to go to niche artists despite having plenty of fans listening to them. It makes it harder to earn money with niche music, which would be a negative effect on what I think you value as well: each can have their own.<p>Spotify doesn&#x27;t seem to support your favorite artists as well as you might expect from paying for Spotify and knowing that the money goes to the artists behind the tracks you play.<p>&gt; The truck does it all for everyone.<p>Erm looking that &quot;F150&quot; up on image search (I don&#x27;t speak car and driver), it looks like a huge asshole car. If everyone would drive that we might as well pick up and leave this planet. Also I don&#x27;t get what the comparison is trying to tell me.')
