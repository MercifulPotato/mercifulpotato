I do not engage in politics unless it&#x27;s a minimum-effort activity like the default mail-in voting (WA). Sure, I may know approximately what the best way to organize society is, and if aliens landed and put me in charge I&#x27;d become political; but as it is, I do not care, mostly because it&#x27;s not productive, but in no small part because actively caring about how to organize society is heavily correlated with being very wrong (IMHO).')
