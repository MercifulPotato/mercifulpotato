And then to peek through the abstraction you suddenly not only need to know about DNS and which machine is running bind, but also how kubernetes internally stores it&#x27;s DNS config and how it spits that out and what version they changed it with.<p>In other words you have to become expect in two things to debug it.<p>And maybe it&#x27;s worth it - but I struggle to see why it&#x27;s not simpler to keep my install scripts going.<p>(OK I guess I am writing my own answer - but surely the point is what is the simplest level of thin install scripts needed to deploy containers?)')
