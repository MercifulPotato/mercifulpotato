Building UIs felt more like writing Verilog than writing functions. Nothing like chasing event ordering bugs through library components. With React I never saw &#x27;enqueue a new event for component X&#x27; anti-pattern. All callbacks flow from children to parents in a fairly regular manner.<p>* Related, there is no need to manually manage repaint events in React. Visual updates happen automagically. See, for example, <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;952906&#x2F;how-do-i-call-paint-event" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;952906&#x2F;how-do-i-call-pai...</a> for a hair pulling session related to manual repainting.<p>* On the ergonomics side, having a markup language allows for terse but readable definitions of component trees. I see 2020 Qt has introduced a markup language, this was not the case circa 2005.<p>* Hooks give an extra layer of niceness. Declaring a component is as easy as declaring a function. Local state becomes almost as simple as declaring a local variable.<p>* The inspector capabilities of modern browsers are very handy when debugging layout and styling issues.')
