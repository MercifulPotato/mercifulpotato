I agree w&#x2F; you though that it&#x27;s not a strong argument, and that you can do the same thing in C++; it&#x27;s a confusing&#x2F;arguably incorrect point IMO.<p>More broadly, this is kind of a bad example. Handling files is surprisingly difficult and that&#x27;s really where the dragons lie here. IME the dragons exist for both Rust and C++, because they&#x27;re platform problems rather than stdlib&#x2F;language problems.<p>NB: the correct thing to do here for POSIX platforms is to call fstat, which is true regardless of systems language.')
