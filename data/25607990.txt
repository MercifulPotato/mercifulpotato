Assigned seats, attendance taken, etc. Don&#x27;t recall if bathroom trips needed permission as I always handled that before class started.<p>Math and science classes were generally much more informal. Class met at a specified time and place, and nobody paid much attention to who was there or not. I would occasionally sit in on other classes I was considering taking, to see if I liked the instructor.')
