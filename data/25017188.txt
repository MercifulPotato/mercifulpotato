If the startup pays the fee, then the VC funds the startup and the startup writes a check. If the VC pays the fee, then the VC will negotiate a slightly different deal for the same amount of equity. VCs prefer the first option because they can show lower operating costs to their fund investors. Some startup founders prefer the second option because they don&#x27;t like the appearance of paying for someone else&#x27;s legal costs. In both cases the costs of the deal are borne by the deal participants; the question is merely which company&#x27;s financial statements show the costs.')
