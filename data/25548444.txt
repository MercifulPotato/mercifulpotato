And if, before differential car axles were invented, anyone tried solving the same problem by driving two wheels with separate engines?<p>With modern electric vehicles that lack a transmission, having a separate motor for each drive wheel seems like a reasonable thing to do now.  I assume someone&#x27;s already built such a thing; the Cybertruck is planned to have a 3-motor variant, though I don&#x27;t know if two of the motors will share a differential or if they&#x27;ll just each go to a separate drive wheel.  Also the Rivian might have separate motors per wheel, I&#x27;m not sure.')
