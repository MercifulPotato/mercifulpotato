Months later, I got it. If I would have been remote that day I would have never heard about it as stuff like new projects and new customers is pretty hush-hush until the ink dries on the contract so they&#x27;re never written about in public slack channels until then, but then it&#x27;s usually too late to call dibs as the pieces are already in motion.<p>Not to mention, you can&#x27;t really move far away from the office either since you could at any time be expected to show up in the office for $IMPORTANT_MEETING.')
