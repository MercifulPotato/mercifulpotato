And this is a very good question because\nsomething that is coming up a lot more now. Increasingly I\nam getting messages from people building new Tree Notation\nlibraries in different host languages. The problem is people\nquickly get the basic structure done (pretty much just\nnested spreadsheets), and then are like &quot;okay what next?\nhow do I add support for the higher level tree languages&quot;.\nSo that is becoming the top priority to figure out. Do we\nmake a universal Grammar language that then is implemented\nin all host targets (JS, C, C#, Kotlin, Swift, GoLang,\nJava, Closure, Haskell, Python, etc) so that people can\ndefine a language (or &quot;protocol&quot;) in this Grammar language\nand then generate get parsers&#x2F;compilers in any of those\ncommunity supported host languages? That seems like a likely\npath, but a lot to figure out there.<p>&gt; I have always felt like web assembly was missing a\nwell-defined system for extending the API and also a\nstrong external module system.<p>I agree! I&#x27;ve been wanting to write a Grammar for a simple\nTree Language that compiles to WASM for years but just\nhaven&#x27;t found the time \n(<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;treenotation&#x2F;research&#x2F;issues&#x2F;7" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;treenotation&#x2F;research&#x2F;issues&#x2F;7</a>).<p>If anyone wants to explore that space, happy to help!')
