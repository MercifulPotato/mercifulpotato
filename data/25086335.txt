Admittedly that&#x27;s very probably a feature used by few people (although I know that for all of the people that use it, it is because of some very obscure track they are very attached to and can only listen to if they upload it, making it a must have feature).<p>And more generally, while I don&#x27;t necessarily mind a rebrand (although I have to admit that this being Google, I have my suspicions that this will be handled the same way they handle all their messaging services) and I can be forgiving for a v1, this is still so far below play music that I don&#x27;t really see myself using it.')
