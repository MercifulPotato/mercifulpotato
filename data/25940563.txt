Windows 7 and before definitely didn&#x27;t make it obvious how to make a window half a screen, Windows 10 makes it a bit more obvious I think, but you&#x27;re still limited to 2 windows side by side. Ubuntu&#x27;s default window manager has the same behaviour as W7 and Lubuntu&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t have keybindings for this by default at all.<p>You can of course resize windows manually but it&#x27;s tedious compared to a 2 button shortcut, especially having to hunt the 3 pixel wide resize button with wrist issues.')
