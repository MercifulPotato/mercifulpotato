I kept using it for some things until earlier this year for work, and the update woes were still present, albeit smaller than in the past (maybe that&#x27;s a Fedora-specific thing?). It&#x27;s quite possible that even for a primary desktop the situation is better than it was in 2006, but at least for my use cases I&#x27;m at this point in &quot;it ain&#x27;t broken, don&#x27;t spend time to fix it&quot; territory wrt my OS.  If that changes and there are things I want to do that macOS doesn&#x27;t let me do, I will of course start looking at other options.<p>&gt; I think last time we lost the ability to even run 32-bit apps...<p>Indeed, and for some people that&#x27;s a deal-breaker.  For me specifically it was a non-issue; everything I use had long ago upgraded to 64-bit.  I had to install a newer version of DOSBox than I had before; that&#x27;s it.<p>Again, this is not going to be everyone&#x27;s experience!<p>Upshot: I&#x27;m glad we have the various options we have right now, since it&#x27;s pretty clear that different people experience them very differently and value different tradeoffs.  I would be very sad if any of them disappeared.')
