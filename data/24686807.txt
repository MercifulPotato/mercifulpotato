Item(by='SXX', descendants=None, kids=[24687224], score=None, time=1601898831, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24686698, text='I guess It&#x27;s my development culture is flawed, but as one-man-team I always time constrained. So I sometimes don&#x27;t have sufficient time to write too detailed commit messages.<p>So I end up with &quot;one commit per feature&quot; rather than &quot;one commit per logical change&quot;. So I actively using squash during interactive rebase when I prepare to merge completed branch since my commit history sometimes looks like this:<p><pre><code>   Backend: new set of APIs for XYZ\n   Backend: implement feature X (+ some long comment)\n   Frontend: implement feature X\n   fix for feature backend\n   fix for backend API XYZ\n   front fix\n   backend fix\n</code></pre>\nYeah again I know I could do better, but yeah I use squashing for this reason. A lot.')
