I do think anyone can gain that body awareness though, it&#x27;s not just for those that have been athletic all their lives. I didn&#x27;t come to having a physical exercise practice until my early 30s and the amount of internal body awareness I&#x27;ve gained in the past few years has been amazing. It really deepened my seated meditation practice as well.<p>Yoga definitely is great and I practice asana 5x per week. I will say that my injury came up during an asana class, though, and it wasn&#x27;t until I really targeted my weak scapular muscle groups that it got better.')
