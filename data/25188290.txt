I&#x27;m accepting the &quot;hospitals are not overrun&quot; observation, which is very hard to cover-up. I happen to know someone working in a Beijing hospital and it is not overrun. How else would you explain that except to say that there is minimal community transmission?  The only other possibility is a country-wide refusal to hospitalize patients, which seems equally difficult to cover-up. Otherwise the cover-up could only ever be briefly temporary until the spread was rampant again.')
