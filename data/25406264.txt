Item(by='tombrossman', descendants=None, kids=[25417795], score=None, time=1607864268, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25405821, text='&quot;A friend&quot; drove a (non-UK reg) car from Glasgow to Southampton last year, significantly exceeding the speed limit most of the way and maintaining &gt;90mph for multiple hours, and wondered if speeding tickets would later arrive in the post. Nothing ever happened. I can only guess that speed camera tickets are only sent to UK registered vehicles? That&#x27;s a pretty big loophole.<p>I don&#x27;t drive like this in France, they will stop you and my understanding is you must pay the fine on the spot or they arrest you and tow your car.')
