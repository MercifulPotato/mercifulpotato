There are even templates for sale to get you started too. Choose something familiar language wise. I’d try to avoid JS frameworks if you are not used to web dev.

Use bootstrap - I am recommending because it will have the most documentation and stack overflow coverage which is what you’ll need as a newcomer who wants to get something done quickly. Consider hiring for odd jobs where you are stuck.')
