Especially if you&#x27;re doing commercial shopping and need stuff to actually idk maybe do what it says and not be counterfeit.<p>I know i know they seem like a dinosaur, their catalog is a disaster and  it seems impossible to find a real price. Thats all true, but theres a reason they obfuscate themselves. They’re a walled garden but once you&#x27;re in its living in the future where this whole amazon problem has already been solved going on decades now!!! Its kinda like walmart to sams or target to costco. But grainger isnt owned by amazon, theyre direct competition and I’d wager if the hn crowd had our way and put consumer pressure on them to expand their market and made them know of our capabilities in helping them expand that vision, that grainger would pivot in a heartbeat to be more common consumer friendly. ... and then maybe we could have a little bit of peace.<p>But seriously their worth checking out.')
