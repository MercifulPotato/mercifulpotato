It&#x27;s like saying &quot;you shalt not think of a white monkey&quot; - and you will. The goal should be not to make people feel bad for failing yet again to be free of biases - the goal is to learn to detect them and work around them. You cannot make people fly by flapping their hands - but you can build tools that let people fly while they are sitting comfortably in their chairs. There should also be tools and processes built that allow even biased people to arrive to a correct conclusion, without demanding the impossible from them.')
