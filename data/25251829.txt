Diets like these are usually more psychology than science. What science teaches us that the human body is remarkably resilient at survival and it doesn&#x27;t say much about lifestyle. What this guy wants to do doesn&#x27;t sound all that different from the bread&#x2F;potato&#x2F;rice diets most humans subsisted on until the twentieth century. So probably harmless. I believe in encouraging people who want to make positive changes in their life. There&#x27;s also YouTube videos of others who&#x27;ve apparently had success changing their lifestyle by potato dieting.')
