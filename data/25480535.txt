The PPE part seems to show &quot;We can&#x27;t trust the public, so we should lie to them.&quot; It&#x27;s an ends-justify-the-means position, which is a dangerous mindset in someone who influences public policy.<p>If it were just &quot;a few missteps&quot; that&#x27;s one thing. Making the wrong call under uncertainty in a dynamically changing situation is excusable. Having the (lack of) ethics to think the appropriate response is to lie to the public is much less so.')
