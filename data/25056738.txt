This brings me back to my teen years when we would bike over the border (NL-&gt;BE) to get fireworks in Li√®ge. Those people sold everything that was illegal in the Netherlands and sold it all to us kids, too.<p>We would cut them open and use the powders to create larger and strung together bombs to blow up everything we could find from post boxes to old TVs to some cabinets we found on the streets.<p>Some off duty fireman found us and forced us to tell him were we lived. I can still feel his hand pinching on my ear as he dragged me back home to my parents.')
