Then I did miss the point.<p>I do think it&#x27;s benefited other nations, but -- getting more into personal opinion -- I also think the &quot;help other nations&quot; argument is mostly used to justify cheapening wages. If companies were paying foreign workers the same rates that they would have paid US workers I&#x27;d be more empathetic to the argument. But something about the fact that the top 90th percentile of Americans has seen huge gains in the last 40 years, while the middle to bottom percentile has seen neutral or losses [1] raises flags to me that the push towards globalization was selfishly motivated. I know it&#x27;s a huge inference to say the stagnating wages are caused by globalization, but realistically I would say it&#x27;s the combination of outsourced labor&#x2F;manufacturing, immigration, rise of women in the workforce, rise of minorities in the workforce, and automation. Most of these are positive changes, but I still think the average blue collar worker suffered a cost that the hyper-wealthy elite did not, so at the moment I don&#x27;t see the push for globalization as a very selfless initiative.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fas.org&#x2F;sgp&#x2F;crs&#x2F;misc&#x2F;R45090.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fas.org&#x2F;sgp&#x2F;crs&#x2F;misc&#x2F;R45090.pdf</a>')
