These are tools.  Does the tool do what I want with the least amount of friction?  That’s what they care about.<p>Also how does Apples stance on one product in any way change the device you are using to post in any way?  Are Apple thugs coming to your house destroying non-Apple tech?  Of course not!<p>It always amuses me how Apple can simultaneously be irrelevant due to their market share and also be the greatest threat to open computing by their temerity at daring to have different computing models.<p>If you don’t like their computing model then don’t use it. Railing that they aren’t supporting your vision lockstep is pretty freaking arrogant.<p>Their market position is strong because they provide value that people desire. The market is not a zero sum game.   Apples mere existence does diminish your computing experience.  Indeed Apples existence and continually pushing computing in new areas has benefited everyone in the last 40 years - whether you use Apple or not.  Just think where computing would be of the attitude that you were only a real computer user if you assembled it - at the component to board level, not just bolting pre-mad parts to a pre-made case - persisted?  People criticized Apple for selling complete computers with the Apple II.<p>Your complaint isn’t that different.')
