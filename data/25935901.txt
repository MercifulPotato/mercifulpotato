Or do you have to double check every query before you run it?<p>Isn&#x27;t that the same for your new coworker Bob over in that corner of the room? Sure, his &quot;failure modes&quot; might look different, but how can you tell whether someone (or some<i>thing</i>) &quot;understands&quot; what you want to query? And how can you be sure they got it right if you don&#x27;t double check?<p>In my eyes GPT-3 is akin to a freshly hired grad that can&#x27;t operate google (so you have to send him some related stackoverflow examples for his task). You can&#x27;t trust that the result is right in either case, but both might bring pretty decent domain knowledge and - when given work accordingly - could save you time in the end.')
