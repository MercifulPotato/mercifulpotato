The transit system was excellent and accommodated people carrying groceries quite easily. In cases when I had to lug something heavy, I would just grab a taxi. I&#x27;ve never needed a car in that city yet and the one time I did show up with a rental car for a short visit, trying to deal with parking the darn thing was a flaming headache that almost ruined the trip (Old Port fortunately had good, albeit expensive, parking.)')
