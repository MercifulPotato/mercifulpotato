I explained my own morals, and why I&#x27;m comfortable encouraging people to blame the wealthy for the harms they perpetuate. Could you please elaborate on how you think this reply is relevant to that?<p>As slow as it seems to be, my perception is that societal attitudes towards wealth have been shifting over the past few decades.
