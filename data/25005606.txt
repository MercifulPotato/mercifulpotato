Like less trust from the state in how you use your own money, and less power to decide over what to do with the money you&#x27;ve earned from your own hard work. Instead you are forced to trust that the government is better at allocating that money than a private company.<p>You effectively get no choice in the matter either, except every fourth year. And that isn&#x27;t even a real choice, because you&#x27;re not choosing a better medical company, or a better insurance deal against joblessness when you vote. Instead you&#x27;re hoping that more than 50% of the people who are eligible to vote in your country, will agree with you that the medical deal or accident insurance (and a whole swathe of other stuff, take it or leave it) offered by some politician that you like, is also liked by them. If not, then you&#x27;re <i>forced</i> to take whatever the people—who do not have your own best interest at heart—wants instead, because they just happen to be in the majority. On top of that, you&#x27;re supposed to celebrate it, and thank the guys who forced you to accept what you&#x27;d rather not have. That&#x27;s what&#x27;s known as a <i>democracy,</i> and somehow you&#x27;re supposed to think that <i>that</i> is the pinnacle of &quot;freedom&quot;...')
