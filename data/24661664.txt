Race discrimination is when you are treated differently because of your race.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;equalityhumanrights.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;advice-and-guidance&#x2F;race-discrimination" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;equalityhumanrights.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;advice-and-guidance&#x2F;race-...</a><p>Skin color is not the reason of a certain person to have certain ability, or certain moral standard.<p>&quot;Aboriginal people just commit more crime.&quot; is a factual statement about how many aboriginal people committing crime. It could be true or false. If the statement is &quot;Aboriginal people just commit more crime, because they are aboriginal&quot;, then it is racist because it draws a causal relationship of race and crime rate which is completely false.<p>Nowadays, from a statement of &quot;Aboriginal people just commit more crime.&quot;, someone can see through the proposer&#x27;s mind to assume he has stereotype impression on aboriginal people and inside his&#x2F;her mind, the proposer thinks because of people&#x27;s skin color, they will just magically commit more crime. So, it is concluded that the proposer is racist. This is thought crime, and law should assume people is innocent until proven in case of criminal law.<p>It is really bad, because it does not let people to lay out the data based on race, and therefore cannot solve the real problem behind it. Why a specific race would commit more crime in a country? There must be a reason behind it. Maybe only one community with majority of a specific race committing most of the crime, and other communities of that race are completely normal. Then you have to further find the reason why that community committing so many crime etc.<p>However, the left in America does not think like that. They just get a aggregate data of the country and lay out many disadvantage of certain race facing, and so it can justify minority group to victimize themselves.<p>A term systematic racism is coined. If there is no equal outcome for each race then the society is racist. No active actors of racist is involved. The system itself is designed which cause non equal outcome among races and therefore must be overthrown and replaced with a non racist system.<p>The whole idea is just giving up thinking analytically about the root cause of non equal outcome and blame it all to the society. If there is not enough educational resource because the state is consist of mainly poor blacks, then just let the rich state to subsidize the poor state. Rejecting better grade non-black is just solving the problem by a racist measure which is not moral. And it is also racist against the black because it implied black are just dumber, and I find it strange for black to accept that. No, because they are poor and does not have enough educational resource.<p>I think the America left is so irrational that it starts to be very similar to Soviet Union style of thinking.<p>PS: Not-White. Just a observation from other race outside America.')
