Even a single person&#x27;s faculties (vision, cognition, focus) change drastically over longer periods of time, or when they&#x27;re tired, sick, or worse (drunk). Machines at least have standardized hardware with self-test protocols and onboard diagnostics. There are innumerable scenarios in which machines have no good solution yet, but I suspect over time the heuristics will reach a threshold of &quot;good enough for public use.&quot;')
