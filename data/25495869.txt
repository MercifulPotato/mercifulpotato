In a Rails app that was written consistently with the styles and APIs documented in the Rails docs I have never been more productive. In other micro-framework type environments, regardless of the language, Ruby&#x2F;Sinatra, Python&#x2F;Flask, Javascript&#x2F;Express. Most codebases I&#x27;ve encountered are a mess of inconsistencies introduced by various developers over the years. With a lot of the mess, effectively re-writing the core features of Rails and it&#x27;s most popular gems.<p>Rails, if done correctly, is a remarkable tool to allow developers to focus on the business logic and UI of their app and forget about the &quot;filler features&quot; that pretty much every app needs implemented. On the other hand if you write Rails code without reading the docs and re-invent the wheel rather than doing things the Rails way, essentially running an app in the framework without using the framework methods, you can create yourself a monstrous unmaintainable codebase like no other.')
