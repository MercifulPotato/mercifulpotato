Twentieth century approaches that provide law enforcement with the ability to investigate but also simplify exploitations and attacks are not in our national security interest. Instead of laws and regulation that weaken our protections, we should enable law enforcement to develop 21st century capabilities for conducting investigations.&quot;<p>&gt;&gt; &quot;Developing such capabilities will involve deep changed for the Bureau, which remains agent-based, not technology-based.&quot;<p>Whenever law enforcement complains that they need tools that give them access to <i>more data</i> they never mention that they have access to <i>far more</i> data than any point in history. Yes, some types of data they have used in the past may be going dark, but they have gained an incredible breadth of new tools.<p>Unfortunately, learning new investigation techniques requires money, training, and effort. Shoveling as much data as possible onto the problem makes the actual investigation more difficult, but they do it anyway when it also acts <i>de facto</i> as another source of <i>power</i>. ~sigh~ This crap needs to be reigned in.
