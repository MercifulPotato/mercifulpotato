They show a lot of amazing and recent developments that have been occurring in various parts of the worldwide Lisp landscape, despite how much energy seems to go into repeatedly proclaiming the Lisp family of languages dead, over and over and over.<p>It was a good choice to host these talks regularly after this year&#x27;s European Lisp Symposium. I&#x27;m glad that I did the work related to that, and I&#x27;ll be glad to do more of this.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;playlist?list=PLgq_B39Y_kKD9_sdCeE5SufaeAtbYPv80" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;playlist?list=PLgq_B39Y_kKD9_sdCeE5S...</a><p>(Disclosure: two of the talks there are by me; my above comment, naturally, doesn&#x27;t refer to them.)')
