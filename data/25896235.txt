I would agree if the numbers are reversed, i.e. 7-10% PMs are not needed.<p>Many developers love to hate on PMs but I think most teams overestimate themselves and think that they&#x27;re mature and self-managing enough to not need a PM. It can be true that the individuals in the team are self-managing on their own but it&#x27;s different when it&#x27;s scaled to a whole team.<p>For example, it&#x27;s difficult to finalize a decision when most experienced and opinionated team members have differing opinions. A PM serving as an arbiter can help resolve this deadlock. (Yes, there are strategies out there on how to make decisions w&#x2F;o an arbiter but then, how do they decide which strategy to use?)')
