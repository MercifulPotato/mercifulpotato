An alternate take on this passage is, &quot;95% of contacts exercised basic security measures rather than blindly install unvetted code on their machine.&quot;<p>It doesn&#x27;t take that much of a shift in perspective to turn this into a very optimistic statistic indicating that normal users aren&#x27;t always quite as security-unconscious as we normally think -- that for whatever reason (security, apathy, paranoia, whatever) sometimes they do actually make the right choices when interacting with sensitive information like their browsing habits.<p>You could not pay me to install an unvetted Electron application where I can&#x27;t even see the source code, that is designed to MITM my browsing activity. Even if I trust the author&#x27;s intention, who wrote the app? Who tested it? How do I know that the automatic redactors are going to actually work? It&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s hard to have security leaks in Electron.')
