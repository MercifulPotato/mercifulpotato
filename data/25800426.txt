For some reason, CTOs are very happy to start doing microservices with high level of documentation and rigorous interfaces but completely unwilling to have a well documented and rigorously defined monolith.<p>I don&#x27;t fucking get it. It&#x27;s like one layer of abstraction on top of folders. Instead of breaking up ownership by folders or whatever bullshit - they decide to breakup ownership by github repo.<p>I&#x27;d love to be sold on it otherwise but that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve been told directly as the reason for the move to microservices by many companies and what I&#x27;ve seen at my own. Can&#x27;t do a good job because your business practices suck? Fuck it - microservices, baby!')
