FOSS is eating the software world.<p>In Social Architecture, Peter Hintjens (ZeroMQ) has another way of putting it. Paraphrased he says that:<p>Open sourcing a particular product can be a &quot;market breaker&quot;. Imagine someone all of a sudden open sourced a great Photoshop alternative with a nice community. Suddenly, the for-profit market would collapse as photo editing became free over night. That&#x27;s open source eating software.<p>On the other hand, (1) licensing your software under the GPL family without asking for contributor licensing agreements and by (2) claiming your trademark (in his case: ZeroMQ) is the control mechanism that defends your product against exploitation.<p>(1) GPL as it allows to create a piece of software that has a huge number of owners and hence becomes impossible to capture by anyone. And also because GPL may force an exploiter to contribute back (APGL).<p>(2) Trademarks so that nobody can come along and offer a &quot;ZeroMQ service&quot; without your consent.<p>Post Script:<p>I love Peter&#x27;s argument for choosing GPL (1), which is that it creates a huge number of owners for the software. Imagine being an infrequent ZeroMQ contributor and now AWS comes along and hosts your product. Then, essentially, they&#x27;re messing with YOUR intellectual property. I think this dimension is often overlooked. I&#x27;d love to see a contributor class action lawsuit one day :D')
