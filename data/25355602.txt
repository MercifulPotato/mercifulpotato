Which is incredibly fast, that nobody had the time to review what their business was all about.<p>And even when they got approval at the lower levels, the higher levels didn’t get to think it through yet. So they decided to pause Ant’s IPO at the last minute. With the requirement that they have 30% of the money held back as collateral.<p>The Ant business model had a serious possibility of destabilizing the entire financial system of China, and possibly the world.<p>Nobody really cared when Ant was private.  Make all the money you want.  But being a public company is a whole different ball game.<p>I think China dodged a bullet here. It’s better to be safe, than sorry.')
