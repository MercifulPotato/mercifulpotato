Where did you get this data from? You can make nonhuman mammals follow their instincts all day, but we can&#x27;t extract much value from that. You can&#x27;t make them do arbitrary tasks that are physically and mentally within their means all day. You can train animals to do a task once easily, but you can&#x27;t train it to continue doing said task for the entire day so it can get fed by the end of the day.')
