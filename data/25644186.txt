There could be horrible biases and we don&#x27;t measure, don&#x27;t hold them accountable. There has been a recent spat at the Google AI Ethics department where a researcher accused Google of being biased because it uses language models trained on biased internet text (thinks doctors are men and nurses are women). I&#x27;d say - before going so deep, first check the actual page results for bias, it&#x27;s 1000x easier to do that and gives much more useful results.')
