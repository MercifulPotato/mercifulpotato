And murder laws reflect the view that those conditions are inherently wrong (<i>mala in se</i>); they don&#x27;t permit a fixed number of what-would-otherwise-be-murders per year with a specific allocation of who gets to commit them and a waiting list if you would qualify to commit them but your application would exceed the allowed number.<p>People who conplain about “illegal immigration” pretend that their problem is illegality, not immigration, and the structure of immigration laws reflect that immigration of vast groups of people who are denied legal immigration each year is not inherently wrong but only “wrong” due to aggregate impact, which can be addressed by other means.<p>&gt; Even many pro-immigration people are against the idea of selling extra spaces,<p>The only difference between trying to prohibit supernumerary immigration of immigrants who aren&#x27;t personally barred and selling extra spaces is that the money those people are <i>willing and able</i> to spend to immigrate goes to criminals, <i>and</i> the public foots additional costs of enforcement <i>as well as</i> dealing with the social costs of immigration and the <i>additional</i> social costs of illegality, instead of avoiding the last cost, mitigating the penultimate cost, and avoiding driving money to criminal organizations. And part of the additional social costs of the particular illegality it engenders  helping those who are personally barred for good cause avoid detection because the prohibition of immigrants who aren&#x27;t undesirable breeds widespread contempt for immigration laws and there enforcement.')
