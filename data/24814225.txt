I concede very little experience of yocto, etc, but I’ve a fairly complex system I maintain for both x86 and amd64 custom boards, all with quite heavily patched packages. I was challenged to add an imx6 board to the mix but I concede it was rather straight forward... for kicks I also switched out uclinux-ng for musl and switched up binutils versions, but it was all fairly painless...??<p>If you are familiar with gentoo it has a package manager called portage. You type “emerge packagename” and it installs it. Prepend ROOT=blah and it installs it in that dir instead!<p>So your build scripts are pretty trivial. Just write a bunch of emerge lines and you are done. Install in your new root, then package that ROOT. Simples!<p>Building from source could be slow, so cache binaries once built. Subsequent binaries will be used by adding “-k” to emerge above.<p>Profiles allow you to build target versions of software, E.g. customising compile flags or software versions. I use both a libc and a processor profile. The arch profile is also split between host and target, so for example static libs might be installed on host but not in target.<p>I used an overlayfs system to trim the delivery.<p>I think the big difference is I can rely on this huge distribution. Yet if I need some platform patch I need only drop it in my patches directory and hit rebuild. Put the patches dir in git and I’ve got a trackable distribution!<p>Comments?')
