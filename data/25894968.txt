What you are giving is a static snapshot in time where France has a mature technology that is declining and Germany is rapidly moving to the future.<p>Nuclear certainly has a place in baseload generation but new greenfield development is rare and costs skyrocket upon decommissioning.  On the other hand Germany is well positioned to take advantage of cost declines in battery storage to solve the intermittency problem.
