If I open a programme which only tutors poor children, \nwould it be justified for the child in Shanghai to point a finger at the poor child and say that it’s\n&#x2F;unfair&#x2F; that he isn’t allowed to be admitted?<p>Good luck with the visa — I hope you get the chance to go to graduate school. Thank you for\ntaking the time to explain your thoughts.')
