If paramedics had instead applied bandaids, those bandaids would not have helped him, but that&#x27;s no reason to claim he was killed by bandaids.<p>On one hand, you have cops trying to pull the man&#x27;s head off, starving his brain of oxygen.  On the other hand, you have a sedative that is renowned for being safe, administered in a quantity that should be safe a few times over.  How in the world people look at this situation and blame ketamine instead of the cops is completely beyond me.')
