This is really convenient because our TLS handshake occurs long before any HTTP traffic. HTTP has a “Host” header which allows a cost-cutting Internet hosting companies to pile hundreds of websites onto a single IP address. SSL has traditionally required a different IP for each site, but this extension allows the server to respond with the appropriate certificate that the browser is looking for. If nothing else, this extension should allow an extra week or so of IPv4 addresses.<p>Extra week? More of a few extra decades!')
