Here the context is an informal discussion to throw generalities on our own feelings on what makes a code readable. Sure, for more specific cases backed with some contextual data, it might be overkill to have a too sophisticated code hierarchy.<p>For your new example, I would find any of the following more fine:<p>maximum_celerity = 300 # Mm&#x2F;s<p>class Physics { public const speed c =  299792458; }<p>current_pace = speed(particle: photon, environment: vacuum, unit: Units.parsecs_per_year)<p>So, I agree, length of identifiers alone is not enough to trigger a &quot;this would be more nicely structured as…&quot;, and context matter. &quot;speedOfLightInVacuumMetersPerSecond&quot; <i>is</i> readable, and might be good enough for some specific contexts. But I wouldn’t take that as a desirable practice example.<p>Just because context matters, doesn’t mean that &quot;all generality are absolute evil&quot; (a statement that condemn itself).')
