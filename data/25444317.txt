I&#x27;ve been using them for a long time, but I&#x27;ve also just started learning CDK and Amplify and I think these could provide the same benefits, and in some (very specific) cases with zero costs. This plus databases such as Fauna or DynamoDB, and I wouldn&#x27;t be able to see my self using any other thing for a good long while.')
