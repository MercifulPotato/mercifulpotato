A lot of people find working for Google soul crushing and would happily take a $100k job that gives them more control and impact versus trying to navigate the path to promotion and relevance in a sea of stillborn products at Google.<p>I also agree founders want to get rich, I mean who doesn&#x27;t? It&#x27;s a nice fantasy.  However if they don&#x27;t have a deeper motivation to solve a problem for its own sake they will fail.  If you&#x27;re super smart and just want to get rich, the right move is to go into finance because you&#x27;ll never cross the chasm of building something people actually want.  Even the language you use to describe the premise indicates you don&#x27;t really get what makes successful founders tick.  Founders don&#x27;t &quot;work for a startup&quot; and they don&#x27;t need to be convincedâ€”the whole point is these are people who have decided for one reason or another that they are passionate about building a company.  You might think them fools because 25yo engineers are making $500k at FAANG and that is a high bar to clear for any startup (it is), but consider that all SWEs under 35 have never known a recession, and they may have come to believe that a programmer is inherently worth $500k even though this is just market rate given todays demand.  If there is another dot-com style correction, a bunch of folks might find out real quick what the value of knowing how to make your own dollar is.')
