Item(by='mlthoughts2018', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606684312, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25247734, text='&gt; “ You will often find that the 4th or 5th comment will have a sensible commentary on what that means for the market, the synergies, challenges, etc.”<p>It sounds like you have your own personal opinion of which commentary is “sensible” that you want to see.<p>But nobody is obligated to share your opinion. The point of democratic upvoting and downvoting is precisely to allow everyones’ different opinions of what makes a valuable comment to compete and the net result determines comment order.<p>It’s rude for you to imply the result of that process has a “signal to noise” problem. That’s your opinion, which you can use to vote like everyone else. If you don’t like the results, that doesn’t mean you should rudely insult them by suggesting the situation needs “improvement” due to poor “signal to noise” problems.<p>Given the insulting nature of your post and the implied arrogance of believing your assessment of sensible comments is better than the community average, I’m inclined to believe that if the type of comment you would prefer isn’t appearing in the top few, that’s probably a <i>good</i> thing, as it means these negative qualities of your own communication might be less correlated to the top voted posts.')
