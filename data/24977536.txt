Look at it: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dahliaos.io&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dahliaos.io&#x2F;</a><p>&gt; a modern, secure, lightweight and responsive operating system, combining the best of GNU&#x2F;Linux and Fuchsia OS<p>The initial announcement and first couple years of development of linux had no logo or website or anything. Let&#x27;s compare:<p>&gt; a (free) operating system (just a hobby, won&#x27;t be big and professional like gnu) for 386(486) AT clones<p>I usually just move on without comment ... but I&#x27;m kinda annoyed by the trend of the &quot;npm generation&quot; to have all this slick marketing bluster for experimental &quot;just for learning&quot; projects. Go ahead and compare to <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gcc.gnu.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gcc.gnu.org&#x2F;</a> - much less slick, much less marketing bluster, much more important project.<p>This dahliaOS has apparently recently joined the Open Invention Network &quot;joining the likes of Google, IBM, SpaceX, Huawei, Microsoft, Yamaha, Honda, System76, GNOME, Daimler&quot; and is accepting donations. Meanwhile, the founder says:<p>&gt; A lot of my stuff is learning about kernel development and is mostly what I do. I do a lot with porting devices to fuchsia, and tinkering with the zircon kernel. Thats mostly it.<p>If there was just a repo and the readme just said that, I don&#x27;t think there would be any skepticism and criticism here, just some interest and encouragement. But with all this slick marketing, skepticism and criticism is a healthy balance.')
