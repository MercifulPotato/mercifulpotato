There is more empathy for people protesting racial injustice and the murder of minority groups than there is for people waving hate group symbols and trying to kill political leaders. I don&#x27;t see a need to demand a system void of empathy.</i><p>Every man considers the group for which he fights oppressed and the group that fights against him a “hate group”, and every man has cherry picked statistics to show it.<p>&gt; <i>Everyone has a choice. Everyone identifying as conservative can point at the white supremacists in DC and say &quot;Those are my people&quot; or &quot;Those are not my people&quot;.</i><p>And the same applies to the the more extreme and violent parts of the <i>b.l.m.</i> movement.<p>As is usual, and as I criticized, you cherry pick the most violent parts of “the other group” to make your point, while showing the more moderate of your own to front them as the good guys.')
