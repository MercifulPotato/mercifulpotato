I&#x27;ve never knew the negative meanings the word has until I read this page. It&#x27;s bizarre to read here people assuming everyone knows it&#x27;s offensive.<p>As opposed to &quot;git&quot;, which I used in school to mean an idiot, an annoying person. A &quot;github&quot; sounds like where those people gather..<p>I use and love GIMP. Also, I learnt it while my computer was set to a language I was learning (Spanish). I didn&#x27;t understand 95% of the menu item words when I started. So, hearing people saying it&#x27;s hard to use (in English) is also surprising. :-)')
