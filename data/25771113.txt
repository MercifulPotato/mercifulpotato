The problem exists for Parler trying to become a compelling platform at all among everyone else. And that problem exists for all Parler users including all the would-be users and all people trying to develop a following on Parler.<p>&gt; Oh no we have to go to a bookmark in a browser instead of having an app or even an icon on a homepage<p>Sure, not a problem for Parler die-hards. Massive shortcoming for everyone else. iOS users can&#x27;t even receive notifications from a website. Parler&#x27;s target audience isn&#x27;t just the people willing to jump through hoops. If you&#x27;re someone trying to create content on Parler, your target audience isn&#x27;t just people willing to remember to check their mobile browser every once in a while when every other app (incl Twitter) gives them real notifications.<p>You&#x27;re saying that these obstacles either don&#x27;t matter or they&#x27;re inconsequential as long as your product is good, and you&#x27;re sorely mistaken. You don&#x27;t want to be lacking a notification system as a fledgling social media platform. Just consider how every time someone receives a &quot;X replied to you&quot; notification and returns to the app, how that enriches the entire platform.')
