Imagine that.<p>&gt;I remember when a storm hit the region, everyone got out, cleared the trees on the road and repaired each other houses.<p>Was that the 99 storm ? Back then I was in the North-East, where it was the strongest. I saw an old guy walking his dog outside and almost getting beheaded by a rogue steel sheet. I also vividly remember people daisy-chaining 100m extension chords across the village to bring electricity to the side that lost it. A lot of people were panicking because they had four freezers full of meat hidden in the basement, and a lot of them were quite poor and couldn&#x27;t afford to lose those.')
