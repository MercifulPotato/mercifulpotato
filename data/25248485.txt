I think Moxie is right, and remains right today, about this point.<p>I would consider it impolite&#x2F;rude to use GPG to email someone with whom I have no existing relationship, unless explicitly directed to do so for professional use. When PGP was young I would attach a signature, but over time I found that this cheapened my conversations and set a tone I didn’t consider acceptable to use with others.<p>If someone blind emailed me with a GPG encrypted message, I would delete it without attempting to decrypt it and block the sender, because clearly they have no clue what they’re doing, and I don’t have time for that. So, then, I remain in agreement with the (2015) Moxie that posted this.')
