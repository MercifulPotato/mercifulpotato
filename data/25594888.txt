For a lot of boys, the drive to compete is pretty much the only positive thing keeping them focused on schoolwork.<p>Another typical trend has been to reduce and to almost eliminate the amount of multiple choice testing and to change it to written questions. There’s evidence enough to claim that this significantly penalizes boys (specially in the 10 to 14 age range) due to developmental reasons.<p>The difference in ADHD diagnosis is easy to explain. As we’ve moved our expectations of kid behavior from what “the typical boy does” to “what the typical girl does”, a lot of perfectly normal boy behavior is reinterpreted as ADHD.')
