Item(by='krapp', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604420600, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24980591, text='&gt; If someone produced a study categorizing a high speech volume as &quot;Hispanic language&quot; and saying that Latinos like me get hired less when we use &quot;Hispanic language&quot; in interviews, I&#x27;d be pretty mad.<p>Except there&#x27;s a great deal of cultural, historical and linguistic evidence that assertive language is considered more masculine, and communal language is considered more feminine. There would be no such evidence supporting a cultural bias considering high speech volume as &quot;Hispanic language&quot; that I&#x27;m aware of.<p>It shouldn&#x27;t be controversial to claim that, traditionally, &quot;masculine&quot; as an ideal is defined in terms of assertiveness, dominance and hierarchy (particularly in business) whereas &quot;feminine&quot; as an ideal is typically defined in terms of empathy, submissiveness and collaboration. While English is not an explicitly gendered language like Spanish or German, the ways that masculinity and femininity are expected to be expressed within Anglophone cultures inform the way language is used as expression within those norms[0,3].<p>You are correct that this is stereotypical, as most gender conventions are, but incorrect in asserting that this stereotype does not exist beyond the authors&#x27; personal bias, and therefore, is useless in studying gender dynamics. Indeed, the entire point of the linked article is to study the effects of that bias and those stereotypes on the hiring process. Seeking to ignore that aspect on the basis that referring to stereotypes is itself engaging in stereotyping would miss the point in the same way as ignoring race in a study of early American slavery on the basis that focusing on race would be racist.<p>Women are Warmer but No Less Assertive than Men: Gender and Language on Facebook[0]<p>[0]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC4881750&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC4881750&#x2F;</a><p>Gender Differences in Communication Behaviors, Spatial Proximity Patterns, and Mobility Habits[1]<p>[1]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.researchgate.net&#x2F;publication&#x2F;305616148_Gender_Differences_in_Communication_Behaviors_Spatial_Proximity_Patterns_and_Mobility_Habits#read" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.researchgate.net&#x2F;publication&#x2F;305616148_Gender_Di...</a><p>What Is Feminine Style Rhetoric and Why Is It Important?[2]<p>[2]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jenniferspoelma.com&#x2F;blog-feed&#x2F;feminine-style-rhetoric-why-important" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jenniferspoelma.com&#x2F;blog-feed&#x2F;feminine-style-rhetori...</a><p>Masculine-Feminine Difference: How We Talk[3]<p>[3]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.huffpost.com&#x2F;entry&#x2F;masculinefeminine-differe_b_5559127" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.huffpost.com&#x2F;entry&#x2F;masculinefeminine-differe_b_5...</a>')
