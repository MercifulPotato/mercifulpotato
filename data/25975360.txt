A good majority of the mainstream media in India are paid for and&#x2F;or afraid of the current government. There is plenty to be said about this but I want to stick with farm bill issue.<p>You say: “ current farmer protests, they are demanding that minimum price supports not be removed.” That is not the demand. The demand is to ensure that these new trading places outside of the mandis support the minimum price. The minimum price is a not a law but these mandis do follow them especially since the government also procures crops from the farmers. The farmers fear that with non-government buyers entering the market they would be less incentivized to buy them at minimum price. There are couple of links below that go into more of the nuances of the bill and what the farmers fear.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;indianexpress.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;explained&#x2F;what-is-the-basis-of-msp-6609668&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;indianexpress.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;explained&#x2F;what-is-the-basi...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;indianexpress.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;explained&#x2F;in-three-ordinances-the-provisions-that-bother-protesting-farmers-6598905&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;indianexpress.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;explained&#x2F;in-three-ordinan...</a>')
