Item(by='prirun', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603727794, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24889817, text='The ridiculous part is that a corporation was given &quot;personhood&quot; by the law, with all the rights that people have.  A corporation is not a person.<p>Here&#x27;s the 1st amendment:<p>&quot;Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.&quot;<p>What works for me is to replace the words Congress &amp; government with Facebook, Twitter, or any company with a certain market share.  If you want to be a corporation that facilitates communication between thousands of people, you&#x27;re subject to the rule, ie, you lose some of your private property rights.  If you have fewer than say 1000 users, do what you want: only private property rules apply.')
