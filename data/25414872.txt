At least bigger Volkshochschulen do offer non-academic qualifications, especially in the area of continuous education for those with existing qualifications.<p>Besides languages, this ranges from various finance and law classes for people who are starting their own business, over “Ausbildung der Ausbilder” (Train the Trainer but a formal qualification the German dual system), to certificates like CCNA.<p>The courses that are offered vary widely between cities, it’s difficult to generalize.<p>What you find is courses that are job-qualifying degrees. The VHS is really structured around taking individual, stand-alone, courses.<p>The one exception I can think of is that some VHS’ are offering “Hauptschulabschluss” for those who left school without graduating.')
