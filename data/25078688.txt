While the lower bound of the cited range is realistic (but only for certain problems), the majority of the range is highly unlikely. According to my sources, the difference is not that dramatic: depending on a specific type of a problem, it ranges from 1.5x to 100x. For applications using relevant Web frameworks, the composite difference is just 4-5x.<p>As for scientific computing domain, I would start a new project in Julia rather than Python.')
