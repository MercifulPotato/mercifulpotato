Literal Nazis and fascists, the ranks of which have been, if not growing, then clearly emboldened.<p>This group &quot;feels oppressed&quot; because they are not able to exert their will to oppress others. This is not a morally defensible position. So please, spare us the gaslighting about the level of discourse.
