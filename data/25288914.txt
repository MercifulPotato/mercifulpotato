Item(by='II2II', descendants=None, kids=[25289399], score=None, time=1607004495, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25288695, text='&gt; I don&#x27;t understand the comparison to the iphone and android situation.<p>Because articles like that are pure nonsense.<p>Take the initial paragraphs.  We already knew that faster processors don&#x27;t necessarily run hotter.  People are simply conflating higher clock speeds with higher performance, while ignoring all of the ways CPU design optimizes computation.  Likewise, we already knew that &quot;emulation&quot; doesn&#x27;t imply that performance will be unbearably slow.  There has been enormous amounts of research and development into the problem over the decades, to the point where much of our software is optimized at runtime.<p>None of this is meant to diminish what Apple has accomplished.  They were clearly paying attention to details that have been largely ignored or at the very least rarely highlighted by their competitors.  Now that it has happened, we will likely see more from the PC industry.  Apple will likely have a hard time keeping up unless they have more up their sleeve.')
