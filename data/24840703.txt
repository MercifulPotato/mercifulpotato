Expecting an author to cater to every other culture with everything they do is a bit self-centered, IMO. It should be on the reader to understand that there are differences, not on the writer to make sure every single cultural difference is pointed out. It seems kind of weird to expect him to alter his headline to cater to a country he doesn&#x27;t live in.<p>If you were writing an article about potato chips, it would seem kind of silly to expect you to add &quot;(crisps)&quot; in the title to cater to our English friends, so I&#x27;m not sure why you would expect that here, especially when the vast majority of the world calls it &quot;football&quot;.')
