I&#x27;m a software engineer from Sri Lanka working in Germany as a software engineer. It was my personal opinion and as I&#x27;ve said everyone has their own preference.<p>&gt; Over time the role will change to reflect the changing organisation and role.<p>If the role has evolved, then it will not be the same job you did &#x27;x&#x27; number of years ago. But according to original post, OP says &quot;I have worked 20 years in the same job&quot;. Maybe I understood it incorrectly, but it seems like the role hasn&#x27;t evolved or changed at all.')
