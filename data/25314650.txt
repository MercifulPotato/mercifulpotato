The universe branching that MWI posits is not really different from wave function collapse, and decoherence also doesn&#x27;t really solve things. You still fundamentally have a single position for any classical system, but multiple positions with different amplitudes for quantum systems, and some mysterious threshold where you pass from one to the other.<p>Probability also can&#x27;t really explain this, since the classical model also applies to single particles after they have interacted with a macroscopic system.<p>MWI considers that observers inside one branch can&#x27;t interact or notice observers inside other branches, and this is why we perceive the world as if objects have unique definite positions. But this still doesn&#x27;t hold up for quantum systems, which do in fact perceive and can interact with all of the other &quot;worlds&quot;, including interacting with themselves in other worlds such as in the single particle double-slit experiment. So MWI doesn&#x27;t really get away from the duality in any rigorous way.')
