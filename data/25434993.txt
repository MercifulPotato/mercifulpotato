The only remaining part is to prove intent.<p>They aren&#x27;t because<p><i>... the mere accessibility of the ... website in the Union ... is insufficient to ascertain such intention</i><p>Local EU websites are covered by virtue of being EU websites, not because they&#x27;re <i>accessible</i> in the EU.<p>&gt; Conversely, if this would indeed exempt them from GDPR, then are all general purpose US news sites not specifically targeting the EU exempt too?<p>Yes.<p>&gt; if I have a social media site and 99% of my users are Americans talking about US-related stuff, am I exempt too even if I let EU citizens register and participate?<p>Yes, unless you&#x27;re targeting EU citizens by e.g. offering interface localization in EU languages or setting growth targets for the European market in statements to your investors etc.')
