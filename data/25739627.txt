If we find a simpler or more predictive model for the electron, physicists will happily abandon the model we currently have, while nothing will destroy our brain&#x27;s model of &#x27;what I type is what is sent&#x27;. Conscious thought isn&#x27;t even required for the process of physics, we only use it because it is the only thing we have to approximate the mathematical reasoning that physics does require.')
