Perhaps thousands of stoves could fail at once, all encountering the same defect. Something like this could happen if the software fails after 10,000 hours of continuous operation, say. (A bug of this sort once resulted in the deaths of 28 US soldiers, when a missile defence system failed. [0])<p>&gt; The real problem in these cases is internet-connectivity + software-control<p>I agree this is a very obvious and severe problem, and it&#x27;s rather shocking that it&#x27;s even legal to do this. Avionics software is famously strictly regulated, but the software in road vehicles isn&#x27;t.<p>&gt; Without internet-connectivity, your primary failure mode is random chance<p>It depends. There could be a failure after some number of hours of continuous operation. Perhaps a particular stretch of road could be dangerously mishandled by all self-driving cars of a certain model. There&#x27;s also a risk that deliberately crafted fake road signs could cause the system to drive dangerously, opening the door to targeted attacks.<p>&gt; once you add in internet-connectivity, you now introduce an easy way to induce simultaneous failure<p>That&#x27;s a good point. It&#x27;s similar to how we place enormous trust in Windows Update, except we&#x27;re talking about a life-and-death system.<p>&gt; They should not be releasing internet-connected gas stoves unless every engineer on their team is comfortable that their security would be good enough to connect the US nuclear arsenal to the internet since the worst-case consequences are equally bad.<p>Well, no, they plainly aren&#x27;t, but I do agree with your general point.<p>I wonder if we&#x27;ll see any kind of general software regulation (that is, not specific to a domain such as aviation) to cover this sort of recklessness. Currently, the company behind such a product would only suffer after the fact, were something to go badly wrong.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www-users.math.umn.edu&#x2F;~arnold&#x2F;disasters&#x2F;patriot.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www-users.math.umn.edu&#x2F;~arnold&#x2F;disasters&#x2F;patriot.htm...</a>')
