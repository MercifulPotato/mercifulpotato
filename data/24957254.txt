Null exists for cases where you want to set the the absence of a value intentionally. It is literally the value of having no value. Undefined exists for cases where no value has yet been set. It&#x27;s a subtle but important difference and allows a certain amount of nuance and expressiveness in ones code to communicate intent. I do think it&#x27;s fair to say that a lot of devs don&#x27;t use them that way. They _are_ for separate use cases though.')
