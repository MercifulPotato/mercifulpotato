Requiring people or organizations to host speech is the exception, and is limited to things like utilities and cigarette health warnings.<p>Making Facebook or Twitter a utility is very coarse grained. They would have to allow all legal speech. They wouldn&#x27;t be able to ban users for nudity or porn, or explicitly espousing Nazism (actual Nazism, not the much more expansive post 2016 definition of &quot;Nazi&quot;). Both of these things are legal in the US, and a utility would have to permit them. If social media is made a utility, then social media is going to become 8chan.<p>That&#x27;s why I think it makes the most sense to apply utility status at the infrastructure layer not the application layer.
