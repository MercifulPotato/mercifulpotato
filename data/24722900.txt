Item(by='JPKab', descendants=None, kids=[24722979, 24723036], score=None, time=1602185604, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24721734, text='I feel like this confirms (although this could be confirmation bias, and would literally be a textbook case) my belief that this is indeed a tiny percentage of people at most tech companies that are really into social justice activism, and they are very, very noisy and disruptive.<p>My suspicion is that the percentage of folks who are into this is higher at companies like Google, who have absurdly overly bureaucratic hiring pipelines that weed out free thinkers in favor of academic elites who are strong conformists.  Strong conformists from academia are the ones I see gravitating most to this form of activism.  Add to that the fact that your typical Google engineer is massively overqualified for the actual work that they do on a daily basis (working on a cog in a gear in a giant system) and you get a lot of anxious, bored people trying to erase their guilt over being radically overpaid.<p>Another group of folks I&#x27;ve witnessed being into social justice activism (at an extreme level) are borderline Aspergers folks I&#x27;ve worked with who, on a good day, have a hard time navigating human relationships of any kind.  I think the intersectional, hierarchal nature of these beliefs brings a Dungeons and Dragons, RPG like sense of order to humans that is comforting to them.  The fact that it&#x27;s mostly over-simplified and false escapes them.<p>Basically, Coinbase probably got rid of a lot of unproductive personnel and won&#x27;t have to deal with this anymore.')
