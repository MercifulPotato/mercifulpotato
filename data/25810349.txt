Item(by='cycomanic', descendants=None, kids=[25810383], score=None, time=1610888619, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25806686, text='I actually just had an argument with my SO about this. She was arguing that it was mostly the parents protesting and I strongly disagreed. If you talk with a even 6 year old, they can realise things being wrong and argue about it very well (and get better at it when they get older to 11-12). In particular they question things that adults often take for granted. Now that requires parents listening and taking the kids serious instead of just telling them to obey.<p>So I believe it&#x27;s wrong to suggest that it was adults &quot;misusing&quot; their children. The way it was portrayed in the film was that it was the children discussing their situation in class and then being encouraged to try to do something about it (the bit where they talk to the politician). This is how you raise children who think critically and create participation in democratic processes. I would not be surprised that this is the actual way it developed.')
