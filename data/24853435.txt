And Localbitcoins started  to become a target by regulators and gox was on its last legs.<p>Also worth noting how you could bypass this with the sale of Bitcoin &#x27;software&#x27; on their platform:<p>&gt; <i>Ebay previously allowed users to sell software for bitcoin mining and transactions.</i><p>0: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ibtimes.co.uk&#x2F;ebay-uk-allow-users-buy-sell-bitcoins-1433007" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ibtimes.co.uk&#x2F;ebay-uk-allow-users-buy-sell-bitco...</a>')
