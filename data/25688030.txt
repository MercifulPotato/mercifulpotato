But when it happened then the protests were &quot;fiery but mostly peaceful&quot; because &quot;collateral damage is okay if it is done in the name of grappling with racism&quot;. Now that the other side has gathered to protest what they see as injustices, it&#x27;s &quot;a coup&quot; and &quot;terrorism&quot; because of the bad actors who postponed congress for a few hours despite the fact that the vast majority of the people at the protest were peacefully protesting.')
