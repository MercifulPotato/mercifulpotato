So &#x2F;if&#x2F; the patient&#x27;s improvements can be ascribed to the soluble ACE2 treatment, it&#x27;s likely the improvement was because of the effect the soluble ACE2 had on the person&#x27;s renin-angiotensin system.<p>And if this holds, then it&#x27;s likely many of these same improvements would be possible using a common class of widely-available blood pressure medications called ARBs.<p>This approach would not neutralize the virus, but instead stop the body from damaging itself.  That&#x27;s the theory, at least.<p>There are ~20 trials of ARBs for COVID-19 in progress now, though almost all are underdosed.')
