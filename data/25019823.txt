It is snappy and the UI is really nice. I particularly liked how clubhouse drives backlog curation as a largest block to smallest block.  At the time, this was way ahead of JIRA.  I found the team at clubhouse to be awesome too - responsive and transparent.<p>Ultimately we went back to JIRA because clubhouse thought differently about agile workflow than we do. At the time, clubhouse didn&#x27;t support sprints other than by adding labels - but the reports didn&#x27;t reflect the sprint temporal boundaries.  We found it really hard to create things like a view on sprint velocity. We also didn&#x27;t agree with their view on what a team is but I forget the specifics.<p>It wasn&#x27;t that JIRA is perfect, but it was either less wrong or more right depending on your perspective.<p>I am a fan of the newer Portfolio&#x2F;Plan functionality in JIRA which I think replicates some of the features I liked about clubhouse, in forcing a large to small PBR, but I don&#x27;t use the date planning features.')
