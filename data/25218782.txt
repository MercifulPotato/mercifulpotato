It&#x27;s the first time I&#x27;ve heard of it and, quite honestly, it sounds pretty weird (albeit I undertand why it&#x27;s there).<p>I guess some push is needed for this kind of change, as the system is somehow natually fit for status quo.<p>In a perfect world, gender in these matters wouldn&#x27;t even be part of the discussion at all.
