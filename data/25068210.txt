Item(by='berkes', descendants=None, kids=[25069001], score=None, time=1605174589, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25066779, text='&gt; In Netherlands<p>Off-topic, but it really is `the Netherlands`; not unlike &quot;the United Kingdom&quot;.<p>As Dutchmen myself, I too often see software doing this wrong, which is why I mention it here; in dropdowns, validations, invoices etc. When you design a &quot;country dropdown&quot;, its `the Netherlands`, and it comes after `Nepal` and before `Netherlands Antilles`, and it should be highlighted when someone types `net`. Often one can &quot;solve&quot; the sorting by moving the `the` to the back: `Netherlands, the`, `United Kingdom, the`, though that&#x27;s a bit of a hack more than an actual solution.')
