Most mobs are moved by emotions and herd mentality so just being silent for a while can disperse the worst of the mobs.<p>Make an thorough apology (like the guideline here) later.<p>Most internet mobs just move on to the next totem pole to burn in days so this seems to work (and is indeed how a lot of companies respond if they can&#x27;t just fire someone and get over it)<p>A real mob, such as campus students can be a bit more troublesome.')
