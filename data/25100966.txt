It would be like the need for massive US presence in Canada - nobody thinks that, it&#x27;s obviously unecessary.<p>2) There would be 0 concern over border integrity, especially in Baltic states. Again, it would be like concern over &#x27;New Zealand&#x27; being invaded - there&#x27;s no concern there.<p>That&#x27;s what &#x27;good security&#x27; looks like - it makes one position look secure to the point of any real aggression being unfathomable or crazy.<p>The Europe should pay more for it&#x27;s security so we can spend the next ~100 years or so cooling down - eventually the Russians won&#x27;t want to invade their neighbours.')
