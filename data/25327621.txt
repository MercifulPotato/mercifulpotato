In particular, they set a low budget for the renovation - then rejected all the bidders who weren&#x27;t using the cheap flammable materials for being too expensive.<p>But the council&#x27;s <i>intention in starting the project</i> was insulate poor people&#x27;s homes free of charge, while making the area look nicer. I don&#x27;t see anything wrong with the intention - it&#x27;s the budget and implementation where they screwed up.')
