If Google were to lose Google Chrome, there is nothing that would prevent them from directly or indirectly evolving Chromium.  If Google is prevented from making a browser, then they could even move the focus of computing away from the web browser with power from their search business.<p>Therefore, antitrust oversight is required to curb the types of behavior that lead to the antitrust situation in the first place.')
