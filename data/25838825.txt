Item(by='poulsbohemian', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611090028, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25838437, text='&gt; focus on insulting these people instead of hearing how society has failed them<p>Look, I&#x27;m just a guy, with no fancy credentials or research to back this up, but the more I read, the more I try to understand this crowd, the more I talk with other people about this crowd, the more I believe <i>these people are making choices</i>. That is to say, there are plenty of educated and monied people running amok here. To believe that this is a crowd of impoverished, under&#x2F;un-employed people with limited economic means that society has failed is in fact allowing them to behave recklessly and grow their audience. Nope. A lot of these folks know what they are doing or are allowing themselves to give in to their worst selves. That&#x27;s not being failed, that&#x27;s making choices.')
