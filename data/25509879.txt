Item(by='kurthr', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608664052, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25507048, text='Well, I&#x27;m not quite sure I buy that they will look crappy (terrible CRI is an issue, but white balance does work) in low light, because they have larger apertures!<p>&quot;It&#x27;s the lens stupid&quot;... is often true for bad images. More pixels (or even larger film) won&#x27;t gain you that much, but more light will help with focus, contrast, saturation, noise etc.<p>Really, you could also say, &quot;it&#x27;s the lighting stupid&quot;... but better lighting is a bit harder to set up than a larger lens. The cost can be moderate to make it really good. On the other hand making it just suck less, it usually pretty cheap. Thus the ring light you see suggested everywhere.<p>What amazes me is how good our eye is so that we don&#x27;t notice terrible lighting.')
