I like taking 4x5 negatives and making 100MP digital images that you can infinitely zoom into.  But!  It is a lot of work.  (I wet mount, and take several scans to get the focusing perfect across the entire negative.)<p>You can get 90% as good results by putting the negative on a slide viewer (more commonly sold for tracing these days) and taking a picture with your digital camera.  Will you extract every bit of information that the film captured?  No.  Will an amazing picture look amazing when digitized in this way?  Absolutely.  So it&#x27;s worth considering if you already have a digital camera and are just getting started!<p>I have taken pictures of negatives hanging to dry with my phone, inverted them in Photoshop, and posted them to social media with good results.  You don&#x27;t need expensive equipment and to spend hours getting things perfect if you don&#x27;t want to.')
