Item(by='ddalex', descendants=None, kids=[24789120], score=None, time=1602749008, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24776442, text='One needs to do this because - should one say, for example, &quot;100Tb&quot; - this means very little for &quot;regular people&quot;. If far easier to say &quot;so much that you don&#x27;t have to worry about it<i>&quot; &quot;</i> as long as you are decent about it&quot;.<p>And then a small minority of users take to the literal dictionary definition - which one is allowed to, which gave birth to vast amounts on legalese on the wrapping bags of sandwiches - and start to scream &quot;you&#x27;re not truly &gt;UNLIMITED&lt; you owe me&quot;.<p>And then the provider - which assumed common sense - sees that the common sense is not to be taken for granted, and starts to spell more legalese and then starts enforcing limits which are now laid out but perhaps not enforced from the start, because it assumed that people would know how to read between the lines. But said minority doesn&#x27;t know how to read through the lines and then starts to search for workarounds around the limits, forcing the provider to drop in even harder limits, which affects EVERYBODY because some people need to go through life with a fine tooth comb that exploits each little thing that they can.<p>So this is the difference between a high trust society and a low trust society - the level of hard enforcement of rules because people will try to exploit even the smallest thing.')
