[...] The success rate for short attacks is over ninety percent&quot;<p>he&#x2F;she can only find two examples (Global Link and TASER), which is a bit odd.<p>In any case, there is a connection to the current narrative of &quot;short sellers are evil&quot;. But &quot;the shorts&quot; or &quot;they&quot; is one of these &quot;us vs them&quot; constructs that does not exist in any meaningful way.<p>Even worse, there is a common notion on r&#x2F;WSB that &quot;the shorts&quot; are also &quot;the suits&quot; and there will be some rough awakening when folks find out that Wall St made more money on $GME than Main St, and that is on the long side, before any dip in share price!<p>By the way, this awakening might never happen and there is a scenario where we will never find out who traded what on $GME, because transparent transaction data is not publicly available. Thinking back about the 2010 flash crash [1] we still don&#x27;t know with certainty what exactly happened.<p>Grant Williams did a podcast about the current events [2] and I can only recommend it (also check out his Endgame series).<p>There certainly are unethical sellers of stock (see e.g. Jim Cramer video where he talks about manipulation) but I have yet to see convincing evidence that unethical or fraudulent behaviour is more common on the short than long side.<p>There was a recent poll on Fintwit to name examples where &quot;short attacks&quot; hurt companies, and the paucity of meaningful examples further confirmed the above point (can&#x27;t find reference due to crappy Twitter search).<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;2010_flash_crash" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;2010_flash_crash</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ttmygh.podbean.com&#x2F;e&#x2F;gwp_003&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ttmygh.podbean.com&#x2F;e&#x2F;gwp_003&#x2F;</a>')
