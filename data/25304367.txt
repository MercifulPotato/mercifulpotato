Item(by='vorpalhex', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607100060, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25303957, text='&gt; what is the reddit replacement?<p>I keep looking and monitoring promising replacements but haven&#x27;t found one yet. I do think the ultimate way forward is going to be some kind of federated system where each &quot;subreddit&quot; is hosted individually and there are aggregators which glue them together, either as a hosted portal or as individual apps.<p>One of the things that has been killing me is that small interesting subreddits keep getting either killed for not being actively moderated enough or invaded by people who have their own goals. It&#x27;s very frustrating and it really hurts the longterm knowledge that gets generated in these subreddits.<p>If anyone is working in this space, please drop me a line.')
