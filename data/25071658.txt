The first is that, even though the matter&#x2F;energy density was higher then the Chandrasekhar limit,  space itself was expanding at faster than the speed of light so it could not collapse.<p>The second thing is that gravity has negative energy,  and matter has positive energy,  so the total energy of the universe was exactly zero.   Zero total energy is the only amount compatible with our understanding of thermodynamics.')
