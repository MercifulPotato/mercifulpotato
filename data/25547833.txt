(specially true on docker for mac, which all the cool kids(tm) here are using). Even if you restrict container host-FS access to a source repo dir, mind rogue code changing your .git hook scripts in there or you might run code outside of the container when committing ;)<p>Another slightly relevant fun fact, USB is a bus. That means that any device can listen in on any other device. And USB access is given by default to some X-enabled docker (--tty something), and to most virtualbox machines (including the hidden one running the fake docker linux host on docker-for-mac), and more recently Google-Chrome. ;)')
