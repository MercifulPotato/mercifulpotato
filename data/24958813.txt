What would a system look like that focuses on tracking authorship claims, which helps humanity see which teams achieved what (a shared record of &#x27;who was first&#x27; that helps assess the productivity of a certain team)?<p>2)<p>My second argument comes with the way our economic system commoditizes information, creating essentially a world with &#x27;information feudalism&#x27;. My question is: is this inevitable? Or can we create non-rival ways of acknowledging wealth? [1]<p>Sensorica and Mikorizal are moving away from dollars, euros, etc. and towards asset backed accounting, with the use of the Resource Event Agent (REA) accounting model, in what they call an &#x27;Open Value Network&#x27; (OVN). An Open Value Network inverts the closed corporate Value&#x2F;Supply Chain accounting. A 1kg bag of carrots stays a 1kg bag of carrots, instead of becoming denominated in dollars, euros or pesos [2]. This means we start being able to see the flows of resources flowing through our communities. This has never existed before so it&#x27;s hard to describe.<p>I&#x27;m glad I got to clarify thanks to your comment - also helps my own thought processes<p>I&#x27;d be curious to hear if this resonated, or made some sense to you?<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;eric.harris-braun.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2007&#x2F;11&#x2F;05&#x2F;id-55" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;eric.harris-braun.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2007&#x2F;11&#x2F;05&#x2F;id-55</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;metacurrency-project&#x2F;the-metacurrency-myth-8db61ed14fb8" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;metacurrency-project&#x2F;the-metacurrency-myt...</a>')
