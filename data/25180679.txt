That is not the same as saying religion never generates true beliefs or never looks at facts.<p><i>&gt; religion is an ancient applied science of managing authority and consent in large groups of people</i><p>This is an interesting hypothesis, but note a key implication: that this &quot;applied science&quot; involves generating and propagating false beliefs. And given that, an easy alternate way of contrasting the religious worldview with the scientific worldview would be that the scientific worldview does not consider generating and propagating false beliefs to be a good thing. That&#x27;s not to say science never does that, just that in science, it&#x27;s considered a bug, whereas in religion, by your description, it&#x27;s considered a feature.<p>Also, the term &quot;applied science&quot; implies that there is an actual scientific theory that is being applied. Religion does not have any theory at all about &quot;managing authority and consent in large groups of people&quot;. It <i>does</i> that in practice, but it doesn&#x27;t have any <i>theory</i> about it. So &quot;applied science&quot; is a misnomer in this case: a better term would be &quot;art&quot;, as in &quot;religion is an ancient art of managing authority and consent in large groups of people&quot;.')
