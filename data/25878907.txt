An increase by that much might possibly wipe out the species.<p>That is absolutely not what scientists and economists are predicting. An RCP 8.5 scenario (which is considered on the worse side of what&#x27;s likely in a &quot;do nothing&quot; world) is expected to knock 6.7-14.3% of US GDP by 2100: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.brookings.edu&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2019&#x2F;10&#x2F;20191025_ES_THP_Environmental_Facts_FINAL.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.brookings.edu&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2019&#x2F;10&#x2F;2019102...</a> (p. 7). That would be about half as bad as the COVID lockdowns (but permanent): <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnbc.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;07&#x2F;30&#x2F;us-gdp-q2-2020-first-reading.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnbc.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;07&#x2F;30&#x2F;us-gdp-q2-2020-first-reading...</a>.<p>Note that&#x27;s a 14.3% hit compared to what GDP would be in 2100. That&#x27;s a big impact. It&#x27;s equivalent to going from 3% annual GDP growth between then and now to 2.7% annual GDP growth.<p>Now, the numbers hide some really terrible costs. The Florida and Gulf coast will become uninhabitable, destroying half the economy in those areas. To put it into perspective the 2018 California wildfires cost 0.75% of GDP. So this is like 20 times worse. It&#x27;s bad! But it&#x27;s not an &quot;untold cost.&quot; It&#x27;s not an outcome worth spending any amount to avoid.<p>Scientists don&#x27;t think mitigation will cost more than the damages from climate change, because scientists aren&#x27;t proposing to mitigate climate change by shutting down the economy the way we did during the COIVD lockdown. That&#x27;s an insanely inefficient way to achieve mitigation. I mentioned the economic loss from COVID lockdown not to suggest that is actually how we would reduce emissions, but to put into perspective what the expected costs of climate change are.<p>Saying that climate change will have &quot;untold cost&quot; is problematic because it makes you believe that mitigation strategies that will have massive costs will be justified to avoid climate change damages. It&#x27;s worth the U.S. spending hundreds of billions of dollars a year on climate-change mitigation. The EU is planning on spending 260 billion euro annually by 2030. That&#x27;s roughly the scale of Biden&#x27;s plan.<p>But the &quot;World War II-style&quot; mobilization of the economy that Green New Deal advocates want will hurt economic growth by more than climate change will. If we go from 3% annual GDP growth to 2% annually we&#x27;ll shoot ourselves in the foot.')
