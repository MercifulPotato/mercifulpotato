Just because Europe loves to regulate itself to death so that the useless politicians can justify their salaries doesn&#x27;t mean that will produce successful software companies. That&#x27;s not how innovation works.<p>Just look at Russia, who despite having less wealth than the EU, has managed to produce its own Google in the form of Yandex. The EU has no Google of its own.<p>If we could have made our own Google we would have done it already, without regulations. But we can&#x27;t. I mean, we could do it if we would put our minds and money to it just like we did with Concorde or Airbus but we&#x27;re too cheap and ignorant to do it when we could just use and work for the OG Google from across the pond.<p>Increasing regulation in tech will only benefit the huge and bloated big consultancy corps and no way help with innovation.')
