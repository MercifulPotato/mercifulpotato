Item(by='unishark', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607150632, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25311682, text='Even in a language without pointers, in a multidimensional array you can index the data one-dimensionally by array[index0 + N * index1] with 0-based indexing, as opposed to array[index0 + N * (index1-1)]. Where N is the length of the inner nested array.<p>And for that matter all algorithms for which zero-based indexing makes more sense are simpler, such as working with polynomials and expansions where the zeroth power is included in the expansion.<p>Having said that, I too prefer 1-based indexing because the list of algorithms that are written more cleanly (i.e. without constantly causing bugs when you implement them) is far larger for me personally, including all of linear algebra and related numerical methods.')
