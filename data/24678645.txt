Skinner&#x27;s research.<p>I was quite shocked reading about the Skinner boxes and felt empathy for the mice after having been trapped in one myself.<p>By coincidence I went with a friend to a lecture at the local university at this time... some guy called Richard Stallman was speaking about computers.<p>I came home and installed Linux, I have been learning what I need to participate in this fight ever since.<p>Originally I just wanted to be free from manipulation, so I put in the hours to protect myself.. but now I want everyone to be free from manipulations so I try to find out which kind of software I should contribute and maintain to move us closer to that dream.')
