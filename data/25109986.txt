We will move in (1500 square meters of) office space in February and currently plan the grand IT picture. We will definitely hire up to 4 IT guys (DevOp, SecOp or how you call them today).<p>As we will do basic R&amp;D and lab work, we have a big need for security. As we are all technically skilled people, we favour Linux on the desktop.<p>Here is my question: What&#x27;s the modern way of an enterprise level Linux infrastructure? Given that I would not want to use a notebook where I have not root, what&#x27;s the best way to implement a functional concept?<p>I just wonder whether the answer is to go to some Linux vendor (such as RHEL) and buy everything in.<p>I would love to hear opinions or keywords from the HN community.')
