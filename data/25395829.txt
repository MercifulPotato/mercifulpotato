Just look at the huge differences between different states (and in Canada&#x27;s case, provinces).<p>After all, two months ago you might have said that Sweden did much worse than the EU. Yet at this moment, the EU <i>average</i> reported deaths-per-capita is just slightly below Sweden&#x27;s, with many countries significantly above.')
