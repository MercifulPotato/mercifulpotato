Looks to like someone saying they don’t want to host someone else’s crap.<p>It would be a form of censorship if private companies were forced to host content they didn’t want to host.<p>&gt; Giant corporations aren’t simply following court orders, they are acting on their own now. This is problematic for a multitude of reasons. The precedent has been established.<p>I think this is a completely different problem that stems from anti-competitive behaviour. If we’re unhappy with a few large companies acting as extra-judicial gatekeepers, then we should break them up and increase competition and diversity in the market.<p>If they hold a natural monopoly, then we should make them utilities, and make it explicitly clear that government is controlling their behaviour, and concepts like the 1st amendment should apply to them.<p>What we shouldn’t do is try to fix this problem by having governments force private companies to host certain content. For the same reason we don’t want governments forcing private individuals to express certain speech.')
