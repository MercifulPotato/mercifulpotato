It&#x27;s great for building extremely lightweight environments that will run on any machine.<p>The productivity side of it is slightly exaggerated (in terms of tiling vs stacking manager), and i didn&#x27;t find myself saving so much time. One thing i&#x27;ve always missed from the stacking manager is the window overlap - i do that quite often, especially when reading something while doing stuff on another window - most sites have side panels that don&#x27;t react well to changing window sizes and with stacking window, you can just place them optimally and hide the stuff you don&#x27;t want to see.<p>The only issue i&#x27;ve had with it is how it handled popups. For example the andoid emulator window was a pain, also some dialog windows.<p>I don&#x27;t think i will be ever coming back to tiling WMs. It was nice infatuation.')
