As a developer I absolutely love it and it has changed my workflow completely.<p>I haven&#x27;t run into any limitations that kept me from doing what I wanted to do with it, and some minor adjustments like using wsl2host helps bridge any gaps.<p>What did we sacrifice along the way? Well, apparently we can&#x27;t change our Windows network config or see Windows processes through Linux tools that weren&#x27;t designed for it anyway.<p>And we want that sort of thing because, it&#x27;s, uhh, &quot;cool&quot;?
