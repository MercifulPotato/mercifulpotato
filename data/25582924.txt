Because that is what current autonomy does.<p>I&#x27;m willing to believe that current tech is capable of being safer than human drivers, simply because they do so many things way better than humans do, like stopping for pedestrians and safely navigating around cyclists. But to compare them <i>in general</i>, that is left to be proven. You can&#x27;t just compare incidents per mile driven, because autonomous vehicles can conveniently opt out of driving whenever the task gets too hard.')
