This disparity between the two signals there is lots still to discover that will paint the whole picture.<p>Similarly Newtonian physics was also well understood and worked great, and still does; but as it turned out, there is a bigger story. The way things go, i think it&#x27;s reasonable to suggest that current physics is just another stepping stone on our way to something even better that will unlock much more capabilities. It&#x27;s been what - ~300 or so years since Newton and ~100 since quantum mechanics. We&#x27;re basically in our infancy, can&#x27;t draw ultimate conclusions about what is possible for our destiny. What will happen in the next 200 years?')
