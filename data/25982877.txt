In the last [edit: 88] years nobody had lost a single penny to a bank run or default including 2008s WaMu default thanks to the FDIC.<p>Crypto fractional reserve like tether has no backstop and that’s a completely different beast. It’s what exacerbated the Great Depression.<p>As with all blockchain unless the state is 100% totally and utterly encapsulated within the blockchain, then it’s garbage in, garbage immutably recorded. Which is why the only thing you can do with crypto is currency and kitties.')
