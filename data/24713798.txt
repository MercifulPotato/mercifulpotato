Item(by='lucb1e', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602111535, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24705082, text='&gt; Without ECC RAM, how would you know that you had a single bit flip?<p>Errors, glitches, or files with unexplained errors. If there is a bit flip in code, more likely than not that&#x27;ll be an invalid instruction, jump, or something like that, so it would crash. If it&#x27;s in data, often there&#x27;s some algorithm involved (compression, linked list, js&#x2F;css&#x2F;html, whatever), so that would either find invalid data and crash or display an error, or display at least a wrong pixel to a certain degree (but, true, I&#x27;d have to spot a single color channel being off and there&#x27;s, let&#x27;s say, a 4&#x2F;8 chance of the significance being too low to really see; but this only applies to a raw bitmap case). Data on disk should also become corrupted (I&#x27;m thinking of image or video editing, data processing like gigabytes of port scans that I recently processed, etc.) if it was inadvertently modified in RAM. There are a ton of ways to notice this, though admittedly also a certain number of cases where one wouldn&#x27;t.<p>I see your point though, like, if the error is silently corrected by the software or I just hit retry and don&#x27;t figure what the error must have been (also because it won&#x27;t be reproducible), I&#x27;m unlikely to find out that I need ECC. Maybe I should introduce random bit flips on a raspberry pi (so I don&#x27;t corrupt my actual production filesystem) and use that for an evening for browsing &#x2F; programming &#x2F; other usual activities to either prove or disprove the theory that I&#x27;d notice if this happens with any sort of regularity.')
