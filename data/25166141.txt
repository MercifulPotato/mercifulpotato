I still don&#x27;t understand why they made that choice.<p>At least they do play nice with the whole &quot;systemd owns the Cgroups tree&quot; story. A thing that was always a bit painful with docker.<p>Fun note. Systemd-nspawn actually can run OCI containers directly as well these days. However I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s feature-complete')
