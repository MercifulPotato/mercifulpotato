The (very) old school way was to have indexed logs accessible over HTTP. You can almost certainly still find IRC logs on google this way --<p>If it’s internal just stick an ELK stack behind an authentication proxy it’s 20 minutes of work, an hour most with the addition of a log bot which joins public channels.<p>This is for IRC though, better options exist for things like Zulip or Matrix. (non-exhaustive list, obviously)<p>Side note though: I find it weird that this is the bar. It comes up every thread but it’s tantamount to a “ha! Gotcha!”, because no -sane- messaging system logs its history in a way that is retrievable immediately because indexing -all that content- is expensive and better off being centralised; additionally chat history (almost by definition) loses relevance quickly.<p>It’s almost certainly an anti-pattern when you feel the need to refer to things you said 2 years ago, immediately, in the same client you used to write those things.<p>I don’t know how you’re using slack though, so I guess it’s pretty central to your flow.<p>EDIT: am I wrong? Is this normal? Someone correct me please if you’re not happy with what I say.')
