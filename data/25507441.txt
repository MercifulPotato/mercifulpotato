If someone gets genetic modification to enhance, say, their muscles abilities to use energy, how are you going to police that?<p>&gt; Have everyone playing submit their genome for examination?<p>My point is is that it does not matter. What is current top competition sport is not natural anymore so I do not really care about whether they take drugs (illegal today, maybe legal tomorrow) or not. Or modify they genome.<p>Wasn&#x27;t there a case of a (South African?) athlete who was asked for a sample of their DNA to check weather they were a man or a woman? (it was not that long time ago I think)')
