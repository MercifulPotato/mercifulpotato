The 2020 machine is faster and that is great, but its also 3 years newer.<p>Is this more or less than the expected improvement in benchmarks if this were an Ice Lake or Ryzen 4000 CPU in an equivalent form factor? Are there similar benchmarks comparing e.g. a 2020 Dell XPS 13 to an M1 Macbook Pro?')
