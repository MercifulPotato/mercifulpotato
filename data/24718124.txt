Item(by='the_af', descendants=None, kids=[24718232], score=None, time=1602156902, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24716297, text='No, your intuition is misleading you: it&#x27;s not a choice between <i>two</i> doors. If the probabilities don&#x27;t convince you, you can easily simulate this by using three cards and considering one is the car and the other two goats. Pick one at random, then pick the remaining &quot;goat&quot; as if you were Monty; lastly, switch your initial choice as a player. Repeat the experiment 10 times and count how many times you win; remember you must always switch. You will win more often than lose! I tried this, that&#x27;s how I know this <i>will</i> convince you.<p>Monty opening a door with a goat doesn&#x27;t change the probability of your initial door being right: it&#x27;s always 1&#x2F;3. You&#x27;re not choosing between two doors; you&#x27;re choosing between &quot;I think I got it right the first time&quot; (1&#x2F;3) vs &quot;I got it wrong the first time&quot; (2&#x2F;3) -- the second is more probable.<p>The game where there are two simultaneous participants, both free to open any door (including both picking the same door) only muddles things and offers no insight. It&#x27;s effectively two simultaneous but independent games. How they are going to split the price if they both win, anyway? ;)')
