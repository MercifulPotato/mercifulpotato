Worked on automated tests - nobody is willing to discuss this or do the required changes like fixing Angular timeouts and assigning some unqiue-id&#x27;s to elements that tests don&#x27;t break. We misuse the API from the parent project we are building a plugin for - some calls take 3s or more instead of feasible 100ms if correctly implemented. We have a useless PHP addon that constantly breaks for &quot;performance&quot; but it&#x27;s slower than doing it in Java correctly. Brought all of this up. It&#x27;s not even a topic.')
