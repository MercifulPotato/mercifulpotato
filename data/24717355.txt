Just like any large organization, things can go off the rails and move far away from the original intended purpose.<p>But at the same time, you only really hear about the bad unions.  The ones that fairly represent their members and partner with management to find common ground (obviously this is dependent on good management as well)?  Those don&#x27;t get talked about much.')
