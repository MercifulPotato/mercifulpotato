Then they got this thing nder control quite fast, with harsh measures.<p>It is still not possible to tell whther the Swedish way was the bast way or not. Lockdowns worked in the early days, the goal was to avoid overloading hospitals. Stuff like SARS and MERS didn&#x27;t spread by planes to a large extent, did they? So not banning them kind of made sense, until people learned more and their opinion changed.<p>Lockdowns helped halt the spread when the virus wasn&#x27;t already everywehere, at least much better then they would now where the virus has spread across the globe, more or less.<p>And just yesterday, Germany and France reinstituted lockdowns. Things change, and I&#x27;d rather listen to people who change their minds with changed facts instead of broken clocks that a right twice per day.')
