Bluetooth connections as well as decoding are done in hardware using commodity chips that can&#x27;t do much else. Adding additional audio processing hardware will increase the complexity of these chips which translates to higher prices and lower battery efficiency.<p>Remember, some of those devices have 20mA of battery. The codecs already have to be made easy to decode.<p>There is also absolutely no need to limiting processing to a static convolution with an impulse response. That&#x27;s just the only device-specific processing you have to do. Headphones are minimum phase devices, so except for things like distortion, they can basically be described by their single impulse response.<p>For the rest, like spatial audio, or EQ, or anything of the sort, there is no need to do it per headphone, it&#x27;s the same for all of them.')
