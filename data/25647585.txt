I would not recommend playing it with young children for instance. However I would myself not put in the same box as other games in the &quot;intense violence&quot; category.<p>Mostly because and this may sound silly, but it&#x27;s not &quot;violence in motion&quot;. You are viewing a murder scene, and someone died, and you might hear someone take the last breaths of their life. Which has a very high emotional impact which should not be ignored. But that to me is still fundamentally different from gory&#x2F;bloody games with often fast visceral violence. \nAs mentioned by others, the scenes themselves are calmed a lot by the dithering art-style.<p>I would say about the emotional content though that this hits differently from other stories where characters die because of the narrative tool. You never have a Game of Thrones moment where a character you are heavily invested in suddenly dies, because even though you learn about the passengers and feel for them in their misery, you also realize up front even before you learn about them that they have died and you are just looking at memories before that event.')
