Not because it isn&#x27;t a good article but because everything has been said a thousand times. As far as I can tell we are pretty much stuck because so much code has already been written with old licenses. It is becoming more and more alike to how W3C has become a standards body for Big Business and, what at least feels like, anti-user. A shared license might work but I&#x27;m not sure I would add any code to it.<p>In my opinion this is the old &quot;Capitalism versus Communism&quot; all over again.
