There&#x27;s no way you&#x27;re going to get tax paying americans to hop on the socialize education bandwagon when the assumption is the average college student that holds debt got a degree in acrobatic water polo...<p>The one message that did stand out to me and we kind of have it already was this: &quot;That system should be reformed going forward, with a shift toward income-based repayment.&quot; While we do have that, I think having a standard percentage having to be paid as opposed to case-by-case scenarios of individuals dealing with it themselves.<p>The funniest thing to me is how the average student handles debt. From my knowledge working at a bank and seeing non-working students, they couldn&#x27;t budget a single checking account. A lot of them have this misinterpretation of finances as though &quot;that is money I can use freely whenever.&quot; Not only do none of these kids know personal finance, they don&#x27;t even know basic accounting principles. Most traditional students are either A: affluent and risk averse meaning they don&#x27;t incur debt; B: affluent but also take out loans because &quot;why not&quot;; or C: low income and treat debt as a means to get free money. I have rarely ever if at all met a student who has a budget, does double entry accounting for their finances, and properly manages debt.<p>I just feel like the government in this scenario, both sides, would never just pay off the debt of all student loans. It&#x27;s just not profitable and the economy&#x27;s student loan bubble hasn&#x27;t burst yet, which will be the only way they would do something. Honestly the only way for banks to truly take a total loss is if the person with the loan dies before it&#x27;s paid seeing as you can&#x27;t dissolve it by declaring bankruptcy.<p>However we shouldn&#x27;t be looking entirely at students for this. Colleges are the most liable here. No other institution in the United States can act with such free autonomy while siphoning tax payers income. Also they can just jack up prices that in the private sector would be considered price gouging. The cost of doing business in education has certainly not increased. Another thing colleges do is they routinely play pretend and lie to you that the &quot;job placement rate&quot; for a program has anything to do with the field they&#x27;re in or that it was the degree that got them the job. It really takes a keen and jaded individual to see through these just blatant lies! College institutions are extraordinarily predatory.')
