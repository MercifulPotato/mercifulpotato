It can be generally useful for all those entities to have access to a single source of truth that can&#x27;t be altered without the alteration being obvious.<p>You <i>can</i> do this by appointing someone as a trusted authority. But, in practice, this has overhead and no one is <i>completely</i> trustworthy at least absent a lot of overhead. You also often have to deal with reconciliation when there are a bunch of different data stores scattered around.<p>BTW, Hyperledger is the overall foundation of projects. Hyperledger Fabric is the most popular blockchain platform under the foundation. (There are also various libraries and so forth.)')
