It is certainly doable, but you will not be able to afford any other luxuries.<p>I would consider Paris a top-tier city, and while none of my friends make more than 100k, half of us bought our house already (we&#x27;re all late 20s, early 30s, with a few kids starting to pop-up).<p>If you make 80k€[1] pre-tax in Paris (that&#x27;s a good salary for SWE here), you can borrow more than 300k€. For a couple, that means buying a 700k€ flat&#x2F;house, you can even live in the middle of Paris for that price! And we&#x27;re talking about one of the most expensive city in Europe, with a massive housing bubble since 2000 (where the price was 2.74 times lower, adjusted for the evolution of salaries[2]).<p>In Europe, you are affluent with less than 100k€.<p>[1]: I&#x27;m talking about «super brut», which is how much money you cost to your employer, not the «brut» which appears on your working contract (which would be around 57k€ in this example)<p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stymaar.fr&#x2F;net&#x2F;Capture%20du%202021-01-14%2012-11-55.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stymaar.fr&#x2F;net&#x2F;Capture%20du%202021-01-14%2012-11-55....</a>, source Jacques Friggit (<a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cgedd.developpement-durable.gouv.fr&#x2F;prix-immobilier-evolution-a-long-terme-a1048.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cgedd.developpement-durable.gouv.fr&#x2F;prix-immobili...</a>)')
