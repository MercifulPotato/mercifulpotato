There is no use-case for reproducing every keystroke. Major edits would be fine after literally only after a major save, or a day has passed.<p>FYI - this is a kind of &#x27;biometric&#x27; leakage eh.<p>Your typing style is probably as unique as your finger print.<p>It&#x27;s not shockingly bad, but probably something, under thoughtful review, they should take care of.<p>Edit: by &#x27;no use case&#x27; I mean, no use case for long term history. Obviously there&#x27;s a good use case for &#x27;very short term&#x27; individual keystrokes.<p>Also Edit: the answer to this issue is not &#x27;Don&#x27;t worry about it, it&#x27;s a low risk problem&#x27;. This is the &#x27;slow boil&#x27;  SV way of thinking that is seemingly benign, but not acceptable in the long run. The answer is: <i>don&#x27;t store personal data that is unnecessary</i>. It&#x27;s that simple. It doesn&#x27;t diminish the product a single bit.')
