Item(by='gjulianm', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609877088, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25647513, text='&gt; I cannot imagine there is something extra-ordinarily hard that mathematicians do, that is somehow not captured by how a Go player approaches the game.<p>It&#x27;s not &quot;extraordinarily hard&quot; but the issue is that math does not have a well-defined search space. A lot of times, proving statements requires quite a lot of intermediate results, additional tools and definitions... There is more creativity in math proofs that people think, and I don&#x27;t think ML algorithms will be able to reproduce that. At most I see specific algorithms for limited purposes.')
