If you create $1MM value but cost $500K, and someone in the Midwest can create that same $1MM value for only $150K, it&#x27;s pretty obvious what most companies will choose.<p>FAANG companies somehow convinced themselves that paying $500K for talent in SV made sense even if they could get similar talent basically anywhere else in the US for less. This massive WFH experiment that we&#x27;ve all been in seems to have demonstrated to some of them that physical location doesn&#x27;t really matter as much as they thought. The next logical step is that paying inflated rates to hire someone in a particular physical location doesn&#x27;t make sense, if you&#x27;re just going to have them work remote anyway.<p>WFH may just be the pin that burst the SV tech wage bubble.')
