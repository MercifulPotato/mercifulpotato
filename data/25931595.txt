Tesla destination chargers [1] will charge non-Tesla vehicles with an adapter. I have this adapter [2], and my friend&#x27;s Bolt charges from my home charger (a high power wall charger on a 100A circuit) when he&#x27;s over for beers.<p>It <i>is</i> true that the V3 version of the Tesla destination charger (which is relatively new), which has a microcontroller&#x2F;wifi&#x2F;etc, has a config flag you can set to only charge Tesla vehicles and can whitelist by VIN, but it&#x27;s still in the very early stage of release.<p>@vel0city: In response to your deleted reply to this comment, if legacy automakers want access to Tesla&#x27;s supercharging network for their own EVs, they should be prepared to contribute towards the enormous capex costs Tesla incurred as well as the ongoing operational expenses. Otherwise, legacy automakers who made <i>no material effort</i> to transition to EVs are free riding off of Tesla&#x27;s hard work to build the network they now desperately need to remain in business.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tesla.com&#x2F;destination-charging" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tesla.com&#x2F;destination-charging</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;smile.amazon.com&#x2F;Lectron-Tesla-Charger-J1772-Adapter&#x2F;dp&#x2F;B07V7V2QT8" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;smile.amazon.com&#x2F;Lectron-Tesla-Charger-J1772-Adapter...</a>')
