Iâ€™m in Seattle, and I feel like the areas with sharrows are consistently the streets where I am (as a commuting cyclist) tailgated by cars or finding myself (as a errand-running motorist) unable to safely pass a cyclist for a very, very long time. And those sharrow streets are often an inefficient route for cyclists with no clear indication for how the route would be improved.')
