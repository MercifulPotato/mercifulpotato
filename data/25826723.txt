Black-Scholes was used in industry before academia, and is only used in a heavily adjusted form (for example, option MMs have never used it as the only pricing input). MPT isn&#x27;t useful: volatility doesn&#x27;t describe risk to any degree (possibly as you move to the limit of retirement age...but then, not really), the empirical relationship is actually the inverse of that predicted by MPT (i.e. the model is not only wrong, it is misleading and will cause you to lose money), and it is easy to construct superior models that beat MPT models in every way (and even those aren&#x27;t very good because they often use the same theoretical underpinning...again, most of these models exist because the subject needs to be taught in universities and needs to build on stuff learned earlier...the practical use is zero, which is why no-one really uses these theories...the only place I have seen them used at scale is in investment consultancies, and most of these places are clueless).')
