The actual legal definition of tools covers both actual technical purpose as well as <i>marketed</i> purpose. Rebranding, say, OBS as &quot;Recorder for YouTube&quot; and talking about how you can use it to get around YouTube&#x27;s downloading protections by screencapping the entire video would possibly constitute a 1201 violation.<p>There&#x27;s also another question of law, though: does 1201 apply when only the intent of the DRM has been circumvented, as opposed to it&#x27;s technical scope? In other words, does pointing a camera at a monitor constitute circumvention of DRM under section 1201? Most DRM can&#x27;t actually validate, say, that a human is watching instead of a camcorder. (Let&#x27;s ignore pesky things like Cinavia which are more akin to post-piracy frustration techniques, and easily circumvented with any kind of Free media player.) Likewise, YouTube&#x27;s rolling cipher can&#x27;t really validate that it&#x27;s not sitting inside of an instrumented browser that will dump whatever URLs it grabs. Our hypothetical OBS rebrand wouldn&#x27;t actually be a 1201 violation unless the law specifically covers things that DRM can&#x27;t technically enforce but would like to.')
