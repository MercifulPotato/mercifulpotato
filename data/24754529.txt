I probably update my basic package compiles once every month (which is often because I work on a lot of packages of course), and many of the SciML users report updating PackageCompiler sysimages every few months. With that, the basic compile times are gone. Given that as a &quot;new standard&quot;, we might as well include some times with compile times in a user-improved environment.')
