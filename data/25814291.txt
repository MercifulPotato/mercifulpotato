Item(by='akamaka', descendants=None, kids=[25816700, 25814802, 25814956], score=None, time=1610913299, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25800576, text='It seems to be part of the New York Times style guidelines to put everything into context of presidential politics.<p>For example, they published an  article yesterday about the technical merits of hypersonic missiles, but instead of focusing on the details, it was full of phrases like “Biden will have to decide on the future of Trump’s program...”<p>In reality, the president doesn’t get into the minutiae of weapon system design.  I find the NYT’s style very irritating to read, since I have to spend too much time filtering out the rather meaningless political fluff to find the nuggets of useful information.')
