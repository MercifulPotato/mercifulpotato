It would do the usual. Parse descriptions and try to find keywords there, parse and count the number of comments mentioning family-related topics, up-score hotels with certain facilities and then push the images through Google Cloud Vision APIs to re-order the images putting first the ones with children, pools, playgrounds, etc.<p>With that done, just an app to find hotels by searching anywhere.<p>It was more built for personal use but ended up being quite attractive.
