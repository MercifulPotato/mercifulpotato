Item(by='gambiting', descendants=None, kids=[24925823], score=None, time=1603928409, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24923852, text='For me personally, in Control, 720p upscaled with DLSS to 1080p looks better than native 1080p presentation. I say that with a hand on my heart, the DLSS image is cleaner, the lines are sharper, and the texture filtering is just vastly superior. I have no idea how they are doing it, because it seems to be pure black magic, the traditional logic of &quot;upscaled can never look as good as native&quot; has been completely thrown out of the window. It doesn&#x27;t look as good - it looks better in my opinion.')
