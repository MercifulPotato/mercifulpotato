If I hold myname.com, it&#x27;s $1. If I hold a thousand domain, the last 500 are at $1000&#x2F;year.<p>People will just form a thousand LLCs or use straw men.<p>&gt; Managed by a government institution or not-for-profit with open meetings, salary caps, public records requests, and other (legally-enforceable) checks-and-balances.<p>I think you&#x27;re making this too complicated.<p>Just prohibit them from ever raising the price or changing the terms on an existing registrant. The cost of hosting goes down over time, so the price should <i>never</i> increase. If you started off paying $10&#x2F;year, it never goes up, the end.<p>And then create more sensible top-level domains, like when they&#x27;re industry-specific. Then there is more competition between TLDs and the value of good names stays lower, which discourages squatting because it&#x27;s less profitable when good names are less scarce.')
