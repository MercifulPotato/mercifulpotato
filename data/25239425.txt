Sounds like an interesting problem for the reader for sure. :)<p><i>edited with suggestion to call use-package</i> I&#x27;m not very familiar with the lisp packaging stuff yet.<p>Here&#x27;s what I was trying to do:<p><pre><code>  * (load &quot;test-framework.lisp&quot;)\n  T\n  * (use-package :lisp-koans.test)\n  T\n  * (assert-equal t t)\n\n  debugger invoked on a UNBOUND-VARIABLE in thread\n  #&lt;THREAD &quot;main thread&quot; RUNNING {1001570143}&gt;:\n  The variable LISP-KOANS.TEST::*KOAN-ASSERT-LIST* is unbound.\n</code></pre>\nAha it looks like it&#x27;s part of the code that is testing for blanks in the original form.<p><pre><code>  (if (form-contains-blanks-p form)\n      (push :incomplete *koan-assert-list*)\n</code></pre>\nThat seems like it&#x27;s fixable, maybe I will open a bug for that. I don&#x27;t think it expects to run outside of the run-koan function.  That&#x27;s fine, I&#x27;ll stop there until I know enough to fix it haha.<p>Also thanks for answering my noob questions!  I just realized you also wrote the Common Lisp Condition System which is on my TO-READ list (after I do about 100 hours of lisp refresher stuff lol).')
