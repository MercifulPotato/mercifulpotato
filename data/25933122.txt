At what point does killing become a crime? When you kill an ant for no reason? When you kill an animal for food? Or when you kill another human for survival? Intuitively I know the differences. But articulating my intuition into words can lead to loop holes so I&#x27;d rather not.<p>The moral module in your mind is not perfect but when looking at Ikea, it&#x27;s telling me Ikea is an getting an unfair advantage with this loop hole and it&#x27;s ethically wrong. That&#x27;s enough for most people.<p>&gt;It&#x27;s either legal or it&#x27;s not. If you want the &quot;abuse&quot; to stop, then elect the legislators that will make the loopholes illegal.<p>You don&#x27;t need a law to tell the difference from right and wrong and nothing is as simple as electing the right person to make things right again. Who do I elect to save dying infrastructure in the US? Who do I elect to stop corporations from paying less taxes than me? It&#x27;s not so clear cut, what I&#x27;m voting for or how to fix this.<p>I don&#x27;t know where you&#x27;re reasoning comes from, but one thing is for sure. I&#x27;d share your exact attitude if I&#x27;m a beneficiary of said loop holes in laws. My mind would twist the obvious logic to justify my own crimes if I myself were the ass hole that was committing them.')
