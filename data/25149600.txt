But it&#x27;s <i>yet another barrier to entry</i> for students and people that just want to hack on their own computer at will.<p>It&#x27;s also a potentially dangerous first step towards forcing new versions of MacOS to only run code from <i>verified developers</i> - those that pay Apple. Again, trivial for commericial development, but a major issue for non-commercial use.')
