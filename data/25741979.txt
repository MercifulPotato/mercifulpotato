Certainly infrastructure like AWS or the app store should be considered exactly like a utility.<p>The problem is with little forums or sub groups like sub reddits, how can they curate the content according to this law? Maybe the solution is to enforce service for everybody but give clients the option to choose curation so twitter will be able to block Trump for whoever agree to sub reddit moderator being the curator but if you don&#x27;t agree to it you will see all messages.')
