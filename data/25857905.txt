And those that we know are bloodletting, how do we get rid of them as a society?<p>Instead of thinking of these surgeries as ineffective and looking to restrict their use, we can think of the placebo as effective in many cases, and try to lower their cost.<p>In America, high healthcare costs are partly driven by the fact that Americans are  over medicated and doctors are incentivized to intervene.
