Some old windows games such as Vangers, Operation: Inner Space and Astrorock 2000 used to do this.<p>I guess both cases applied better to 2D games, specifically more arcade-y space stuff, so probably it went out of style when arcade went out of style, and when 3D game environments (specifically first&#x2F;third person) became more prominent.<p>Another thing that I found is that implementing this wrapping yourself while using a commercial game engine, without actually fighting the engine, is usually quite tricky, as most aren&#x27;t really built to deal with this sort of stuff. That might be another side-reason for not being as popular anymore.')
