Here is Steve Jobs&#x27;s &quot;Thoughts on Flash&quot; letter from 2010 that brought it down: \n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20170615060422&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.apple" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20170615060422&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.apple</a>...<p>And now we have giant js bundles composed of thousands of little libraries, ad hoc animation, subpar media playback.<p>The web stack wasn&#x27;t prepared to match the ease of authorship and distribution of Flash. It still isn&#x27;t up to the same par, and it&#x27;s been 15 years.<p>If Adobe had open sourced the entire standard and the player itself early on, they&#x27;d still have the best authorship tool and would have done amazing things. I don&#x27;t know what they were thinking. They had an awesome tool, but their strategy was so wrong.<p>Flash was like PHP. Admittedly not the prettiest, but people did amazing things with it. It was a tool that worked for a lot of people. <i>Teenagers</i> were using Flash and getting really good.<p>Steve didn&#x27;t want Flash eating his batteries, so he killed it on Apple. He also left us with the fucking robber barron App Store and the concept that we can&#x27;t run stuff or upgrade our own devices. Seems like Apple shouldn&#x27;t be able to dictate what you can or can&#x27;t run on their platform - that&#x27;s monopoly power. They killed Flash.<p>Steve was worse than Flash and stole from us.')
