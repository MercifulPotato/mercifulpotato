Very nice, but also heavy. I think around 500â‚¬.<p>Today I use 2 Anker 21 solar W and 3 power banks for half the price and at least triple the power.\n(downside is only USB charge, meaning not possible for many laptops, unlike the power gorilla)<p>Also laptops really improved in battery life and power efficency, meaning, when I started doing it 10 years ago, I could only really work consistently, when I had a real power source nearby. Otherwise it was maybe 2 days of full-time working.<p>Today I can work forever off the grid, on my cheap rugged Asus Chromebook, as long as the sun shines from time to time and I have a safe place to put up the solar panels. \nAll in all my mobile office equipment is 4-5 kg. \nFor short trips with laptop, 1 panel and 1 powerbanks, cables,.. 2.5 kg. Which is managable, even when you carry also your tent and food.<p>Combining working in nature really helps my creativity and I can recommend trying this out.\nThe tech really is ready today, unless you want to do heavy video editing or 3D Design.<p>But coding, in my case mainly with chrome dev tools and node, really works fine off grid. There are new insights to be gained, from top of a mountain, tree, or next to a river, compared to your never changing office wall.')
