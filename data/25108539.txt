Originally Amazon used the Linux namespaces, cgroups, etc. for isolating Lambda invocations, but they only did this at the AWS account granularity (i.e. your Lambdas only shared the same VM with other Lambdas from your account) for security reasons. They built FirecrackerVM so they could run Lambdas freely on the same bare metal machine as others without having to group by tenant VM in this way. Obviously they found using the Linux primitives to be insufficient for maintaining isolation when dealing with hostile native code.')
