More seriously, I would not accept your claim with evidence as weak as that.  Roll the dice a few more times and then I&#x27;ll credit your claim.  Rolling the dice only once when you could just as easily roll them a dozen times is junk science.<p>Incidentally, this trick is something magicians sometimes do.  Sometimes when a trick has gone wrong they&#x27;ll make a wild guess.  If they&#x27;re right, the audience is impressed.  If they&#x27;re wrong, they&#x27;ll brush it aside with some joke and the audience won&#x27;t notice&#x2F;mind much.  This works for things card guessing tricks and puedo-psychic&#x2F;cold reading stuff.')
