People thought I was being too dramatic when I had been saying this for the past four angry years (for everyone): Stop frivolously accusing young white men of being &quot;racists,&quot; and being &quot;Nazis.&quot; Don&#x27;t use those words to beat people over the head with it. The political mindset that enables the use of those words as blunt weapons against those we hate is resentment-based and vengeance is its goal.<p>The use of these terms as bludgeons in a lot of these youth cultures combined with a culture that makes young men feel increasingly isolated with its habitual treatment of them that is at best arid and at worst psychologically abusive. &quot;They&#x27;ll be alright,&quot; everyone reasons. &quot;They have everything given to them by default.&quot; By whom?<p>In my guesstimation, it amounts to gaslighting. Young angry white men feel deprived by society of anything to grasp, or to believe in, or to look forward to, or to work toward. Then they&#x27;re told that, even though they were among the first generation that was wholly ready to forget about race and ignore it as a social factor... they were told, oh no, you&#x27;re always racist. In fact, irony of ironies, you&#x27;re racist by blood and birth. How sustainable is such a social environment before legions of terrified young men start picking up the label that has been thrown at their feet and wearing it as a badge of honor because it&#x27;s the only possible identity they have left? &quot;Fine, I&#x27;ll give them something to treat like shit.&quot;<p>Plus, those are not the sorts of words (racist and Nazi) we should risk over-using and numbing people to... We kinda want them to keep their sting. So, let&#x27;s not morph them into a weapon to justify treating our fellow humans poorly. I think doing that might actually mass-produce neo-Nazis.')
