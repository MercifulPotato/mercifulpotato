Most people would not like to take risks and would not even think about stepping outside of their comfort zone.<p>In some sense this is true, but lets not get carried away. The American Startupism is all about the flash, big growth, big impact, big IPO. \nIn EU you have companies slowly grinding a hard problem for 20 years that also have huge impact but no flashy news. Look at things like vertical farming, ASLR, fintech. Thats all thanks to low risk and stability.')
