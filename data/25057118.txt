Some apps can&#x27;t be sandboxed totally without modifications.\nSo the take is more Flatpak apps are not systematically sandboxed.<p>The &quot;sandboxed&quot; icon issue is not even flatpak, but Gnome Software which is NOT flatpak, which makes me doubt about some other parts of this article as well.<p>My take on Flatpak is that it&#x27;s still very much work in progress but does go on the right direction. The core issue is that it&#x27;s not popular enough to be considered as an official way to package software and a lot of it is packaged by Redhat developers or the community. Which means that a package can be easily abandoned, or modifications in the software itself that would allow proper sandboxing are not happening.')
