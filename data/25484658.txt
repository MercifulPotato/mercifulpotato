Clearly the vast majority of us don’t have the autonomy at work or the compensation that those Steves have&#x2F;had. There are many types of work that people enjoy and not just in prestigious fields. The problems with work arise out of issues such as:<p>- Businesses being incentivized to pay as little as possible<p>- Workers not being treated with dignity, not allowed enough time to recover from being ill or take vacation to mentally recharge<p>- Workers being pressured to maximize for output rather than their own experience at work<p>Of course work can be great for some people, but it’s intentional blindness to look around and tell the worlds workers most of us are in a position where work is fulfilling rather than a demanding stressor that asks more of us while corporate entities attempt to cut pay and benefits. You can call it overemphasis on short term thinking or a systematic failure of capitalism. But work is demanding and often even unforgiving to most workers.')
