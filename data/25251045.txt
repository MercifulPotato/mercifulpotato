I wanted to know if I was capable of butchering. With some training from a pro, I did it around 6 times(goat). Gave up on meat since.<p>For some reason I don&#x27;t feel the same disgust with fishing, so my diet is mostly replaced with fish. Good thing about sea food is you get a lot more variety!')
