Then with vendor specific stuff that you don&#x27;t need, such IAM, and then when you think everything is alright, you notice your bandwidth is caped after 1 hour running your ec2, that your port 25 is magically broken (docs were updated years later after much complains), everything is a slow black box.<p>Cloud is like chopping your both legs and being happy with it.')
