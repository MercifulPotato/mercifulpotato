That scenario likely has the traffic and revenue to justify a full AWS build out.<p>I&#x27;m talking about new projects at much smaller companies, or much smaller departments within the company that don&#x27;t yet know if the product they&#x27;re building is going to even work.<p>Not to mention; I have the same freedoms to try things out with a $10&#x2F;mo DigitalOcean droplet as I do EC2&#x2F;Lambda&#x2F;ELB&#x2F;RDS&#x2F;S3&#x2F;etc...  If something doesn&#x27;t work, delete the droplet and start over.  To that degree, it&#x27;s even easier, cheaper, and more free to just test something out in Docker containers on my laptop.<p>So, respectfully, I&#x27;m not buying the &quot;freedom&quot; argument.  That&#x27;s not even the selling point AWS is pitching.')
