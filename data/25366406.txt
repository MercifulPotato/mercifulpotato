One potential resolution I see is to say that if you see someone making his own nuclear weapons without telling anyone about it, this is strong enough evidence that he&#x27;s going to try to do something terrible (i.e. it looks like a crime in progress) that you would be justified in using force to stop him.<p>How does this generalize and fit into the framework of property rights in general?  What makes, say, manufacturing guns <i>not</i> strong enough evidence of trying to do something terrible?  Is it mere history, or is it the defensive uses of guns, or does the magnitude of the terribleness matter, or something else?  (In practice, I think purifying U-235 takes huge facilities and no one can do it in their backyardâ€”it&#x27;s probably a few orders of magnitude more expensive and complex.)  Also, if it&#x27;s 100% established that this one guy making the nukes is a trustworthy pacifist who won&#x27;t use them, but the problem is he won&#x27;t keep them in a particularly secure location, can one defensibly call his actions illegal?  (&quot;Planning to be neglectful&quot;?  How about someone who <i>will</i> guard them as heavily as he can, but that&#x27;s just not heavily enough?)  There would be a lot to explore there, but I think it <i>may</i> be possible to resolve the issue of nuclear weapons while keeping a pure system of property rights.')
