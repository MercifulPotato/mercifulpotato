Item(by='skrebbel', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608629024, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25498815, text='&gt; Isn&#x27;t this the type of vanity purchase that usually happens after you validate your idea with 10,000 customers and you got a round of investment to go big?<p>- The founder previously flipped his startup Screenhero to Slack and got some cash out of that I suppose.<p>- Interest is negative, that money is just costing money.<p>- Short dictionary domains are a pretty low-risk investment, I don&#x27;t know the market well but I suppose they tend to increase in price over time.<p>- So if the company fails he can sell it. Meanwhile it&#x27;s an asset on the company&#x27;s books so it&#x27;s part of the valuation etc.<p>Sounds like this is the &quot;second startup&quot; version of rich-ish parents buying an apartment near college for their kid to live in, hoping to flip it for more when they graduate. Doesn&#x27;t seem all too &quot;vanity&quot; to me, it&#x27;s just combining pragmatic usefulness with an &quot;good enough&quot; investment opportunity.<p>ps. wow this app works really well!')
