They completely violate the otherwise standard-ish syntax of Lisp, are very poorly documented, impossible to memorize, and are really hard to debug despite the otherwise excellent tooling available for top tier implementations like SBCL. It was our standard practice to replace these macros with more verbose but idiomatic lisp whenever possible.')
