It&#x27;s unfortunate, but also funny - the idea of people spending a great deal of time and thought to produce something and unknowingly giving it an objectionable or obscene name. For example, there is a recommendation engine called TasteDive which started out as &quot;TasteKid&quot;. Does anyone recall other examples here on HN?<p>One show HN-submission a few years ago that I recall but haven&#x27;t been able to trace since was a database startup with an inadvertently obscene logo. The logo was a cartoon beaver or otter lying on it&#x27;s back, waving, supposedly. Commenters on HN pointed out that it looked like the beaver was &quot;air-fellating&quot;, which cheapened the landing page a bit. Anyone remember what I am talking about?')
