It managed around ~50 FPS most of the time, only very occasionally dropping a little below 30 when there was a lot going on. I would try Cyberpunk 2077 on it out of curiosity but I&#x27;m not interested enough in the game to pay the launch price for it.<p>Obviously no hardcore gamer is going to be happy with this, but in general I&#x27;m very happy with the trade-offs Apple has chosen for portable macs and when I do replace this with an Apple Silicon machine, I will be slightly disappointed at losing the ability to play the occasional triple-A game, but not enough so to seriously consider other options.')
