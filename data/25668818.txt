If these things were true then violence would be a logical, reasonable, justified, and appropriate response to stop a hostile anti-democratic takeover of the country.<p>Of course, nothing of Trump&#x27;s claims are true. Not even remotely. Not even a tiny kernel of truth in it.<p>But you just can&#x27;t expect people who actually hold this worldview to quietly stay at home. <i>I wouldn&#x27;t</i>, if this would actually be happening.<p>As I&#x27;ve said many times before, if the current path continues it&#x27;s only a matter of time before there is actual real bloodshed, and Trump and his bootlickers can&#x27;t just wash their hands with &quot;but I said I they had to remain calm!&quot;<p>And if you look at the cause for all of this ... it&#x27;s not even a political disagreement really, it&#x27;s just Trump not being mature enough to accept that a universe exists where he could lose an election. Good heavens all this ruckus for something so petty. Future historians will look back to Trump not too dissimilar to how we look back to Caligula.')
