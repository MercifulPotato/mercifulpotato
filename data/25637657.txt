I had great hopes for the technology and was mostly just following stuff on r&#x2F;bitcoin while also trying to built little proof of concept projects on the side, that could maybe turn into some useful gadget like a payment processing device or similar things.<p>I got out because it turned into exactly a religion. There was no room for questioning the technology or considerations about whether this was really as useful as we thought it would be.')
