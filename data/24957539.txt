I am explaining why they should be considered invalid.<p>&gt;Questions of being inappropriate are, of course, a personal opinion-based judgment call and not a question of legality.<p>Disingenuous. If the law is not agreeable soon it will be unenforceable. I consider the rulings inappropriate both on the basis of constitutionality and on the basis of construction an egalitarian society.<p>Again, see my example about Missouri statutory expenditures on the basis of gender and race. Many states have laws like this. They plainly violate the equal protection clause. You can try to claim the state has an overwhelming interest to ignore the protection clause, but then can&#x27;t it just have an overwhelming interest to violate whatever parts of the constitution it wants? Where does it stop?')
