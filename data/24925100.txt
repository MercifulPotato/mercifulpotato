Browsers use ANGLE to convert GL to DirectX for a reason, it&#x27;s a crap API all around on Windows (not that it had to be but that&#x27;s how it is).<p>The driver bugs are what I&#x27;m most worried about though. I remember when I got a 4670 in 2008 there was a cursor corruption bug (google it, it&#x27;s common) and if you didn&#x27;t shake the mouse enough for it to fix itself it&#x27;d crash. Then I built a new PC with a 5770 and I still had it. Later a new PC with a 6950 and still had it. Then 2x280X and still had it. It even occurred on Linux once. Then I went Nvidia for a few generations and it seems AMD finally fixed it. It seems fixed now (maybe because of new hardware) based on internet searches but from 2008-2015 the bug was there. And this is just one example of things.<p>Not that Nvidia drivers have ever been perfect but I never ran into this kind of shit so often for so long on their cards. Hopefully I don&#x27;t end up regretting the 6900 XT because of it.')
