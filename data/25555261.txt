First, many things in the spec are clearly thrown in your way for Apple&#x27;s convenience, and feel as totally arbitrary or almost counterintuitive.<p>Others are clearly nonsensical or unreasonably complex to do; for instance, until a few revisions ago, the spec specified an &quot;outlet in use&quot; characteristic for power outlets that literally meant &quot;something is physically plugged in&quot;. This isn&#x27;t something you can know without putting actual sensors on your outlet&#x27;s shutters, in order to detect if a plug was inserted in, something that while very fancy, it increases sensibly the cost of what is basically a relay strapped to a power socket. Needless to say, Apple had to make it optional because lots of manufacturers were simply not certifying their lower end smart outlets for HomeKit.<p>Also, certification with Apple is a massive PITA, and they meddle with every single aspect of your device, and they ask for money on each step of the process.')
