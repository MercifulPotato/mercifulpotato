To me this is similar to the old &quot;no one has gotten fired for going IBM&quot;. The new phrase would be &quot;no one has gotten fired for going with a static typed language.&quot;<p>When someone writes bad Java code, we tend to blame the developer. When someone writes bad Python code, we blame Python.<p>If you think it&#x27;s the lack of types that make things more difficult to follow, you can always force build failure if type hints aren&#x27;t provided (which Python has supported for a while now) in the same way you can fail your Java builds if test coverage isn&#x27;t up to par.')
