It&#x27;s a really slick tool for exploring large csv datasets.  I&#x27;ve typically used it to do some prototyping and exploration of 200-500GB csv datasets before doing more hefty work in Java+PigLatin (our use-case is more long-term than just a single run for analysis, so that&#x27;s re reason for moving out of just Miller).  It&#x27;s great to get a feel for the data and run some initial analysis before diving into the larger, more cumbersome system and tooling.')
