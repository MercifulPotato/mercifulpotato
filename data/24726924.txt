You are being a great son, enjoying good time with your parents. Don&#x27;t throw that away. First of all, be thankful that you are comfortable and not manically driven for more.<p>How do you think living like a bum would improve your life? Let&#x27;s say you do that. You will get a job but will it be the right job? Or are you now more concerned with just getting any job so you can pay the bills?<p>Look at it this way, you can right now be in the exactly same situation, except you are in a non-ideal job, living alone, in a small place with little future prospects, with the same level of motivation.<p>So see your situation as a strength, not a weakness. How&#x27;s your health? Are you at good healthy weight? Are you exercising regularly? You have the time to take care of yourself. If your health isn&#x27;t optimal, that&#x27;s a worthy goal to focus on.<p>In terms of work, if it&#x27;s a question of making money, why not keeping going for the contracts? You have the flexibility of being a great freelancer. Pick an area, get skilled and just take on contract work. This is your leverage. I hate to say it, but just do it. It seems you have the luxury of being picky and so you are. Take a contract or job that isn&#x27;t ideal but in the ballpark of what you want. What&#x27;s the worst that will happen? You&#x27;ll end up back where you are now.<p>In the end, you don&#x27;t need to be barely living in order to push yourself. We all love the stories of the rags to riches in life but that&#x27;s kind of the aberration rather than the norm.')
