To rephrase it in my words: a condorcet election could elect someone that a minority HATES rather than a candidate that everyone is indifferent to. This makes a lot more sense why we would have these voting methods like RCV&#x2F;STAR.<p>&gt;There&#x27;s research here that considers both honest and strategic voting: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;electionscience.github.io&#x2F;vse-sim&#x2F;VSE&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;electionscience.github.io&#x2F;vse-sim&#x2F;VSE&#x2F;</a><p>I&#x27;m definitely going to look into this when I find some free time. Thanks.<p>I&#x27;ve simply enjoyed attacking these voting methods via these small details, but I think it&#x27;s really important as well. We are putting into place a system that will be put to extreme tests and will need a ton of integrity. Millions of people will be affected by it and will spend time coming up with strategies to maximize their votes (as they do currently by not voting for 3rd party candidates). Campaign strategists will try to use the system to their advantage (as they do currently by campaigning in battleground states). And malicious outsiders will try to use misinformation to attack the system as well. I want to make sure it&#x27;s done right.<p>I think I was a little angry in my last comment where I said these conversations were tedious. I&#x27;m just really hesitant to choose a method like STAR, or even RCV as they&#x27;re so different from our current system. I want a safe removal of the spoiler effect, which I think approval voting might do best, but I&#x27;m not sure, and it may be best for America if we make a big leap to a more complex system as this could help us avoid problems in the future, rather than having to transition again. Definitely going to look into this more though.')
