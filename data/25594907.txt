They will rapidly evolve to become much more conventionally life-like.<p>I find the notion that viruses <i>aren&#x27;t</i> alive to be totally absurd.  They replicate themselves, evolve continuously into an ever-branching tree of different niches, etc.<p>Is your objection that they don&#x27;t have their own copying machinery?<p>Should mistle-toe not count as alive even though it depends on a tree to live?  Hell, it appears it&#x27;s even missing most of the genes necessary for it&#x27;s mitochondria to produce ATP[1] so if it&#x27;s somehow hijacking ATP production from the host tree, it clearly has no ability to reproduce on it&#x27;s own.  What about a human male?  They have no replication ability without a female host &quot;machine&quot; to make copies of themselves.  Are they therefore not alive?   I think your objection rapidly descends into absurdity if you closely examine your definitions.<p>&gt; In a world with a different life architecture, viruses would likely just be random an uninteresting molecules.<p>In such a world, a virus would not exist.  In the same notion, in a world without sources of sugars, starches, and proteins, you would not exist.  If you happened to blink into existence in this same hypothetical as a virus, you would be an equally uninteresting collection of molecules that would rapidly disappear.\n[1]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.quantamagazine.org&#x2F;the-mystery-of-mistletoes-missing-genes-20201221&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.quantamagazine.org&#x2F;the-mystery-of-mistletoes-mis...</a>')
