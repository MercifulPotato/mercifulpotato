This is especially true if your skin isn&#x27;t white enough: How many stories do you hear of folks being in jail for having the description, &quot;Tall black male?&quot;.<p>You act like everyone can avoid all things: Have you never met anyone put in jail for not paying child support when they don&#x27;t have a job... in part, because they were put in jail for not paying child support?<p>Or... you can live in a weed-friendly state and forget you have some in your car while traveling. Jail for drugs now. Heck, you can be jailed for being in a house with drugs, even if you weren&#x27;t doing drugs yourself. &quot;Visiting a common nuisance&quot; is a thing they charge folks with [1]. I don&#x27;t think it is as common now, but at one time, it wasn&#x27;t uncommon to get arrested while walking home drunk for public intoxication, even though driving would have been criminal. Indiana cops used to wait outside bars to arrest folks for this.

You just get caught or you don&#x27;t, and you can get caught your first time. It happens.
