The only major component we&#x27;re missing is that normal browsers don&#x27;t have the ability to verify that the portal is serving you the right code - which is of course super important.<p>Once you have that though, the rest can be done within the webapp itself. Credentials are managed by a separate webapp like <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sky-id.hns.siasky.net&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sky-id.hns.siasky.net&#x2F;</a>, and some apps already have built in failover to try other portals if one is not responding.<p>With the advent of utreexo, it&#x27;s even possible to run full blockchain nodes inside of a webapp. Again you need an integrity check on the code served by the portal, but if you have that you can independently do everything else.')
