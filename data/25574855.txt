Most professional cooks who want to stand out use lots of salt and sugar, sometimes up to a point that I find it disgusting.

But believe me, you can unlearn it and start to taste the food itself, instead of the added salt and sugar.<p>I learned the rule that a cook that uses lots of salt and sugar is a bad cook.')
