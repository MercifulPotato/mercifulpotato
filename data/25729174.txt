But my numbers for 2020 are faaar lower than usual. Normally I would bike to and from work 5 times a week, to swimming 3 times a week, to meet a friend for jogging, to the mall, etc. But now all those things are closed, so I use the bike for something maybe once a week instead.<p>So I hope and believe the numbers will be even greater for 20211, actually. Multiple new people with bikes, and soon people will move about as usual.')
