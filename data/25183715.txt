And &quot;suburban families try hard to game the SAT&quot; is not so much a &quot;claim&quot; as &quot;a fact your own analysis acknowledges&quot;. I could be persuaded, but what you&#x27;ve presented here doesn&#x27;t constitute extraordinary evidence.<p>(Your other argument in this thread, about the possible Cobra Effect of eliminating the SAT, is much more persuasive).')
