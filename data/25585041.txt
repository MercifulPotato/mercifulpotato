I&#x27;m using it for development of my macOS&#x2F;iOS app.<p>So far I am enjoying it. My other machine is a 13&quot; MacBook Pro from earlier this year (intel, the cheapest model) and the Mini is definitely snappier, even if it only has 8GB RAM.<p>The MBP would often stutter audio playback when I was doing anything CPU-intensive and listening to music at the same time. This would often require me to restart the coreaudiod process to get audio playing nicely again. (It&#x27;s a really horrible OS bug.) But the M1 just chugs along. Xcode builds are much, much faster on this as well, making the write code&#x2F;test and debug it feedback cycle tighter.<p>The only drawbacks I&#x27;ve seen so far are that homebrew isn&#x27;t fully supported yet and Firefox will just get stuck if you leave it for a few hours, requiring you to restart it. Other than that, for my workflow, it&#x27;s been working great.')
