It seems to free up the local memory usage of the program, but it doesnâ€™t seem to release the memory back to the operating system, until some type of triggered event.<p>That&#x27;s up to the C runtime&#x27;s memory allocator. Modern memory allocators don&#x27;t typically request a new chunk of memory for every malloc() call -- instead, they allocate a single large region of memory at a time and carve that up as needed. This is massively more efficient (system calls are expensive), but also means that those regions can&#x27;t be released to the OS until all allocations in them are gone.')
