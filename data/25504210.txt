But it&#x27;s not necessarily because people are unreasonable, there are limits of arbitrage as well. In order to make any profit at all you&#x27;d need to lock up a sizeable chunk of money, say $1000, for something like a month, pay 5% commission, plus I imagine the hassle of it all, and all you get is a few dollars. In economics literature things like this are described as limits of arbitrage, to explain situations (like deep out of money options) where it seems like an arbitrage opportunity exists but where everyone still thinks it&#x27;s a bad trade.')
