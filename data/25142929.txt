In fact, it appears that Facebook subcontracts content moderation to Accenture and CPL, both of which are named in this letter.<p>The letter also takes shots at Mark Zuckerberg&#x27;s growing wealth and attacks Facebook&#x27;s attempts to augment the human content moderators with AI pre-filters to remove the worst content. The latter claim is strange, as the content moderators are the ones most likely to benefit from AI pre-filtering. They try to claim that Facebook &quot;failed&quot; to create a workable AI, but I seriously doubt that Facebook has given up on the project. More likely that they&#x27;re still iterating. I suspect these people feel they need to attack the AI angle to protect their jobs.<p>The letter goes on to demand 50% higher hazard pay, demands that the subcontracted content moderators be hired directly into Facebook as full employees, out of their contracting jobs under consulting firms.')
