I could go on-and-on about So-Cal, but I guess the die-hard Nor-Cal folks could do the same. I know I&#x27;ve blown a fair number of weekends at Morro Bay, the Monterey Bay aquarium, and wandering around The Mission. Haven&#x27;t gotten around to San Jose yet. Maybe after this whole thing blows over. My buddy keeps trying to get me to go up for the Cherry Blossom festival.<p>I hadn&#x27;t heard that tiki bars were a thing! That&#x27;s pretty cool. Talk about a blast from the past.<p>With regards to real estate prices, that is one thing where I can really, really understand people&#x27;s complaints. Even down in So-Cal you can see desert cabins on the market for $300k. I figured a bubble would burst at some point, but it hasn&#x27;t so far. Maybe with more WFH folks who don&#x27;t really want to be here can go somewhere that they can get more bang for their buck in terms of property, and the die-hard California folks can catch a break on real estate prices.<p>Cheers though! Good to hear from someone who isn&#x27;t so down on California. It really is a cool place, and it&#x27;s easy to take it for granted until you&#x27;ve spent some time in the Midwest.')
