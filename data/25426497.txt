Perhaps the reason we are inclined to view pandemics and other crises as moral and political turning points is that we have been conditioned to view them through a medical-historical lens. History suggests it might be better to regard pandemics less as crises than as occasions for political ‘reckoning’ that may – or may not –  see the resolution of long-standing social and economic grievances.”<p>Reads like a high-scoring paper from a critical theory class. Foucault, three examples, and flourishes of vocabulary to basically say “never let a crisis go to waste.”')
