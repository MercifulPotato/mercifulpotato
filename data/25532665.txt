Some of their controls make sense, some made sense for corps in the 90s and some are completely opposite to what you should do. It&#x27;s good that they at least force the company to think of the requirements and dedicate some time to it. But I really wouldn&#x27;t put PCI DSS as a good example, or an &quot;almost always safe&quot; example.')
