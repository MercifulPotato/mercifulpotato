So many fun things to do. And its a little less humid in the summer than Detroit, and has fresher air. But the water is still warm. You can just walk out on the sandy beach and go for a swim, like you&#x27;re in the Bahamas or something. I used to live in Vancouver, and the local lakes were never warm enough to swim in in the Summer.')
