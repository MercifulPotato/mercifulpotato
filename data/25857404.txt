The cost of streaming music is WAY WAY WAY too low. They priced an entire month of music at about £10, the same as a CD. That&#x27;s 720 hours (30 days) for the same price as just over an hour of music. This works out at £0.013888888888889 per hour, or just over 1p for an hour of music. This is then SPLIT between the streaming company, the label (if one), the artist&#x27;s manager, and the artist.<p>But, unlike movies or any other service, the music service is repeatable and potentially generates infinite value over the years, with very minimal cost of maintenance. Once it is submitted to spotify, it is there forever, generating revenue, without you doing anything at all.')
