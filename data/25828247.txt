Strike that - suppose there was a <i>war</i>. We have 20th century behind us. It&#x27;s not something that happened before history was invented by Herodotus. There are still people alive who have seen shit by their own eyes that would make average twitterati literally wet their pants on the spot just to think about it - and emerged through it without their ideals shattered.

Nobody abandons free speech because actual Gulags and actual Nazis actually, not metaphorically, happened. But now somehow people come out and say &quot;maybe free speech isn&#x27;t that good an idea. I know about Hitler. I know about Stalin. I know about Pol Pot, Osama bin Laden and Radio Of Thousand Hills. None of it have ever shaken me, I knew freedom of speech is important. But now, that&#x27;s different!&quot; What is going on, seriously? How does it make any sense? Are we being targeted by CIA for one of those mind control experiments again?')
