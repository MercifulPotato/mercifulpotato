It is not a “run and done” solution, you do have to put a little effort in to build a decent API but we give you the tools to achieve this in a fraction of the time of rolling your own, and probably with better performance also. Our extensive documentation is peppered with advice on how to craft your API, not to expose more than you need, not to expose complex filters (instead adding specific filters the frontend needs), how to include&#x2F;exclude things, how to add in additional fields, types, remote content, etc. Our users are generally very happy, we’re just not very good at marketing ;)')
