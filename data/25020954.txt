However, I also think life doesn’t has to be all about finding purpose or all that. There is so much more world has to offer. Good food, good conversations, beautiful places, hikes, creative art, books, music, movies - I can go on and on. One can build a good happy life just by appreciating everything good he already has. It just takes a very big perspective shift.')
