We eventually wrapped the whole fuselage in a farraday cage so that the datalink and flight controls wouldn&#x27;t be overwhelmed. It was responsible for transmitting data at a 1 Hz rate, and we could visualize the interference on a spectrometer over a broad range of Rf at exactly 1 Hz.<p>Anyway, we totally could have made a transmitter out of that thing.')
