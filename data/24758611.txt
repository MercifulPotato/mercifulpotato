In my experience this is the <i>number one programming interview failure</i>.<p>I&#x27;ve seen this story a number of times.<p>After a lot of struggle, the team (or lead engineer) feels justly proud about their last accomplishment. Hey, we built a cool priority queue! Nothing else was as good as this! The implementation is elegant, once you understand it! Why, it&#x27;s something that we could have written in 10 minutes if we had understood it before!<p>Soon afterwards &quot;ability to build a priority queue&quot; is a defining characteristic of your team.<p>And, then... you start testing candidates for it.<p>But somehow, none of them seem to have the insight into priority queues that everyone on your team has. Strange. It&#x27;s so hard to find good people.<p>---<p>What went wrong here?<p>Impostor syndrome, and lack of emotional security. Unconsciously you are competing with the candidate and putting up your best work (obtained after perhaps weeks of blood, sweat, and tears) with what they can come up with in an interview.<p>I myself suffer from a kind of &quot;ratchet effect&quot;. Everything that I learn becomes something that everyone <i>should</i> know. I believe this process is related to insecurity; previously, I might have been kind of embarrassed about not knowing how (for instance) priority queues work. But now that I <i>do</i> know, it&#x27;s part of my defenses against vulnerability.<p>As a very senior developer I need to keep in mind how people actually progress, and honor every stage of people&#x27;s development.<p>[1] See also: the social rules at the Recurse Center, which are good for any development team. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.recurse.com&#x2F;social-rules" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.recurse.com&#x2F;social-rules</a>')
