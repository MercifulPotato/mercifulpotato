It provides a layer of abstraction on top of ClickHouse to make ingesting, transforming and creating API endpoints on the data super fast, and after our first year in business we have a bunch of small customers, and several big enterprise ones<p>During Black Friday we had the biggest load on our systems so far (everything held out!) and we&#x27;re running a small contest on Twitter to give free accounts to the 3 closest guesses on how many rows were read per hour on BF<p>We&#x27;re slowly opening up and we&#x27;d love to see our tech applied to new use cases, so feel free to participate or reach out to us to try out the product :D')
