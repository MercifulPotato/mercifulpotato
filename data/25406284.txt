Those who are looking for reliable work can look at reviews, past work portfolio, interviews and milestones... to make sure they&#x27;re getting better workers or at least minimize the risks.<p>There are providers of much more reliable workers, which do the vetting for you... but those are limited to narrow domains. You need to hire experts to vet freelancers and this does not scale. In traditional freelancing platforms, this vetting is crowd sourced to previous customers, so it&#x27;s automatically scalable.<p>Another thing is, you don&#x27;t even mention what your approach to solving the problem is. Yes, there are some problems inherent to freelancing on the internet, but that&#x27;s true for anything. What is your selling point that will solve the existing problems and make it that much better than the competition while not losing the value existing platforms provide to your customers?')
