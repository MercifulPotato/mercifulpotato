Item(by='jessriedel', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611073259, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25832496, text='Based on the later-discovered extra photos, it appears that the taxi-way in the background (which, as you say, is clearly much further from the camera than the landing plane due to the tiny small aircraft parked along it) is nearly perfectly overlapping with the actual runway, so that at the moment of touchdown the wheels look like they are touching both the runway and the background taxi-way.  The larger blacktop with yellow lines in the foreground of the picture is a <i>second</i> taxi-way (<i>closer</i> to the camera than the runway, and clearly offset from it visually).  This in particular can be seen by the fourth photo in the time series, the one taken immediately after the OP photo.<p>The quirky features of OP photo are such a nerd snipe, and the later finding the complete photo series is just so convenient, that I&#x27;m tempted to think the whole Stack Exchange post was planned.')
