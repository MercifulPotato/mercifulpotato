Not only will you pretty much never see tofu boxes with it but (IMO) their emoji graphics are better than most. I think it might violate the standard but I really hate having emojis rendered with a different color than the surrounding text. And personally I prefer the bitmap style for graphics even if text itself is better as vectors (which is the way the font is intended to be used anyway.)<p>It is huge though, like 13mb for a font is a lot.')
