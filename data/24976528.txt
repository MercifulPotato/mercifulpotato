But imagine the sort of company that trains their own model instead of using a huggingface refinement or an off-the-shelf redistillation. (These can be done reasonably on an average gaming PC, no need for a cluster.) Such a company has expensive <i>human</i> resources. They bothered to get a data scientist and at least a research engineer, if not a full researcher. Were they hired on six-month contract as well? This is a huge expense, so it must be an important differentiator to have built a custom model -- and it&#x27;s a one-and-done? I don&#x27;t see it. I think it&#x27;s going to be an ongoing project, or it shouldn&#x27;t have been approved in the first place.')
