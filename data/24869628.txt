Assuming Prop 22 does not pass, the most likely outcome seems to be Uber and Lyft will simply shut down operations for the time being, if not for good. They have already signaled they are willing to do this before this appeal, and they are explicitly saying this is the most likely outcome in the media.<p>The philosophies of both sides have been debated ad nauseam. Regardless of what side you take, the reality is these new regulations are effectively going to get many drivers &#x27;fired&#x27;. I don&#x27;t hear much discussion about this. It seems folks on the side of making them employees can&#x27;t imagine a world where Uber and Lyft will simply shut down.<p>Of course, those who are anti prop-22 have the drivers best interests in mind, but nobody&#x27;s lives will be improved if they are denied the ability to work at all. We have to take that into account.<p>What happens when 22 fails, and all those drivers are out of work? What happens when millions of users who are used to being able to dial up fast, affordable rides on the drop of a hat, suddenly lose this ability? It&#x27;s going to be painful for all parties involved.')
