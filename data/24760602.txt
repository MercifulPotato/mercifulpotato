It&#x27;s way to easy to phish people for information by calling them and claiming to be their bank. Too many people will fall for it:<p>&quot;Hi, this is SomeDude from Bank of America, and we noticed some suspicious activity on your account. Before we go further I would just like to confirm your identity. Could you please provide your name? Your address? Your mother&#x27;s maiden name? The last four digits of your SSN?&quot;<p>Banks should adopt a policy of only interacting with customers physically, via their web interface with a login, official mobile app, or by the user calling the bank&#x27;s official, publicized number. Never by calling the user.<p>That way they can post big signs saying &quot;We will never call you, if someone calls you claiming to be us, it&#x27;s fake&quot; and people will get it.')
