Item(by='adgadev', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607100178, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25303865, text='Yes, currently jplusone requires Spring &amp; Spring Boot to work, mainly because it significantly reduces effort needed to integrate the library into applications (adding dependency and enabling logger by developer is enough in most cases, the rest is handled by spring boot autoconfiguration), and minimizes the risk of wrong setup. I think with some minor changes it would be possible to allow using jplusone without spring. I&#x27;ll try to add such option in future releases. Thank you for a good idea for an improvement.')
