I have no idea how much the manufacturing&#x2F;R&amp;D costs of Quest are, but I doubt it makes sense for Facebook to sell it this cheap without requiring users to link&#x2F;create a Facebook account. Don’t expect stuff to be free&#x2F;cheap for no reason.<p>My point is that regulating this space of tech will only lead to less innovation. There’s an extremely easy solution that every single one of us can do: don’t buy it, don’t be tempted by the cheap price Facebook is offering. I closed my Fb account ~5 years ago now (after being on it for about 10 years) and I’m very tempted to buy Quest 2, but I won’t. If enough people do this, what ever scummy plan Facebook is weaving will fail, but even if it doesn’t, you’d be out of it.')
