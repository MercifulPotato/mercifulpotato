Ppl buying minimal amounts of marijuana (and other selectively enforced misdemeanors) are doing real time while members of a violent mob walk free. And not only are they all on camera, but there may even be SIGINT collection devices that have their phone ID info.<p>I donâ€™t usually engage in politics on HN, but I think this goes beyond politics. How are we not supposed to be angry, after watching ppl be gassed and shot with rubber bullets, about how the Capitol Police responded 6 Jan? This is much bigger than politics.')
