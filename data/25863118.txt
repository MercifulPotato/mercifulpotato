I have done this move twice.<p>* Fire ants mean you can just ignore your back yard. Why bother to mow or plant anything? You can&#x27;t use the yard because the ants will attack. Not trying to maintain a yard frees up time.<p>* Public schools host prayer meetings, don&#x27;t bother complaining. At least the one our daughter attended for a couple of months did, and tried to get her to go. We took her out of school when the second-grade teacher punished her for &quot;reading books above her grade level.&quot; Thanks to Cedar Park public schools we got into homeschooling.<p>* You will get asked what church you go to every time you chat with your neighbors. But you will rarely meet your neighbors because they drive the F150 just to go down the block.<p>* Great barbecue! Even the Buccee&#x27;s gas stations have good barbecue.<p>* I miss HEB.<p>* No shortage of bars and alcohol. Austin must have more bars per capita than any city I have visited.<p>* Austin public library is beautiful and has lots of free services. It also has the most bizarre organization of books I&#x27;ve ever seen. If you need to study Windows 3 programming or DCOM they have it.<p>* Bike paths that just end. No riding on the sidewalk -- get in there and mix it up with the pickup trucks.<p>* Electric scooters littering every inch of sidewalk. Maybe those got cleaned up.')
