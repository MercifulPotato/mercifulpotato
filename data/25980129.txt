Now, sheâ€™s participating in a campaign to disaffiliate from the larger organization.<p>It&#x27;s important to choose allies carefully. If you opportunistically work with an individual who&#x27;s more invested in making scenes and silly sloganeering than using good judgment to accomplish meaningful change, you shouldn&#x27;t be surprised when it turns out she&#x27;s not much of a team player. Can&#x27;t feel too bad for the CWA here.')
