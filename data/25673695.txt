They all show good results. Comments all say &quot;DisplayLink is faking it and it&#x27;s gross&quot; but the people making these videos say &quot;Sure, but it&#x27;s not gross. It&#x27;s working almost perfectly.&quot;<p>Anyone here have any experience or thoughts on this?<p>I&#x27;m not gaming or needing to do high level graphics or video editing on a 2nd or 3rd display. Just basic dev stuff and window management.')
