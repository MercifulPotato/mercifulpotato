The contributions are dual licensed <i>to the maintainer</i> as GPL+MIT, which means that the maintainer can relicense them as they please, just like the code they own the copyright for. So other than minor formalities like maintaining a list of copyright owners, the maintainer can continue to release both GPL and commercial versions unimpeded. Keeping track of which lines were contributed in this way going forward isn&#x27;t really necessary (although a note in the merge commit would be prudent).<p>The main practical difference between a CLA and actual copyright assignment is when you are suing a violator. At that point it is a bit simpler if there is one copyright owner, rather than asking other copyright owners to join the suit, but it is important to realize that they don&#x27;t <i>have</i> to join the suit for it to go forward (in fact, every copyright owner could sue the violator independently if they wish). Only when you are the copyright owner of a minority of the software&#x27;s source code (IOW most of the source comes from contributions) do things get inconvenient in terms of a violator possibly being less motivated to negotiate with you (although that would actually be <i>really</i> stupid on their part).')
