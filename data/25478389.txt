I think you might be able to help mitigate some of these kinds of attacks:<p>&gt; To have some minimal form of obfuscation from prying eyes, the strings in the backdoor are compressed and encoded in Base64, or their hashes are used instead.<p>There needs to be a quick tool that flags strings that appear to represent binary data before a merge, maybe even decoding them when possible and providing hints of what they might represent, especially inside source-code files. These shouldn&#x27;t be common in checked code. And we should figure out a way to whitelist them in the repo that&#x27;s both safe and convenient (I&#x27;m not sure how).<p>Is this a feature code-hosting sites like GitHub can add?')
