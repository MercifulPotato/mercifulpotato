At least I could sleep in in the morning.<p>My biggest problem was because I work a lot with people in Europe which meant that I ended up working very late every night, since there was no natural way to stop in the evening.<p>Now that we&#x27;re back in the office 50% of the time, I realise just how much nicer that is. You really get isolated when working from home, and one doesn&#x27;t really notice it until you actually come back.')
