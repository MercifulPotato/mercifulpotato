My hypothesis is that it&#x27;s the latency. We humans are very sensitive to the cadence of a conversation. We wait for lulls to know when to speak.<p>Calls over the Internet add enough latency that it really fucks up that natural process. So I find I end up being hypervigilent to try to <i>guess</i> ahead when the speaker is about to pause so that if I start talking now it will flow naturally. Otherwise, if I wait for them to pause, they won&#x27;t hear me start for a while and will end up resuming.<p>So it&#x27;s just super draining trying to anticipate the conversational flow and make it go smoothly. I hate it.')
