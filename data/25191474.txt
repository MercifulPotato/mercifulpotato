Not sure how much else it adds to the bill-of-material beyond a regular USB port! Adding it direct to the CPU would be a wonderful way to save space, &amp; significantly reduce how hard it is to implement, since one would no longer need to route USB and PCIe and power to this extra chip.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t expect Thunderbolt support on the low end for a long time. But I really do think it&#x27;s really time that cpu makers begin offering it onboard. They already need to start moving towards USB4. Adding PCIe as well would be a courtesy, &amp; a big enabler, for their customers. Hopefully we see these great awesome futures begin arriving in a more well-distributed manner.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mouser.com&#x2F;new&#x2F;intel&#x2F;intel-8000-thunderbolt-4-controllers&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mouser.com&#x2F;new&#x2F;intel&#x2F;intel-8000-thunderbolt-4-co...</a>')
