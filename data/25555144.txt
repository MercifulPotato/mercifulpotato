Netflix, for example, is quite transparent that they have a &quot;hire and fire&quot; culture, and I for one wish that many tech companies would be more willing to have open, honest conversations with their employees and ensure everyone is up to whatever bar they set. I&#x27;ve seen it become incredibly demoralizing for the rest of the team when subpar performers don&#x27;t get let go, and I&#x27;ve also seen rather disingenuous uses of &quot;layoffs&quot; as an excuse to finally cut people who should have been cut long ago.<p>Still, there are practicalities that can make &quot;hire fast, fire fast&quot; difficult in the real world. First, many countries outside the US have much more onerous requirements to fire someone. Even in the US, it&#x27;s quite trivial for any employee to take legal action if they think they&#x27;ve been let go unfairly, so most HR departments will require many months of detailed documentation (e.g. email conversation, performance reviews, PIPs) before someone can be let go.')
