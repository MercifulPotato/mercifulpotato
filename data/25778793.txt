Therefore I would expect most communities to be moderated horribly. How could it be otherwise if they are moderated by stupid people elected by other stupid people? The good part is that people who are better than average can create their own community which will be better than average. How much better, that only depends on those people.<p>The alternative is having some kind of elite moderators that moderate all communities. It sets a lower bar on their quality. Unfortunately, it also sets an upper bar on their quality. Everything will be as good as the appointed elite likes it, neither better nor worse.<p>From the perspective of what the average person sees, the latter is probably better. From the perspective that I am an individual who can choose a community or two to participate in, and I don&#x27;t care about the rest, the latter is better.')
