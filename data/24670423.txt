So we could write a regex to listen for “Yubikey for” and have it run the same script, eliminating the need to press buttons altogether.<p>Don&#x27;t do this.<p>Actually seriously, don&#x27;t do most of this.<p>The fact that your computer <i>cannot</i> induce the yubikey to provide its key material (or evidence of the key material) is where it gets &quot;security&quot; from in the first place. As soon as someone can convince your computer to do <i>something</i> there&#x27;s an increased chance they can get it to do something else.<p>Some suggestions:<p>- Wire the F14 key up separately to &quot;the finger&quot; (and not to wifi)<p>- Use a yubikey simulator[1]. If your sysadmin won&#x27;t trust you with the key material inside the yubikey so you can use a simulator, they definitely won&#x27;t trust yourself to emulate the simulator with the finger either.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;sstelfox&#x2F;yubikey-simulator" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;sstelfox&#x2F;yubikey-simulator</a>')
