I don&#x27;t use web notifications at all though so I haven&#x27;t even thought about testing that - but as far as I know, Anbox doesn&#x27;t have any way to push notifications out of the Android container into host system so far (but it shouldn&#x27;t be hard to implement; plus I guess you could even just install KDE Connect inside Anbox and synchronize notifications that way as a lazy hack).')
