The Zoom founder and the original 40 programmers worked for Cisco Webex, and the programmers were&#x2F;are based in China.<p>Why Cisco allowed an ex-manager to poach 40 engineers is beyond me. My guess is that Cisco&#x27;s legal team advised that the founder would just retreat back to China, where there&#x27;s no fair legal system.<p>The question is if Zoom copied source code from Cisco, which I haven&#x27;t seen addressed yet. It would actually be surprising if Chinese engineers did not copy, since that&#x27;s done in every other situation.')
