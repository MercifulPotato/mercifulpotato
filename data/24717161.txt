The difference in peak torque (helps in acceleration out of corners) is smaller, 550 N&#x2F;m and 639 N&#x2F;m, about 11%. Power (helps at high speed) difference also less - 317kW and 340kW, yet Tesla win here too. Model 3 is even slightly wider (2cm, about 1% wider), which should help in track too. And after all that, a whopping 0.1s of win.<p>Tesla borked their very first Roadster, despite the fact that they had to provide only drivetrain to it and everything else was done by Lotus. The analysis above suggests that they are still do not get <i>driving</i> as opposed to <i>drag racing</i>.')
