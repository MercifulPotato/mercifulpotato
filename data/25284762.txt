Maybe a touch longer.<p>I love it. My professional career moved to .NET and Python over the last decade, but if I&#x27;m building for myself, I build in PHP.<p>Whatever foibles people claim are in PHP are really just personal gripes about features they don&#x27;t like, while ignoring all the other pieces that are ideal for web API development. Frankly, I believe first-class duck-typing and nearly-zero impedance with JSON make PHP a first-class citizen of the web. Duck-typing pairs so well with dynamic typing that I don&#x27;t know why so many languages abuse themselves with the alternatives.<p>I remember the Docker switchover being very confusing. Why do all these people need such elaborate instrumentation around their development environments? With PHP, the kitchen sink is always there, and always consistent (we&#x27;ll ignore money_format() for now). Once I really started using other language environments, the pain points that necessitated Docker cropped up, and of course the deployment benefits are excellent. It was just a very confusing couple years trying to figure out why the Node and Python guys were living like animals.<p>Anyways, cheers to another 20.')
