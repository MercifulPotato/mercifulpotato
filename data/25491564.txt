Here&#x27;s mine. In highschool, I cranked out a version of tetris in Turbo Pascal that basically worked.<p>Fast forward a few years, I am taking CS219 with Prof Stark (random that I remember the course number) who is hard-core and really tough since it&#x27;s year 2000 and the class is full of kids who are taking CS cuz it&#x27;s &quot;the thing&quot; but have no passion or talent for programing.<p>Me, I love programming but I don&#x27;t have it very much together attendance-wise so I accidentally miss the midterm. OOPS. And obviously there&#x27;s a &quot;zero make-up test&quot; policy, but surprisingly the prof lets me do the part of it which is a take-home coding assignment, since you can&#x27;t really benefit from prior knowledge of the questions.<p>My lucky stars - the test is to make a rudimentary subset of - you guessed it - Tetris. Which I had &quot;solved&quot; for myself a year or two earlier. Apparently I was the only one in the class to nail the implementation.')
