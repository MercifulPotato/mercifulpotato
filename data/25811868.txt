Auditors never look at them in any detail. They look for last revised date and last review date.  Have bought $150 bundle online and submitted as-is without even replacing a single parameter and audit went fine.<p>but Vanta&#x2F;Tugboat won&#x27;t actually do the reviews and training and HR and executive reviews you need. Basically their deal is that they cut volume discounts with the audit firms and then take the rest.  They have nice dashboards, don&#x27;t get me wrong, but only their hand picked auditors will accept them. Others will require you to manually package up the same evidence anyway and upload to their IRL evidence system.')
