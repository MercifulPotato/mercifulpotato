In 1983 when the weather underground literally bombed the capital was a far cry from trump lunatics walking about staying within bollards and aside from a few legitimate fools (like the one who got shot) generally just making fun of where they were.  Of course, there were a few morons who supported nazi rhetoric, just like at any run of the mill antifa rally a few of those people actually have intent on killing cops and rich people.<p>Blowing this idiocy out of proportion is just going to result in more of our civil liberties and rights being taken away.')
