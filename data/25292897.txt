It sounds terrible.<p>As a graphics programmer I feel things have moved very far in the right direction within the last ten years.<p>I used to write generic computations disguised as pixel rendering without any decent tools for diagnostics or profiling.<p>Now I can just use a compute shader and if I want to debug or profile it there are so many great alternatives.<p>I recently re-implemented a particle simulation I first wrote in 2011. Without access to the pervious code.<p>The first time around it took me months. Now it took me days. Sure, I&#x27;ve learned a lot since, but a lot of the speedup was just from better language and tool support for what I wanted to do.')
