On the other hand, coronaviruses which are experienced as &quot;colds&quot; apparently have a lot less retention of immune system recognition.  Optimistic scenario is that the immune system is &quot;smart&quot; enough to recognize which infections are a big deal which must be remembered forever, and which are not.  Pessimistic scenario is we got lucky with SARS, and may not with Covid-19.')
