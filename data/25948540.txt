Even if everyone were in office--some are, some aren&#x27;t--almost every meeting I&#x27;d be in would have people from 2 or 3 different offices. One office I work with a lot is in the same time zone. The other is 6 time zones away but that still works pretty well because we have meetings early in the workday our time, which for them is mid-afternoon.')
