Item(by='mlyle', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605921256, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25164210, text='Yah, but let&#x27;s leave some room for some meaning to evolve and not be some kind of robots based on historic meaning and roots.<p>E.g. It&#x27;s OK for &quot;decimated&quot; to mean &quot;destroyed&#x2F;removed a sizable part of&quot; and not &quot;killed precisely 10% of&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s also OK for us to disagree on when the exact place an object becomes no more useful than a brick and to think that this could be a gray area.  To me, something is slightly&#x2F;soft bricked when it requires specialized, non-garden path recovery procedures to fix (e.g. a firmware flashing tool).  It is hard bricked when it requires tools and processes only usually found in depot maintenance or manufacturer facilities, even if my home workshop happens to be capable of these things.<p>Of course, this means some things that are hard bricked could become soft bricked or even not bricked at all, if the manufacturer releases a tool or updates the normal software to deal with a situation.')
