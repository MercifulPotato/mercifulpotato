It goes without saying that staying mid-sized doesn&#x27;t mean staying complacent, but you can innovate without growing huge.</i><p>There is nothing morally wrong with this and I think most Americans are entirely in support of this ethos. In fact it is a truism that politicians are <i>always</i> talking about how important &quot;small businesses&quot; are.<p>But the emergent property of our corporate finance system is that those businesses get swallowed up or crushed by huge conglomerates over time. We have a pretty toothless anti-trust regulation system these days and big corporations have enough economies of scale, regulatory capture, and other practices to destroy any business below a certain size.<p>It&#x27;s as if there is no protected shallow water in the business ecosystem. You&#x27;re always in a place where a shark can get you, so if you aren&#x27;t as big as a shark, you&#x27;re bait.')
