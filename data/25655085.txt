Does such a thing exist?<p>I&#x27;m planning on setting up my own nextcloud server, and they also have their own file manager system (Nextcloud Files), which is great for keeping files in sync across devices.<p>And although it&#x27;s nice to edit a text file that&#x27;s stored on a cloud server from any of your devices, I want to be able to use more powerful desktop applications to edit&#x2F;organize other files. e.g. beets for music, digikam for bulk organizing the directory structure of my photos. Darktable for editing photos.<p>Does anyone know of a workflow that lets me do all the organizing&#x2F;editing on a desktop, but still keep it all in sync with my other devices via a cloud server?')
