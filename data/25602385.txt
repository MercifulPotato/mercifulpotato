I think my mother did this while I was growing up - she would try out new replacement products (primarily food) and start buying them for a while, until the household got fed up with them and we went back to the old product. Repeat purchases for sure, but the only draw was novelty. Trying out a new type of milk instead of the old one, etc.<p>Gadgets too - We got a bread baking machine, and used it quite a lot for a year or two, then people got tired of it being somewhat impractical, it ended up in the back of the cupboard and finally thrown away.<p>Wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if there is a group of people for whom it is very rewarding trying out new products, and many products you can&#x27;t just buy once and then consider it &quot;tried out&quot;.')
