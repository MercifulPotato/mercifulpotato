Item(by='ksaj', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603076674, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24819894, text='In my neighbourhood, there are a lot of older people wandering about without masks.<p>Nearly all young &#x2F; teen people are wearing masks and even when hanging around the park, or are at the very least keeping a distance when outside. A lot of people keep distance by going to the far edge of the sidewalk or even walking in the grass when passing each other on the street. The youngest kids are pretty much entirely wearing masks everywhere outdoors, except at very local spots, like the common areas of an apartment building where 2 or 3 kids might be playing together not wearing them. But by and large, young people are taking it seriously at least for now.<p>Unsurprisingly almost the only time I see young people not taking precautions, they are with their parents who are also not taking precautions.<p>I actually find it rather surprising that the people who are apparently in the highest risk group, at least around my area, are also visibly the least likely to be taking care to avoid catching it. They aren&#x27;t even trying to keep distance. It&#x27;s like they feel like they&#x27;re specifically immune. Literally the older they are, the less likely they are to mask up in public walkways, etc.<p>I should note that I live in a Covid-19 hotspot, and we&#x27;re in &quot;modified Level 2 restrictions&quot; conditions right now because of it.')
