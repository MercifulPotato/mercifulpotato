I.e., I did my masters and Doctorate while working.\nFor both my dissertation and thesis I worked in domains and problems that lend themselves to logical formulations - and most of the implementations I did were in Prolog. I also had minor professional experience with Prolog. Focusing here just on the learning-the-language parts and disregarding all other activities:<p>* I _absolutely_ could have used that time to learn a more marketable language or framework. So that was a tradeoff, but -<p>* I most likely would have put only a fraction of those hundreds of hours into &quot;marketable training&quot;. I&#x27;d have played games for most of them. Or just browsed history channels on youtube, etc.<p>* I did not feel like any practical skills deteriorated at all. In fact -<p>* I feel like learning Prolog in-depth was a valuable &quot;exercise in learning&quot;. It might have helped me learn hard stuff for my job by making me a better independent student<p>- I hardly ever interview but I usually let Prolog be at most a footnote in my resume. I don&#x27;t expect it to be useful in that way (but who knows?)<p>My takeaway would be - for marketable purposes, learning Prolog is only substitute for meta-training. Like, instead of reading another (not your first!) book about design patterns or asynch control or  (...) you could learn Prolog.<p>But 85% of the benefit in learning it is the intelectual stimulation.')
