Take subsidies away and stop artificially underpricing it.<p>If we want to make sure meat products stay available in large quantities to everyone so you can have bacon for breakfast, a sandwich with deli slices for lunch, and a burger for dinner every day, you can take that subsidy money and put it toward lab grown meat instead.<p>Personally I&#x27;d like to see some of it redirected to vegetables though. Cheap meat and expensive vegetables isn&#x27;t the ideal outcome even if it comes from the lab.')
