You should go to get your fifth job. (Kind of paraphrasing a quote that I don’t remember who was from).<p>I studied economics, political science, and history at a liberal arts college. I’m a senior software engineer and can hardly imagine receiving much benefit from a CS degree.<p>Looking forward in my career, the stuff that’s quickly becoming more important is not the technical stuff (though I expect to stay on the technical track), it’s the communication, critical thinking, and analytical skills that were at the core of my college education. Could I have gotten those skills if I had majored in CS? Maybe, but I don’t think I would have enjoyed it as much.<p>If I were to go to do college over again, expecting to have a similar yet more direct career, I would do things differently, but I still don’t think I would major in CS.<p>Of course, others may have different interests that would lead them to requiring a CS degree.')
