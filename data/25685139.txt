Reliable relates to factual accuracy not spin, story selection etc.  It’s one thing not to cover an inconvenient story, it’s another to lie about what happened.<p>Fox News is well known for massive bias in the US, but they try to stick to the facts.  Russia Today etc is a little more factually flexible.')
