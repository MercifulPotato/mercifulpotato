Industrialization as it exists currently is bad because its optimizing for profit. If environmental costs were factored in (short and longterm), then we&#x27;d arrive at a sustainable balance. A carbon tax is a good first measure.<p>If we were, as you suggest, to revert from industrialization back to artisanship and manual labor we would produce a fraction of what we do now. That&#x27;s senseless. Would you wish for every household to have to produce their own food, raise and butcher and skin their own animals, hand-mine their stones and construct their homes, carve out their own furniture, sew their own clothes...? Our living standards would plummet. The fact is that industrialization multiplies efficiency.<p>We can arrive at a post-scarcity society whilst also being long term sustainable, even with current global populations. It&#x27;s just a matter of optimizing for it (and not just immediate profit).')
