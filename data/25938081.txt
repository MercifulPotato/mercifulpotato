When you call swap buffers, it sends a handle to the client&#x27;s backing surface to the server via IPC.<p>Honestly that&#x27;s one of the most amazing things about wayland, or more specifically the improvements in the Linux graphics stack over the last decade. Offscreen rendering is now implicitly supported, along with being able to share references to buffers on hardware devices between processes, rather than something like ANGLE, where the opengl commands themselves were sent between processes.')
