I don&#x27;t regret having gone on a canoe trip but I do regret many hours of playing RTS games.<p>Maybe it&#x27;s just me and my brain is prone to addiction to games, but it&#x27;s a loop that&#x27;s hard to escape. At first it&#x27;s pleasurable, then I find myself playing through the night, just one more game again and again, I start to gain weight, sleep in, resent the whole thing but crave the fake-accomplishment and dream with the game. I might be an outlier. It hasn&#x27;t ruined my life though because I always snapped out of it due to some external event that forced me to stop and then I normalize after some days or a week or two of not playing. But when living alone and nobody stopping me, I have definitely wasted months of my life on such things and have holes in my CV due to it.<p>Nowadays I just refuse to play games altogether. I miss out on some cultural references, but so be it. Same with TV series and binge watching. I miss out on them and become a more boring person but I just cannot do a little bit of these. If I start I&#x27;m useless for days or weeks.<p>It&#x27;s easier to have willpower to just not start.')
