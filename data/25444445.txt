I don&#x27;t do much on IRC, but my limited time there was productive and friendly.<p>There were (probably still are) a few assholes and zealots on comp.lang.lisp, but they were easy enough to ignore (killfiles are your friends). I think some people also got a bit testy and short there because of the trolls. People like Jon Harrop liked to go on there and basically say, &quot;You&#x27;re all morons and lisp is useless garbage here&#x27;s why...&quot; as a way of promoting F#. It was incredibly obnoxious, and I recall during his time as a troll there people becoming overly sensitive to other posts that <i>looked</i> like trolling but were meant in earnest. This would have been off-putting if you got caught in the crossfire.')
