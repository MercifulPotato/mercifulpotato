As a young person, I won’t be taking the vaccine anytime soon anyways, not because I have anything against vaccines, but because I have many doubts about barely tested drugs <i>in general</i> (I’ll take it after it’s been tested for a few years).<p>But hey, say this on YouTube and I’ll be banned!')
