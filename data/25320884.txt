Item(by='yellowapple', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607226922, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25318669, text='&gt; The argument against it is that a vacant property imposes very little cost upon society.<p>A vacant property (really, any ownership of property, <i>period</i>) results in an opportunity cost externalized onto all other members of society.  That opportunity cost is equal to the land&#x27;s value.  In the middle of nowhere, therefore, that opportunity cost might be low to the point of nonexistence, but in the middle of a city downtown, that opportunity cost can be and often is on the scale of tens&#x2F;hundreds of thousands of dollars (or more!) per year.  That is wealth that is long overdue to be repaid back to the rest of society.')
