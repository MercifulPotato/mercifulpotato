It&#x27;s the reason we&#x27;ve got the photo of Bowie at Victoria Station -- photographed while waving to the crowd, he had to repeatedly deny being a Nazi afterward, because it sure looked like a Nazi salute in the photo.<p>Once the actual Nazis started showing up we had to get more explicit in our condemnation of their evil, and that&#x27;s okay -- rejecting hate is the easy part.  Defending ourselves against the people we agree with is much harder.')
