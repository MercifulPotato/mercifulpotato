If I have a question about Elixir, I don&#x27;t even think about going to StackOverflow for it. I either go ask on ElixirForum, or Google for my problem (which, in most cases, lands me to an ElixirForum thread rather than a StackOverflow one). I think the surge in the use of ElixirForum is inversely correlated with the use of StackOverflow: the more the forum has grown, the less reason there has been to use SO.<p>I do worry about the impact it has on these &quot;popularity tracking&quot; services though, since the discussion living elsewhere might (falsely?) indicate that the language isn&#x27;t attracting developers.')
