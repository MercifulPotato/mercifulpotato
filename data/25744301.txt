I2P would share bandwidth with other nodes, but not out to the public internet. It was always built as an anonymous network with various services hosted in it. Basically it&#x27;s like a stripped down robust version of Tor that only has hidden services. HTTP proxies to the public internet are just a hidden service essentially. Unless you chose to set up one yourself it never just allowed random I2P nodes to proxy out to the public internet through your connection.')
