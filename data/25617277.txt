I am keen on feedback and potential contributors.<p>From the README:\nWhat is the point of HyperTag&#x27;s existence? HyperTag offers some unique features such as the import function that make it very convenient to use. Also HyperTag&#x27;s code base is written in Python and thus extremely small (&lt;500 LOC) compared to TMSU (&gt;10,000 LOC) and SuperTag (&gt;25,000 LOC), making it very easy to modify &#x2F; extend &#x2F; fix it yourself.')
