A catch-all &quot;rule&quot; doesn&#x27;t make sense.<p>In some channels I just type my update. Those channels don&#x27;t have Hello or similar. We usually never actually leave them.  We&#x27;re always on. Even if we go offline we&#x27;re deemed &quot;will connect later&quot;. The message will get to wherever eventually. Especially PMs to a particular person.<p>In other channels, especially those Question&#x2F;Answer channels... often the Hello is to see if anyone is around. If no one is around and the question is time sensitive, why bother asking it?<p>Other channels work across time. Ask your question now and a person may later answer. Even later still you will get the answer. No one is offended by delays. Its expected.<p>In still other channels, a &quot;hello&quot; is mandatory. Who are you? Why are you here? Did you just barge in and start asking questions or join the chat? Introduce yourself.<p>Different context. Different rules. Synchronous vs Asynchronous. Different expectations.')
