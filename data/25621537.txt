Sometimes they aren&#x27;t even &quot;problems&quot; but just improvements or curiosities. You might just need to dig a little more or reflect on things.<p>For example, I taught myself Java for Android and created an app to calculate party alcohol needs. One part was pretty trivial - cost&#x2F;volume calculation for the price per pure unit of ethanol. Then I modified the BAC formula so that I could plug in the variables (number of people, estimated average weight, hours partying, etc) and have a slider for how drunk you wanted the people at the party, then it would tell you how much alcohol you needed to buy. I found it very interesting to make. Sadly it never made me rich (or any money for that matter).')
