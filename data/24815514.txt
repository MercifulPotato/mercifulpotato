If you’re not sweating against other players, then you probably prefer to keep it casual. That’s fine!<p>But if I can’t play Overwatch, the latest Call of Duty, Escape from Tarkov, etc on Linux, then I wouldn’t bother. I think it’s more about multiplayer when talking about casual vs more serious.')
