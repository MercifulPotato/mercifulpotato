Instead, there is a college of electors, and those electors should at least reflect the electoral outcome in the nominal congressional districts that they represent, as in Maine and Nebraska.  (I know that&#x27;s not how elector assignment generally works, but I think it&#x27;s just as valid an interpretation as your &quot;1 entity&quot; view).<p>Neither that per-district system, nor my original popular vote proportional system, would require a parliamentary style of government.  Indeed, under a parliamentary system, the executive would be chosen by parliament itself and there would be no need for the electoral college or even the presidential vote at all.')
