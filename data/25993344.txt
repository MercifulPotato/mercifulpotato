This is wildly used for asynchronous communication between services.<p>I use MQTT (or other buses) when I have services that need to send some information without consideration for the services that need that information. The first ones are producers, the other ones - consumers.<p>This is a very powerful approach when you have good cases. IoTs are typical cases where they send data and something else makes use of them. Another example is code that calculates some information and emits its results.<p>Some of my code retrieve google calendar information and emits that - and it is consumed by a dashboard, some other code that makes decisions such as alarm clocks etc.<p>In general you use this for asynchronous messaging, especially in with one-to-many scenarios.')
