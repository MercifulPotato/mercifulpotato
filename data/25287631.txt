Item(by='waffl', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606992252, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25281164, text='In Regensburg, Germany, there is a restaurant that has essentially been operating for 850 years since the construction of the Steinernen (Stone) bridge was constructed in 1146 AD, and in its precise&#x2F;current form as a sausage restaurant since 1806. It&#x27;s really incredible to see the longevity of a simple business like this and be able to eat where entirely different generations ate for almost a millennium (Plus the food is honestly remarkably good if you eat meat). There are only three things on the menu: sausage, sauerkraut and potato soup and together they make a very nice meal :)<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Regensburg_Sausage_Kitchen" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Regensburg_Sausage_Kitchen</a>')
