Either way, while terms like retard, autist, and gay are used frequently I&#x27;ve yet to see any racism or any xenophobia whatsoever in the community. And any insinuation of it is usually shut down fast. And While they use that mantra I think WSB is very unlike 4chan (although my exposure to 4chan is extremely limited) and its racism&#x2F;hate speech.')
