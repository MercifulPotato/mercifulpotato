I like this policy a lot, and don&#x27;t mind paying extra.<p>Unfortunately, the way many restaurants choose to manifest this is via a &quot;mandatory 18% service charge&quot; that is <i>not</i> reflected in the prices themselves. I hate this. I wish restaurants would just publish a menu that has the &quot;all-in&quot; price, with the &quot;service charge&quot; and taxes included. Maybe the market will reject this, but I suspect that this fear is not fully founded.')
