I have Logitech C910 and it does 1080p60 flawlessly. I wonder if it is not actually 2.0 but USB 1.1 which made sense since the transfer rate is abysmally low (1.1 does up to 12 Mbps, 2.0 is up to 480 Mbps).<p>I am not who you were responding to, but I can confirm that at 480 Mbps our Intel Realsense does not work, 5000 Mbps are mandatory. We use an Infrared stereo mode at 30 fps. I am not a my desk now and don&#x27;t remember the exact details by heart.')
