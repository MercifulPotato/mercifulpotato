Where brew is generally based on recipes (read: collection of bash scripts) that may or may not play well together, MacPorts is a package system with well-defined dependencies. The drawback to MacPorts is that everything is built from source, and nothing previously installed on the system is utilized -- so installing Python for the first time may take 30-60 minutes. But the next time is 5 minutes, and you can install all the versions you want, where they&#x27;ll live side-by-side in peace and love and harmony.<p>MacPorts is slower, but offers peace of mind -- &#x27;cause when I&#x27;m trying to develop something, the last thing I want to worry about is dependency issues (gross)')
