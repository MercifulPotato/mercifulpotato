Item(by='yrimaxi', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611612850, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25909280, text='&gt; but I can’t understand deciding it’s ipso facto irrelevant because you’re a programmer.<p>The negation of “everyone should know this” is not “no one should know this”.
