I&#x27;m saying that the polling data is so flawed because it&#x27;s not getting into a specific democratic that it&#x27;s off by much wider margin. So much so that if Trump wins again it&#x27;s because it was a 40% chance he won both 2016 and 2020, we just don&#x27;t have the polling data to prove that number.<p>So while you say 6% &quot;happens all the time&quot; - no it actually happens 6% of the time. But 40% for both terms would indicate more like he had a 70% last time and maybe another 60% this time. The pollsters can be correct for fucking California, but what good is that if they&#x27;re super wrong because racist people in Alabama don&#x27;t click or pick up the phone (or have no phone to begin with) or talk to pollsters.')
