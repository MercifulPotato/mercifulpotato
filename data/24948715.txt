There&#x27;s also the fact that many vegan people try not to purchase vegan products if they come from a &quot;non-vegan company&quot;. So if a meat producer also starts peddling tofu, vegans will buy from a different brand simply so they don&#x27;t line the pockets of the meat or dairy industry. With the way things are going, I&#x27;d imagine the first to achieve lab-grown top-quality meat would be an agricultural&#x2F;farm corporation, which wouldn&#x27;t sit well with many vegans.')
