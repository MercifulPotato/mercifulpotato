I wonder if what&#x27;s happening is that the very top of the market is falling out. There exist apartments for rent in the tens of thousands <i>per month</i> range in Manhattan, and it totally would not surprise me that if you wanted a place to live with a large family, it&#x27;s no longer interesting to do that in a skyscraper by Central Park.<p>If that were true, that would explain why the <i>median</i> rent is down 22% - the top end of the curve got lopped off - but I&#x27;m certainly not seeing rents down even 0%, let alone 22%, in my range!<p>(That would also line up with the article&#x27;s claim that 80% of groups looking for homes are 1-2 person groups. The 20% is quite profitable.)')
