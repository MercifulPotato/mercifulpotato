The SAG constitution [1] contains a special provision requiring a supermajority to ask for a pay cap or to call a strike. Acting, like tech, is largely meritocratic with a huge talent dispersion. A prohibition on pay caps is necessary.<p>I somehow doubt the Google tech activists will be copying the SAG&#x27;s meritocratic philosophy. Every single thing I&#x27;ve seen from Google activists and their ilk is about prioritizing technical excellence way behind having the correct ideology. The people behind the Google unionization effort are not genuinely concerned about working conditions. They really want two things:<p>- to be gatekeepers that keep their ideological opponents out of big tech companies (even moreso than now), and<p>- to gain power to pressure big tech companies into punishing their ideological opponents (for example, banning advertising from certain websites, refusing cloud services to oil and gas industries, censorship intensification, and large donations to their favored organizations).<p>If you&#x27;d been at Google and watched all this unfold over the past few years, it&#x27;d be obvious to you what these people are really about.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sagaftra.org&#x2F;files&#x2F;sa_documents&#x2F;2019%20Constitution%20-%20Updated%20Rules%202020%201214.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sagaftra.org&#x2F;files&#x2F;sa_documents&#x2F;2019%20Constitut...</a>')
