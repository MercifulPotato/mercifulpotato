Item(by='dragonwriter', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611133407, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25844097, text='&gt; They’re not doing this if the press reaches out to them for comment with the specific details first.<p>The press didn’t have the specific details until given them by Google, which is the “naming and blaming”.<p>The press had a report from another party of an apparently nonfunctional corporate email address. Describing the existence and basis of an internal investigation that had not been completed from that is grossly unprofessional; I’d be mildly surprised if it was done by a small outfit where media inquiries were regularly fielded by someone with no corporate PR, HR, or legal training, advice, or guidance, but for anything at Google’s scale it is unimaginable as anything but a conscious, deliberate breach of norms with the intent of harming the subject employee in public without developing a full picture of the facts, and that’s <i>assuming Google’s statement is completely truthful as far as it goes</i>.')
