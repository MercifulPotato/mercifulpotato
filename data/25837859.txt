Gridded ion thrusters have slightly better efficiencies (add 5-10%), mainly because they operate at higher Isp (they would actually have worse efficiency than Hall thrusters when operating in the 1000-1500s range).<p>Why I object to the (admittedly common) characterization of Isp as an efficiency: it is always better to have a high efficiency, whereas Isp is always a trade-off between mass budget and power budget so optimal Isp is always mission-dependent.')
