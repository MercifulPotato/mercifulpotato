What we call &quot;races&quot; are actually mishmashes of a large variety of different ethnic groups, many of which have little to nothing in common with each other genetically.<p>Vaccines are certified by age and by gender and that&#x27;s it.  There will never be a &quot;whites-only&quot; vaccine and the very idea is morally repugnant and biologically ridiculous.')
