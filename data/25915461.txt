They haven&#x27;t released details of how many they sold, or on what dates.<p>It&#x27;s not clear what view the SEC would take if they fast tracked an ATM offering now. Hertz were told to knock it off, but they were literally trading in bankruptcy. There&#x27;s a pretty good argument to be made that issuing more shares is if anything the responsible thing to do to in response to increased demand, since it would help to correct the anomalous price rally.')
