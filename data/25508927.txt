I have never experienced anything like that in my life. The school I went to was not a university I think (I&#x27;m not sure how to compare the Dutch &amp; US education systems) but they would change and improve courses based on student &amp; industry feedback every year, so while you could get an idea from upper year students what kind of questions they would ask, you would still have to learn it.')
