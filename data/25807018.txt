It really angers me every time I see a huge amount of whitespace for no good reason, but then most of the functionality is hidden behind a dropdown menu whose equally stupid &#x27;...&#x27; indicator only shows up when you happen to hover over it. WTF.<p>Back when UIs were still good, things would usually be hidden only if there wasn&#x27;t enough space. You could see almost everything you needed at a glance. The &quot;designers&quot; dismiss that as &quot;messy&quot; and &quot;clutter&quot;, which is frankly absurd --- something functional is not going to look &quot;clean&quot;, much like a machine shop that&#x27;s in active use: Tools and parts are laid out everywhere, because the user needs access to them.<p>That diskprices.com site is great. Craigslist is another one that comes to mind. The only thing it&#x27;s missing is a &quot;submit&quot; button for those who have JS disabled... otherwise it&#x27;s a perfect example of extremely functional design that wasn&#x27;t ruined by &quot;UI&#x2F;UX designers&quot;.')
