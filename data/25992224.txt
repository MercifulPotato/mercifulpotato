You might get interested to make a movie based on its elevator pitch, but you probably won&#x27;t be that interested in seeing it - unless you already know a lot about it, for example you might want to see an MCU movie based on the description The Avengers fight Thanos! But that&#x27;s not because it&#x27;s a concise description - in fact there&#x27;s hardly any description at all, the sale is made by relying on a mind embellishing it themselves.')
