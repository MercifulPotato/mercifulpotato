Interesting that someone might have made a custom fit, nicely silkscreened and barcode part-labeled bug for one specific model of voip phone.<p>I would imagine these bugs are designed by hardware engineers (a high skill job due to uniqueness of such trait), but not necessarily assembled by the same engineers (a lower skill job which requires different qualities).<p>So, for example, a &#x27;TAO station&#x27; would not necessarily contain all those engineers who designed the bugs, but it would have technicians who can install&#x2F;implement them.')
