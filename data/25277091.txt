Like on the voter fraud thing,  lefty news keeps saying no evidence of &quot;widespread&quot; voter fraud.  Where as right news has many small scale specific examples of fraud.  Which narrative is true all hinges on the definition of &quot;widespread&quot; which is something that can never be agreed on.    This is why I now read both left and right news,  because each side only gives you half the story.')
