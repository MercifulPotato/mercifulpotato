It&#x27;s configured for all packages in RHEL distribution and it works. It&#x27;s an additional layer of defense and think that&#x27;s the most important denominator from other Linux distributions. I saw recent Ubuntu distributions shipped with AppArmor, but I&#x27;m not sure that it&#x27;s as good.<p>2. First-class support for systemd. Well, I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s a fair point.. But with Debian I&#x27;m always seeing some messages about sysv scripts, even when I&#x27;m using systemctl. It feels like some scripts were not fully ported to systemd or something like that. Some people don&#x27;t like systemd, but I, personally, think that it&#x27;s a good solution. AFAIK systemd development is sponsored by Redhat and its support is very good, all services are shipped with proper systemd units.<p>3. First-class support for NetworkManager, Firewalld. I think that those packages are available for Debian, but it&#x27;s nice to have them installed and configured from the start, they&#x27;re very convenient to use.<p>4. Documentation. Most of that documentation is hidden behind loginwall, but <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;access.redhat.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;access.redhat.com&#x2F;</a> contains plenty of information.<p>There are some drawbacks of RHEL. The major one for me is limited software selection. You need to enable EPEL even for some basic software like Strongswan, Certbot or OpenDKIM. And EPEL is not RHEL (although it&#x27;s quite good).')
