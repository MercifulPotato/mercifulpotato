He&#x27;s been pretty clear about wanting to address systemic racism, the green new deal, a science-based response to covid, valuing international coalitions, etc.<p>If anything I&#x27;m kind of anticipating him walking back his pledges on those things when in office. Though I hope not.<p>Let&#x27;s also bear in mind though that, while we can armchair-quarterback, his strategy succeeded.<p>I think the question of if moving to a more aggressively Progressive agenda would bring in voters hungry for change who are otherwise turned off by Democrats, or if moving more to the center to bring in voters turned off by a more Progressive agenda, is an extremely vexed question to which I have no answer.<p>That is interesting about Germany though.<p>And at the end of the day my own belief is that we are living in a time of change, and that it&#x27;s important to offer policies I believe to be right (mainly Progressive policies) to address that change.<p>Or otherwise the void will be filled, as you pointed out about Germany, by something else.<p>At the same time we haven&#x27;t seen that approach be successful on a national level in US politics yet. So I don&#x27;t know.<p>Curious what your thoughts are.')
