Negatives like these are hard to quantify and therefore hard to compare. What the men are paying for on OnlyFans is a pseudo-connection or a fake relationship. \nThis strikes me as being emotionally, sexually, or romantically manipulative or exploitative.<p>Of course the men choose to contribute but the incentive structure is for the women to foster a sense of intimacy or connection so they can exploit it for cash. It&#x27;s a voluntary association, but it doesn&#x27;t seem like a morally neutral or harmless association to me.<p>This is not to say that the harm men face from exploitation is greater than the harm that women face - or that women don&#x27;t also face this phenomenon, but just that it is also a harmful byproduct of the service.')
