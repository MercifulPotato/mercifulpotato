The capitalist priority is always to reduce cost and increase profit, after all. (Though they also happily pay to reinvent the wheel, because business doesn&#x27;t understand yet that that actually results in lost value)<p>It would be better to incentivze companies to donate their engineers&#x27; time and work into improving the source code. Often they refuse to do <i>that</i> because they&#x27;re petrified of patent, licensing, and intellectual property rights issues. Make that a no-brainer for them, and maybe suddenly they&#x27;d see the value in not only paying for it, but even contributing to it. I think the true value big companies can bring is an entire software development team and the &#x27;test environment&#x27; of a big production use case.')
