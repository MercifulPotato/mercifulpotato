Maybe I&#x27;ll add the &quot;add_slots&quot; behavior into the @dataclass decorator in 3.10, even though it would need to return a new class. At least it could be well documented, and I doubt it&#x27;s a concern for most people.<p>&gt; Thanks for working on dataclasses :) - as I said, it&#x27;s my #1 new feature in Python.<p>I&#x27;m offended! I also wrote f-strings, but maybe that&#x27;s not considered new anymore. In any event, you&#x27;re welcome!')
