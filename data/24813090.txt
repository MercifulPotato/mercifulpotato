Many car companies fully split their lending and you might end up with costs on not going through with lending even if you get your money back on the car.. Insurance companies, DMV registration taxes, etc, might try to hit you a little bit on rounding and can have some non-refundable charges but more significantly, will mess with you on paperwork which is all the hassle of work.<p>I doubt many people went through with that, though I can imagine people who started on impulse created weird situations for their sales teams and weren&#x27;t worth the hassle.')
