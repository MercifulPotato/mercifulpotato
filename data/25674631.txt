Item(by='ThrowawayR2', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610042280, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25673480, text='&gt; &quot;<i>That&#x27;s how the society works: its moral values are reflected by the actions of those who participate in it.</i>&quot;<p>The gaping flaw in the &quot;social norms&quot; argument is that slavery, women as second class citizens, religious intolerance, etc. used to be a social norms as well, so in those eras one has to suspect the parent poster would be arguing in favor of those as well.  It is basically a conservative viewpoint saying that what society believes to be moral at the present time will always be moral, so hearing it parroted by people claiming to be aligned with the left is just mind-bending.<p>For the record I am a (old-school) liberal.')
