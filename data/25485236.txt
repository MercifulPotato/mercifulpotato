From my perspective, HN isn&#x27;t really designed for addiction in the same way. No personalized, UAM-optimized algorithmic feed, no infinite river of small content bites, no rich mechanisms for interaction. And, very importantly, it has the noprocrast feature, which I long ago set to low usage levels.<p>And as others point out, it&#x27;s not like I took some sort of vow of internet chastity to a god who will now smite me because I looked at HN. The point was to partially undo some bad habits that had built up during the election cycle. I&#x27;ll often make some 1-month change at the beginning of the month. For me it&#x27;s valuable mainly as self-experiment and a way of getting back to some baseline.')
