The filesystem drivers, the TCP&#x2F;IP stack, the HAL, and possibly other components were rewritten from scratch for XBox specifically. It wasn&#x27;t just locked down, a significant portion of &quot;Windows&quot; was entirely missing, and a decent chunk was replaced with new, Windows-incompatible code.<p>I suppose it depends on what &quot;based on&quot; means, though. It is <i>technically</i> based on Windows, but not like most people would take that to mean. e.g, when you say &quot;based on linux&quot;, you don&#x27;t take it to mean, &quot;based on our custom kernel based on the initial loader and memory management and debugger functions in linux with the rest scrapped and replaced with a custom stack&quot;.<p>Using a little hyperbole there, but yeah. It does use DirectX, and is more Windows than not. But I can definitely see why someone might see it as a &quot;lie&quot; that it&#x27;s &quot;based on Windows&quot;.')
