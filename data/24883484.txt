Rather than do all that, at least in Gnome, when I unzip it has an option of &#x27;preserve directory structure&#x27; that I unchecked, which basically gets rid of all the folders.  From there I was easily able to mass remove all the json and other non-photo files, leaving only the photos behind.  Good luck.')
