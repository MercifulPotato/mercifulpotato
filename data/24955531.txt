I&#x27;m sure there are things even the best among us do today that could be harshly judged in the future.<p>Well, to be fair, people where aghast at his position towards women <i>when he took it as a position</i>. Not just in modern times.<p>Watch some of his interviews -- he seems to think he is coming off as manly and possessive, but the female journalists interviewing him usually come off as insulted, scared, and overall disrespectful towards his misogynist attitudes. Barbara Walters saw right through his image, which is why that interview was one of the ones to go so lopsided.<p>He was judged plenty when he was &#x27;modern&#x27;, too. Since the judgement came about when he was young, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s too great a leap to discuss now around his death.<p>This isn&#x27;t a case where his behavior was normalized by his time of existence : he was a misogynist during the hay-day of the first wave of Womens&#x27; Rights, he was well known to be one, and his antics and interviews were broadcast around the world.<p><i>He</i> decided to go &#x27;against the grain&#x27; during one of the most important civil rights movements in the United States so that he could keep his macho demeanor. His comments in no way encapsulated a standard male response, he was deliberately pushing the buttons of people to strengthen and  embolden his image as a playboy misogynist.<p>RIP Sean, I loved you as an actor.  You were amazing in a lot of ways, and not-so-amazing in some others, but that is to be human.<p>&#x27;To ignore either righteous or the condemning would be to ignore history and humanity itself.&#x27;')
