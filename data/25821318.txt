For what it&#x27;s worth, bail <i>is</i> supposed to set to an amount based in part on the person&#x27;s wealth. So for two people ~~convicted~~ accused of identical crimes, where one has 10x the means of the other, the bails should be 10x different. It doesn&#x27;t always happen that way of course, but it is part of the guidelines.')
