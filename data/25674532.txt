I understand that people arrange items via WhatsApp but it seems baffling to me. Why not just use email to notify people??<p>When you sign up to any service, they ask for an email address. They don&#x27;t ask for a mobile number necessarily, and there is never a &quot;my mobile number is on WhatsApp&quot; checkbox. Why is the assumption of the organiser that you&#x27;re on WhatsApp your concern? They have assumed you&#x27;re on a certain platform, and it&#x27;s their mistake.<p>It reminds me of the tidal wave of people suddenly abandoning their own websites and instead using &quot;Find Us On Facebook&quot;. They might as well put &quot;Use this keyword on AOL&quot;.<p>Facebook is not the internet, and WhatsApp is not the only communication method.')
