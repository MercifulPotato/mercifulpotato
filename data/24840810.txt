How does this apply to Backblaze&#x27;s unlimited backup service?<p>So far, it has worked out for us (going on 14 years now).  If you are curious about the size distribution of our customers, here is a histogram of our Personal Backup customer data sizes from the end of 2018: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;iVEuwUT.jpg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;iVEuwUT.jpg</a>  (You will need to zoom in to see all the data points - the largest customer stores 430 TBytes for $6&#x2F;month.)  Backblaze never raised any funding, we&#x27;re self sufficient with no deep pockets, so it works for us financially.<p>Just to be clear, Backblaze doesn&#x27;t price the Personal Backup product as $6&#x2F;month for an unlimited amount of storage to attract gigantic customers.  Our driving force for almost every decision on the Personal Backup product was to make it &quot;easy&quot; for people who either are not experts at using computers, or just don&#x27;t want to spend a lot of their time on it.  My 88 year old father doesn&#x27;t know the difference between a MByte or a GByte or a TByte, and he would be stressed out worrying about &quot;paying per GByte&quot;.  The fixed price of $6&#x2F;month is intended to reduce &quot;sales friction&quot;, not attract massive storage customers.  Another issue for non-computer-expert customers is they don&#x27;t know where all their files are.  So to make it &quot;easy&quot;, Backblaze simply backs up EVERYTHING by default, and only excludes things like the Operating System if we absolutely know what it is and know it can be recovered in other ways.  So the Backblaze Personal Backup product can be installed with a username and password, ZERO CONFIGURATION, and the customer&#x27;s data is backed up.  But that wouldn&#x27;t work very well if we charged per GByte, customers would think we were doing it just to increase how much they are charged.  :-)  So the &quot;fixed price for any amount of storage&quot; is part of the overall &quot;easy to use&quot; strategy.<p>What we ask of our above average storage customers is that they recommend the product to their less technical friends with less data.  We get a good reputation by supporting the large customers, and those customers are often the &quot;technical mavens&quot; that recommend products to their friends and family.<p>I work on the Personal Backup client that runs on your laptop. Personally I like the super ultra big customers simply as quality assurance.  If I can keep the client running for a customer with 400 TBytes, it will absolutely purr like a kitten for an average sized customer with 1 TByte of data.')
