The power that these private companies wield is greater than the power of any government. They&#x27;re not democratic. They are driven by the unending pursuit of growth. They have no moral compass, so their rules are in their own private interest. They dodge taxes, support populist movements to virtue signal, and they quietly collude with governments that wish to spy on their journalists and citizens so they can &quot;disappear&quot; them for wrongthink. Their rules are &quot;whatever is best for us&quot;.<p>I don&#x27;t know what the answer is, but having seen these large private companies censor rational discussion of scientific fact, this scares me.')
