This reminds me of the story of Siraj Raval, a formerly highly influential YouTuber on machine learning and blockchain topics:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.plagiarismtoday.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;10&#x2F;16&#x2F;why-siraj-ravals-plagiarism-is-the-future-of-plagiarism&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.plagiarismtoday.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;10&#x2F;16&#x2F;why-siraj-ravals-...</a><p>Some years ago, when I started getting into machine learning, I couldn&#x27;t tell he is a fraud. Considering that just before he was broadly exposed as a fraudster, he was invited by the European Space Agency (ESA) to give a talk, I was in good company. I think the only reason he got exposed is because he started making stupidly bold claims, attributing high-profile original research to himself. If it weren&#x27;t for this, he would probably still be accepted by the mainstream because the case a few experts could make against him wouldn&#x27;t be strong enough.<p>My point is: it is hard to see what is fraud and what isn&#x27;t. If the ESA can&#x27;t tell the difference, how can average parents?')
