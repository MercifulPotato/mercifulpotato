Item(by='graycat', descendants=None, kids=[25592031], score=None, time=1609367490, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25584977, text='&gt; penalize???<p>Due to <i>bad</i> content, I flatly refuse to go to Web sites of ABC, ..., WaPo.  E.g., if there is a post at Hacker News from the NYT,<p>===&gt;&gt; NO WAY &lt;&lt;===<p>will I go there.  Same for The Guardian, the BBC, etc.  Fool me once, shame on you.  Fool me twice, shame on me.  Bad media has fooled me way, WAY too often, and I will NOT go back.  I just conclude, bluntly, fooling people is all they know how to do.  But they aren&#x27;t fooling me anymore.<p>It&#x27;s worse than that:  For many years I got <i>triple play</i> Internet access -- Internet, landline phone, and TV.  And my house had three nice TV sets.  But I NEVER used the TV (except for movies on VCR).  The <i>triple play</i> was cheaper than just Internet and landline phone access.<p>What happened was, I clicked through all the TV channels looking for something worth watching and finding nothing once too often and flatly, absolutely, positively, totally gave up on all of TV.  All of it.  Now I have no TV set at all.<p>From me, ALL of TV has been <i>penalized</i>, totally.  And nearly all of the mainstream media sources have been equally penalized.<p>What do I pay attention to?  Hacker News for one:  I get good links to good content and the often good comments on that content from Hacker News readers who post.<p>For the issue of images and video, notice that Hacker News has none of that!  Fine with me!<p>For more?  Sure, a few selected blogs and YouTube channels.<p>In total, there are a lot of good URLs just on Hacker News!')
