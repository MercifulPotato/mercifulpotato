It&#x27;s also getting a little more opinionated. The upcoming version 3 removes long-standing warts and adds great features including sum types, intersection types, enums, and more. A huge thing is that it addresses binary compatibility issues, by allowing Scala 2 and 3 to use each other&#x27;s libraries. Also, Scala has wonderful, super stable JavaScript support with Scala.js, and under development native support Scala Native.')
