In Australia, vehicle emission standards and design rules are set by the federal government, not the states. If a state tried to set more stringent standards, there is a risk the federal government might argue in court that is invalid as contrary to federal legislation, and there is a decent chance the federal government would succeed.<p>(Although both Australia and the US are federations, and the Australian constitution is heavily influenced by the US constitution, the balance of power between the state and federal governments is different in each country, so just because a US state can &quot;go-it-alone&quot; on some issue doesn&#x27;t mean an Australian state necessarily can.)')
