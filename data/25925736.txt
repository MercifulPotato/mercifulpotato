I recently had a combination of two popular pieces of software, both widely used by professional programmers, where a plugin was crashing the host application when even basic functionality was triggered. The problem was sufficient that I had to abandon using them and ended up writing that program in a different programming language because it was faster than messing around with broken tools. It turns out that some of these much-touted modern standards for interoperability and portability aren&#x27;t all that great after all.<p>And of course, while we don&#x27;t get a literal blue screen any more, it&#x27;s not as if Windows 10 and several other popular operating systems don&#x27;t frequently break users&#x27; devices, sometimes catastrophically, when rolling out updates. We&#x27;ve just come to expect (by which I really mean, been forced to accept) this culture of shoving broken stuff out and fixing it later, even in the most essential software like our operating systems.<p>Meanwhile, the last time I saw significant instability on any desktop OS prior to quite recently, I think I was running Windows 95. So maybe the spectacles aren&#x27;t <i>that</i> rose-tinted after all.')
