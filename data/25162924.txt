Item(by='kazinator', descendants=None, kids=[25163195], score=None, time=1605894663, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25162563, text='The vacation idea needs to be in the core application.<p>A simple toggle: &quot;pause Anki&quot;. Here are my requirements:<p>- in the paused state, the review UI is entirely disabled. You cannot review anything.<p>- when you toggle out of the paused state, Anki calculates the number of days since the pause, and delays all cards in all decks by that many days.<p>- pausing and resuming on the same day has no effect since the days delta is zero; the UI just becomes enabled.<p>- For the purposes of the delta calculation, a day is the study day (e.g. 7 a.m to 7 a.m), not the midnight-to-midnight calendar day. If you pause at 11:45 p.m. and resume at 1:15 a.m., that&#x27;s a no-op since that&#x27;s the same study day.<p>- since resuming is potentially a time-consuming operation that destructively manipulates the database, unpausing comes with some yes&#x2F;cancel prompt, except in the no-op case.')
