If the article is anywhere close to truth, then it can only be explained by the bad implementation - may be they moved the freed diesel engineers to do the hybrids after the dieselgate :)<p>Recently walking a dog waiting for the light i saw&#x2F;heard a Volvo XC90 hybrid doing ICE start from the red-light stop - the ICE started a moment before the car started to move - it did cross my mind back then that such start of engine would [unnecessary] burn a lot - ie. my Prius starts moving on pure electric with the ICE kicking, if&#x2F;when needed, some moments later, much smoother, better torque and better efficiency. The performance-wise the XC90 had a regular start, far from anything fancy, and anyway large starting ICE wouldn&#x27;t produce much performance while starting (and waiting for it to spin from the 0 in order to get some performance would eat the time thus killing that performance), so why would they do that ?')
