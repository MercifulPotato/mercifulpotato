We knew that before querying. It would be reasonable, and a great idea even, to return multiple results, and include the CSS color if the query matches that name. But maybe I really do want to query for pictures of coral and not the CSS color names. The CSS “coral” was someone’s arbitrary choice, and not the only right answer. Don’t make the mistake of assuming that CSS color names should be considered the authority on color names- to the exclusion of any other use of the word - outside of HTML or X11 contexts, or even within those contexts.')
