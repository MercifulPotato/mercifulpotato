And I disagree that many people doing HoTT today are proposing it as an alternative foundation in anything except (categorical) homotopy theory, and I&#x27;d like to know where you see anyone doing that.<p>Intuitionism in HoTT isn&#x27;t about constructivity, which I agree is rejected by mainstream mathematicians. It&#x27;s about the models of the theory. For example, LEM doesn&#x27;t hold in the category of bundles over the circle (see my other comment on here). If you think of the axiom of choice as &quot;every surjection has a section&quot;, then this doesn&#x27;t hold for topological spaces. (Take the double cover of the circle; there&#x27;s no <i>continuous</i> section.) I disagree that these examples are uninteresting to mainstream mathematicians.')
