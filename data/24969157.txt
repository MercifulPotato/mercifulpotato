If you question anything mainstream these days, or try to discuss an alternative viewpoint, the conversation almost always turns vitriol. It&#x27;s unfortunate, because there have been a lot of &quot;conspiracy theories&quot; that have been shown fully- or partially-true with time, but people seem to be very cult-like in their beliefs, even if they don&#x27;t truly understand their beliefs. It&#x27;s odd to me, and I wish we weren&#x27;t like this. I&#x27;ve lost a lot of friends in harsh ways because of things I have become more outspoken about recently, yet we had been friends for years beforehand even when I knew they had the opposing view -- I was simply too afraid to share my view for fear of losing friends. But alas...<p>Edit: it&#x27;s kind of crazy that I&#x27;m getting downvoted for sharing something that I would&#x27;ve <i>hoped</i> people would agree with. I guess not, and this proves my point. Man, we live in crazy times.')
