Do you think there&#x27;s potential for abuse with different rulesets for different people?<p>&gt; Demarcating crime from uncrime is Sorites paradox.<p>I disagree. The measure of a crime is subjective and objective. Subjectively, the victim notices they have been wronged. Objectively, there is a claim by a plaintiff against a defendant.
