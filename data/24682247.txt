I have a constant battle with some (not all) of my team to get them to think through a problem from its fundamentals, and try to find the best one or two or three ways to pose the problem.<p>Conveniently-posed problems lead to both convenient solutions, as well as a variety of potential ancillary benefits.<p>One practical application of this, for those who are more business-minded, is that I have set a very clear and tight tech strategy for our team. There have been quite a few instances where posing a problem differently has allowed us to better align with that strategy by enabling us to pursue solutions that make use of our existing technology stack and in-house tooling, rather than requiring us to introduce more dependencies and spread ourselves even thinner.')
