I recall from their F# Jupyter notebooks demo they specifically implied they&#x27;re trying to steal Python&#x27;s lunch in the data science world<p>At this point though I believe the F# community is active and resourceful enough to carry themselves even if Microsoft directed resources away from the language. One of the things I noticed early on about the F# community is they tend to be mindful about their investments, and like to mold existing, established work into something more ergonomic for the F# community. The Giraffe, Fable, and Bolero projects are all wonderful examples of this mentality.')
