For example, if I contract you to build me a house, it takes six months, and three months in you decide to back out and pay me back with interest, I still have half a house I need to demolish or else I have to find someone who would continue your work (which I likely won&#x27;t find), and I&#x27;m out 3 months&#x27; rent.<p>I would expect additional compensation.')
