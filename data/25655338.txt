The punishment for hurting someone is much higher than the amount it takes to help someone.  And spending a thousand dollars to help an anonymous person, who is in a sea of people not getting help, and will fall back into that sea soon enough, feels like tossing it into a black hole when the donation is all by itself.  But if there&#x27;s enough donations together, they feel more meaningful.<p>You&#x27;re measuring value in just about the weakest possible context.<p>People want to make a difference that&#x27;s visible when looking at the entire problem.')
