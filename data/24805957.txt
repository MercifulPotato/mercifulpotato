Not the occasional 10+ second page load, where you&#x27;ve accidentally clicked something that happens to generate a cascade of cache misses.  I can forgive that kind of infrequent performance hiccup.<p>But rather, regular usage, especially of Confluence and Jira, just feels <i>sluggish</i> when doing bread and butter actions - adding a comment to a ticket or reloading a kanban view, loading a new page or opening the search dialog on Confluence.<p>Yet, everything I&#x27;ve heard about the responsiveness of the &#x27;cloud&#x27; offering is that it drives people to move to the on-prem server version.')
