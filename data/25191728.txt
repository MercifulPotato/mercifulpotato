I suspected the two species wouldn’t be compatible though I’ve heard of stranger relationships between individual animals.<p>I searched (DDG) for “cat saliva toxic to birds” and I found this very informative article [1] on the subject of rescuing birds from cats (also bringing the topic back to corvids).
