It is a fallacy to evaluate a particular tool&#x27;s usefulness for a particular job by how popular that tool is.<p>Okay but this is a very engineering-specific mindset. I encourage you to broaden your perspective. &quot;Correctness&quot; of a language choice is more than about the language itself. In most situations, it is better to choose a language that scores 9&#x2F;10 on how well it fits the problem domain than one that scores 10&#x2F;10, if the 9&#x2F;10 language will let you solve the problems faster (pre-existing solutions), with less frustration (good docs) and zero need to reinvent the wheel (good libraries). This is especially true if the 9&#x2F;10 language will also allow you to recruit more easily due to its popularity.')
