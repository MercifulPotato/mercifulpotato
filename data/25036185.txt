I feel like the only way to ethically tax people would be have a process to enable taxpayers opt-out of funding with their tax dollars government programs they have a strong moral or personal disagreement with. For example, I would be too happy to fund schools, poverty relief efforts and infrastructure but it sickens me to think that money is being taken from my paycheck to fund pointless wars, genocidal racist thugs and immigration policy that is both racist and destructive to our economy. If financial contributions are a form of free speech, is not the forced usage of my tax dollars for these morally abhorrent equivalent to a law requiring me to purchase display an I &lt;3 ICE bumper sticker on my car?')
