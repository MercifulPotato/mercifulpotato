Like plutonium. And there are substances, where a lifetime of heavy consumption increases your risk by just a measurable amount, like red meat. And then there is stuff that is known to cause cancer in mice, if you inject enough mice with multiples of their own bodyweight so they only just don&#x27;t explode and maybe one of your 10k mice will test positive for a cancer marker.<p>Reporting should find a way to distinguish those properly and understandably, for experts as well as laymen.')
