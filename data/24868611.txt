Looking fwd to playing w this one for the 1st time tonight! :)<p>I remember that film; Glen Hansard&#x27;s absurdly beat-up guitar (with effectively a second, larger soundhole) even featured in Fretboard Journal. &quot;Falling Slowly&quot; is the song that got all the attention (which IMHO it deserved; gorgeous song and harmonies) but I&#x27;ll go dig up &quot;Gold&quot; and give it a listen...  thanks again! :)')
