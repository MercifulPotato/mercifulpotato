Item(by='arijun', descendants=None, kids=[25820752, 25820859, 25820750], score=None, time=1610969715, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25819871, text='Cool!<p>Because I was curious: Rocket Lab&#x27;s Electron is about $27k&#x2F;kg payload, while Virgin&#x27;s Launcher One is &quot;less than&quot; $40k&#x2F;kg to the same orbit. So more, but not crazy if you need some of the benefits Virgin gives, like a slightly bigger payload maximum (300 vs 225kg) or ability to launch from the US (or possibly the UK soon?)<p>Still, I wonder if there&#x27;s enough business at that size to support a more expensive entrant.')
