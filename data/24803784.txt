Hearing is about sound volumes that occur between two limits: The threshold of sensitivity (above which you discern that the sound exists), and the threshold of pain (above which the sound is painful). Between those limits lies hearing.<p>In age-related &quot;hearing loss,&quot; the threshold of sensitivity rises while the threshold of pain stays the same or even decreases slightly. So the <i>range</i> of volumes you can comfortably discern becomes narrower. This explains why simply increasing the volume often does more harm than good. What&#x27;s really needed to treat hearing loss is frequency-specific volume compression.')
