The author says he&#x27;s in erlang (which, btw, is not pure functional).  And then goes on to describe a system which sounds like an object oriented system.  But a game programmer would probably actually implement it not as object per se, but maybe backed by an entity component system.  But it seems like BEAM languages would be actually quite good at expressing entity systems, which, correct me if I&#x27;m wrong, are similar to say checking out and manipulating data in a database.')
