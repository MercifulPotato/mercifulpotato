Today, there are more than 50 million people in the United States who go hungry every day and experience the stress and uncertainty of food insecurity. As unemployment continues to rise in the face of the Covid-19 global pandemic, the mission of Hunger Not Impossible becomes more critical every day.<p>We are a text messaging platform that connects people in need with fresh, nutritious to-go, pre-paid meals provided by nearby partner restaurants. Currently in phase 1 of the national rollout, launched in April of 2020, HNI is operational in 7 major U.S. cities (Los Angeles, Houston, Seattle, Oakland, Las Vegas, Boston, Dallas) and launching in new cities every quarter.  We believe that our approach to providing low income families with easy, stigma-free access to nutritious meals, while supporting local restaurants and the food industry, will drive beneficial health and socio-economic outcomes within our most vulnerable communities.<p>We&#x27;re an early staged startup, currently looking for a senior backend engineer (ideally with some production Rails experience) that is interested in building resilient, scalable systems for a startup with a huge social impact.<p>Tech Stack : Ruby on Rails, Postgres, AWS, K8s, SMS.<p>Job Description : <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.google.com&#x2F;document&#x2F;d&#x2F;e&#x2F;2PACX-1vRQ2kOvCiZ5wR59V45_IM80R0G6KJzCdyPx8Ky-Zl3Bi_XNBN2xI0Y7xnLBrV1KJuRAR2oIBBkxe6gz&#x2F;pub" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.google.com&#x2F;document&#x2F;d&#x2F;e&#x2F;2PACX-1vRQ2kOvCiZ5wR59V...</a><p>Contact : careers@gobento.com')
