One side requires rigid predictability to perform optimally and the other side flexibility and ambiguity. Where the line is drawn and expectations are set is a function of company culture, hence why bigger companies&#x2F;enterprises tend to come down heavy on requiring estimates.<p>(I don&#x27;t mean bean-counter pejoratively; the world needs order and predictability just as much as it needs creativity).')
