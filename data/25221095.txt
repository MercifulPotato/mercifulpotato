I&#x27;m trying this &quot;build in public&quot; thing which is more transparent than feels natural to most people.<p>Who knows where it&#x27;ll go, but I think it&#x27;s cool and useful to see people&#x27;s &quot;early work&quot;, not only a final polished result.<p>So, trying to contribute some of that stuff myself!<p>That said, I&#x27;m not sure where I wrote I want to reach 20K? I don&#x27;t foresee reaching that in terms of either revenue or subscribers in the near future.<p>Thanks for reading, even if you aren&#x27;t sure about it. Was there a part you think was redundant or it was just a bit long-winded?')
