Item(by='mbreese', descendants=None, kids=[25833871], score=None, time=1610933911, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25817228, text='<i>&gt; this is how the Apple Watch proximity unlock works, for example.</i><p>I wonder — do you know if the proximity unlock only detect the relative distance between the computer and AP and compare that to the distance between the watch and AP? Or is it between the watch and computer?<p>The former would make sense to me, because my proximity unlock doesn’t always work immediately and it would make sense if it was because my watch and computer were connected to two different APs in my house (because one of the other hasn’t switched to the closest AP yet).')
