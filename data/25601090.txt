It&#x27;s a great introduction to the various philosophies of mathematics: logicism, formalism, intuitionism, structuralism, basically all of the different sorts of philosophical positions prominent people have taken on the nature of mathematics, going back to Plato and Aristotle. It&#x27;s wonderfully approachable as well, I highly recommend it.')
