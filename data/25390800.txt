I think it&#x27;s unreasonable to frame it as &quot;well we can only address these issues in degrees, lest we make the other worse&quot; and not question the system that somehow frames disease prevention and feeding people as opposing goals.<p>It&#x27;s certainly possible to address this disease without such drastic impacts, but it relies on the population having an empathic mentality. Look at Japan, as an example[0]: Similar in terms of development, but with a much less invasive response they&#x27;ve only suffered around 2.3k deaths _total_, when the US is already seeing that number daily.<p>You are completely correct that &quot;a huge % of the population is not happy with the current actions and policy being performed,&quot; because we have examples of cultures that are weathering this storm FAR better than those of us in the USA are.... but I think attitudes like yours are contributing to our failure to deal with this pandemic well.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.economist.com&#x2F;asia&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;12&#x2F;the-japanese-authorities-understood-covid-19-better-than-most" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.economist.com&#x2F;asia&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;12&#x2F;the-japanese-autho...</a>')
