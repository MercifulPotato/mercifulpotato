Item(by='blackrock', descendants=None, kids=[25564437], score=None, time=1609196738, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25559929, text='On a side note, I’m starting to suspect that Bitcoin, and Satoshi Nakamoto, is an internal NSA job.<p>And Satoshi must be the alias name for some cryptography expert, or experts, inside the NSA itself.<p>Hah, and even if you rearrange the words, its acronym is NSA. Like, <i>N</i>akamoto <i>SA</i>toshi.<p>I just noticed that.<p>And maybe the architect behind it, used a Japanese origin name, to throw people off their trail. To pin it to some foreign country, instead of the United States government.<p>After all, who else can keep a big secret like this? And laugh all the way to the bank. While trolling the entire world, at the same time.<p>Some ideas:<p>1. The Satoshi Nakamoto guy on the message boards, wrote in perfect colloquial American English. Even his sense of humor was American. His grammar was perfect, and similar to a Millennial&#x2F;Gen-X aged American. Like, he grew up chatting on AIM and ICQ back in the 90s and 00s. And probably on BBS message boards back in the 80s and 90s.<p>2. Satoshi mined the originating Bitcoins, and they are incredibly valuable now, and worth around $8.8 billion dollars in mid 2020.  Who wouldn’t cash out on it, and realize all the gains, or even some of the gains? How about some super secret organization, that specializes in cryptography. And especially an organization that doesn’t immediately need the money.<p>3.  Bitcoin mining is consuming a ton of electricity. Increasing carbon pollution, and depleting natural resources. There is only one other country that is generating so much electricity, that a large percentage of it, goes straight into Bitcoin mining. You can guess for yourself which country this is.<p>I don’t think this was intentional, but maybe a side effect is that it will bankrupt other competitor countries that the USA does not like.<p>4. Maybe another strategic end goal is to trick others to put their money into Bitcoin, and wait until it becomes very very valuable. Like, 100 or 1000 or 1 million times more valuable than it is today, it’s a very long and patient wait, then the US Federal government will pass a law declaring the Bitcoins to be illegal tender. And will then pass another law to forcefully seize all private Bitcoin assets, like the way cops take candy from a baby, with their Civil Asset Forfeiture policy.<p>Who knows. All this is just fun conjecture. Maybe there really is a Satoshi Nakamoto out there. But, I’d probably believe Santa Claus is real, before I believe that cover story.')
