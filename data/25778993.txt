This means, we can easily drag application windows into it and discuss it across the network of Linux users. One common workspace for everyone.<p>Everyone gets their own cursor in the common workspace and can interact with it without any barriers, as if it were a workspace on their own machine, i.e. kind of what the Douglas Engelbart folks had at SRI.<p>I am pretty sure that some HN users here have some bright ideas that may help leap towards that vision.')
