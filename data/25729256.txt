Would you put an engineer in charge of a bank product? What about a medical service? It&#x27;s one thing to be consulted, it&#x27;s another thing to be the decision-maker.<p>I agree with the premise of the article that more engineers need to be in powerful positions, but some domains are just too complicated and require substantial domain knowledge to make &quot;product&quot; decisions. It&#x27;s the collaboration between product and engineering that&#x27;s important, not switching one for the other. The biggest problem I have with the article is that it presents the problem as too binary with only 2 possible outcomes - someone being in charge.<p>Tech companies put engineers in charge because the engineers are the domain experts, not because they figured out some secret sauce.')
