Lots of technical detail in a whitepaper, but ARM chose to let that stand alone, without the misleading PR of Intel or the vague imprecision of AMD.\nFor the array bounds attack, ARM is introducing a new instruction that provides a speculation barrier; similar to Intel&#x27;s serializing instructions, the new ARM instruction should be inserted between the test of array bounds and the array access itself.
