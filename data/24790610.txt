I&#x27;m the founder of HashiCorp.<p>Waypoint is our 2nd day HashiConf announcement and I&#x27;m excited to share and talk about it! Compared to Boundary, Waypoint is definitely weirder, it&#x27;s trying to do things differently. I&#x27;ll be around here to answer any questions.<p>I think the most common question will be what is this and why? I cover that in detail on the intro page here so I recommend checking that out: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.waypointproject.io&#x2F;docs&#x2F;intro" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.waypointproject.io&#x2F;docs&#x2F;intro</a><p>Here are some major things Waypoint is trying to do:<p>* Make it easier to just deploy. If you&#x27;re bringing a Ruby app to Kubernetes for example, Waypoint uses buildpacks and an opinionated approach to deploying that app for you to Kubernetes. You don&#x27;t need to write Dockerfiles or any YAML. You can `waypoint up` and go. If you have existing workflows already, you can use a plugin that just shells out to `kubectl`. The important thing here is you get a common workflow &quot;waypoint up&quot; and your future apps should be much easier to deploy.<p>* Provide common debugging tools for deployments. Waypoint gives you `waypoint exec`, `waypoint logs`, etc. and these work on any platform Waypoint supports. So while K8S for example may provide similar functionality, you can now get identical behavior across K8S and serverless, or your VMs, etc.<p>* Build a common workflow that we can plugin other tools around. This is similar to Terraform circa 2015. There wasn&#x27;t a consistent way then to think about &quot;infrastructure management&quot; outside of a single target platform&#x27;s tools. With Waypoint, we&#x27;re trying to do something similar but for the application deployment lifecycle.<p>As always, a disclaimer that Waypoint is a 0.1 and there is a lot we want to do! We have an exciting roadmap[1] that includes promotion, config syncing with KV stores, Vault and others, service brokering for databases, etc.<p>And also, lots of jokes about Otto in the comments here. :) I think Waypoint and Otto similarities end at &quot;they both deploy&quot; (and Otto with HEAVY quotes around &quot;deploy&quot;). They&#x27;re totally different tools, one didn&#x27;t inspire the other, though we did make some major changes to avoid Waypoint hitting the same pitfalls as Otto.<p>Super excited to share Waypoint today!<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.waypointproject.io&#x2F;docs&#x2F;roadmap" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.waypointproject.io&#x2F;docs&#x2F;roadmap</a>')
