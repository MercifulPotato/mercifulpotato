Everything just works. Had a  sager and a System76 that worked without issues, too.<p>Sometimes,  it&#x27;s the hardware that&#x27;s the problem. Had a Dell and an HP for work that were so bad with Ubuntu that I had to give them up entirely for Linux machines.<p>Honestly, my next laptop is going to be a System76, top of the line model. If it can last as long as my Lenovo (2010, I think), it will be money well spent.')
