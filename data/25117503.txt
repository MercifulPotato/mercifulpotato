Laypeople are not even aware of the possibility of spoofing the sender field in emails. Technical people can check the &quot;explicit claims&quot; of a protocol like e-mail, SPF, DKIM, etc. to understand what it claims to do. In other words, email makes both implicit claims, and explicit claims about the verifiability of the sender field.')
