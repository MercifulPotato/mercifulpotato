Parts of the interior are still inaccessible for safety reasons due to the structural damage sustained. Structural and electrical engineers are en route. There is standing water in the basement and on every floor. The fire department will assist with pumping water out of basement.<p>There is no commercial power connectivity to the equipment due to breaker and switch equipment damage. Teams are currently working to de-energize all systems.<p>Two 850W generators are en route with an ETA of 21:00 CT. A chiller is also en route with no ETA available at this time. The parking lot adjacent to the building (opposite the damaged side) has been secured to stage the generators. Once the generators arrive, teams will determine if it is safe to wire the generators tonight due to the sustained building damage and water in the building.<p>In addition, TEMA (Tennessee Emergency Management Agency) is volunteering two 1 megawatt generators to support recovery.<p>A SATCOLT has been positioned approximately a block and a half from the NSVLTNMT building and is up and taking traffic to aid in communication with those performing restoration. The next update will be issued at approximately 20:00 CT, unless there is a significant change in status.&quot;</i>')
