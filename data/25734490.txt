[1]<p>At this point its not even a question of whether we will see Jack Ma in public again. Overnight he went from billionaire to peasantry. We&#x27;ve seen dozen cases like this:<p>1) Billionaire disappears or is &quot;killed&quot;<p>2) Billionaire&#x27;s company becomes nationalized<p>3) Rinse &amp; Repeat<p>Everybody who isn&#x27;t familiar with the inner workings of the CCP thinks that Jack Ma openly challenged the CCP. That simply isn&#x27;t the case. They are using as an excuse to take over the company because they <i>can</i>.<p>As much as people in the West praise CCP&#x27;s economic rise, and some even point to its authoritarian system as superior to our democracy, but little do they know the very laws that protect them isn&#x27;t an option in China.<p>Imagine spending most of your life building a massive business and then one day it is taken from you by force by an authoritarian ruler.<p>This is why anyone that has money send their kids abroad and move permanently to a Western country that their kids despise and criticize their host for calling out the CCP.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=YtJK_5qDraM" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=YtJK_5qDraM</a>')
