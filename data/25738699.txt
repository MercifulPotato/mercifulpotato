I would not have expected that in Denmark. LSN is awful.  You will be sharing source port depletion limitations with others in your network.  That also means you can&#x27;t host any servers unless you use port forwarding services or reverse vpns like hamachi.  It also means you are sharing a SNAT with others on your network which means that malicious traffic from others could be attributed to you.  Glad they are fixing it for you.  If they didn&#x27;t, then one would hope there were other ISP options.<p>Any ISP using LSN will have low NAT timeouts because it takes memory on their routers to track sessions and state.  I would be surprised if your ISP remove timeouts unless they are letting it fall back to FIFO pruning on your segment.  Did they tell you what they are changing?')
