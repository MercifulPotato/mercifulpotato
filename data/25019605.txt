Biden and Trump have 4 years difference in age. Where&#x27;s the representation for people significantly younger than post-retirement age? Even Bernie Sanders, a favourite, is hitting his latter years, and it seems the Democrat candidate is just chosen by the DNC rather than what their voter base would like.<p>So, it&#x27;s great news that Trump avoids a second term, but I don&#x27;t see a progression in the political system yet.')
