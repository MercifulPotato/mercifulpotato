We basically set every article as a draft, and because they can write in WYSIWIG writer now (no markdown) and the netlifycms admin dashboard allows them to see a fully-rendered preview that gets us 80% of the way.<p>At that point (once we&#x27;ve checked the links and typos, etc) we flip the draft boolean to false and check the article looks as expected on production.<p>Not perfect – we&#x27;d probably have a staging server if we were bigger – but we&#x27;re still small :)')
