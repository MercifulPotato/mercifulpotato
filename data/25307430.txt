Most of those support legalization as a specific goal, while others would support through their view of federalism.<p>A supermajority of US citizens support legalization at this point - only around 1&#x2F;3 poll as be opposed as of last year, and that number is consistently falling over time.<p>It&#x27;s honestly not a partisan issue at this point - it&#x27;s a &quot;politician&quot; issue.')
