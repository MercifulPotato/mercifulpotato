The Olson Database is the Right Thingâ„¢. Timezones are a weird human artefact, but ordinary humans have no idea what ZQMT or whatever actually &quot;is&quot; and will make loads of egregious mistakes if exposed to these zones directly even if your UX isn&#x27;t terrible (which it probably will be).<p>But humans do understand what a city is, and if they live in or near one they understand what the time is in that city, adjusting for any weird local political rules like &quot;Daylight saving&quot; because those rules affect their life.<p>It&#x27;s the right granularity practically too. Can politicians decide that Dublin and Belfast are in different timezones? Yeah, it&#x27;d be difficult but I think they could make that happen. How about Queens and Brooklyn? Ahahaha No. The residents will defy any pretence that clocks change between one city block and the next, it would never stick.')
