Item(by='api', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606139199, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25185517, text='&gt; Any individual would agree with you and herein lies the crux: who is &quot;we&quot;?<p>&quot;We&quot; is a complex system. It is nobody and everyone.<p>I really don&#x27;t think humans are actually intelligent. I think we are extremely <i>clever</i>, but a truly intelligent species would learn to countermand the emergent properties of the systems in which it embeds itself and take charge of its own history.<p>We are not intelligent enough to do that. Clever means we can understand one-cause-one-effect or few-causes-one-effect, and you can see that this is how all our engineered systems are built. They are very sophisticated versions of &quot;hit thing with rock.&quot; Our machines are full of single parts with single functions.<p>Living systems on the other hand are all-causes-cause-all-effects fully concurrent feedback loops. Every part has every function with varying weights, like the weights in a neural network. That&#x27;s totally beyond our intelligence to understand. We can barely do parallel programming with a few threads... this is like parallel programming where every instruction executes at once.<p>So far what look like attempts to control our destiny, like communism and fascism, are nothing but resentment driven tribal purges thinly veiled in complex language. They&#x27;ve done more harm than good. Right now just leaving things alone is possibly the best we can do.<p>BTW I think this is also why the promised dividends from sequencing the human genome and understanding genetics have not materialized. Genomes and the living phenotypes they help form are complex all-causes-all emergent systems much like our societies and economies. We are not cognitively capable of understanding them. Studying biology is like studying alien technology from a civilization a billion years beyond ours.')
