I use &quot;sorry&quot; as a casual non-apology sometimes when I don&#x27;t mean to trouble people for the same reasons as others up-thread.<p>It wasn&#x27;t until I met my exgf when I realized that some people are perplexed by that. I said it in the context of &quot;hope I&#x27;m not troubling you,&quot; and her immediate response was &quot;why are you apologizing?&quot;<p>Didn&#x27;t help that I came back with &quot;...I&#x27;m not?&quot; because she insisted I was.<p>That said, my mother is Australian, so at least half of my upbringing is non-American, and I often don&#x27;t give much thought to certain cultural discrepancies (even though I was born and raised in the US) because I have a hard enough time keeping my own straight. lol')
