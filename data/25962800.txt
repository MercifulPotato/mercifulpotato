They&#x27;re already selling as many as they can at the current price -- there&#x27;s no shortage of Coke out there. They might lower the price and thereby sell more (though they&#x27;re unlikely to sell twice as much without more than halving the price), but that&#x27;s not necessarily a bad thing; it means people are having to do less to get the same amount of Coke.')
