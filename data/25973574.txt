If you dislike muddy waters, I would recommend staying out of Indian politics. It is a clusterfuck.<p>To add to your top comment, these events - protestors attacking police personnel and protestors raiding Red Fort and raising their own flags - happened on <i>republic day</i>, which is like a mini 4th of July for India (we have two: 15th August, which is when India became independent and 26th January, which is when India adopted its constitution). On Republic Day, India observes the president furl India&#x27;s national flag from the Red Fort, so seeing these events unfold, especially seeing a flag other than the Indian flag at Red Fort on Republic Day, were of very big symbolic value.')
