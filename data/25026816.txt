These devices emit some very low level of 125MHz energy during normal operation. This software is simply turning that on and off, but not doing anything to increase the amount of emissions.<p>Presumably the 125MHz emissions are within the FCC allowed envelope anyway, so this isn’t doing anything to exceed normal emissions limits. This only works in a quiet RF environment, as noted in the README.<p>There is no need to be concerned about this signal reaching aircraft or otherwise interfering with normal transmissions.')
