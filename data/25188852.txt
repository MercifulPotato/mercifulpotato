During the industrial revolution there were big advances in metal tools. Maudslay&#x27;s development of a metal lathe that could be used to make metal tools was a huge step forward. I think if you can reach this point of development you should be able to make continued progress using non-fossil fuel power sources.<p>Are there other natural materials that could be used instead of metal to achieve this level of precision? I&#x27;m pretty skeptical on this.<p>Are there energy sources, other than coal, that could be used to develop early metallurgy to the point where someone could re-invent Maudslay&#x27;s lathe? I suspect that there are and given enough time someone would find one. It might take longer to reach this point but I believe we could get there.')
