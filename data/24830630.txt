So I looked at your HN profile. In fact, looking at your comment from 6 days ago[1]:<p>&gt; [James Watson] [b]lasphemed against contemporary morality by taking the &quot;wrong&quot; side in the nature-vs-nurture debate. See his Wikipedia page for details.<p>That is not why James Watson got in trouble. James Watson got in trouble because he said directly that black people were dumber than white people, and that this is due to genetic differences. He has only flawed circumstantial evidence for the former, and absolutely zero for the latter. His claim is strongly disputed by anthropologists and sociologists, who have considerable evidence that African art, technology, and society is just as sophisticated as the European variety. His claim is also disputed by human geneticists - again due to a total lack of evidence.<p>The fact that you<p>a) dishonestly sanitized his actual views with a cowardly euphemism, and<p>b) apparently agree with him that Africans are dumber than Europeans<p>makes me suspect you aren&#x27;t &quot;objectively&quot; concerned about the media reporting on increasing white nationalism.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24762396" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24762396</a>')
