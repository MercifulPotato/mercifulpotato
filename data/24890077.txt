I like big, big monitors.<p>2. I prefer a full size keyboard.<p>3. I prefer a separate mouse.<p>4. I prefer big freaking disk drives installed.<p>5. I put the desktop under my desk, and with a wireless keyboard and wireless mouse, there is much less of a snarl on my desk.<p>6. The desktop has an optical drive I still use.<p>7. The desktop has lots of USB ports and they&#x27;re all in use.<p>8. I can replace&#x2F;alter parts of the machine without buying a new one.<p>9. Desktops are cheap.<p>10. I can build what I want with parts from newegg. Premade powerful computers are always &quot;gaming machines&quot; and I don&#x27;t want a gaming machine that comes with a graphics adapter that sounds like a 747 taking off.<p>11. I want an all-metal case because a machine caught fire once.<p>Edit: 12. My desktop doesn&#x27;t have a microphone or camera, so they cannot be surreptitiously turned on remotely.')
