Perhaps you or other readers may have the answers:<p>- How is collection of the product verified. In other words, a customer can say they went to the drop location and nothing was there. The seller has no way of knowing if the customer was lying or if the product was &quot;intercepted&quot; by chance or federal officials<p>- How can people making the drop be confident that authorities making controlled buys won&#x27;t be able to trace them via CCTV (if there is a camera recording in that area, their identity can be determined) I suspect the normalization of face masks has helped make this somewhat easier to evade, but in normal times, the government could go to 100 drop zones used by the same seller, compile a list of all the people who have been seen near those zones in the last 6 months with facial recognition, then dig into people who have been seen in more than one of those zones. I assume these are obscure enough locations that random people won&#x27;t find the drops, so a person appearing in more than one is enough to flag them as likely to be involved. But in the event these are just <i>really</i> good hiding places in more public locations, someone being <i>near</i> 3 or more of these locations is still enough to suggest involvement.<p>- Most of the risk still seems to be the buyer&#x27;s burden; if a government official impersonates the seller, they can just wait for the person to show up to collect their package, and they&#x27;d be caught &quot;red-handed&quot; so to speak. I suppose the person can claim ignorance, but I don&#x27;t know how good of a defense this would be.<p>- Sellers would be taking massive risks with bulk orders being found by the wrong party (I assume bulk orders are most of their profits). Additionally, they wouldn&#x27;t really have the ability to tailor the amount to the customer for complicated orders')
