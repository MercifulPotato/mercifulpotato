Item(by='curryst', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607019243, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25285265, text='&gt; Of course Amazon isn&#x27;t likely to ever do such a thing, because god forbid we don&#x27;t have the ability to suddenly order something from Amazon on every device at all times.<p>Comically, that&#x27;s actually one of the things its the worst at.  I tried to do it exactly once and swore I would never do it again.  In the time it takes to read the first search result, I could have found and ordered what I want from my phone.  If that&#x27;s what they were going for, I can&#x27;t believe they didn&#x27;t scrap the project.<p>Supposedly they&#x27;re fairly good at re-ordering, but given how often Alexa mis-hears me, I&#x27;m not a fan of doing anything involving money on it.')
