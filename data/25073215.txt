Item(by='dragonwriter', descendants=None, kids=[25073316], score=None, time=1605206642, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25073055, text='&gt; Are you seriously claiming Guido van Rossum was hired for software development&#x2F;engineering..?<p>No, nor do I think he was he hired for the other thing I discussed, academic computer science. The post I was responding to made a general comment about &quot;CS graduates&quot; and &quot;our profession&quot;; I was responding to that. Whether that post itself was material to, or merely tangential to, the discussion of GvR&#x27;s hiring at Microsoft is an argument that, while perhaps interesting to some, was not the focus or concern of my response.')
