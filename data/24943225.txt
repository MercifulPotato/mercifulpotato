I played a bunch of neopets as a kid and had no idea until a few years ago how involved scientology was with the site. I bought a car from a scientologist recently and was blown away by the house they shared with their fellow practitioners. Walls of plastic wrapped Hubbard books, several family units (kids included) living together, dvd strategically left in car for us to watch. My fiance studies religions (she&#x27;s a mental health worker and doesn&#x27;t want to be ignorant to other&#x27;s spirituality) so it was a fun watch and experience for us.')
