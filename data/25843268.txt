The collective society <i>tends to</i> benefit with using our Republic government as an instrument of recourse&#x2F;change.<p>Using a small microcosm to judge any movement is a psyop by someone trying to reduce your critical thinking skills. Please figure out how to understand the grievances of &#x27;the other side&#x27; because it&#x27;s blinding you to a destructive discourse environment. Dare I say 80% of Americans would actually enjoy many &#x27;other&#x27; people, if they were open and less hostile that mutes any chance to fixing mutually agreed upon problems.<p>[1] - I understand I&#x27;m opening myself to many historical counter arguments. But please understand that today isn&#x27;t the 1850s. Nor the 1960s...etc.')
