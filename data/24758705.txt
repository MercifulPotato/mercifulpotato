But there&#x27;s plenty of other reasons that people work on side projects besides just career advancement. &quot;Just for fun&quot; might be the most famous reason, that is I believe how the Linux kernel started.<p>While maybe big companies won&#x27;t value side projects directly too heavily, there&#x27;s still a good chance that if you learn new things and try to build interesting stuff, that it might open new doors in all sorts of unexpected ways. But there&#x27;s no guarantee.<p>I also think that full time coding jobs can be a lot of work, and people shouldn&#x27;t feel too pressured if they don&#x27;t want to have side projects, because they have other things like a busy family life or non-technical hobbies.  But for many people, programming can still be fun and interesting, especially outside of the usual corporate routine, and that&#x27;s all the motivation they need to pick up a side project. That to me is really what a &quot;hacker&quot; is, not a leetcode grinder climbing the ranks at FAANG.')
