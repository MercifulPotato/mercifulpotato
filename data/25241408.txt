You should be able to run `powermetrics` on an interval while running a high-intensity task to confirm; the performance cores pin first when on mains, then ramp up the efficiency cores, and the opposite happens on battery.<p>It&#x27;s a big difference because the efficiency cores max out at about 2W draw, and the performance cores max out at around 18W. There&#x27;s a big incentive in battery life to rely on that behavior.<p>I&#x27;m not sure yet if it&#x27;s tunable, macOS doesn&#x27;t make that a transparent behavior where you can just tweak it at will.<p>The Air will throttle if under full load long enough, but it&#x27;s still mostly just ramping down the performance cores to stay cool.')
