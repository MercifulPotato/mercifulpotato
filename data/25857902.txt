Here is what gave me hope every time: If it can wait, it can’t be that bad.<p>There are a number of injuries for which treatment has severely changed during my short lifetime. A torn ligament used to be operated on in the past but now you are often told to wear a cast for some weeks, take painkillers only when necessary to sleep so you avoid movements detrimental to healing during the day (it’s painful) and to just wait it out. Not X-ray, no surgery, just time to heal.<p>E: added an all important if to the third sentence.')
