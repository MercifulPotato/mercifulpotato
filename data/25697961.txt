They both went to the same university. They both got the same degrees. Both PhDs. They both practice psychology in the same major metro. They both married men with the same _ultra specific_ backgrounds. That&#x27;s where my knowledge of them ends, I haven&#x27;t spoken to either of them in a few years -- I should reach out.<p>I have fraternal twins. They are not at all that similar! Not in looks, or size, or hair color, or personality. They&#x27;re only ~2 years old and the differences between them, both physically and mentally, is so staggering, already.<p>Life is so fascinating!')
