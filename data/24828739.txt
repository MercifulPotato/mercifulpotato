Quick, what are the functions that you can call on it ? Assuming it&#x27;s a collection, what kind ? What are the elements made of ? Is it heterogenous ? Is the field &quot;name&quot; specified for each of them ? Is it always there ? Are there cases where it&#x27;s a string and others where it&#x27;s a tuple ? Does it depends on user input ? Has it been sanitized ? Has it been produced by code you have not written ? Or by code you wrote a year ago ?<p>What do you mean, &quot;you don&#x27;t know ?&quot; Oh, you must be one of those &quot;weak minds&quot; MIT guys  like to make fun, of. Welcome to the club ! No big deal, we&#x27;re still nice. We sometimes get things done, and we get to repeat the same weak&#x2F;strong arguments every so often whitout anyone ever saying anything that might change each other minds. Kinda like social science and militant politics, but with waaaaay higher pay.<p>Cheers !')
