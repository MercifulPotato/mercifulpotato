At least that’s the version that’s publicly available.<p>If Firefox had used something other than firefox.com the brand trust could be decoupled from the service but by offering it for free they received PR. Catch 22 I think.<p>The nature of Mozilla not having access to the files eliminated any sort of scanning&#x2F;vetting and malicious actors quickly exploited it.<p>If Firefox had decided to charge for send I’m sure fraudulent payments would have been used to procure accounts intended for malware. That could have helped expire out malicious links before unsuspecting users clicked them\nbut it wouldn’t have completely addressed the issue.')
