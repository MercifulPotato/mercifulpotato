Your fucking football team is named for this very idea.[0][1]<p>Now, that&#x27;s not to say I&#x27;m not sympathetic. Even in the less-expensive Seattle area I wonder where my hair dresser is supposed to live (I know where she lives: nowhere near Redmond). I&#x27;m trying to think of anyone I know that lives within the boundaries of &quot;Eastside&quot; (...of Seattle) that doesn&#x27;t work in software and isn&#x27;t married to same. I came up with one person: a psychologist. IOW, I have drifted from my modest roots and now only know high-income people. That&#x27;s fine, I guess, but boy howdy, I&#x27;ll bet I&#x27;ve grown far more out-of-touch and more bubbled than I&#x27;d like to think.<p>But I see a lot of what I perceive to be jealousy amongst the noble concern for those less well off. Are you blocking those &quot;new, expensive condos&quot; because of concern for the poor or because you don&#x27;t think wealthy people should have a place to live in SF? (Okay, fine, they can consume all of the cheap housing, and...oh, this has been rehashed ad nauseam.) I don&#x27;t even have a snappy question for those that block corporate busses, y&#x27;all are just &quot;doing something&quot; for the sake of doing so (and the &#x27;gram points, I imagine). But mostly I see a lot of &quot;I was here first&quot; attitude, like that counts for something. As if one gets to define &quot;what our city is about&quot;, even if one gets it horribly wrong from the start.<p>[0]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;San_Francisco_49ers" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;San_Francisco_49ers</a><p>[1]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;California_Gold_Rush#Forty-niners" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;California_Gold_Rush#Forty-nin...</a>')
