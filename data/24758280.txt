That&#x27;s really not too big a sacrifice to ask to kill an epidemic.<p>It&#x27;s also clearly direly needed practice for the next, worst epidemic.  We got lucky with COVID-19, it&#x27;s on the mild side of the scale.<p>In a worse case scenario, say Ebola mutates to an airborne strain, the countries and cities that essentially used COVID-19 as a practice run to develop the procedures and social knowledge to quickly shut down an epidemic, will be looking smart.<p>We&#x27;ve known for decades that pandemics are coming, as the world becomes more physically connected.  We&#x27;ve written tons of books and made tons of movies about it.  Every zombie movie of the past 20yrs is about a viral outbreak.<p>So it&#x27;s insane that so many Western countries are behaving like idiot children in the face of this entirely predictable and predicted problem.')
