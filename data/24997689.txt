On one hand I also used vanilla Python instead of something easier to use like Django but the amount of preventable run-time errors and the lack of IDE autocomplete support at various points was kind of off-putting after coming back from very strictly typed languages like Swift, Kotlin or F#.<p>It also didn&#x27;t have the simplicity that Phoenix &#x2F; Elixir still has, for example when you Google how to solve problems you have Python 2 versus 3, the old way to handle requests which is limited and the new way to handle requests which isn&#x27;t as documented, yes you have type hints and named arguments but they&#x27;re not everywhere yet and so on.<p>So I don&#x27;t think I will circle back to use Python again unless there&#x27;s some kind of reason I can&#x27;t easily go around it. There are still some very good ideas in there (I like the braceless approach to code hierarchy and a standard on code formatting in general) and it&#x27;s definitely not as dumb as JavaScript but it has accumulated too much cruft.')
