Item(by='quadrifoliate', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607739121, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25394473, text='&gt; Who are these people who feel a need to participate in a community based on their text editor?<p>Eh, guilty as charged. Why do people participate in a community based on anything? Because they are passionate about it.<p>There are detailed communities for every single thing you can think of. People collect matchboxes. There are people who make detailed paintings using Microsoft Excel. Why should Emacs be an exception?<p>And if a survey takes into account people who are passionate about their editor, that&#x27;s <i>good</i>. Who should it take into account, the people who aren&#x27;t? That&#x27;s how you get operating systems that spy upon you all the time and optimize for some silly metric.<p>&gt; That religion stuff was normally meant as a joke.<p>Just because someone makes a joke about it does not mean there cannot be an actual community of grown-ups who treat each other with respect around it. And the Emacs community I have seen so far is <i>very</i> respectful and welcoming, even for things like evil-mode that unify emacs and vi editing paradigms.<p>I encourage everyone who uses emacs or is interested in it to check out r&#x2F;emacs and associated communities.')
