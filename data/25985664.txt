Given the decentralized nature of BLM (dozens if not more local and regional groups), I don&#x27;t think anyone can <i>reasonably</i> say that any one person or group speaks for the BLM movement as a whole.<p>As such, making the assumption that a few loud voices are representative of millions of people seems inaccurate at best, and an effort to discredit millions of people who desire positive change in the methods, focus and biases of US law enforcement, based on the violence and hyperbole of a tiny minority at worst.<p>And the same can be said of the vast majority of those who, however misguided, protested in support of the specious claims of a &quot;stolen&quot; election.<p>A vanishingly small minority of <i>those</i> people committed acts of violence and destruction too. And the millions who supported that point of view shouldn&#x27;t be tarred with the same, broad brush as those who committed acts of violence and insurrection.<p>Both of those tiny groups should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.<p>The difference between those two groups is that the public&#x2F;elected officials who supported the BLM protestors right to exercise their First Amendment rights  overwhelmingly condemned and decried the violence committed alongside those legal, lawful protests.<p>While many public&#x2F;elected officials decried and condemned the violence and insurrection at the Capitol, a non-trivial number of public&#x2F;elected officials who supported the Big Lie[0][1] of a rigged election encouraged violent action, and some may[2] have even knowingly conspired with violent factions to facilitate their insurrection.<p>That&#x27;s a big difference.  And we should acknowledge that.  Not because it&#x27;s a partisan thing, but because we&#x27;re supposed to be a nation of laws -- and when those who are elected&#x2F;appointed to make and enforce those laws actively work against our constitutional order, they must be dealt with directly and strongly -- or we risk the basis of our societal order.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Big_lie" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Big_lie</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;talkingpointsmemo.com&#x2F;feature&#x2F;the-capitol-mob-was-only-the-finale-of-trumps-conspiracy-to-overturn-the-election" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;talkingpointsmemo.com&#x2F;feature&#x2F;the-capitol-mob-was-on...</a><p>[2] It&#x27;s important to note that <i>no elected officials have been charged with aiding the insurrectionists</i>, there are indications that a few may have done so.  Investigations should continue and anyone who <i>provably</i> (and that&#x27;s a critical point) aided and assisted the violent scum who tried to subvert our constitutional government must be vigorously prosecuted -- but only if there is sufficient evidence.  We are, after all, a nation of laws.')
