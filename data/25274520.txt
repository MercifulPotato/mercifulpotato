The Airbnb hosts were always liable for paying all of their taxes, including whatever sales taxes they were liable for. This change means that Airbnb are now responsible for collecting that sales tax and paying it to the government on behalf of their hosts.<p>Whatever opinion you have about that, it doesn’t seem to be addressing any sort of loophole. It’s not a new tax, it’s just a new regulation for collecting it.')
