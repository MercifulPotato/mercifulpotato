Item(by='nkurz', descendants=None, kids=[24891481], score=None, time=1603668058, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24890803, text='&gt; Probably in this case it&#x27;s because metadrama threads like that are a dime-a-dozen and never lead anywhere new<p>I think that&#x27;s unlikely.  While it would be great to know why users flag the stories that they flag (feature request?) in this case I&#x27;d wager heavily that it was flagged by people who feel the underlying story is false and unworthy of public discussion, and not out of concern that the discussion would be boring.<p>Separately, I&#x27;ll note that this story was submitted  yesterday, quickly got to 38 votes and 7 comments, and then was flagged off as well: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24881000" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24881000</a>.   I vouched for it, which brought it back briefly, but then it was killed again.<p>Oddly, that version doesn&#x27;t appear when one clicks on &#x27;past&#x27;, or with search terms for &quot;taibbi&quot; or &quot;suppression&quot;.  Any idea why this might be?  Are flag killed stories always omitted from searches?<p>Edit:  This post discussing the flagging of this story is flagged as well:  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24889835" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24889835</a>.  Should it be?  It seems like it raises reasonable issues.   Vouching for it did nothing.')
