Genode&#x27;s a framework for creating operating systems. It&#x27;s not comparable.<p>What&#x27;s interesting imho is to compare seL4 with zircon. The former is a third generation microkernel. The latter is still a first generation microkernel or, according to google, not a microkernel at all.<p>It&#x27;s thus not very interesting from a computer science perspective. In practical terms, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll be better than Linux and IOS&#x2F;OSX, but that&#x27;s a very low bar to meet.')
