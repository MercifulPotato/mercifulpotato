It&#x27;s just a thought and not a very well researched one so I wouldn&#x27;t expect anyone to take it too seriously.<p>For Joe Simpson, or say Earnest Shackleton&#x27;s expedition to the Antarctic, these are stories where something went wrong and they were able to show heroic Endurance* just to survives.<p>In professional Cycling, it&#x27;s slightly different, temptation is a factor.<p>You can stop at any time and you&#x27;ll be picked up by the warm Broom Wagon or team cars that follows the race.<p>It would be so easy to give in to the devil on your shoulder offering you the easy way out...<p>Even giving in to that weakness is venerated by numerous photographs of weeping riders by the side of the road. Cycling fans seem to respond to a loser&#x27;s suffering, as we recognise shared weakness.<p>That story of temptation seems to chime with stories of martyrs and saints.<p>Who knows though, like I said it&#x27;s just a hypothesis.<p>* Sorry, terrible pun.')
