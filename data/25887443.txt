It complains about bad cables (not unique to USB-C), differences between USB 2 vs 3 (this is true for USB-A and Micro-USB as well, so again it&#x27;s not unique to USB-C), and then cryptically says &quot;Dongle Hell Is Real&quot; as the third problem with USB-C before talking up the merits of AmazonBasics in the section titled &quot;Your Best Bet is AmazonBasics Cables.&quot;<p>The second link complains about cable quality (solution: buy better cables), missing USB-IF logos (not a functional problem and can also be solved by buying better cables), USB-C adoption (like that&#x27;s some kind of product characteristic), inconsistent supported features (that&#x27;s true of any standardized connector used for several different applications), and non-compliant cables.<p>Of a total of eight complaints, four of them can be resolved by avoiding cheap-o cables, one of them is totally unrelated to the product&#x27;s technical characteristics, two of them are true of all USB standards. That only leaves &quot;Dongle Hell Is Real.&quot;')
