Quality of life, and also a living wage, comes from the establishment and endurance of human rights.  If government can violently crush dissent, there&#x27;s no room for workers&#x27; rights, there&#x27;s no incentive to give pay rises etc. and you get phenomena like this:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.com&#x2F;worklife&#x2F;article&#x2F;20201123-the-psychology-behind-revenge-bedtime-procrastination" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.com&#x2F;worklife&#x2F;article&#x2F;20201123-the-psychology...</a><p>But that&#x27;s just the start, and the situation with the Uyghurs is the tip of the iceberg, plenty of that is going on in sweatshops around the world.<p>Anyway, I won&#x27;t keep on repeating myself:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25405400" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25405400</a><p>&gt; 1 million is a small number.<p>What sort of monster are you?<p>And you can be sure that this problem is still happening across the broader population at the tail end.  Any talk of China lifting its citizens out of poverty has to be viewed sceptically, given their brazen lack of transparency.')
