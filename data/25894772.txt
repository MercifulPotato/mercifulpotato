I can&#x27;t hang a shingle as a vet on a whim. That&#x27;s a very clear filter. All the vetting of whether or not someone can perform the job is done before they even get to you.<p>However, anyone can call themselves a programmer and apply to programming jobs and there&#x27;s no way to tell if they&#x27;re capable or not until they&#x27;re at it.<p>And even previous job experience isn&#x27;t a strong signal of competence. I&#x27;ve inherited code bases from people who left for other programming jobs where the code they left behind was just a mess inside.')
