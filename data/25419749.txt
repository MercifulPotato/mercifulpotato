In fact, it gave the rights to online hosting of its entire back catalog of games to the amazing Aussie Scott Kevill, who runs GameRanger. You can play games as far back as Dungeon Keeper 2, or as recent as some of the new Battlefields on GameRanger, completely for free. It supports almost 1000 old PC games, and allows you to play online in games that only supported LAN play at launch.

There&#x27;s plenty to dislike about EA, but killing online servers is something they actually handle better than most other PC game companies: everything is on GameRanger.')
