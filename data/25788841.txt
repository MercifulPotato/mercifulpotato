I often think that disability is something imposed by the external world; it is society&#x27;s expectations of functionality that are encoded into how we&#x27;ve designed our infrastructure and lifestyles. Spoons are in such deficit, largely, because the world is often unadaptable to our capabilities. We change. It remains fixed, expecting that same amount of capability in order to participate. Participation in the world is optional, but to sit alone in spoon-deficit for life is so so awful a concept, especially because it doesn&#x27;t have to be that way if we only designed more parts of life to accommodate the entire spectrum of capabilities.')
