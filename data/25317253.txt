So you have to then adjust your monitor&#x27;s brightness up to compensate. The monitor&#x27;s brightness effectively sets the upper cap of the HDR brightness, so let&#x27;s say your brightness was set at 50% before, now you&#x27;ve got to fiddle with the monitor to boost the screen brightness to 100% to allow HDR to function, and to achieve your previous desktop white brightness (you&#x27;ll probably also have to adjust the software &quot;desktop white&quot;  point slider you mentioned, since MS has no clue what the correct monitor brightness and SDR pull down amount should be, so good luck matching your previous desktop colors and brightness). In my experience very few people successfully manage to setup their Windows HDR correctly, and even if you do there&#x27;s no way to &quot;seamlessly&quot; switch between the two modes (which you have to do since tons of stuff on Windows doesn&#x27;t work properly when HDR mode is enabled). I haven&#x27;t checked Surface or other MS hardware, perhaps they&#x27;re able to do something more clever there?<p>What Apple does, is that when your display brightness is 50% and you display HDR content, the HDR content will seamlessly appear at a brightness somewhere between 75% to 100% of the maximum screen brightness. That is a seamless HDR effect, giving you the whiter than white experience next to your other windows that just works.')
