Closest I got was retrospectively: in a small case study in my book Right to Left I looked back on a great experience using Sociocracy as a lens. The principles of circles, consent, double linking etc turn out to be way more interesting than the mechanics of meetings (except, ironically, it is a meeting design that keeps bringing me back to it). John Buck, co-author of We the People (make sure you get the 2nd edition) contributed my foreword so it all checks out :-)')
