They especially like the verbosity. I personally like features that make code smaller, concise and at the same time readable.  I&#x27;m referring to the syntactic-sugary things like the `for` comprehensions in Scala and `do` notation in Haskell which are pretty much built to do the same thing. Wish Go had a little more of those, it would have made things a little more exciting for me.')
