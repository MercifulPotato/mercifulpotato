That was paid for on the backs of the people.  Funny how short his memory is.<p>Elon is a talented man - I absolutely respect what he&#x27;s done.  However - let&#x27;s call this what it is - he doesn&#x27;t want to pay a large tax bill for the success that he has had (hence selling all property in CA).  I get it - it sucks and you can also be much more anti-union in Texas.<p>Too bad he had to go along with the narrative “I think we’ll see some reduction in the influence of Silicon Valley” -- feels like a slap in the face to the market that lifted Tesla off the ground.')
