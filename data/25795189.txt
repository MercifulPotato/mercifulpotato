I want to make sure I haven&#x27;t overlooked anything, so I&#x27;m keeping the subject purposefully broad.  Generally speaking, some of my questions are:<p>- What are the general laws that apply to <i>all</i> distributed computations?<p>- What are the major programming models for distributed computation?\n- What are the major distributed computing paradigms in the industry?<p>- What are the theoretical and practical limits of trustless computing?<p>- Other than &#x27;blockchain&#x27; (and related concepts), what are the most exciting developments in the field of distributed computing? (e.g. session types)<p>What are some of the must-read papers that would shed light onto these questions?<p>I think of &#x27;must-read&#x27; in terms of:<p>1.  Seminal&#x2F;foundational papers<p>2.  Papers that do a good job of reviewing the literature, and help get oneself oriented<p>3.  Papers that represent significant advancements on important problems in the field<p>Many thanks in advance!')
