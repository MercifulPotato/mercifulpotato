Sandy Bridge or thereabouts? Because for the past few years, PCs have basically been &quot;fast enough&quot; for most things, super-inefficient monstrosities like Electron excluded. In fact my &quot;daily driver&quot; is probably slower than this Chinese CPU.<p>Incidentally, there is an interesting and active market in Chinese motherboards with X79&#x2F;X99 chipsets, which are from that era, along with used Xeons and such.<p>Obviously those who place performance above all else will not be buying these.')
