In short, it&#x27;s taken me years to be able to do this. Last year we finally got our engineering organization to a point where I no longer have any direct reports. Instead, everyone rolls up to our VP of engineering. In most mid-sized startups (like ours), the VP of engineering is the person that manages most of the process and generally makes sure the trains run on time.<p>My view of the CTO role is that it&#x27;s focused on more long term efforts or the product generally (in more technical companies). So that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve been doing for much of this year. With the caveat that I&#x27;m also the founder and on the board so there is still about 10 hours a week of executive meetings&#x2F;management, reviewing of other people&#x27;s writing &amp; product efforts and working with our biggest customers and prospects.<p>All that being said, I&#x27;m not just working on this because it&#x27;s what I want to do and it&#x27;s what excites me (which it does). I also think it&#x27;s my highest point of leverage within the company. Very few people have the same view and in depth experience in this problem domain. Most of the people I know of that do are either founding and running competitive offerings or they&#x27;re working on similar projects at Google, AWS, or Azure and getting paid significantly more than we can afford to pay a single engineer.<p>I think this is one of our most important efforts right now and the best way I know to make it successful is to be working on it in depth. I&#x27;m not the best programmer on the team or the smartest, but I have some depth of experience that gives me a clear vision on what it should be able to do and what tradeoffs we should be making.<p>My role on this effort is basically as the product person and the tech lead. In this case the tech lead isn&#x27;t the manager of people on the team. We try to have a multiple paths for advancement in engineering and one of them tech focused individual contributor.<p>Of course, I view this project as necessary, but not sufficient for our overall success. That&#x27;s why most of our engineering team is working on our legacy products and the continued forward development of the overall platform.')
