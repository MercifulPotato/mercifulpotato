What if you explicitly want to know that the contents of the auth token aren&#x27;t modified? What if you want to work with a IdP that only provides JWTs to offer centralized authentication and user management?<p>&gt;  Cookie auth is much easier to implement without the need for a 3rd party library and is also more secure.<p>As long as you are in the browser, sure! In many cases you can use secure cookies and server side sessions and they work well. But as soon as you get into more distributed or larger systems, reaching out to multiple APIs, JWTs may make sense.')
