Cheap is important, but overall accessibility is what I&#x27;m getting at. That&#x27;s what I meant in my OP in my comments about people intimidated by the bare hardware of normal Pi. The normal Pi is cheaper. The form factor and convenience of the Pi 400 make it a more accessible platform, especially for an 8 year kid old with poor parents that aren&#x27;t very technical. This family doesn&#x27;t know to avoid Atom CPUs, they don&#x27;t know anything about installing RAM. They need something easy, off-the-shelf, and decently supported. And yes, also cheap. You&#x27;re saying it&#x27;s possible to do better than the Pi 400. I agree! I&#x27;m saying it&#x27;s not practical to try to scale your approach across thousands of families.')
