Maybe I am ignorant but Deno feels just like an opinionated node&#x2F;Typescript distribution with too little improvements but not like the successor we hoped for.<p>Besides, I wonder if the Deno team solved all the performance issues which popped up the last time I&#x27;ve read about Deno. There were some debates with the ws community but can&#x27;t remember details anymore.')
