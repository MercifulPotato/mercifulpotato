Even seasoned cigar smokers, if they slightly inhale into their lungs, go into a coughing fit from doing to when they screw up. While I never smoked chemical cocktail cigarettes, people don&#x27;t typically chain smoke cigars. Most people smoke one a day. However, that also depends, you have different lengths of cigar too. Some short, then you get the Churchill length (I&#x27;ll let you figure out why). Also diameter of the cigars are different. Oh how full bodied the cigar is (typically these are the stronger cigars, lots of caveats to this, there&#x27;s a cigar culture similar to wine culture, lots of nuance). The nicotine hit varies. Some smoke a few mellow cigars, which is like drinking Bud Lights, while for me, I like fuller bodied cigars. Half a full bodied can knock you like drinking 2 IPA beers. You can get tipsy from smoking a cigar.<p>Honestly, here&#x27;s a pretty good video to teach you why people like cigars: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=79GnBpNuVBo" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=79GnBpNuVBo</a><p>I watched it shortly after I got into cigar smoking and learned a lot from it.<p>I&#x27;ll also say this, I have severe doubt that nicotine itself is highly addictive. In the last 3 years, I have a few 3-5 month time spans of not smoking cigars. No reason either. Just, I didn&#x27;t feel like it. I&#x27;ve never had the feeling to, &quot;I have to smoke today&quot;. I only do so as a relaxing time on the weekend, some parties, and celebrations.')
