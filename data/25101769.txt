It seems like a pretty straightforward factual article. Are you trying to add context in a well-meaning attempt to short-circuit the potential for this article to give credence to anti-vaxxers? Or that the pro-vaccine perspectives tend to heavily imply (or explicitly state) vaccines are without risks and this is a bit of an embarrassment? To qualify that further: not arguing the efficacy of vaccines as all public health officials agree the risk-reward ratio tilts heavily towards vaccines and vaccine historical success is unprecedented ... just the arguments that are made in support of them by well-meaning &#x27;debunkers&#x27;, &#x27;skeptics&#x27; and &#x27;science-communicators&#x27;.<p>Is that really what news is supposed to be? A way to drive narratives (well-meaning that those narratives may be), lest the readers take the &#x27;wrong&#x27; idea if you just present the facts?<p>In other words, is this article supposed to:<p>1) Provide a factual account of events in Sudan around the Polio outbreak, OR<p>2) Further the goal of large-scale vaccination efforts in Sudan, Africa and the world.<p>#2 is certainly a worthy goal, but is that what the point of news is? Push worthy goals like #2, instead of doing #1?<p>&gt;<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;d41586-020-00812-z" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;d41586-020-00812-z</a><p>Not a huge fan of &quot;Argument by citing a random published study to supports my conclusion&quot; either. Typically in these cases, there are thousands of studies on the topic, some with very subtle conclusions - but specific studies are cherry-picked to support a pre-defined conclusions, which tends to say more about what the arguer believes versus what&#x27;s actually true.<p>Here&#x27;s my cynical conspiracy theory: This article would be flagged or banned on social media (Twitter&#x2F;YouTube&#x2F;Facebook) as misinformation, especially if shared by any non-mainstream outlet.')
