Anti-competitive statements can be binding, though, so it might be illegal for them to work at FB and Google, as their business might intersect. But it&#x27;s a different story than just right to hold two &quot;full-time&quot; jobs.<p>One possibility I might think of -- if an employee is really a high performer, but couldn&#x27;t negotiate compensation above &quot;market price&quot; for their level.')
