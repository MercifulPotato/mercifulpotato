It sounds like it&#x27;s mostly PCB soldering and assembly that are done in the US.<p>&quot;Fully made in the USA&quot; is an almost fractal claim that can&#x27;t be literally true  unless all raw materials were mined in the US, but even without demanding that level of depth I think calling this &quot;fully made&quot; in the US is a stretch.')
