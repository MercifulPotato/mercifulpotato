It seems like Facebook has many versions of code that get deployed in some places and not others, never attempting to reach an eventual convergence even for the same feature.<p>I have a few anecdotes where, as a Facebook group administrator of some large (tens of thousands of members) and small groups (few thousand members), there were so many bugs in moderating the group with an added mega bug where the “Report issue to Facebook” (or something to that effect) would also throw an error. Those bugs lasted years (going into the current year) before I gave up and quit Facebook.<p>Based on my experience over several years, I doubt there’s much rigor on many things. It may just be one of those marketing messages that have a little bit of truth and a lot of subterfuge.')
