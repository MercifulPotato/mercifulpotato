If hypothetically 100,000 people show up in NYC tomorrow there is some slack that might accommodate them.  But, how do you scale the transportation network to handle even just 1 million  extra people in NYC?  Now extend that to every other part of the country.<p>Sure that seems unlikely, but when millions of people are willing to become undocumented immigrants, itâ€™s likely a more open policy would see dramatically larger influxes.  Especially in response to local events like civil wars.   Really, just raising the caps by say 10% every year gets the same result without the chaos.')
