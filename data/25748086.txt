First, that breaks TOS. Second, given that AWS new provably knows about those, once someone acted on those threats, they could be liable.<p>Probably not because of “threats”, which are generally only unlawful if they are delivered to the person that would be threatened.<p>On the other hand, if the messages on the site constituted constituted conspiracy, that is more likely to be a liability risk for AWS once they knew of it.
