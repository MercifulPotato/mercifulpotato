It has an &quot;I built it, I can fix it&quot; vibe.  The result is it has been far more stable for me.  I&#x27;ve struggled in the past with Ubuntu releases.  I put them off, and then eventually I&#x27;m forced to update, and something somewhere breaks in a way I struggle to fix.  Fedora, and Open SUSE were slightly more stable, but eventually I ran into the same issue.<p>Not with Arch, though.  I have not run into a problem that I couldn&#x27;t easily fix.  I&#x27;ve been using it daily for a few years now, and I really love everything about it.')
