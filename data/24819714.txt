Item(by='tzs', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603043425, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24818767, text='Firefox can be kind of annoying to use on HN, at least if you post often.<p>I use Firefox for most of my personal browsing other than Fastmail&#x27;s webmail interface, and most of my general work browsing.<p>I use Chrome for a lot of testing and development at work and for dealing with PayPal. These things all get separate profiles, and Chrome handles multiple profiles better than Firefox. Yes, I know about Firefox containers, but I need separate bookmarks and history. Containers just deal with cookies and maybe cache.<p>I&#x27;ve been tempted to switch to Chrome for at least HN and Reddit because I tire of dealing with Firefox&#x27;s spell checking. It regularly tells me things are spelled wrong that are not (such as &quot;webmail&quot; in this comment). It&#x27;s not just that it is terrible that irks me--it is that it is <i>inexplicably</i> terrible.<p>What I mean by inexplicably terrible is that they are using Hunspell. That&#x27;s the same open source spelling engine that is used by Chrome, and LibreOffice, and MacOS. Those all have great spell checking. I thus infer that Firefox&#x27;s problem is not an engine problem. It&#x27;s a dictionary problem. So why don&#x27;t they they grab the ones LibreOffice uses?<p>Here are some words that came up in comments of mine either here or on Reddit that Firefox incorrectly told me were spelled wrong.
