Item(by='mrtksn', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605468810, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25103266, text='In Bulgaria, Gypsies are viewed as a huge problem and people are often openly racist against them, even on national TV. The stereotype is that the gypsies will steal whatever they can, trash and start fights and many other things. My grandma would hide her stuff if sees a gypsy, on the other hand there&#x27;s a subset that she would adore. The subset, according to her, are the &quot;tradesmen&quot; gypsies and she would often buy services from them and would trust them. Also, the gypsies are quite often the musicians at the Turkish minority weddings. Bulgarians would also often complain that gypsies are making Bulgarians look bad in the EU.<p>Just next to Bulgaria is Turkey and in this country the Gypsy image is drastically different.  In Turkey gypsies are musicians, dancers and overall free soul people. Much less negative connotations overall. The exception is &quot;Conolar&quot; or &quot;the Jonos&quot;, a clan in a major Turkish city.<p>If I lived only in Bulgaria I might as well be a racist but I have seen enough to believe that the Bulgarians need to look in the mirror if they are looking someone to blame about the situation with gypsies.  It doesn&#x27;t have to be the way it is in Bulgaria.')
