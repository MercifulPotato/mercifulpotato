IMO a real built-in appliance wouldn&#x27;t have feet on the bottom that it sits on, wouldn&#x27;t have finished sides and back, it would be purpose-built to only work within cabinetry designed for that purpose.<p>My ovens don&#x27;t work that way, as far as I know.  It requires a certain opening, but it isn&#x27;t designed to be free -standing so it couldn&#x27;t be set on the floor.  At least not safely.  It&#x27;s designed from the ground up to be inside a cabinet, there isn&#x27;t just a trim kit to fake it.<p>My dishwasher for sure isn&#x27;t designed to be free-standing.  It would tip over when you opened the door.  It does have feet, but it requires attachment to the counter.  And if you pull it out, you are looking directly at the tub, not finished sides.<p>Not sure about the fitted fridges.  Mine is not that fancy, so it&#x27;s designed to be standalone.  It sits inside  a cabinet that is designed to accommodate it, but not as a built-in.')
