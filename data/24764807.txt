Just because you don&#x27;t like people taking your code and bundling it into a proprietary product doesn&#x27;t mean you&#x27;re necessarily also okay with using the legal system to enforce that preference.<p>For example, I release my code into the public domain to the extent possible. But I am also very strongly opposed to plagiarism. Yet putting code into the public domain means people can legally plagiarize my work.')
