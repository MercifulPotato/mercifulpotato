It&#x27;s widely regarded as a one time thing that was agreed upon partly because the system (and testing tools) were so new at the time.<p>Bitcoin had a bug that was required an organized chain reorg back when it was early as well, but it&#x27;s not regarded as fatal to putting trust in the chain now (search for &quot;bitcoin value overflow bug&quot;, was kinda interesting)<p>More recently, Parity, one of the main developers of one the Ethereum clients, had <i>millions</i> locked up due to mistake in their smart contract code.
