But here&#x27;s what I found regarding the Falcon 9 [1][2] which puts it around 425 Metric Tons per flight. And for a fully loaded airliner there are CO2 emission numbers per seat which can put it up in the 500 Metric Ton range [3] for a long flight. Our numbers are not that far apart. 3 flights vs 1 flight is a rounding error in the scale of global CO2 emissions.<p>The Starship numbers are much harder to analyze though, it entirely depends on how you get the methane, because yes, it will put out a LOT more CO2 per flight. Methane can be collected from the production of coal&#x2F;natural gas&#x2F;oil where it is burned anyway, or as SpaceX has said they would like to do, from the Sabatier process which would actually be carbon neutral given that you can produce Methane by extracting CO2 from the atmosphere.<p>I can&#x27;t deny that it will spread the CO2 further through the atmosphere even if it is carbon neutral, but when it comes down to it, rocket launches are now and for the foreseeable future a minuscule portion of CO2 output and airplanes, cars, and industry are all orders of magnitude greater emitters.<p>And then when it comes to Musk, it just seems weird to say he isn&#x27;t doing enough to combat CO2 on a post about him donating $100M to help improve CO2 removal and also ignore what electrification of cars can and already has done for CO2 emission reduction.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;space.stackexchange.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;13082&#x2F;calculate-falcon-9-co2-emissions" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;space.stackexchange.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;13082&#x2F;calculate-fa...</a>\n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;everydayastronaut.com&#x2F;rocket-pollution&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;everydayastronaut.com&#x2F;rocket-pollution&#x2F;</a>\n[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eci.ox.ac.uk&#x2F;research&#x2F;energy&#x2F;downloads&#x2F;jardine09-carboninflights.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eci.ox.ac.uk&#x2F;research&#x2F;energy&#x2F;downloads&#x2F;jardine09...</a>')
