Last Resort Font is intended to provide descriptive glyphs for all codepoints, even for those that are non-characters (which would presumably be out of scope for unifont), and to distinguish between private-use and unassigned codepoints, which would all simply be missing glyphs in something like unifont.<p>The idea is that if you are working on some software that produces or works with Unicode, you can see at a glance what type of character you have (if no other font provided a glyph), or if the codepoint is private-use, non-character, or not assigned yet.')
