It was just an explanation about the DMCA as if we didn&#x27;t already know. What a joke.<p>Technology was supposed to enable us to do more as human beings. It was supposed to empower us to do what we want. Instead we&#x27;re wasting it on these bullshit industries that honestly shouldn&#x27;t even exist anymore. It&#x27;s become just yet another form of control meant depower instead of empower. The computer is limitless, they purposefully restrict it just to force people to pay money in order to use it.<p>They&#x27;re not the true threats, though. The big picutre is government control of computers. Governments simply cannot handle the notion that people are not under their control. Technology like encryption and anonymization are inherently subversive to <i>any</i> government. They will seek to regulate it, just like they&#x27;re imposing laws all over the internet today.')
