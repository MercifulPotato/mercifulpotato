For music production things are different in Windows. Due to latency, studio-level hardware vendors completely skip Microsoft&#x27;s audio stack and use something that talks directly to the card called ASIO. So, you kinda need external audio hardware even if you&#x27;re on-the go and wants to do some low-latency audio. Or you use hacks like Asio4all to achieve low latency. In macOS CoreAudio has low latency even if you use the built-in 3.5mm audio jack.')
