These alternatives seem destined to encroach on the Sonos turf come hell or high water.<p>I will say that for their intended purpose--streaming music to a network connected speaker, Sonos speakers just work great! Their app interface, while not a great experience, functions. When I click &quot;Play,&quot; stuff immediately comes out of my speakers. NOW. There is never a delay, never a spinning pizza, never, never NEVER! (anecdata, of course)<p>So I (me, not you) can&#x27;t blame them for wildly thrashing a bit on the data collection side. I get it. They are terrified they are going to get squeezed eventually.<p>Do I wish they would reconsider advertising and related marketing shenanigans as business models? Yes, I do. For now they meet my needs and they just work. It&#x27;s a trade off I&#x27;m (me, not you) are willing to make for now.')
