The EDA vendors are huge employers of developers, and esp for backend tools you need not only to be able to deal with algo scalability issues (the datasets are enormous), but also understand more and more of the actual physics, electrical engineering aspects. Very interesting combination.<p>But also, most customers also develop their own tools, scripts, automation of toolchains etc. And the HW dev toolchains are much bigger than what you have in SW.<p>At the ASIC shop I used to work (with about 40 engineers) we had 3-4 people full time on tools, environment, methodology.')
