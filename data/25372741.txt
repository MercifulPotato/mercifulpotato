The costs would be absolutely fixed and known.<p>On a tight budget? You don&#x27;t even need to go as far as $1200, I see totally fine test&#x2F;development environment suitable, Dell 1U servers on eBay right now for under $500 with 128GB of RAM.<p>Or that would be better off purchasing a fixed-configuration virtual machine (typically running on xen or kvm underneath) that has a certain specific amount of CPU, RAM and storage resources allocated to it which cannot balloon. For a fixed bill per month like $65 or $85.<p>You want to deploy your weird app on some cloud platform? sure, go for it, once you&#x27;ve got the possible scaling-up cost issues and possible bugs worked out on your own platform.')
