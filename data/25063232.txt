Mostly because its face&#x2F;object&#x2F;place&#x2F;whatever recognition is the best of its kind.<p>Dropbox: they are ignoring the photos needs from users. They focus on &quot;enterprise cloud storage&quot; and &quot;workplace sharing&quot;.<p>Apple: I love the privacy features of Apple, but what I&#x27;ve come to realize is that, with a very big photo library, no iPhone or Macbook can analyze them all and share the results with all my devices. Only a server can analyze 10,000+ pictures, identify faces, organize by date. All in a slick and fast UI.<p>There&#x27;s definitely space for Google Photos competitors. Build a product that automatically triage photos, using and sometimes guessing the exif data. With face identification, location identification, automatically creating albums from photos batches (like if you take 40 photos in 2 days).<p>Managing our online pictures will be extremely important in the future (it is now), because we take more and more of them.')
