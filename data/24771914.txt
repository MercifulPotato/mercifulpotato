I don&#x27;t particularly stint in my usage; Google reports I use 34 gigs in my old G Suite Business account.<p>I will definitely pay more if I need to.<p>I have some level of personal storage backing it, along with paid backups, but I trust Google SRE to store my data long term far more than I do.
