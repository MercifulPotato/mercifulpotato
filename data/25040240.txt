This is happening across the sector. The success of contract cheating websites, and the inability of universities worldwide to deal with them, attest to that.<p>&gt; If cheating is rampant, either the culture is broken or you are selecting students wrong.<p>Sure. People are willing to risk jail to get their kids into top universities. A kid whose family  borrowed money to send them study in a Western institution might not see honor as their top priority. It is not a student selection problem: the culture is broken all the way down.<p>Lest I come across as pessimistic, I am not. Academics may not be able to fix the structural problems, but we have more control over our own little part of our world than in the private sector. I, for one, don&#x27;t rely on exams anymore for the time being and have not seen a GPA increase in my course. A honor-based exam system is not something I rely on, however.')
