I will never be free from degree of pain and suffering many people don&#x27;t understand.<p>I&#x27;m one of the people who don&#x27;t understand, but I think there is at least some distant theoretical possibility it will get better?<p>&gt; I try to make the best of it.<p>&quot;Sometimes we don&#x27;t get to choose the role we play, but we always get to choose how well we play the role.&quot;')
