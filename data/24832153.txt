Item(by='ryukafalz', descendants=None, kids=[24832292], score=None, time=1603149527, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24831725, text='&gt;Signal is OSS and you can start your own fork &amp; network if you want to.<p>Resources and network effects make this a much much less likely endeavor than in federated systems. I can reasonably (and do!) self-host Matrix and XMPP servers for myself and a few friends; I cannot reasonably host a Signal server for everyone I might want to possibly contact via Signal. (And that&#x27;s setting aside the effort involved in convincing everyone I might possibly want to contact to use <i>my</i> Signal server. It&#x27;s just not going to happen.)<p>EDIT: Oh, and I don&#x27;t think the VoIP side of the Signal server is FOSS? At least I believe that used to be the case.<p>&gt;App publishing platforms not having a good binary signature verification system is the orthogonal issue that you&#x27;re bringing up, that would in many ways apply to matrix for most users too. Most will never bother to sideload it.<p>If the main client developers are pressured to put a backdoor into their client, I would expect non-backdoored forks to rapidly pop up in the stores.<p>If the platform provider is also legally pressured to not allow any non-backdoored clients into the store... well, I hope that never happens, but if we get to that point I hope more people would bother to learn more and start sideloading things. Maybe wishful thinking on my part.')
