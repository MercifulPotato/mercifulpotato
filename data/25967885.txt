Item(by='mewse', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612002121, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25965192, text='&gt; you had one of the longest lockdowns in the world (110 days)<p>If you want to be precise, there was one lockdown in April-&gt;May, and then the major one in July-&gt;November that we’ve been talking about.  It was 112 days for that second lockdown, the severe one.  (note that the exact restrictions changed over that period, but 112 days was the period for which there were any restrictions around when you were allowed to leave your home)<p>&gt; spanning the fall, winter and spring<p>No, that would require around 270 days.  The 112-day lockdown included the second half of winter and most of spring, but didn’t include any of Fall (which is March-&gt;May here in Australia, and also we call it Autumn).<p>The first (much less severe) lockdown did take place in part of Fall, though.  But that wasn’t part of the 112 day period that you were talking about.<p>&gt; and then it came back in the summer, and you had to do it again<p>It was a small handful of cases in a corner of the state and we just backed up one step in the scheduled reduction of restrictions to make sure things didn’t get out of control;  it lasted about three weeks before the government was satisfied that it was contained and restrictions resumed easing.<p>It absolutely wasn’t a case of “do it all again”.<p>&gt; And you&#x27;re in an isolated island nation with almost no international travel.<p>Note that “almost no international travel” is because it was shut down by the government, to protect against the spread of Covid.  That’s another option that’s available to other countries.<p>It might also interest you to know that we’re holding the Australian Open here in about a week, with folks arriving from all over the world.  They’re apparently expecting to have 30,000 spectators attending per day, in person.<p>&gt; Your story does not encourage me about the feasibility of the strategy you advocate -- it underscores how tenuous the situation actually is.<p>Oh, it’s absolutely tenuous.  Absolutely.  Everyone has to be working together for it to effectively bring cases down to zero, as has happened here in Australia and in New Zealand.  One bad apple or one selfish person in the wrong place can undo the sacrifices of thousands of people who are doing the right thing.<p>But what’s the alternative?  Just stand around and watch the corpses pile up? (3500 covid deaths yesterday in the USA, for example)<p>I would take the lockdown over that, personally.  In fact, I did.  And today, after the lockdown has ended, I went to work in an office.  And I took public transport to get there.<p>0 locally acquired cases, for the 24th day in a row.')
