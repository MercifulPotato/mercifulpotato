I mean, if you&#x27;re in the business of getting an online business up and running, it seems to me that both do provide the infrastructure that allows you to achieve your goals.<p>Arguably, AWS and GCP have more data centers spread throughout the world, but beyond unicorn-scale companies you&#x27;d be hard pressed to find any business that does need that sort of infrastructure.  Yet, when you&#x27;re at that scale you&#x27;re far better off running your own infrastructure, both in terms of cost but also reliability.')
