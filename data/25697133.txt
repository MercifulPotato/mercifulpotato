This is certainly possible, but does having comically understaffed security when it was <i>extremely well known</i> that there was going to be a huge crowd serve Donald Trump, or someone else?  Like, when you turn on the news, or read forums, do you get a feeling that this is playing out in favour of Trump and his supporters?<p>I am going to be paying close attention to how this story is spun over the next few weeks, including the type of language they use, and we&#x27;ll see if an investigation that can be taken seriously is ever performed.  And going forward, how often this event is used as &quot;proof&quot; of how dangerous &quot;right wing extremists&quot; (or populists) are.')
