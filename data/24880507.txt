CPC has learned a lot from the fall of the Soviet Union and they will do anything in their power to prevent a similar outcome for China.<p>One of the lessons was that cultural differences between citizens can be a very effective tool to destabilize a country. So instead of promoting cultural autonomy as was done in USSR (sometimes to the detriment of Russians, e.g. see Lenin&#x27;s remarks about &quot;Great Russian Chauvinism&quot;), they aim to completely assimilate Uighurs and other ethnicities living inside Chinese borders. They feel that it can be an existential threat, so &quot;the end justifies the means&quot;. This is why such policy got significantly accelerated after clash with &quot;the West&quot; became inevitable.<p>If you want to change someone&#x27;s behavior, you have to understand it first.')
