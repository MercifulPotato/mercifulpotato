Item(by='ben7799', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601564516, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24650718, text='All I know is my 2018 15&quot; MBP is flaky as heck plugging in docks, monitors, keyboards, etc.. through the various USB-C dongles &amp; docks.  It almost never just plugs in and everything works.   Sometimes you have to plug&#x2F;unplug more than once, sometimes you have to wake&#x2F;sleep the laptop, sometimes the Mac kernel panics.<p>I have 2 docks at home and have gone through 2 at work that cost as much as $300-400 (OWC and similar) and it&#x27;s just flaky no matter what.<p>How do you blame the adapters, docks, whatever when some of them cost as much as a chromebook or a cheap windows laptop?  All these dongles and adapters used to not even be required, something&#x27;s really wrong when they cost as much as another machine and you still can&#x27;t get things working as well as they worked in the past. Realistically I had less trouble docking my Windows laptop in the late 90s than I do with this MBP.    That would have been with 1 monitor instead of 2 but otherwise all the same peripherals.<p>The only other USB-C device we have is a switch.. we&#x27;ve never tried to use it with anything but the nintendo chargers&#x2F;devices so I guess we&#x27;ve just been lucky.')
