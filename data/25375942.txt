Nothing like it is today in terms of numbers of people. So, there just weren&#x27;t as many people doing it. Now that they are older the number of younger people dwarf them, in part, because the number of jobs has gone up.<p>Older developers are there. I know a number of them.<p>There are also company differences. Some companies don&#x27;t like to hire older developers. Some of these companies want people to work around the clock and older developers tend to have families and hobbies. It&#x27;s harder to have an influence on them to work a major number of hours.<p>Then there are older developers who do not want to change. I know some of these. As technology changes a breakneck speeds they don&#x27;t want to move on from what they did to something new. This can cause issues and give the age group a bad name.<p>I find the most successful older developers are those who use their experience to do a good job and what needs to be done while adapting as things change.')
