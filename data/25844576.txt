They are chasing me to add Zecoda [1] (early stage SaaS) to their discount stores with the following:<p>- Offer: Zecoda Pro: Lifetime Subscription<p>- Promotion: email to 4MM+ subs and ~25 pieces of editorial content<p>- Publisher Stores: Placement in 200+ publisher stores (such as Engadget&#x27;s store &amp; TheNextWeb&#x27;s store)<p>They would get ~70% (!) of the revenue and will never include our website&#x27;s URL in their articles. All links will push users to the stores.<p>I&#x27;m kind of on the fence here. It could be a potential revenue boost, but:<p>- Lifetime Subscription isn&#x27;t ideal because we also have web hosting<p>- We won&#x27;t benefit from SEO (they&#x27;ll never add our link in the articles)<p>- We risk hurting our image by selling cheap<p>What are your thoughts on this? Have you tried this approach before? Any good results?<p>Thanks!<p>[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.stackcommerce.com&#x2F;<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;zecoda.com')
