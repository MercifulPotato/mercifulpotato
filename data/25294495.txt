Mac OS just works, feels, and looks good by default and gets out of my way.<p>I am also waiting to see how the next couple of years of CPU wars plays out before committing to a Linux laptop like a ThinkPad with all that stuff soldered in place.<p>Can&#x27;t see myself ever going back to Windows which I grew up with. Windows 10 just looks and feels and acts miserable.')
