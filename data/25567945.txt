Trillions on batteries would&#x27;ve been a much better investment; with ROI.<p>Sadly, some folks in defense still can&#x27;t understand why non-oil investments in battery tech are best for all.<p>There are multiple electric trainer aircraft with flight times over an hour and quite a few more in development.<p>Jet engines are terribly inefficient (30-50% efficient) compared to electric motors.')
