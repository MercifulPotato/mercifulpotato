But rightly or wrongly, the entire economy is currently awash with credit to fight the pandemic-induced economic crisis.<p>But money is not the only reason it has worked. Norway is generating 95% of their electricity using hydro. A KW&#x2F;h is cheaper in Norway than it is in France (which is notoriously cheap due to nuclear). People <i>want</i> to have an electric car, because it makes sense for them. Once the economy is converted, they will reduce the incentives, and they will be in a very good place.<p>Now we can say that that is also an unfair advantage (a geographic one). But they did build all those plants. Norway did play the long game.<p>We can all continue to say that there are no solutions to climate change, or we can take a leaf from their book and start playing the long game. The best moment to plant a tree is 20 years ago. The second best moment is today.<p>Wikipedia page on Norwegian Electricity sector: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Electricity_sector_in_Norway" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Electricity_sector_in_Norway</a><p>Eurostat statistics on electricity prices in Europe: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ec.europa.eu&#x2F;eurostat&#x2F;statistics-explained&#x2F;index.php&#x2F;Electricity_price_statistics" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ec.europa.eu&#x2F;eurostat&#x2F;statistics-explained&#x2F;index.php...</a>')
