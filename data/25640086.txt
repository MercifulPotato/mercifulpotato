Item(by='ghostwriter', descendants=None, kids=[25643468], score=None, time=1609805060, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25635454, text='&gt; Why do you only ask about fallible unions?<p>Precisely because you&#x27;ve added a redundant argument of fallible corporations to the thread that makes a case about corrupt unions that negatively impact law-abiding high-skilled professionals. This was the concern I initially raised.<p>&gt; My point is simple. These are all human institutions. They&#x27;re not &quot;problems&quot; with &quot;solutions&quot;.<p>I think they are, unless these institutions have no purpose and do not set any goals.<p>&gt; And, to answer your second question, I believe the scenario you idealize creates externalities like environmental pollutions which kills citizens<p>For that we&#x27;ve already got a court system that is capable, after a proper due process, of fining and criminally charging everyone who is proven to be guilty. I&#x27;m not advocating for dispersing them, I&#x27;m advocating for separating state affairs from economics, in the same manner and for the same reason why religion and church was separated from the state in the western world a few centuries ago.<p>&gt; consider what the food industry, meatpacking plants, etc, would look like without OHSA<p>what responsibility do OSHA, FDA, SEC, etc inspectors and supervisors carry for regulatory failure? I know what happens to the producers and owners of those plants who fail to provide safe environment and products, or who commited fraud and got caught, I&#x27;ve never heard of government inspectors and commitee members going to jail for any of those cases that led to citizens&#x27; harm. At most, and in very rare cases with a lot of public pressure they get permanently banned from holding similar positions in the future.')
