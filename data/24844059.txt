I did the calculation and it&#x27;s actually worse than that...<p>Alpha Centauri is just 4.37ly away. With an acceleration of 0.00227g, mass of 1t, and max velocity of 0.1C (10% of C), it will take 86.33 years to reach Alpha Centauri for those on the spaceship, assuming you also want to stop at the destination.
