And we&#x27;re exactly in that market of &#x27;we want the OSS + on-prem friendly variant for our on-prem users, but a managed service provider for our managed tier.&#x27; Auth0 and friends show how big this market is, and the general push to SaaS-only by them and their competitors has been a non-starter. Smart!<p>Unfortunately the focus on nodejs &#x2F; non-django backends means we won&#x27;t be evaluating for now -- despite being actively looking at this space. But if you or others become active here, am interested. See replicated.com -- implementing API tokens, RBAC, etc. is necessary for teams like ours yet largely generic, so a good OSS-native partner to pick up where frameworks like Django fall down would be awesome. Good luck!')
