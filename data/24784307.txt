It&#x27;s also entirely predictable that the NYT would write this article. However, the article still contains interesting detail and will be informative for a lot of the NYT&#x27;s general readership who don&#x27;t work for a (somewhat controversial) big corp. Dismissing it as &#x27;simple click-bait&#x27; is an over-reaction. Not improved at all by the snark in your second paragraph.')
