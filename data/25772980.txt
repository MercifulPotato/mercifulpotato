Item(by='wahern', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610606643, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25772513, text='I don&#x27;t think the Leviathan is taught for the conclusions; it&#x27;s taught because it established the <i>modern</i> framework for political science discourse; the terms of debate, so to speak. While the debate is far more sophisticated today, the emphasis on security, conflict, selfishness, and property is as strong as ever. That itself is somewhat unfortunate, but on the plus side on the list of most assigned at Ivy Leagues is #2 Imagined Communities, and #3 Republic.<p>Regarding Imagined Communities, I can&#x27;t think of any better text for introducing alternative dimensions for understanding political systems. It&#x27;s not critical, but constructive; not abstract, but concrete; not idealistic, radical, or predictive, but powerfully descriptive. You <i>have</i> to teach Hobbes because without it, it&#x27;s not possible (or at least not easy) to orient oneself in the sea of modern Western political philosophy. Imagined Communities is just smart and an unsung seminal piece of political science literature. I had no idea it had become so popular.')
