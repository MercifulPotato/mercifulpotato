Left or right is irrelevant, these companies will remove you if you say something they don&#x27;t want you to say, there&#x27;s no additional complexity that needs to be analyzed. Any judgement that one needs to make on how to feel about the censoring they do can be made on that simple rule alone. I&#x27;m amazed the discussions about censorship have been muddied to this extent where even the past relationships of people have been scrutinized to determine if they were deserving enough of a ban. None of that matters - did you say something they did not want specifically _you_ (the individual) to say at this time? Then they will decide to ban&#x2F;suspend&#x2F;remove you. Now how you feel about that is how you feel but there&#x27;s no reason to even think &quot;Well they let this person say this!&quot;, because these companies are not in the business of free speech. They can turn on a dime tomorrow and start banning Antifa members left and right and it still wouldn&#x27;t change their bottom line.')
