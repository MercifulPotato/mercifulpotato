Usually 150mcg or half of one of the tablets I take at night. 300mcg is for me nearly a guarantee that I&#x27;ll nap for 3 hours, and those oversleep results (depending on last night&#x27;s sleep, but usually it&#x27;d be oversleep) are not enjoyable at all.<p>Edit: I&#x27;ve also taken a quarter tablet or about 75mcg to calm down after a long day, and I&#x27;m glad I tried it.')
