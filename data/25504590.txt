As to concrete evidence, I obviously don&#x27;t have it but it might be hard to acquire:<p>&gt; The ministry has admitted tampering with paperwork to make it tally with testimony given in parliament, and on Wednesday admitted orders were given to destroy documents for the same reason, according to a document distributed to reporters by opposition lawmaker Osaka.<p>And it&#x27;s not as if I would believe the figures anyway, from [3]:<p>&gt; According to the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, there were some 3,700 “unaccompanied deaths” in Japan in 2013. However, other experts estimate the number is nearer 30,000 a year.<p>Why is there such a disparity between the figures academics are claiming which would embarass the government and those that the government are claiming? How are we supposed to measure the impact of COVID-19 with such low testing and no idea what the expected death tally to have been?<p>It&#x27;s not as if things like that are isolated cases of government numbers going awry. I ask myself, would the Japan government go ahead with something even if it endangered large numbers of people but brought money or prestige? The answer appears to be yes[4].<p>&gt; They based their claim on a 2002 report in which government experts estimated there was a one in five chance of a magnitude-8 earthquake occurring and triggering a powerful tsunami within the next 30 years.<p>&gt; At the time of the disaster, Japan’s nuclear regulator was severely criticised for its collusive ties with the nuclear industry, resulting in the formation of a new watchdog that has imposed stricter criteria for the restart of nuclear reactors that were shut down in the wake of the Fukushima disaster.<p>So, in the face of all that (and more) I&#x27;m of the opinion that they were doing their best not to scupper the Olympics. I&#x27;m willing to be proven wrong but I&#x27;m not going to wait for absolute proof to fall in my lap, I&#x27;m not sentencing anyone to prison.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22728674" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22728674</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bloomberg.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2018-05-23&#x2F;japan-ministry-releases-scandal-papers-it-said-were-destroyed" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bloomberg.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2018-05-23&#x2F;japan-min...</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;slate.com&#x2F;news-and-politics&#x2F;2015&#x2F;06&#x2F;kodokushi-in-aging-japan-thousands-die-alone-and-unnoticed-every-year-their-bodies-often-go-unnoticed-for-weeks.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;slate.com&#x2F;news-and-politics&#x2F;2015&#x2F;06&#x2F;kodokushi-in-agi...</a><p>[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;world&#x2F;2017&#x2F;mar&#x2F;17&#x2F;japanese-government-liable-negligence-fukushima-daiichi-nuclear-disaster" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;world&#x2F;2017&#x2F;mar&#x2F;17&#x2F;japanese-gover...</a><p>Edit: missed off a reference number.')
