Eurostat has these &quot;proof of concept&quot; statistics that try to look at how many people with a particular kind of degree are or are not working in a relevant field, and while I do seem to remember that STEM was a bit worse than other fields, the overall message is that there are an enormous amount of people who do work that is unrelated to their degree, whether that&#x27;s an art degree or a teaching degree or computer engineering.<p>(<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ec.europa.eu&#x2F;eurostat&#x2F;web&#x2F;experimental-statistics&#x2F;skills" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ec.europa.eu&#x2F;eurostat&#x2F;web&#x2F;experimental-statistics&#x2F;sk...</a> if you&#x27;re curious.)<p>Anecdotally, too, I&#x27;ve definitely heard of teachers who pursue other careers even though they love working with kids, architects who became brewers, physicists who became writers, lawyers who became journalists, farmers who became coders, and so on.<p>Perhaps tech is worse, but I think there&#x27;s something universal about throwing everything you have into your passion (which is also your career) and burning out when it turns out to be a total slog with zero impact on the world, then pursuing a second career in which you are much happier because you got a fresh start but more importantly because you acquired a more relaxed attitude to work and life that comes with age.')
