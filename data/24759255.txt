This makes the unsafe API surface (which, in the context of security, becomes attack surface) very large.<p>Compare to Java or C#. Vast majority of stuff, including these collections, are implemented on top of memory-safe primitives. Usually (unless explicitly writing unsafe code which most people don’t do), the only attack surface is the VM itself.<p>The attack surface is much smaller in comparison, both JVM and CLR are very simple from the outside, 202 and 234 instructions, respectively.<p>The attack surface is well-contained, third-party C# or Java libraries don’t patch the VMs, while unsafe rust is used in many third-party crates not just in the standard library.<p>Also, these VMs are well-audited (most of the implementations are open source now) and widely used all over the industry, including very security sensitive applications like banks and military.')
