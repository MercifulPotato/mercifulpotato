A lot of the lucrative “real” jobs are quite destructive and counter to the problems that many charities and NGOs try to solve. Also, if everyone thinks this way it’s going to be very hard for these charities and NGOs to find the skills they need at rates that they can manage to fund. A skilled worker can potentially generate a lot of value that might not directly flow back to the organization they work for but to other parts of society - that means the organization has no business case for hiring them (the economics don’t exactly work out) but in the bigger picture it can still be a net benefit.')
