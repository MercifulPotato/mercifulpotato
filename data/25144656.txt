And it probably started with censorship of bad information that lead to the bubble in the first place.<p>There is nothing nefarious about bubbles.  They happen automatically when people are in control of what they consume.  Imagine I join Twitter and I am given a list of people to follow.  I don&#x27;t like to hear from people with viewpoints that I think are crazy so I unfollow someone if they say something I disagree with.  If some gets retweeted into my feed saying something I agree with, I might follow them regardless of the validity of their comment since I don&#x27;t have the time or motivation to fact check everything.  Wouldn&#x27;t you know it, I am now in a bubble despite there being zero censorship of anything.  If one of the people in my bubble repeats some false claim, am I going to see someone dispute that claim or will the disputing occur outside my bubble?<p>&gt;This is where the analogy breaks down, its not a virus, its an idea, anyone can come up with an idea, good or bad. you can&#x27;t protect people from themselves, you can only immunize them, we know it works, it was the only vehicle from the dark ages to the enlightenment.<p>Ideas do have virality to them.  Something like QAnon is a prime example.  Is isn&#x27;t like &quot;wealthy democrats drink the blood of children&quot; is some random idea that multiple people reached through parallel thinking.  It was a particular conspiracy theory that spread from one person to another.  Stopping that message from spreading to more people seems like a more effective approach than trying to retroactively unconvince people who have already bought into the conspiracy.<p>I agree with the rest of your comment about the dangers of censorship.  That is why I said I would have a preference for something that is closer to free and open than not, but that doesn&#x27;t mean we can&#x27;t recognize the specific situations in which completely free and open systems can go wrong.')
