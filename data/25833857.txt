Wn(Ae1,...,Aen) = const*Wn(e1,...,en). This scalar const is called determinant. It has all the properties you would ascribe to Volume like volume spanned by collinear column-vectors is zero. This is a nice bridge to geometry in Ln. Also, in a space of just one page (p.99) he introduces determinant and proves its main properties like det(A*B) = det(A)*det(B) and therefore det(A^-1) = 1&#x2F;det(A).')
