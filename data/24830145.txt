Thanks for taking a look at the code!<p>I picked SHA-1 because it was the simplest way to generate pseudorandom data: I knew there&#x27;s a Rust crate for it which I used before. Works fine for a proof-of-concept :) I&#x27;m now reading up on other hashes and ciphers. My tentative plan was to replace SHA-1 with AES-NI in counter mode, but if I can find something that works on all CPUs while giving me a comparable performance, I&#x27;ll go for that. (Should probably look at PRNGs as well; if I concatenate the file seed with the counter and use that as a seed for a PRNG, then ask it for a value -- it should be good enough too.)<p>I doubt Lars has requirements for the quality of randomness, but we&#x27;ll see.')
