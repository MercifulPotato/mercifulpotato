When you join a new team look for the gaps, what isn&#x27;t getting done or what will benefit the team most and fill that gap. You&#x27;re not going to compete with the current guru of this or that, so learn from them for sure but that&#x27;s not going to mark you out.<p>The only down side is there are often reasons those gaps are there, but it&#x27;s just time to roll up your sleeves and get to work. It&#x27;s an approach I&#x27;ve taken every time I&#x27;ve joined a team and it worked well for me.')
