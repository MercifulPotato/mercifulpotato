I’ve figured out a way to make the economics work with the existing 500MB disk + 1GB RAM requirements, but it would have been a lot easier with Go and Dynamo.<p>Thanks a ton to you and the team for the work you’re doing. I think you’re making a fantastic system, and want to make it available to more people as a personal blogging platform. I just wish it could run multi tenant or with lower memory needs.<p>I don’t suppose making it easier for others to compete with the official Ghost revenue model is a priority, so I doubt this is anything you’ll want to take up. But I’m happy to share revenues on this - I just think Ghost should be a lot more accessible to individuals around the world.')
