Vets seem to charge by the pound <i>(wait, sorry, kilogram, immigrantâ€¦)</i>. Large dogs seem to come with large medical bills, and we were strongly advised by friends and family to go for pet insurance.<p>Now, I am not actually sure that pet insurance, versus setting up a dedicated savings account that we sock money into, was the best idea. If anything, we went for it because I am from the States, and I assume any non-trivial medical issue will be cripplingly expensive.')
