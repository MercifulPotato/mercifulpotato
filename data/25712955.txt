But individuals and groups cannot forcibly enlist others to help spread their message. My local church can&#x27;t force me to espouse my love for their god, nor am I forced to listen to a random passerby on the street.<p>These 2 principals can be easily agreed with in theory, as requirements for a well functioning society. But with technology, comes the ability to convert capital into speech, and those 2 principals come into natural conflict. The written language, the printing press, the internet, etc. are all tools that can be used in conjunction with capital to amplify speech, and drown out the speech of others via shear volume. It isn&#x27;t necessary to silence someone else, if yelling over them achieves the same effect.<p>Thus continues the ever-lasting compromise and conflict between our rights as individuals. There is no free lunch, no easy solution.')
