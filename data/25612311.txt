ONE sense 2a (which is “being one in particular”)\n</code></pre>\nSo, pro tip: in chat-like discussions with strangers such as hacker news, one should prefer saying “one” when using sense 2, even if it sounds a bit archaic (at least to me. Is it?)<p>Also, when reading a “you” that could be interpreted both ways, do not assume it is used in sense 1.')
