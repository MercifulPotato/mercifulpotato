And if there&#x27;s a mechanical issue with a drive and it dies &#x2F; stops spinning, then you&#x27;ll probably get an alert and can swap it.<p>But if there&#x27;s any kind of bit rot or data corruption, and it only happens on one side of the (traditional) RAID1 mirror, how will you (a) know that it actually occurred, or (b) know which side is good bits and which side has bad bits?<p>With ZFS and checksums, you can be confident that your data is still healthy. Depending on the data, this may be an important consideration.<p><i>zfs send-recv</i> is also very handy for doing incremental backups.')
