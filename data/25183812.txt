For instance: does a company that sells drugs that can be used off-label for executions of human beings have a &quot;product [that] is directly related to politics?&quot;<p>This problem is a lot like writing good requirements.  Your rule above is a lot like a requirement of an HR system that states simply &quot;the system will reject the resumes of all unqualified candidates.&quot;  There&#x27;s a lot to unpack there, and that requirement, as stated, doesn&#x27;t even get you 1% of the way there.')
