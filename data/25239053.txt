At my last job, we had several guys working 60+ hours &#x2F; week whose output was miserable. I put in 5-6 hrs &#x2F; day and was easily 2-10x as productive as them.<p>Secondly, work&#x2F;life balance is real. As a lead, I tell my team they should absolutely not be working over 40 hours, and I won&#x27;t do so myself unless I&#x27;ve fucked something up that&#x27;s mission-critical. I&#x27;d advocate for a shorter workweek but my boss is very old school.<p>Thirdly, I don&#x27;t think you can put in long workweeks and be productive long term. Most people just waste time when they work longer, and their productivity goes down, not up, and their mistakes go up. In dev, especially at startups, a single mistake can cost you your business. Do you really want exhausted workers in your codebase?<p>The truth it you should work however much you feel comfortable for the money you&#x27;re getting. That&#x27;s different for everyone. But if I can provide several million in revenue growth with a few hours of effort per day, then I figure I&#x27;m more than paying for myself. If you&#x27;re willing to work 80 hours while getting paid the same as if you work 40 and being as productive as working 20, that makes you stupid and servile imo, not dedicated.')
