I mean we don&#x27;t say the US government as a whole is evil because of the child separation policy (some people do but not most).<p>I&#x27;m pretty anti CPP for the most part, but I feel like we&#x27;re losing all nuance when we use broad stroke labels. I also don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s productive. As soon as we label something or someone &quot;evil&quot; then any avenue for dialog and improvement is gone. The only thing left is conflict and confrontation.')
