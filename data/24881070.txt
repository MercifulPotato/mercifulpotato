The jury is still out on those decisions, but they are rational.<p>In fact we’ll probably never know who chose the optimal policy mix to cope with the pandemic, and as a result we should give those with differing views an awful lot of slack as they try and negotiate it with limited resources and foresight (i.e. as humans).<p>For now, let’s just enjoy this good news about the people in Sweden at face value–we need it!')
