Many times in Clojure is easier to write two wrappers, one in Java (to make the Java lib access tolerable from Clojure lol) and the Clojure one. And I&#x27;m talking about ad-hoc wrappers for your use case&#x2F;functionality needs, not general wrappers, which take much more time. Productivity goes down in this translation, you start to wonder why are you wasting all this time wrapping Java libs. Kotlin is much better in this area of course.')
