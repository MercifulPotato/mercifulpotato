In many large and established companies, there is formal training that puts all these people in one room with the trainees, either because the company is already so distributed as to make this impossible otherwise, or because it&#x27;s more cost-efficient to disseminate this info to a large number of incoming engineers.<p>In smaller startups and growing companies, where these things are changing at a high rate, it becomes even more valuable.<p>It&#x27;s not that these things are not doable virtually, but it&#x27;s something that will require deliberate rearranging of how people work. In larger companies, this type of stuff already happens, but not so much in smaller ones.<p>Engineering organizations can learn a lot from Sales departments in this area. Sales in companies that sell in various geographies (which includes even small companies that have gained traction and are beginning to grow) already functions perfectly fine with very distributed teams, and highly technical sales motions (think enterprise products).<p>Small, growing companies have big problems with communications and coordination in general. That&#x27;s what makes the scaling stage challenging and full of pitfalls: many companies fail at this stage!')
