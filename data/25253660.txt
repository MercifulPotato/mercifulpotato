Yes. You will likely live in a small-ish apartment and not save that much. At least to me, at $70k I felt like a failure in Tokyo. A lot of things go into that feeling.<p>1. Not being able to afford what I considered a &quot;nice&quot; apartment. Like say as nice as the one I was living in before I cam in So Cal with 2 bedrooms, a nice living room, 2 bathrooms, etc. Those apartments exist. They&#x27;re probably $2500 a month a few stops out of downtown. If you move way out they can get way cheaper but then you aren&#x27;t downtown.<p>2. Having &quot;finance&quot; jobs and corresponding lifestyle in front of my face. Before I moved to Japan I thought I was doing well (never compared). Once I got here, at least at the time, the English free magazines around town are all targeting expats in finance. Those people, at the time, made $300k to $1000k a year and live in $4k to $20k a month apartments provided by their comapany so their salary is even higher. At $70k I don&#x27;t I can justify spending more than about $1400 a month on an apartment.<p>That said, if I was just out of college, even at $40k-$50k I think I&#x27;d have thought things were pretty good. In other words, &quot;it depends&quot; on what you find acceptable. I took a big step down in lifestyle to live here at the time.')
