Item(by='TeMPOraL', descendants=None, kids=[25608080], score=None, time=1609539602, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25607684, text='&gt; <i>So it&#x27;s in my experience totally untrue to suggest that any child would have to &quot;catch up&quot; any learning missed due to sickness (and also reveals that schools are talking bollocks when they suggest that taking a few days off to go on holiday during termtime will have any noticeable adverse effect, but shhhh)</i><p>But it does seem true, from the point of view of parents and children. It doesn&#x27;t matter that the curriculum is helical and revisits the same topics multiple times. It doesn&#x27;t revisit the same topics multiple time <i>in a single semester</i>, which means the kid doesn&#x27;t get a second chance to learn a topic within the grading scope, which means they have to catch up or risk a lower grade. As much as we say that it&#x27;s the education that matters, as much as it should matter - it doesn&#x27;t. What matters are the grades. At the very least, in my experience, most parents have grade expectations, and the kid will suffer negative consequences <i>this semester</i> if they fall back, even though they may recover by the end of the education level (where again, the final grades are all that matters).<p>(Even though the immediate pressure may come from the parents, it&#x27;s in a control loop with the grades, so the school can&#x27;t pretend this is not happening.)')
