Others must pay to invalidate patents that are obvious next steps, just math (which is indeed unpatentable even in the US), infringing other (defensive) patents, or which are invalidateable due to published prior art.<p>It&#x27;s hard to believe that topological sort (available in the GNU `tsort` and `make` apps, for example) was <i>ever</i> patentable.<p>Perhaps Wikipedia contains references to published prior art?<p>If they don&#x27;t even look at everyone else&#x27;s registered-as-unique ideas, how could they have been knowingly infringing?<p>Everyone wants their cut of Progress in the <i>Useful Arts and Sciences</i>. Nobody will invalidate patents for everyone else; USPTO has no obligation to even check a search engine for the subject matter.<p>And then, prove the date that published prior art was published without a distribted time-stamping blockchain.
