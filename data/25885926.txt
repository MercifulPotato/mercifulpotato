My phone uses WiFi for everything by default. I wonder if they&#x27;d be able to tell (probably via Google?) If I were to leave it home for a day. On the weekend of course, since daily commute will hit the towers except for an atypical occurrence.<p>With such capability I feel like it&#x27;s obvious they don&#x27;t want to stop certain things.')
