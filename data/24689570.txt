What if I need to have separate kind of default contracts for different classes of customers? What if I need to modify the details of a certain type of default contracts for all consumers that are using it? And on and on. If storing them in contracts table is not good (which I don&#x27;t really agree with), then where should we store these variety of default contracts? How do I join them with contracts table to know which consumers have default contracts? Or groups consumers by type of default contracts?<p>Keep the model sensible. Contracts belong to contracts. Add basic sanity to the model. The service that manages the data guards the data beyond basic data model sanity checks. Also, explicit is better than implicit.')
