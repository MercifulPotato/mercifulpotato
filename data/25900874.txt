Autocracies always appear stable until suddenly they don&#x27;t anymore and break apart or fail in some other way. While democracies seem inefficient and at times quite volatile, they are significantly more robust and can adapt better to changes down the road.<p>Modern China, so far, has only really experienced a fairly homogeneous historical phase, which is one primarily driven by economic growth. They haven&#x27;t been forced to deal with major societal issues, in my opinion it&#x27;s simply too early to judge just how robust that government and state is going to be in the long-run.')
