We recently built probably the nicest looking enterprise app within our company (even I was shocked when I first saw the designs, it was light years ahead of everything else at the company). Six months later it started to look dated. Design language that models certain user flows feel old over time, and obviously the aesthetic is completely operating under the laws of fashion, things stop looking fresh fast. This is all important because other products within the company can start to look and feel better, and definitely so can competing products by other companies. It happens so fast.<p>Has anyone looked at MaterialUI lately? It looks dated. The new design paradigms are coming, and whether you like it or not, it’s going to make your current stuff look sluggish.<p>So yeah, no-code tools <i>could</i> quickly build the design of the day, but today’s designs were already yesterday’s design <i>yesterday</i>.')
