What &#x27;saved&#x27; intel was a change in philosophy rather than chasing MHz they chased power savings. And with Apple&#x27;s new chips that history is repeating itself (and appears to be with a similar outcome).<p>It&#x27;s an exciting time for hardware again because Intel and AMD are going to have to react to this and I think there&#x27;s still legs to x86, it&#x27;s survived everything thats been thrown at it so far...')
