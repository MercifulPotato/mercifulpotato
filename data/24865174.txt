Even at top-100 institutions, like the University of Vermont, enrollment is down ~ 20 %. Must be a good year to get into Harvard or Stanford. There&#x27;s also the secular trend of decreasing student numbers, the echo of the baby boom is wearing off.<p>It&#x27;s bad. Neither party has a political response to the coronarecession, public institutions had their funding cut severely because states can&#x27;t print money, they have to balance their budgets. Private institutions will drop dead like bogflies. Ordinarily one wouldn&#x27;t cry for any of the many low-ranked sectarian colleges that will bite the dust, but their faculty will compete in the labour market.<p>And no political response is to be seen. Traditionally, under Democratic leadership the science budget is bigger, but we haven&#x27;t heard anything about that from the incoming Harris-Biden administration. It&#x27;s really bad and makes you want to vote Republican because of protectionism and reduced immigration.<p>The only safe funding now is soft money.')
