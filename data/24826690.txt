We then update our priors based on our interpretation of available information.<p>Both of these steps are highly subjective. Especially the choice of the priors, since they are based on years of unique personal experiences and personal analysis of those experiences.<p>I would never attempt to change or challenge anyone&#x27;s prior. I don&#x27;t know whether human civilization will some day develop a way for people to converge to similar priors, but it&#x27;s certainly not happening this century, so it won&#x27;t be relevant to me.')
