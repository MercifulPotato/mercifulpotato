Now, this is likely better than what some off-the-shelf open source library might be using (which might actually have been fine if you had configured it correctly) and I have nothing against running further authentication before giving access to your things, but calling this the “only safe way” to do something is not really true at all. There’s a number of companies that run without this model that do fairly well, and Google endpoints <i>are</i> occasionally are hit by researchers. So it’s good on Google that they have a policy up for this and it mostly seems to work for them, but it’s not the <i>only</i> solution like you’re suggesting.')
