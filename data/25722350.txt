Item(by='eganist', descendants=None, kids=[25722660], score=None, time=1610325096, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25722291, text='&gt; I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m actually going to go to this topic, but your argument has been made before with the Reichstag Fire [1]. Using threats of violence as a pretext for assuming more government control is a tactic as old as governments.<p>There&#x27;s a bit of false equivalence here. The fire was, on one hand, a false flag (from the very link you posted), and on the other hand, a stroke of luck.<p>Whereas here, it was an attempt at taking human hostages (reference: the many more recent videos of insurrectionists with human zip ties and small arms) and disrupting election certification with human shields in the form of a mob of conservative protesters. Which by every definition would be an attempted coup.<p>And don&#x27;t get me wrong, I&#x27;m saying quite explicitly that there were legitimate, Trump-believing protesters in the crowd who either got swept up into the moment or genuinely fear for the state of the country but who were <i>not</i> in it to overthrow a legitimately elected government. However, within the crowd were people who came equipped to overthrow leadership followed by blending right back into the crowd, and they coordinated on platforms such as Parler with impunity, which is precisely why deplatforming the platforms is the appropriate next step.<p>It&#x27;s not because of everyday conservatives who feel duped. It&#x27;s because of the conservatives who came together to enact violence and disrupt the democratic process.')
