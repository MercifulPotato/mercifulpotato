I will read a bit more about it then motivate myself to go to my GP (they speak Czech which I am ok with in <i>normal</i> situations but for specialized things like medical stuff it can be challenging!). But thanks for this, I proably wouldn&#x27;t have considered CFS&#x2F;ME as a possibility were it not for your comment.')
