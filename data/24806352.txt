A regular expression is a whole new program, written in a whole new programming language (one used to program finite state machines, instead of Turing ones, but still). Why not just write a simple function to compare string suffix? Is you programming language (C++, in this case) so anaemic that you need a whole different language to do such basic operations?<p>This is what people who don&#x27;t like C++ complain about, in addition to the language, the self-indulgent culture around it.')
