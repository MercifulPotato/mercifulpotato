Linux and the greater LAMP stack didn&#x27;t become <i>dominant</i> until after the dot com crash. Even then a significant amount of FOSS money&#x2F;contributions were coming from US companies. Also keep in mind the P in LAMP really meant both Perl and PHP.<p>I&#x27;m also really curious when exactly you think popular (in terms of users) operating systems for computers <i>didn&#x27;t</i> come from the US. Symbian and BlackBerry OS are the only two coming to mind and neither were general purpose OSes.<p>As for American-centric Internet...wow. Piracy is still a thing. Subscriptions are a revenue model in no way unique or specific to the US. Web browsers still exist so I don&#x27;t see how &quot;app stores&quot; did anything to make the Internet American-centric. Those same web browsers can access websites with no gatekeeping unless you live in an authoritarian state that does gatekeeping for you. Describing the Internet as an American walled garden is, to be charitable, absolutely ridiculous and borderline stupid.')
