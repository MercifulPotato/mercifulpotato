He framed it this way: the &#x27;American&#x27; approach is to implement FBW to always do what the pilot inputs indicate, whereas the &#x27;French&#x27; approach is to do the right thing, and override the pilot if the FBW &#x27;knows&#x27; better. That&#x27;s an interesting cultural cultural consistency as well!<p>So, the &#x27;American&#x27; approach is better if the sensors are not working as expected, and it makes the software simpler. The &#x27;French&#x27; approach is better if the pilot is wrong, but both the sensors and the software must be working perfectly. Everyone makes mistakes, and all software has bugs. What to do?<p>(In reality, some &#x27;judgement&#x27; is needed by the software, even in the American approach.)<p>EDIT: That said, some of the design choices in the Airbus FBW are baffling, such as making the control input the average of two different inputs. I like to think AF447 is less likely to have happened in a Boeing ship, although the ulitimate cause of the crash was a pilot making what amounts to a beginner mistake.<p>Don&#x27;t miss William Langewiesche&#x27;s article!<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vanityfair.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;business&#x2F;2014&#x2F;10&#x2F;air-france-flight-447-crash" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vanityfair.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;business&#x2F;2014&#x2F;10&#x2F;air-france-...</a>')
