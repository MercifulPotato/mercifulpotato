In addition to this kind of policy being elitist I also think it is racist. Those attending higher education tend to be from more well off backgrounds and white. This is where the whole affirmative action thing started, under representation of minorities in higher education. It is a snub to those who could not attend college due to their socioeconomic background. There are many struggling people who never attended college and don&#x27;t have student loans, what about them?<p>EDIT: I would directly benefit from this as I have student loans, but if I could make the decision to forgive student loans like this I would say no.')
