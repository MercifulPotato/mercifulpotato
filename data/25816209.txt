I generally give away my tech (gpus, keyboards, computer parts, kindles, headsets) to friends and coworkers, which usually means through previous conversations with them that I know they&#x27;ll use it. I think that&#x27;s the motivation for me.<p>It&#x27;s also a good way of introducing them to tech that they wouldn&#x27;t normally get for themselves. The best example is mechanical keyboards; most people don&#x27;t think they want one until they&#x27;ve used it regularly. And kindles.')
