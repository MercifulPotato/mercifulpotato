Framer has a lot of cool stuff, their plugin system is really powerful So you can have things like 3d elements which is super cool.<p>I am sure people use it, but it didn&#x27;t grow in popularity like Figma did. I think with any kind of product, there&#x27;s often a world of stuff happening under the surface that leads to success. I don&#x27;t know why Framer hasn&#x27;t been as successful. One guess would be that people just don&#x27;t find writing react components and tying it to their design tool to be useful. Potentially too much friction, or that the people doing the designing don&#x27;t often write react code. Or maybe they didn&#x27;t market it well enough.<p>The question of components in design is really interesting but it&#x27;s a whole other issue.<p>I do know that along with Adobe XD, Framer has had some issues with bugs. Figma, I would expect, is a lot more stable because they have their own custom renderer that&#x27;s one canvas element whereas other tools use the DOM. It&#x27;s one of the reasons why Figma is so feature-poor, they have implement a lot of behavior themselves.')
