And people with those audiences were reluctant to repeat whatever wild bullshit was proposed to them if they couldn&#x27;t vet it themselves.<p>If you didn&#x27;t have your own credibility, you had to convince those who did to run your stuff. The cost of this is that it&#x27;s slower to break things, and some stuff gets missed.<p>Unmoderated internet platforms with algorithmic jumps between otherwise-unconnected publishers let you borrow and hijack other people&#x27;s credibility and platforms.<p>Why those platforms <i>shouldn&#x27;t</i> be allowed to have editorial control - given that maintaining a certain reputation will still be critical for their long-term success - is beyond me and seems to have obvious un-American problems (infringement on their own private rights).<p>The trade-off being desired also seems fundamentally bad. More people being misled more quickly seems like a worse situation than slower breaking of news and the ability to suppress some stories, given that we <i>were</i> still able to break those stories you mention in the past. (Of course, I don&#x27;t know what <i>else</i> might have been more widely reported in the past... I&#x27;m having to rely on a &quot;we didn&#x27;t feel like we were living in a totalitarian dystopia in the 60s-through-80s&quot; assumption.)')
