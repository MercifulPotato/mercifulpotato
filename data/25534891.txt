Therefore, on one side many people in the humanities greatly misunderstands and either fantasizes or fear-mongers AI up to ridiculous heights (sometimes venturing into science-fiction territory), or many scientists and the engineers think there is absolutely no problem in applying algorithms that can be comparable to phrenology [1] to society.<p>But most importantly, it seems like there needs to be a fundamental advancement in philosophy (beyond the current state of modernism and postmodernism), if we really want to criticize the negative aspects of technocratic governance. Maybe here&#x27;s an idea I had for a while: I think there is a deeper lineage to machine learning that nobody is talking about: optimization. (Hot take: isn&#x27;t what we&#x27;re all doing with deep learning just optimization to fit large datasets?) I think in order to actually create a meaningful discussion about today&#x27;s AI, it is crucial to look back at the history of optimization (all the way back into the 30s Soviet, where they tried to use linear programming to their planned economy and failed [2].) I think there needs to be a philosophical framework capable of articulating the effects of optimization technology on our society, before we can go any further and tackle the issues with today&#x27;s and tomorrow&#x27;s AI.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Phrenology" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Phrenology</a>\n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;crookedtimber.org&#x2F;2012&#x2F;05&#x2F;30&#x2F;in-soviet-union-optimization-problem-solves-you&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;crookedtimber.org&#x2F;2012&#x2F;05&#x2F;30&#x2F;in-soviet-union-optimiz...</a>')
