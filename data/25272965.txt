I suspect any work done would be fairly old - back in the days when ISA research was active. Similar to compiler front-end work (think lex, yacc, grammar etc..) ISA research is not an active area currently. But maybe it&#x27;s time to revisit it?<p>Also, I&#x27;m not sure if Huffman encoding is applicable to a fixed-size ISA. Wouldn&#x27;t it be applicable only in a variable size ISA where you devote smaller size encoding to more frequent instructions?')
