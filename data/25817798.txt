Signal is only looking to generate a movement to guarantee e2e encryption across all chat and social stacks. They don’t care who ends up owning the social wars, as long as that becomes the new standard. Think of it as an attempt to strike at the heart of the capitalistic forces that have diverted that kind of research away from production. It’s a brilliant strategic play they’re doing so I’m more grateful to figuring out how to do that because it looked like it had repeatedly failed in the past.')
