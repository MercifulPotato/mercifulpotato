It&#x27;s not unusual for us to see high loads on early parts of the system 1 hour and 1 hour later seeing high loads on the later parts of the system.<p>Unfortunately, we don&#x27;t currently have a way to scale out and reassign resources.  That means we&#x27;ve built out for our peaks even though the majority of the time that hardware is sleeping.<p>We could spend the time building out a scaling system (right now, our resources are all on prem).  However, why do that when we can instead take advantage of k8s already built in scaling capabilities?<p>So, technically not k8s that will be saving us money, but rather implementing autoscaling.  However, the solution with k8s is really nice.')
