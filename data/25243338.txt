Item(by='Dionneo', descendants=0, kids=None, score=1, time=1606631229, title='Survey for my fellow SaaS startups', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='Hey guys, I&#x27;m new to this community and have never done a startup before.<p>Recently, I had a problem of collecting user feedback from my enterprise clients. The non-technical clients had a hard time communicating their concern&#x27;s &#x2F; wants and I had to be physically present at their office to get them to explain the problem to me effectively. This is a problem which I felt that most startups would face(Or maybe not..).<p>The concept of my solution is simple, give users the ability to visually tell the developers what the problem on the app is (via screen recording and click captures), contextualize the problem and organize it for developers to understand the issue effectively.<p>Of course, there are other solutions out there like Bugherd and UserSnap, but I feel that I can still bring value to the table.<p>That being said, thank you for reading thus far. I&#x27;m currently trying dig deeper into the problem and see if other people are facing the same problem as me. If you could take a 5min to complete the survey, I&#x27;ll be extremely grateful!\nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;forms.gle&#x2F;nngqFJnMvQo6f3hn6')
