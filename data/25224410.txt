The science on mask wearing did change and it&#x27;s possible it may change again if the virus evolves in the near future.<p>What won&#x27;t change is the risk profile of wearing vs not wearing a mask. Wearing a mask despite necessity is an inconvenience, but unlikely to result in harm. Not wearing mask, even if current science says is safe to do so, is still exposure to potential harm that may have been unforeseen. For instance a transmission vector that is not yet a well characterized one. This is why I personally take a dim view to these sorts &quot;following the science&quot; arguments.')
