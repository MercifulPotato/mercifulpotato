Benchmarks don&#x27;t typically target the efficiency cores.<p>In any case, I think it&#x27;s tricky to read to much into microbenchmarks like this; the overal system perf in any case does not have anything near like that perf difference, but instead a slowly shrinking gap (as described before, and supported by links to evidence).<p>I&#x27;m still curious about those efficiency cores mind you, even if I don&#x27;t think it has much impact on the overall point.  Also, one of the things qualcomm intentionally skimps on is powerplanes, I&#x27;m assuming for cost reasons - and that means low-perf power will be suboptimal.  Then again, I&#x27;m not sure how much that matters.<p>(Don&#x27;t forget the context of the Altera ARM server CPU and what it means for intel&#x2F;AMD; efficiency cores probably don&#x27;t tell a very meaningful story of qualcomm vs. apple, but certainly don&#x27;t apply in that space, yet).')
