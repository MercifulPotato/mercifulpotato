A lot of plans call for getting 30% of your calories from fat, which is about 12% of food by mass (since fats are about twice as calorie-dense as carbs or proteins).<p>Controlling total calories is important in weight loss, and that&#x27;s a matter of portion control. A diet with a good proportion of fat will be fairly satisfying; you just need to limit the total amount of it. That&#x27;ll still leave you a little hungry. There&#x27;s no magic that makes calorie deficit pleasant. Tweaking the ratios can make it less unpleasant, a matter of personal taste.<p>It doesn&#x27;t need to be junk. You don&#x27;t even necesarily need a calorie deficit, if you&#x27;re happy with your weight. There exist good vegetarian and vegan diets with appropriate amounts of fat and appropriate total calories, and they don&#x27;t at all resemble &quot;brown rice, steamed chicken breast, and cauliflower&quot;.')
