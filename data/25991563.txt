This isn&#x27;t reality. There has to be tools that are patently bad to use and people have used these bad tools to build great things. But it doesn&#x27;t change the fact that a tool can be horrible to use.<p>I would argue that at the time the article was written, Mongo was definitively a bad tool. Things have changed, but not all things.')
