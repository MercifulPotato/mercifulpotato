If you want to see less art be more selective in what to see or go to the advertised shows and be amused.<p>A museum preserves cultural heritage.<p>The roman books about the greeks  hidden in monasteries, sculptures buried in the earth that inspired the renaissance where not seen by the public for hundreds of years.<p>Until some start reading them again,a fire, a hope for a different way of thinking was born, accumulating to democracy land of the free etc. and probably your way of life as it is now.<p>So do not underestimate the value of currently unseen cultural heritage.<p>Selling it of now to a rich dump head showing it around until it rots in a basement as it is not envogue anymore is a filter but will put it on high risk.')
