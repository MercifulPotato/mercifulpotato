The US is a bit weird in that one person is excluded for the normal legal system of judges, and instead replaces it with the congress, but regardless that is where the crime of &quot;incitement to violence&quot; and &quot;conspiracy&quot; is settled.<p>As with all other conspiracies, we also have the persons who committed the act of violence. If they are not dead they will hopefully end up in court and have their case brought up by the legal system.')
