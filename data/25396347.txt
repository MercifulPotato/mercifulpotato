What reason have I to believe there is great risk in approval?<p>As I understand it, medical ethics isn’t about utilitarianism, or else we’d skip the rats and monkeys and just go straight to testing on the poor for money. They don’t seem to prioritize minimizing the opportunity cost of avoiding bad outcomes. Their guiding principle seems to be avoiding giving harmful treatment.<p>Meanwhile some healthcare workers at my partner’s facility are skeptical about whether the vaccine was rushed (I think they’re crazy, for the record). But there’s real risk if enough of the public doesn’t trust the vaccine. I’d bet that kind of angle is part of why they focus on “do no harm” instead of “minimize cumulative regret.”')
