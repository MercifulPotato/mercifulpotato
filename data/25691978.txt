A right to free speech, is set in stone in the US Constitution, a private company can enforce their own censorship, but having a company that wants to have the 1st amendment and is being forced to be shut down is not what the US is about.<p>Threats and actions to commit treason should be handled by authorities and prosecuted. But someone saying they don&#x27;t believe the election results should not be silenced. Its their right to free speech and the US constitution guarantees it.<p>We had 4 years of major media and almost all journalists saying Russia stole&#x2F;meddled with our election and none of them was criticized as saying they are trying to deliberately sabotage democracy or silenced via social media platforms. Lets also not forget the &quot;resist&quot; movement which was to openly defy a democratically elected president, is that treason? No its free speech.<p>The whole reason you had a bunch of desperate crazies storming congress is an extreme effort to silence speech and whole communities by big tech and the media. Happy content people that are doing well and are well represented do not do these actions, things are not going well in the this country and censorship about ideas someone does not like is like dousing a blazing inferno with gasoline.')
