Imagine seeing a headline that said &quot;replacing female and black executive leadership  with old white dudes increases profit&quot;  by McKinsey.<p>Second the magnitude of the impact seems insane. This seems larger than the difference most studies find between good leadership and average leadership. And while I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if diverse leadership is marginally better than non-diverse leadership I would be surprised if it&#x27;s larger than the difference between average and good.<p>Three they&#x27;re pulling from many different countries which could potentially create huge confounds.<p>In general &quot;research&quot; that comes out of a place like McKinsey and Bane is pretty suspect but something like this is even more.<p>Even if none of the other problems are real they still don&#x27;t establish causation.  It could easily be the case that diverse candidates are harder to find, so more competitive&#x2F;better firms are able to better attract them.<p>I think diversity is great and there are lots of great reasons to increase it but I doubt the impact on profitability would be anything beyond marginal.')
