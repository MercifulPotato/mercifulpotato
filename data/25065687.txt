Too busy or unmotivated to do fact checking every single time. So much so that I have stopped looking at most(political and others) news altogether as I feel I am doing disservice by studying multiple sources and fact checking. It just gets too tiring. Now on most political conversations I just excuse myself by saying even though I should care and me choosing to not care is only possible due to my privileged position in society, I choose to use my privilege for the sake of my mental peace.')
