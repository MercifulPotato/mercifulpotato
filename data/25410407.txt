Volkswagen is an extremely popular brand now.<p>&gt; German Autobahn(super highways) was introduced in Hitler&#x27;s era.<p>&gt; Hitler had forbade German army from using mustard gas or any sort of chemical weapons on enemy forces because of the trauma he suffered in WW1 from mustard gas. As a result, deadly gas warfare of WW 1 was never seen in WW 2.<p>&gt; Nazis were pioneers in rocket science.
