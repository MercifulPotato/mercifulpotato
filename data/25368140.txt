If you think of a tech company and then roughly invert the proportions of engineers vs. office managers and HR, you will have some sense of it.  To first order, it will be a lot less autonomy than you&#x27;re probably used to, and at a much more concrete level of direction.  There is a sharp delta in the amount of paperwork, sometimes understandably and sometimes not.  An admin that will run interference for you on those fronts, or simply not interfere <i>with</i> you, can make a big difference in QoL points.  &quot;I teach for free and they pay me to do the rest of the job [of which there is an awful lot]&quot; is a pretty common sentiment.<p>I had some very good teachers for whom I&#x27;m grateful.  In retrospect, they gave up a lot in order to teach.  Best of luck with your decision.')
