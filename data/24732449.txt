Item(by='regularfry', descendants=None, kids=[24733035], score=None, time=1602265672, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24728066, text='That paper doesn&#x27;t consider reinfection risk or non-fatal outcomes.<p>There are many problems with the GBD, but the simplest is that <i>we don&#x27;t know who the high-risk groups are</i>.  Yes, we know age and certain categories of pre-existing condition make for higher risk of death.  But we also know that perfectly healthy young people end up with strokes, heart damage, and lung damage, and we&#x27;re not really sure why.  We don&#x27;t know why some people end up with debilitating symptoms months after infection.<p>We don&#x27;t even know if herd immunity is actually possible, or if we&#x27;d be committing ourselves to years of intermittent lockdown controls as local outbreaks come and go.<p>This paper is a similar (if slightly more mathematically detailed) approach, and is more recent: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pnas.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;early&#x2F;2020&#x2F;09&#x2F;21&#x2F;2008087117" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pnas.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;early&#x2F;2020&#x2F;09&#x2F;21&#x2F;2008087117</a>.  It comes to the opposite conclusion.  What they find is that while it&#x27;s technically possible to achieve herd immunity this way, it&#x27;s logistically unfeasible.  It needs monitoring, compliance, and reactiveness that we demonstrably can&#x27;t (or won&#x27;t) implement - if we could, we wouldn&#x27;t be in this mess.<p>Besides which, neither this paper nor that supports any idea that these three are &quot;leading experts&quot;.  As far as I can see they&#x27;re vocal and have a history of being proved wrong by events.')
