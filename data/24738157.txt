Unescaping in place does make it non-trivial.<p>Assuming escapes are rare, backshift unescaping is totally an option, though it scales poorly (interpreting escapes is linear, backshifting is quadratic) and is thus susceptible to slowdowns with malicious inputs. It does need very little code and no extra memory at all, though.')
