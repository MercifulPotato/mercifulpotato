It&#x27;s <i>wild</i> how expensive it is. Like, the regular cheapo milk at the grocery store is $4-5 for 4L, and the Eby Manor milk is $5 for 1L, basically four times the cost.<p>Now, they&#x27;re a small time operation doing a specialty product, so I&#x27;m sure that contributes a lot to this cost bump— they justify this mostly by touting health benefits rather than talking about the sustainability of their operation, but I suspect that getting many animal-based food products to a more sustainable place would require a similarly eye-watering bump up in price. Which is, of course, part of the argument for going part-time vegetarian&#x2F;vegan— get used to the idea of meat and animal products being something we enjoy once or twice a week or a few times a month, rather than multiple times per day.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ebymanor.ca&#x2F;our-family-farm&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ebymanor.ca&#x2F;our-family-farm&#x2F;</a>')
