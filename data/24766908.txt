Just because doing the simplest darn thing gets the job done, doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s the best way to do it.<p>Obviously you chose this solution because it made the most sense given your constraints (time&#x2F;money&#x2F;knowledge&#x2F;microcontroller limitations). But that doesn&#x27;t mean it was an optimal solution nor that with slightly more time&#x2F;money&#x2F;knowledge a significantly better solution couldn&#x27;t have been found.')
