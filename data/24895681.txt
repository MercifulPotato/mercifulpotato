Item(by='macspoofing', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603717329, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24895590, text='&gt;This is simply not true<p>That is exactly true.<p>&gt;All of the rights that corporations have stem from a public-interest grant by the state.<p>That&#x27;s right. But that&#x27;s missing half the equation. If property rights weren&#x27;t enshrined to corporations, and corporations could be arbitrarily raided by any two-bit socialist politician, nobody would incorporate. And those property rights come from the property rights of the owners because if the owners own the corporations, and if the corporations property rights are violated, then it follows the owners property rights are violated. If I own a corporation, that owns a local business (maybe a grocery store, or a autobody shop), and a looter steals from the store, I, the owner lose. Remember those videos of store owners in tears when looters and rioters destroyed their stores - some (all?) of those business owners are incorporated, so why are they in tears if it&#x27;s just corporate property that was affected??????')
