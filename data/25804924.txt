You have extremely valid criticism, and I appreciate your writing them.<p>I loved the nation, when I lived there, and it had a profound impact on my life. Leaving was heartbreaking. I have &quot;survivors&#x27; guilt&quot; from that, as I suspect that all the kids I used to play with were probably killed. I still have items with bayonet holes in them, from when the soldiers were making sure that my father wasn&#x27;t smuggling out his students (who were all killed). I sincerely wish you well in your continued growth and success. It has been worse.<p>Idi Amin and Milton Obote killed around a million folks; from the end of colonialism, through the mid 1970s. I remember -extremely well- public executions in the park in Kampala.<p>I also remember how rich, cosmopolitan and modern the nation was, in 1972, and how it collapsed -almost overnight- after Amin kicked out the Asians. From what I see, it has never regained that stature. It was in really good shape, pre-Amin. The income from tea, alone, made it the richest country in East Africa. The rich, volcanic soil, meant that you could grow almost anything there. It also has vast mineral wealth (my mother was a geologist, and I remember touring mines in the Southwestern part of the country). I still have samples of ore from those mines on my shelf.<p>The LRA has probably been the most horrifying thing for me.<p>You have my thanks and support. Good luck, and Godspeed.')
