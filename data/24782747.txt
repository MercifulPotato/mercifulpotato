Every other company uses it with LIDAR.\nIt may be hubris, but I simply cannot see how vision alone will be sufficient to solve self-driving.<p>This is especially true in heavy rains, snow and any driving condition that doesn&#x27;t follow the nicest of layouts like the Bay Area. This means that occlusion will stay unsolved by definition. Even if it works out one day, my intuition is that 3D maps &#x2F; LIDAR self-driving is going to be ready sooner than that, purely due to having richer data.<p>Also, from what I know, (very little but) Tesla isn&#x27;t THE company landing top self-driving and vision talent. They seem to be going to Waymo, Uber, Apple and Nvidia instead. Additionally, while I deeply respect Andrej Karpathy, he simply doesn&#x27;t have the same research credentials as some of the distinguished professors who lead the other groups.<p>3D self-driving labs are all building on each other&#x27;s work, as the cost of GPUs and LIDAR sensors has dropped by orders of magnitude over the last decade. Cameras and sensors on the other hand remain more or less where they were 10 years ago, and Tesla is left alone to compete with everyone else.')
