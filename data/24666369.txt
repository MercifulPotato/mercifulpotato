The next day was fever that lasted till the thursday (august 29th). On the next day (30th august) I was feeling good, though that that was the end. Oh boy how I was wrong. Later on the same day I&#x27;ve had issues with breathing, friday night was nightmare with short shallow breathing and fever, that scared me a lot, never feel that way. I&#x27;ve gad few times pneumonia when I was a kid, but this was next level. The next day was better, so I didn&#x27;t call an ambulance as they were already overwhelmed, but got to the hospital by myself and did the test with positive result. On the monday (september 2nd) I started coughing a lot, but the next day was much worse. With tuesday I started having headaches, dizziness and ear ache.. Coughing, headaches and dizziness lasted more than a week, with better and worse days.<p>It was the worst experience of the last few years, and it started with loss of smell an taste.')
