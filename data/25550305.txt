Item(by='brabel', descendants=None, kids=[25555033, 25550601], score=None, time=1609068212, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25548109, text='I have a similar life, though without the part of a broken home at childhood (parents fought but not out of ordinary I think). It&#x27;s really hard not being able to visit family often, at most once a year (if you&#x27;re lucky and if there&#x27;s no pandemics stopping you!).<p>The hardest part for me is that my wife doesn&#x27;t like my family, so she refuses to visit them... as half the family lives in one country and half in another, and we&#x27;re in yet another country, it&#x27;s almost impossible for us to unite the whole family. My parents never met hers... and I only met my brother&#x27;s youngest child when she was already 5. Last time I went to visit my parents I went alone... and again last time I went to visit my brother (who lives on the other side of the planet from my parents - I live almost in the middle). Sometimes I wish I hadn&#x27;t started the wave of moving to some other country (which my sister, then my brother followed years later)... as they moved to the country I&#x27;d been in, I had already moved again to another country because of my wife. Now I am finally planning to have kids (quite late but still time) I wonder how we&#x27;re going to manage without any family nearby... and how my parents will feel when we never come to visit... that&#x27;s if I convince the wife to get a kid, we&#x27;re running out of time quickly and she doesn&#x27;t seem at all bothered by it.<p>I&#x27;m in a position I must make a decision: perhaps go back to my country and get a new wife there (even though I would hate to go through a divorce) close to at least some of my family... or just let the time pass by and wait for the inevitable, letting old age arrive and die without a family on a strange country. How can I know what to do?! Leaving this great country where I am will probably be the biggest mistake I will ever make (I have a good job, great house and extreme social security here - none of which I would have in my own country), but staying here will likely lead to a meaningless, though comfortable life. What would you do?')
