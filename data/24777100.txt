Late-generation games often benefit from better optimisation, and things like more cartridge space. The Master System port of Mortal Kombat, for instance, despite being pretty horrible as a game, is miraculous from a technical point of view. Despite being heavily cut-down, of course, it was an attempt to create the same game. That&#x27;s a port (or demake or whatever else you&#x27;d want to call it) of a 1992 <i>arcade cabinet</i>, onto a home console released in 1985.')
