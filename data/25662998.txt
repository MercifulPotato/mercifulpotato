The dishonest, mendacious bias in favor of any media source&#x27;s ideological preference was extreme to a degree that even today isn&#x27;t readily visible. Certain media empires were absolutely ruled by their owners and even major papers like the New York Times were often loaded in slant towards certain ideological narratives. Just to name one example: Read about Walter Duranty. Things were even more vicious in the 19th century....  I have no idea where this notion of once fair, objective news sources comes from but it&#x27;s certainly not rooted in the practical reality (referring in all of this to U.S media and politics, regarding other countries things get more ambiguous and complciated probably).')
