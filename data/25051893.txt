We&#x27;d like this to be useful for general OLAP workloads, but the focus for the next year is definitely going to be on our bread and butter time series stuff.<p>That being said, Arrow Flight will be a first class RPC mechanism, which makes it quite nice for data science stuff as you can get data in to a dataframe in Pandas or R in a few lines of code and with almost zero serialization&#x2F;deserialization overhead.<p>This isn&#x27;t meant to be a transactional system. More like a data processing system for data in object storage. I&#x27;m curious what your need is there for OLAP workloads, can you tell me more?')
