Anyway, a decent consumer grade 500GiB SSD that will give you ~5GiB&#x2F;s is in the ~$100 ballpark. If you take an io1 or io2 volume and crank up the IOPS you will get at most 1&#x2F;5th of that throughput, but burn through this budget in 2 or 3 days. Even with fairly modest IOPS, you would have amortized a much faster physical drive in single digit number of weeks. With io2 at least you get (in theory) better durability (and a few other goodies) than with a normal SSD, but the price and performance differential is still enormous -- I often wonder what fraction of companies with massive cloud spends have anyone in the approval loop who has an inkling of what premiums they are paying over &quot;normal hardware&quot;.')
