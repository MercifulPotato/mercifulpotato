You don&#x27;t seem understand how difficult the average rural person has it because the country runs on cash.<p>I have worked in Micro finance in India ~2010-2013. I have spent some time studying and trying to solve this problem. The logistical challenges  to provide banking for smaller communities is immense and costly. Despite government owning 69% of the banking sector and having mandates for unprofitable rural branches.<p>Microfinance was getting demand despite predatory interest &gt;24% ? Why? Because there are no viable competitors offering less with less friction. Traditional loan sharks charge even more. State Banks and various coops are inefficient in their processes. Banks need a lot of documentation starting from PAN, salary and deeds which only landowners have, The banks are so far off physically for the rural workers, even if they <i>could</i> get financing the risk of multiple days of wages lost is too mush.<p>Most banks expect you show to regular income to get any kind of loan. If your bank is 10 km away and you make wages daily&#x2F;weekly, it is not feasible to deposit and withdraw cash every time you need to, you are <i>never going to be approved for the loan</i>.<p>Indian banking system is simply not working for rural poor users, expecting a daily wage worker or NREGA beneficiary  to go 10+ KM to withdraw cash from an ATM that they cannot read instructions is not viable. The traditional model of having middle men disburse cash is extremely corrupt and actual beneficiary gets a small fraction of the money.<p>Yes smart phone penetration is less ( although I suspect it is bit more than you say, given the number of WhatsApp users in India)<p>If we need a chance in hell to be able to service poorer part of the country, banking needs to be <i>cheap</i> and that is not going to happen at a branch and it has paperless as possible.<p>Cash is an expensive luxury the country cannot afford.')
