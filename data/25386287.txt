That means it doesn&#x27;t get much attention from Linux kernel developers.<p>In turn, the implementation is rather poor.  For example, it is impossible to suspend any machine while any ssh directory is mounted.  It&#x27;s been a bug for 10+ years.  The bug is architectural and pretty much impossible to fix (Any file or directory read hangs on the SSH connection, and a process can&#x27;t be paused for hibernation while a non-restartable syscall is running.)<p>While this kind of architectural bug exists, Linux hibernation will never be good.  Fixing that bug properly is probably $500k worth of developer resources.  Nobody wants to pay.')
