Personal computing is supposed to be about user empowerment; the ability for users to not only communicate with other people and to get work done, but to also automate their tasks through programming.  Early personal computing was about achieving this vision, and while it may not have fully attained this vision, companies in the 1980s and 1990s at least made an honest effort toward this goal.  Unfortunately the companies that got rich off of personal computing from the 1980s to the 2000s no longer care about user empowerment.  Unfortunately they&#x27;ve discovered that building platforms that lock users in and restrict their freedoms is quite lucrative.  It is clear to me that the future of commercial computing will be locked-down platforms similar to the situation for smartphones.<p>The question I have is how can we reverse this trend?  I&#x27;ve thought about this a few weeks ago and shared my thoughts at <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;mmcthrow-musings.blogspot.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;where-did-personal-computing-go-wrong.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;mmcthrow-musings.blogspot.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;where-did-perso...</a>.  I am trying in my small way to reverse this trend by building a new FOSS desktop environment that focuses on user empowerment through programmable, component-based software that is inspired by Smalltalk, the Lisp machines of the 1980s, and Apple&#x27;s OpenDoc.  However, user empowerment is more than just having access to software that empowers the user; the hardware must be open enough to allow users to run a wide variety of software without special permission.<p>My dream is to start a company that is dedicated to preserving and improving general-purpose personal computing, as an alternative to commercial platforms.  I&#x27;d like to pick up from where Apple left off in the 1990s, back when Apple had a lot of ideas about how to push the state of the art of personal computing through projects such as HyperCard, Dylan, Copland, and OpenDoc, yet sadly Apple at this time had a difficult time with project management, which led to the purchase of NeXT and Steve Jobs&#x27; retaking of the company.  I also find the work of companies like System76 and Purism inspiring.')
