Work can be a nice place to hide. However the solution is quite straightforward - stop. Work is not crack, it&#x27;s actually pretty easy to not do when you try. Just don&#x27;t do it. 5.30pm and you think about the next thing? Stop. 8pm and you think about opening your laptop? Stop. 6am and you think about getting up and looking at some code? Stop. If you are trying to hide in work it&#x27;s probably not work that is the issue.')
