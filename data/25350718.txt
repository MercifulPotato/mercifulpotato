It&#x27;s a sad cycle for the early customers who gravitated toward Etsy and similar shops because they were looking for an escape from the cheap products found elsewhere. Not sure how to structure the business model or incentives to prevent this, other than just being small and staying small. (i.e. not taking VC money, not going public, not inviting outside pressure to grow).')
