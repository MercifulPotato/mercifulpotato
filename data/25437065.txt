I think the game looks bad (with playable settings) and hasn&#x27;t been compelling enough for me to sink that much time into it, while the missions are pretty grindy.<p>I&#x27;d say play GTA V and the Witcher 3 for a comparison in immersive open world story telling and high caliber graphics. I haven&#x27;t played Spiderman (2018, 2020) but in gameplay footage (which is only on console) it looks much better as well.<p>I feel like I&#x27;m crazy when I say that the graphics are incredibly underwhelming. It looks good, and there&#x27;s neat stuff. But I don&#x27;t care how pretty a shadow looks when the hundreds of NPCs walking around look so rough.')
