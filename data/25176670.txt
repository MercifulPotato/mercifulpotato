I find some click-baitey feeling stuff there too. I get so frustrated every time someone links a NYT article on HN that gets paywalled, and I either decide it’s not worth reading or I find a way around it.<p>I like what Substack is doing, personally, and have subscribed to a couple of journalists I like there. But it’s still missing something... like, editors. It also doesn’t make it easy for me to find new journalists I’d like to follow, and if I was <i>only</i> using substack, I’d have a very incomplete picture of what’s going on in the world.')
