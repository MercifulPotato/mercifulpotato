But that isn&#x27;t what we are talking about, you ventured into strawman territory all on your own. The person was claiming they&#x27;ve never seen a truthful source, this is called the No True Scotsman fallacy. We&#x27;re not talking about god, we&#x27;re talking about the fact that some journalism is unbiased. There is much of it out there, but OP seems to think there isn&#x27;t, or has convinced him&#x2F;herself due to their own desire to not be wrong.<p>Strike two.<p>&gt; can follow a reasonable, logical, defensible chain of trust from what I can directly prove to myself, to proofs I can accept indirectly, and distinguish those from fairy tales.<p>You&#x27;ve demonstrated that you aren&#x27;t very good at following a &quot;logical chain of trust&quot; because you&#x27;ve reasoned to yourself, poorly, something that wasn&#x27;t even being discussed.<p>Strike three.<p>First time playing with logic?<p>It never ceases to astonish me how people who throw around the terms &quot;logic&quot; and &quot;rational thought&quot; really, reeeeeally don&#x27;t know how to deploy either.')
