This project was started when Swing was slow and ugly so SWT probably seemed fresh. Also, having a native L&amp;F was important in those days.<p>We had tons of problems and they where almost never easy to fix. Layouting in SWT is hard. Custom widgets are hard. SWT did not play nice with Swing&#x2F;AWT on Linux so it would crash if you needed to use both. I remember I spent <i>a lot</i> of time getting automated testing working reliably (on mac) but eventually just gave up.<p>Things might have improved since I worked on this 7 years ago but I would not bet on it. SWT is basically a support library for Eclipse and therefore Eclipse is more or less the sole driver for any development.<p>I would rather just use Swing. Compared to when SWT was started Swing has evolved <i>a lot</i> and IMO the rationale for going with SWT does not exist anymore.')
