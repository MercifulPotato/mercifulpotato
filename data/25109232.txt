According to dlgeek there are 893 satellites up right now [1]. If we grow to 10x that number, and each satellite can do 20Gbit (where is that number from, btw?), how do we begin to provide that throughout, whatever fraction of that max 2.2Tbit&#x2F;s aggregate downlink for the satellite fleet? What is it going to take to literally uplink such huge volumes? I&#x27;m not well versed in satcom &amp; how much spectrum is available, &amp; how good ground stations are at pointing. Can one base station potentially fully saturate 10 or 50 or 250 satellites, once the sky starts to fill? Maybe we are that good, maybe we can shoot tiny narrow high-bandwidth wide-spectrum needles exactly as needed up into the sky, en masse, dozens of high bandwidth beams emmentating from each ground station. Or maybe we just need millions of ground stations, but can work that.<p>Does even that work? I keep hearing of &quot;constellations,&quot; trains of satellites. How close will satellites stick? Can a ground station reuse spectrum across multiple transmitters seen talking to constellation members? or are the satellites too close, lumped together? this filters back to a previous question, how much spectrum is available for uplinks?<p>Trying to imagine the scale of this project, seeing both how we get data to in to the sky, then down to folks, it&#x27;s epic. All the &quot;zero to one, one to many&quot; modes of growth discussion feels short of the epic planning &amp; demands it&#x27;d take to both hoist satellites up (which SpaceX Starlink seems to be doing!) &amp; the supply network to make the satellites useful.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25109020" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25109020</a>')
