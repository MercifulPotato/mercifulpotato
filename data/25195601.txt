I use it on a small-medium Python project (100-200 files) every day and have never had any performance problems whatsoever. I did use the MyPy language server at first, which would take a few seconds to update type errors because MyPy wasn&#x27;t designed for IDEs. But the UI thread remained responsive during that time. Eventually I switched to the Pylance language server which doesn&#x27;t do a perfect job with checks, but gives feedback instantly.<p>How big is your project, and how big are your files? I&#x27;ve had massive JSON files (100MB or so) cause some <i>slight</i> jank in the UI, but that&#x27;s about the only example I can think of.')
