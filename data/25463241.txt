These in particular are more akin to saying:<p>&quot;hey this protective outer barrier did it&#x27;s job, had a scratch on the shipping label, and successfully protected the contents. The contents were IN PERFECT CONDITION, 1 star review!!! CONSUMER RIGHTS!11!11!!1 REFUND NOW DAMAGED BOX&quot;<p>The real weird part though; is how the outer packaging regardless of the quality of what is inside the box (their actual goods purchased) dominates their reviews. It&#x27;s like a whole subculture, or something, I can&#x27;t even begin to understand. The internet never ceases to to amaze me for the sheer breadth of absurdity one can find.')
