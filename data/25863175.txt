The police then swear the person is a danger to themselves and&#x2F;or others. The person is committed, short-term, for evaluation. During this evaluation process, the person refuses to follow prescribed treatments; in an underfunded facility this treatment is generally accompanied by powerful psychoactive drugs, that most people, especially naturally difficult people, will refuse. Then comes long-term care.<p>Now, I know it&#x27;s not the context of a judge ordering it, but it really isn&#x27;t that difficult to do.<p>Source: you wouldn&#x27;t believe the things I have seen in my career in higher education. Some people and especially controlling families are truly, absolutely, evil.')
