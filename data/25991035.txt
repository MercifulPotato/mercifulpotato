Even if they&#x27;re not always super relevant to you and only you.<p>Respectful advertising will always have its place whenever the buyer has a choice. It&#x27;s when the companies selling those ads learn how to manipulate their audience that the &#x27;respectful&#x27; parts of the equation get dropped and consumers start to push back.<p>My Kindle shows me ads. I could pay to opt out, but I actually like the way it handles them. My (former) Alexa on the other hand was IN MY FACE with ads whenever I wanted to even just set a timer. That is grossly disrespectful of me as a human being, so it was shown the door.')
