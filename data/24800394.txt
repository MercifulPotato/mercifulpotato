One is the technology itself. The second is how that technology affects the world. Between the two (1.5) is a lot of ambiguity, whenever anyone tries to &quot;score&quot; Ray.<p>EG <i>Displays will be built into our eyeglasses.</i> Tech that essentially exists but hasn&#x27;t yet become widespread or impactful yet. Sometimes tech <i>does</i> become widespread &amp; impactful, but we still predict impacts wrong.<p>PCs have been on every desk for 25 years. But, administration (to the extent that measurement is possible) seems to have gotten less efficient. HR departments, schools, etc need more administrators today than before PCs. Weird considering PCs are paperwork efficiency machines.<p>Meanwhile, dating and social life have been radically transformed by personal computing.<p>A lecture hall, library and university are notably inferior (eg you can pause the lecture) when digitised, yet Harvard is still Harvard. Even a local college is still the local college. Universities are persistent despite their most legible reasons raison d&#x27;etres becoming nonessentials.<p>When I was in college, &quot;Keynes&#x27; 15 hr workweek prediction for the 80s&quot; really fascinated me. He was right, on paper, in his efficiency&#x2F;growth assumptions. I felt that the professor&#x27;s explanation for why the prediction failed (people decided to keep working lots and buy more stuff instead of chillin) totally unsatisfactory.<p>&quot;Why history didn&#x27;t work out this way&quot; seemed a much better basis for understanding the past than post fact theorizing of traditional economics. Lets take theory and its predictions and see why it failed. Often, I think the projected premises turn out correct, but their impacts do not. Demonstrates what we do and don&#x27;t have a grasp on.')
