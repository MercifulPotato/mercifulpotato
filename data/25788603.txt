They add too little to warrant the effort (moderation, attention, spam etc). So i&#x27;m probably not your user.<p>Having bootstrapped a WordPress hosting corp, I can only advise you to seek that demography too. I&#x27;m certain many WP-blogs would gladly switch to static site (WP maintainance and performance is terrible) if their interaction features remain intact.<p>Maybe consider &quot;wordpress migration&quot; as a feature. For example.')
