IANAL.<p>- NY state will have the ability to order the detainment of individuals (EDIT: or groups &#x2F; classes of individuals) if it&#x27;s decided they pose an &quot;imminent + significant threat to public health resulting in severe morbidity or high mortality&quot;.<p>- Individuals are detained in a medical facility or a facility&#x2F;premises designed by the governor<p>- If ordered to be detained for more than 3 business days, and the detainee requests to be released, the state will submit an expedited court order to continue detainment. The court order must be granted within 5 business days after the detainee&#x27;s request, otherwise they are released. If detained less than 3 business days, they are &quot;afforded an opportunity to be heard&quot; (not sure what that actually means)<p>- Individuals with a confirmed case can no longer be detained if they are not contagious. If there&#x27;s no confirmed case, they can&#x27;t be detained if they will not become contagious in the future or if the state determines they will not pose a risk to public health<p>- Expanded power of the state to create and enforce new orders, such as (but not limited to) requiring testing &#x2F; medical evaluation of individuals who are thought to be exposed &#x2F; infected. Also allows them to force preventative measures such as a vaccine, but with the caveat there must be a court order if administration must be done forcibly.<p>- The above powers only apply during a declared &quot;State of Health Emergency&quot; due to an epidemic')
