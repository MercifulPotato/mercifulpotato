If I&#x27;m merging a feature branch that has a lot of commits that effectively make up one feature (because a dev had to go back and forth or because there was a lot of feedback), I might squash those commits into one before I merge it into master.<p>As mentioned elsewhere in the comments here, that also makes it a lot easier to revert said feature if something goes wrong.')
