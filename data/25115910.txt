American discourse uses &quot;right wing&quot; and &quot;left wing&quot; frequently and broadly, someone saying they&#x27;re &quot;right wing&quot; does not mean they are &quot;far right&quot; or extreme or anything like that. Particularly in the context of the original poster, it&#x27;s a common idiom to state something like &quot;I&#x27;m generally left-wing, but I think &lt;insert opposing view on some issue&gt;&quot; as a very clearly centrist person.')
