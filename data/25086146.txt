It&#x27;s okay to provide an explanation as long as you&#x27;re not excusing the thing you did was wrong. For example:<p>&quot;I apologize for shouting at you. I was short on sleep and frustrated about something else. I was wrong to take out my frustration on you.&quot;<p>vs:<p>&quot;I apologize for shouting at you but I was tired and frustrated.&quot;<p>An explanation can make the apology stronger because it demonstrates that you realize what it is you&#x27;re apologizing for.')
