Residual magnetic fields release energy if the metal is demagnetised. Etc...<p>Meanwhile, measuring the production of new elements is <i>trivial</i>, even in tiny amounts, and cannot possibly occur via only chemical processes. Crystal structure, phase transitions, external fields, etc... have no effect on this measurement. It is a simple, reliable, accurate measurement.<p>If you see a scientist insisting that you pay attention to the unreliable metric and waves his hands to explain why you should ignore the reliable metric then it&#x27;s a safe bet that he&#x27;s either fooling you, or he fooled himself.')
