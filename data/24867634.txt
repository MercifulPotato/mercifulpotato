Already the case. My bank account in Portugal just got frozen 2 days ago for trying to buy crypto through Coinbase (we&#x27;re talking about less than 100 EUR transaction here). This involved transferring money to an Estonian account, which according to support is &quot;a blacklisted country&quot; (even though it&#x27;s an EU member state and an attractive European country for tech related businesses). I tried transferring money from my other EU fintech bank accounts which worked perfectly fine and almost instantly (so the blacklist excuse is bs). I still can&#x27;t access my funds in that account 2 days later. Computer says no. Support can&#x27;t help. I&#x27;m strongly suspecting this has nothing to do with Estonia and everything to do with banks not liking crypto.<p>So for everybody who wonders what problems crypto currencies are solving?
