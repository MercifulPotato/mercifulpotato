You can even have a section in the document which contains chunks of code in different languages and how they interact. For example, one chunk could be a part of the render function of a React component, the next chunk could be the Flask API endpoint which generates the data displayed by the component.<p>Literate programming has its problems, and it is made less necessary with modern languages and tools, but I&#x27;ve repeatedly had the experience where it was LP that allowed me to return to a project after a few months and know exactly what was going on and where to continue.')
