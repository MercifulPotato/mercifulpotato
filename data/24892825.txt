At different stages in their lives, people do different things.  Make music.  take photos, and wonder why they suck. Make family trees.  Various hobbies, that require working with multiple bits of sotware on on multiple projects.<p>Take electronics. It&#x27;s a hobby. It&#x27;s nuts to use apps that each store their data in their own sandbox. One app to draw a schematic diagram, another app to plan the hardware layout, another app to record calibrations and test results, another for photos--and other apps to record the project goals and plans, and the lessons learned.<p>If I couldn&#x27;t use a general purpose computer and store all of these files (and others, such as manufacturers&#x27; datasheets for critical components) in a <i>single folder for each project</i> (not part in one app, and another bit in aonther app, and so on), I&#x27;d be using paper, a drawing board and a filing cabinet.')
