The issue is that living for cheap takes time.<p>&gt;It takes prep work to turn cheap vegetables into something edible<p>The thing is, it saves money and time. I&#x27;ve been working late so I started getting into the habit of ordering food most nights for the last month or so. It was costing me $30-40&#x2F;night.<p>The last couple weekends I actually put the effort in to make some things that&#x27;ll last the week.<p>For $40 worth of vegetables and meat I made meals that lasted me most of the week, that were by far healthier than what I was ordering and cost me significantly less.<p>Learning to cook well does take time. But it&#x27;s easier than ever to learn now. \nAnything you ever want to make has a recipe available online somewhere and I have to say, if you can program a computer, you can learn to follow a recipe.<p>Once you can follow recipes well and make them taste good, you start to learn what flavours different ingredients add to food and how things cook you can start to step away from the recipes.<p>Most cooking really just comes down to using the correct heat and putting things in in the correct order at the right time. Once you get that down, you can make anything.<p>&gt;Then comes the education problem. It&#x27;s hard enough figuring out what a &quot;healthy&quot; diet is even with internet access<p>Forget that shit, healthy diets blah blah. You need some protein, you need some fats, the vitamins and minerals and stuff in vegetables, some fiber.<p>Basically, you want to eat the stuff our bodies are made of and avoid things it&#x27;s not made of. If it doesn&#x27;t have some function in our cellular processes, it&#x27;s garbage. Avoid processed stuff, stuff full of chemicals and additives.<p>Obviously, it&#x27;s tough to avoid all stuff like that, but minimizing that stuff and eating things that come directly from plants or animals goes a long way to improving your health.')
