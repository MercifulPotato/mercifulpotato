In KDE, we did something very similar 3-4 months ago with moving most of our development tutorials from various sources (wikis, old pdf book, ...) to a new Hugo based documentation platform at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;develop.kde.org&#x2F;docs" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;develop.kde.org&#x2F;docs</a><p>The problem was that our documentation was bit rotting in the wiki and the previous mediaWiki wasn&#x27;t working so well for having consistent formatting across pages, reviewing changes and organizing the content.<p>Using the new Hugo based software, we now have a few very helpful macros to add links to Doxygen based documentation, include snippets of code from the library repository and automatic generation of navbars and the navigation.<p>And we also get with Gitlab web editor an easy way for people to contribute. It is still like before one click away to edit the content.<p>I probably should blog about it one day, but if someone want to check it out: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;invent.kde.org&#x2F;documentation&#x2F;develop-kde-org" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;invent.kde.org&#x2F;documentation&#x2F;develop-kde-org</a>.')
