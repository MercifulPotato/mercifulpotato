These may be described generally with language like &quot;speed of light&quot; but they were described specifically and tested using math and science. And at this point, these are probably the most thoroughly tested and proven principles in science, since they underpin everything from cosmology to quantum mechanics to chemistry (and by extension biology) and a lot of our modern technology such as satellites (which have to take special relativity into account) and microchip design, for which quantum effects are relevant.<p>[0]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Special_relativity" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Special_relativity</a><p>[1]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Speed_of_light" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Speed_of_light</a><p>[2]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.pa.msu.edu&#x2F;courses&#x2F;2000fall&#x2F;phy232&#x2F;lectures&#x2F;emwaves&#x2F;maxwell.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.pa.msu.edu&#x2F;courses&#x2F;2000fall&#x2F;phy232&#x2F;lectures&#x2F;emwa...</a>')
