The bracketed subquery doesn&#x27;t have a name but it&#x27;s apparnetly called &#x27;users&#x27; because the last clause is &#x27;ORDER BY users.id desc&#x27; - but that&#x27;s illegal. Again tsql correctly rejects that (once I comment out the illegal inner order by).<p>Edit 2: sorry about this but FYI, I&#x27;d expect the inner sort order to be disregarded anyway, and assuming this is mysql it explicitly is.<p>&quot;If ORDER BY occurs within a parenthesized query expression and also is applied in the outer query, the results are undefined and may change in a future MySQL version&quot;<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dev.mysql.com&#x2F;doc&#x2F;refman&#x2F;5.7&#x2F;en&#x2F;select.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dev.mysql.com&#x2F;doc&#x2F;refman&#x2F;5.7&#x2F;en&#x2F;select.html</a><p>(Actually, what the heck is it saying? An outer order by in the presence of an inner order by is undefined overall??)')
