Packed full of advanced features like ability to change what calorie &#x2F; basal metabolic rate calculations were used, export of the data locally &#x2F; dropbox, export to google fit + strava etc., no dependency on Xiaomi&#x27;s servers. Closed source, though. But appears to be one single persons personal project.<p>Those products are awesome if you want a lower-end fitness tracker. Originally I bought a Mi Band 4 because I saw it reported itself as a bluetooth HR accessory, meaning you could get continuous heart rate on bluetooth if you paired your device -- whereas FitBit&#x27;s protocol was encrypted and proprietary. Did some cool stuff with that (a shirt with an LED matrix screen that pulsed at the wearers heart rate!)<p>Wouldn&#x27;t say the hardware is &quot;vastly better&quot;, I found the continuous heart rate monitoring to be a bit sluggish -- i.e. it averaged out HR over a longer period than the fitbits I&#x27;ve had did, so you were less likely to detect the peaks and recovery periods during excercise. Otherwise it was much of a muchness, but cheaper. I imagine the cheaper HW probably meant corners were cut with the sensors and firmware, but being hardly the athlete I didn&#x27;t care outside of heart rate sensing.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;apps&#x2F;details?id=com.mc.miband1&amp;hl=en_GB&amp;gl=US" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;apps&#x2F;details?id=com.mc.miband1...</a>')
