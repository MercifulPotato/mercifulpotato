What I am missing out on?<p>I&#x27;m no stranger to Web tech, including JS on the browser and on the server side.  It&#x27;s hell compared to native App development using the native technologies.<p>I mean, it&#x27;s so bad that the tutorials explaining the project setup phase can be hours long to follow.  Scripts running in the background just to keep you in check and let you write more readable code that is no where as good as Swift(linter, transcompilers, packers oh god &gt;:( ).<p>When Xcode misbehaves, I would clean the build folder or restart it and everything is back to normal.<p>It has been a few years since I did something for the web but please let me know if you have a magical IDE or a script or something that lets you do work on you actual code with no janitorial work. Did JS world become considerably better in the last years? Did npm swamp dried out?')
