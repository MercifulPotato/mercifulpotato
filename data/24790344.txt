I like the work&#x2F;life separation going into the office brings. I actually liked my commute since I took the bus, so it was time to read and decompress. I like seeing and talking to my coworkers. I like having the variety of simply being out of the house. I like not having work stuff at home, so when I&#x27;m home, I don&#x27;t have the temptation to do work. I&#x27;m glad WFH works for so many people, but it sure does not work for me.')
