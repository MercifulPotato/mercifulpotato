You only get about 1000 IU&#x27;s of D3 synthesis per hour for type 3 skin, 2000 IU&#x27;s for types 1 and 2 skin and that is assuming decent body exposure.  It is even lower with type 4 and 5 skin.  Most people in that latitude have types 3 and 4 skin.  D3 is also measured incorrectly.  Medical facilities measure 25-hydroxy which is not showing how much is then converted by the kidneys to 1 25-dihydroxy, the active form of the D3 hormone.  People with diabetes and pre-diabetes can&#x27;t convert the 25 hydroxy as efficiently thus needing higher intake.  People with kidney damage can&#x27;t convert the 25 hydroxy to 1 25-dihydroxy as effeciently.  Diabetes and insulin resistance can cause dysfunction in the kidneys.  About 80 million Americans are pre-diabetic [1] and about 77% of them don&#x27;t even know it.  Here [2] is some further discussion on that topic which believe it or not, ties into deficiencies in many nutrients but that is a bigger topic for another thread.<p>[1] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;media&#x2F;releases&#x2F;2017&#x2F;p0718-diabetes-report.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;media&#x2F;releases&#x2F;2017&#x2F;p0718-diabetes-repor...</a><p>[2] -  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;5LTWJOi3bCo?t=3" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;5LTWJOi3bCo?t=3</a> [video] skipping rude intro')
