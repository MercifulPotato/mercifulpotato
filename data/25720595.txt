It gets merely a 1.4x speedup over the 5950X despite having four times the core count. (Granted, the 5950X core is somewhat better).<p>Geekbench isn&#x27;t terribly useful at the best of times. It&#x27;s particularly bad when comparing across architectures and operating systems. And, as should be clear, its multithreaded test does not scale linearly with core count. You should never take the ratio between two scores to mean the ratio between performance, especially when comparing multithreaded scores with different core counts.')
