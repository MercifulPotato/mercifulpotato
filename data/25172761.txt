One issue with the &quot;wait until they are a larger share of the market&quot; argument is trying to add a tax gets harder the more people are used to not paying it. The earlier you introduce it the easier it should be.<p>EVs clearly use roads and should pay to use them. Yes ICE vehicles have serious side effects, and we should encourage a switch. But it shouldn&#x27;t have to be by giving EVs a free ride. A carbon tax would discourage both CO2 emitting cars, and the coal power generators that make up the majority of Victoria&#x27;s energy generation.<p>Note: I live in Victoria, but don&#x27;t drive an EV (yet).')
