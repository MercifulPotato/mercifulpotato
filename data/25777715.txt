Item(by='lesstenseflow', descendants=None, kids=[25778432, 25777815], score=None, time=1610639147, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25777635, text='There&#x27;s a lot of space between &quot;what violates the law&quot; (or explicit ios&#x2F;play store Terms of Use for that matter) and &quot;what will get you kicked off twitter&quot; and I believe Parler operated in that space. Users could post stuff that would get them booted off twitter, but that was legal speech. This was fine with iOS &amp; play store &amp; AWS until they all <i>simultaneously</i> and <i>independently</i> (wink wink) realized it violated their terms of use. Unless we grant that this had nothing to do with newly discovered terms of use violations, it was crushing Parler in reaction to a change in the political winds (read: this is what happened).')
