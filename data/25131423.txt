I did act more conservatively by only making a bet when it made sense given all 3 versions of 538s&#x27; model.<p>ROI around 12% (not including 5% withdrawl fee). Expect it to go a few points higher given that called elections are still trading at 90c, but PredictIt won&#x27;t close due to ongoing litigation.')
