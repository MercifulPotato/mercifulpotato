If I needed to take bigger loads, zipcar + 10 minute drive. No landscaping but I can chill on my backyard with a garden behind my brownstone. If I really wanted to make furniture out there I could probably manage. For smaller pieces of wood, I can pick from 4-5 hardware stores in a 10 minute walk radius.')
