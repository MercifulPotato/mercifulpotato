Rolling out new TCP options is a decade-long process, and if anything goes wrong with the initial design, once it is shipping you&#x27;re basically never fixing it. Applications are much easier to update than operating systems, auto-update for the vast majority of users, and for the &lt;1% who don&#x27;t update the app can always fall back to TCP.<p>(E.g. the rationale for TOU, now-dead Facebook&#x27;s UDP-based transport explicitly stated userspace-only deployability as requirement. They needed a solution for all their other requirements to be deployed in 2015, not with a consensus design approved in 2020 and in wide deployement in 2025.)<p>The middle-box driven ossification happened by making things harder. The OS upgrade driven ossification happened by reducing&#x2F;delaying the payoff.')
