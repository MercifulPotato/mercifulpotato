Prior to the iPhone, Symbian was the dominant &quot;smartphone&quot; OS in Europe, or at least competitive with Blackberry, but the carriers shut Nokia out of the high-end phone market in America. I think Elop&#x27;s strategy was to win over the American carriers&#x2F;market but the strategy backfired and accelerated the exodus to iPhone&#x2F;Android in Europe while not gaining a foothold elsewhere.<p>Apple left the door open for one or more alternative smartphone vendors. Nokia and Blackberry dropped the ball and Google filled the gap with Android that Verizon marketed splendidly. I&#x27;m not sure if Elop&#x27;s strategy could ever have worked but it certainly had no chance when both Nokia&#x27;s employees and customer base resented the approach.<p>I have not read the book so I&#x27;m not sure if my views mesh with what was written there.')
