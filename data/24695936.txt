Item(by='Aozi', descendants=None, kids=[24696070], score=None, time=1601975346, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24695756, text='&gt;How do we solve this problem?<p>We don&#x27;t, we accept that encryption is part of the modern world and learn to live with it. Because there&#x27;s nothing else you can do about it.<p>See encryption is just math, and you can&#x27;t really outlaw or limit how math is used.<p>If we have bad actors who want to encrypt their communication, they absolutely can with or without this bill.<p>Even if Whatsapp&#x2F;Telegram&#x2F;Whatever has to provide the US government with a backdoor to decrypt all messages, anyone can make their own communication platform and simply not give the government a back door. Implementing secure encryption isn&#x27;t difficult and it&#x27;s very easy to research how to accomplish it.<p>Grab a few devs and they can create a simple encrypted messaging app in a few days.<p>You don&#x27;t even need to distribute it through official channels. Android allows you to sideload apps from anywhere and you can jailbreak iPhones to install apps from anywhere. So our bad actors can create secure encrypted communication platforms and distribute them without anyone ever knowing about it.<p>How will this bill prevent that? How will it prevent a few random developers from whipping up their own apps? How will it make it impossible for anyone, anywhere at any time to implement encryption into any app or platform?')
