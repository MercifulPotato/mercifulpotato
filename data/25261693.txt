Item(by='csa', descendants=None, kids=[25265227], score=None, time=1606790621, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25261576, text='I agree with a lot of your comment, and I basically think large swathes of education are just fundamentally broken for a variety of unfortunate reasons.<p>That said, I would like to answer this question:<p>&gt; Why are there still weeding-out classes?<p>In majors that are oversubscribed (e.g., pre-med, CS, etc.), these classes weed out the people who like the <i>idea</i> of the major&#x2F;career more than the actual work involved. Good weeder courses (and I  think that these exist) allow later classes in the major path to be more focused on the capable and motivated learners rather than baby-sitting the less-capable and less-motivated.<p>There are two reasons why this is desirable:<p>1. There is no way that a department could get through the same amount of material if they had to accommodate the less motivated and less capable in all of the courses.<p>2. Your department will get a reputation in the field for having students who are capable of X, Y, and Z.<p>Typically, if someone can&#x27;t make it in the weeder classes at their school and they still want to enter that career path, then maybe it&#x27;s better to go to a less competitive school. This sounds elitist, and maybe it is, but that&#x27;s the workaround in our current system.')
