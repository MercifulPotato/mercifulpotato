So &quot;no one is denying it&quot; seems false. (Feel free to do the search yourself, it&#x27;s easy.)<p>I imagine the candidate himself is not denying it, because even addressing it to defend himself from a totally false accusation turns it into a headline. Which, given the content of these leaks, is obviously the entire point of them.')
