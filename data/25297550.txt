I said &quot;if they aren&#x27;t opting out, there is a force compelling them to be there&quot;.<p>You say &quot;who is forcing them? Why don&#x27;t they quit?&quot; and yet ... they don&#x27;t quit, and you (apparently?) think there is no reason why.<p>I don&#x27;t think the force is a single person or company. I think it&#x27;s the economic and social system we live in has become (intentionally or not) tuned to keep as many people as desperate as it can, because those are the kind of people who will work longer and harder for less money.')
