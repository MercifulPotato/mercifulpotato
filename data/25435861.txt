I think not...<p>A shell script is literally intended to &quot;glue together&quot; external programs, including all of CoreUtils. If you are doing more than just &quot;gluing together&quot; other programs, then you are programming, not scripting, and you&#x27;d be far better off reaching for an actual programming language instead of a shell script of any kind.<p>Python has plenty of warts too. You can&#x27;t depend on it being installed on any given system, can&#x27;t depend on the version even (Python 2.x or 3.x?), which libraries are installed, environment, venv support, etc.')
