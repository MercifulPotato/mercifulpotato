You are talking about the corporation, but does this mean CEOs, managers, or some combination of the two?<p>I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m arguing along those lines at all. What I&#x27;m saying is most CEOs are far removed from anything direct, but I&#x27;m not sure how that translates to &quot;and therefore no one is&quot;.<p>&gt; They should be ultimately responsible for the entire organization<p>I disagree. You don&#x27;t really argue why, and I argue, at least, that it&#x27;s not at all practically. Best case it leads to scapegoating the CEO for things they aren&#x27;t best positioned to control, and&#x2F;or executive-levels micromanaging lower levels for fear of liability.')
