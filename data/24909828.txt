It bleeds into interactions where it&#x27;s completely inappropriate. You want to be uncouth, do it at home in places where there is no possible connection to me or my business. You&#x27;re at this business, then you&#x27;re on your P&#x27;s and Q&#x27;s or you&#x27;re out. Simple as that. Times are already hard enough without throwing nuggetheadedness on top of everything else that&#x27;s losing businesses money and putting employee livelihoods at risk.')
