First configuration options were hidden, then removed.  Window borders became larger, and bloated transitions slowed everything down.  Menus were removed and replaced with incomprehensible drawings with no meaning.  Keyboard shortcuts made non-obvious.  Not at all an improvement over the state of the platform 20 years ago in my opinion when things were much more lightweight and interfaces were more discoverable.  A lot has been lost for desktops in the push for an interface that &quot;works&quot; on tablets.')
