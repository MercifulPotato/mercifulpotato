For example, I&#x27;m very particular on who I let into my life , and won&#x27;t even consider being with anyone making less than 100k. This isn&#x27;t something I need to argue about. I&#x27;ve moved to a city where it&#x27;s much easier to find other high income earners, with fantastic results.<p>What&#x27;s gained by me arguing on Reddit about my own values ? I don&#x27;t care how others live , and no one cares how I live')
