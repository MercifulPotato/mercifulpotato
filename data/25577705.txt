Yes there are competing ideas and some have merit but it&#x27;s important to realise that most of the systems we&#x27;ve had have not work as well as capitalism has.  That is not to say we have the perfect system but it is not the disaster most of its opponents claim it is. As such we should be very careful to make sudden changes in the hope of a utopia, because getting it wrong has a very high price. A price that will cost lives.')
