Additionally there is a wide range of older hardware out there that may not have been engineered with the necessary support (eg enough space to hold two copies of the firmware).<p>But putting all that aside: the new sealed system partition is a step in that direction (ROSP was partially about getting clean separation between the system and user files to make snapshot-based updates possible). With snapshots if the update fails you still have the previous snapshot to fall back on - hopefully that will make these kinds of failures less likely in the future.')
