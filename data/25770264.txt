Such things wouldn&#x27;t scale with 99% of users and usages, but can handle say, five thousand IPv4 users on your ten million customer ISP who mostly visit Facebook and check email.<p>Eventually the long distance traffic for IPv4 is tiny, because there&#x27;s a transition device nearer almost all remaining IPv4 users and that&#x27;s turning their traffic into IPv6 for the long haul anyway.<p>At that point if you&#x27;re a backbone provider, IPv4 is a sizeable cost (the routing tables for it are horrendous) for negligible benefit (hardly any of your traffic) and its future only looks more dismal. So you start deprecating this service for your customers, and they don&#x27;t bother to buy a replacement because they have a transition device to help any residual IPv4 users.<p>And so one day, without a fanfare, there just isn&#x27;t really an IPv4 Internet any more, and the RIRs will just deprecate their management of the numbering for that network because it&#x27;s obsolete.<p>Ideally this is an obscure nerd event, like a leap second, which your friends at first don&#x27;t understand, and then when you explain it they realise it&#x27;s boring and they don&#x27;t care.<p>I hope to live to see it.')
