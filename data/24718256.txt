To speak like a native you need:<p>1. Weeks, possibly months of professional voice coaching to teach your mouth muscles to move in ways that eliminate all trace of an accent.<p>2. Mastery of idiom - learning at least the most popular idioms and knowing when to use them.<p>3. Mastery of social register and nuance - learning the subtle differences in grammar and word choice that indicate social class and educational level and knowing how and when to indicate both.<p>4. Some awareness of regional accents, so you can hear where someone is from.<p>Anyone with a reasonable IQ could master these within a year or two - <i>if they worked on them full-time</i>.<p>But that wouldn&#x27;t leave a lot of time for having a normal life.<p>So probably around half the population never loses the ability to learn a new language with complete fluency. What they lose is the free time to do it, and access to the resources to do it well.<p>Social register can be a huge problem. E.g. UK English is notoriously indirect and passive-aggressive. When someone in a meeting says &quot;I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s a good idea&quot; they often mean &quot;That suggestion is literally idiotic.&quot;<p>Unsurprisingly, foreigners get very, very confused by this.<p>The Dutch on the other hand are far more direct, and English-Dutch meetings can get very... colourful.')
