The EU rules must have their impact in the US because, at least anecdotally, it seems like just about every car&#x27;s speedometer reads 2-3 mph high.<p>There&#x27;s also apparently a rule in the US that requires that the speedometer never read low for commercial vehicles... probably another reason that the same rule gets applied to passenger vehicles, for parts commonality.<p>The speedometer is just based on the rotation of one of the axles, usually via a magnet and reed switch in modern cars. If you do the arithmetic you&#x27;ll find that just tire wear can have a surprisingly large impact on the final speedometer indication, a few percent easily. Presumably if your tires are brand new the speedometer is much closer to accurate.')
