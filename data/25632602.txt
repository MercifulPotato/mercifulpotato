Now your plan is to collectively mutiny against your employer to extort additional control or compensation. \nI’ve always believed that you treat your employer with the respect they garner by supporting you and your family. If you are not satisfied with you income or relationship with your employer go seek other avenues. Just my 2 cents.')
