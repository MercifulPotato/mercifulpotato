And the days of 1.5m social distancing are long gone. It&#x27;s not enforced at all, people walk all over paths and stairs and you have to squeeze by.<p>Which is probably not a big deal, overall, because as you say rates are low and it&#x27;s basically gone at this point. Some places are taking it seriously though, I know for example a relative with a child in daycare had to get her daughter tested multiple times. Every symptom needs a test, and kids tend to have snotty noses even when healthy, which gets them pulled aside and parents called for a test before they can come back.')
