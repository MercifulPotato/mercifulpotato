What you drink, how you drink, and ofc what your tastes are will drastically change what you like.  I can tell you, if you  don&#x27;t use a burr grinder it can be hard to tell the difference between most high end beans, even for filter coffee, so there is more to it than just getting the world&#x27;s best beans.<p>As far as high end beans go there are three primary categories:<p>- nutty<p>- chocolatey<p>- fruity<p>Often times nutty beans will be called chocolatey, because chocolate is considered a higher grade, but there is a difference.  If you want to play with it, a fun goal is to find the best beans for your setup from each category.  Chocolatey beans can be fun to explore with sweet &#x27;n condensed milk sometimes as well, just for the fun of it.  Nutty beans you usually can&#x27;t taste unless you&#x27;re using an espresso machine.  It&#x27;s typically subtle.  Fruity is the kind of beans you&#x27;ll typically find in a high end caf√© in an urban area and can be quite good when brewing pour over.  However, they can be high in acid, but a high end fruity bean will have low acid.  Those are rare and tend to be reserved for espresso.<p>Years ago before Blue Bottle got bought arguably their best tasting beans was their decaf.  I think they wanted to show to the world decaf can taste good.  I guess it wasn&#x27;t making money, because the first thing that changed when they got bought was the decaf switched to something not very good tasting.  Since then I&#x27;ve been slowly going through decaf espresso beans all over the world trying to find something as good.  I&#x27;ve found good beans, but nothing as good.')
