As such, it will never support the following cases:<p>1. Allow health insurers to predict and thus price the cost of psychiatric care.<p>2. Serve as an “impartial” basis for insurers to approve &#x2F; deny claims in accordance with their pricing model and profit goals.<p>3. Create a defensible, scientific-seeming rationale for allowing some population monitored access to schedule III controlled substances while denying it to the wider public.<p>4. Allow wealthy, educated and self-directed individuals to learn the responses needed to obtain access to medically beneficial controlled substances without resorting to the black market.<p>Cynics, marxists and progressives would likely enumerate several additional cases, but the pattern remains the same. Survey-based psychological tools correlate weakly with patient outcomes and diagnostic accuracy and strongly with the politics and economics of private health care.')
