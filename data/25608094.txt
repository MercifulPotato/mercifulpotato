I have had exposure to several social science departments across continents, not just management, and those members that could be described as &quot;mainstream&quot; are somewhat lacking in reflexivity, with some exceptions. (When they are critical, they stand out extra bright, like Alvesson,  Wilmott, Rowlinson)<p>But about management research. When a leading critical figure in the field summarizes it as follows:<p><i>&quot;Whilst there are plenty of theories in management,\nthere are no laws&quot;</i> [P.Griseri,as quoted by P. Morris in &quot;Reconstructing project management&quot; ],<p>one could wonder if that state of affairs could perhaps be explained by deeply ingrained subservience of management research to industry [ as described by Alvesson and other Critical Management Studies (CMS) practitioners].<p>As far as Taylorism, there may not be self-identification in the field per se, but whether taylorism, puritanism or any other -ism linked to a fundamental desire for subservience, control and performance measurement as sound management practice could be described as to run deep. ( A gem of a paper is &quot;The impact of Puritan ideology on aspects of project management&quot; by Whitty &amp; Schultz )<p>I have been doing some preliminary experiments with applying CMS to recruitment - a short summary could be &quot;treating developers with respect by providing necessary information and establishing transparency in the job announcement increases responses dramatically. Who knew!&quot;<p>Another interest of mine lies in sociophysics, which I have a huge reading list to catch up on. Did you have any sociophysics topics that attracted your interest in relation to political communication?')
