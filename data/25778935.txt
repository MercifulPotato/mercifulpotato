I thought there would be a tool I could use that would make this easy but I couldn&#x27;t find one that checked off everything I was looking for, so I threw together yagss over the last couple weeks.<p>I know, I knowâ€”there are so many static site generators. Still, I just wasn&#x27;t satisfied with the available options. None seemed to support cache-busting and minification without a lot of setup; and many seemed to have significant requirements for building themes, many of which didn&#x27;t make sense for my use-cases.<p>Yagss uses Jinja style templating, has a built-in cache-busting mechanism, minifies output by default, and has a few other features that aim to make it easy to throw together a simple website without having to figure out too much config.<p>I hope that yagss might be useful to a couple other people out there with similar requirements for their projects.')
