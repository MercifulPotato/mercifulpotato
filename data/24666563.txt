I was initially surprised by this, but then I thought: If they have the skills and knowledge to get a company running, why are they working there?  Conceivably, many people who own successful businesses are making more than the people at the EcDev office.  Therefore, it is unlikely that people who would be effective at helping launch a business are employed there.  Their main function seems to be cutting tax deals for large out-of-(town, area, country) established businesses to bring a new (office, factory, call-center) to their area.<p>My suggestion is to not look to them in figuring out your business.<p>I&#x27;ve heard that in the USA, some of the government services are staffed by retired business owners who are volunteering for something to do.  That makes sense that there could be a person in there who could be a helpful mentor.  If they had a successful business, and have done well enough to be able to retire, they probably like doing business, and know what it takes.  Retiring cuts a bunch of the stress out, and volunteering to work with new business owners lets them keep a hand in what they love to do.  If you can find something like that, or find a retired former business owner to mentor you, that would likely put you far ahead of dealing with EcDev.')
