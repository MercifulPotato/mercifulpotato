Item(by='Delk', descendants=None, kids=[25752287], score=None, time=1610473806, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25750016, text='&gt; dunno, this seems like a sane thing to want AND think that this is what your users might want.<p>I don&#x27;t think most people care about RAM upgrades. Non-technical people will probably either just put up with their computer becoming somewhat slower if software requirements change over time, or they don&#x27;t have use cases where they&#x27;d run out of RAM in the first place.<p>A nice and &quot;modern&quot; looking form factor is probably a greater factor for most people even if they did care about the upgradability to some extent.<p>I don&#x27;t really get the trend towards non-replaceable batteries, though, at least not from a customer perspective. Batteries often begin to degrade much earlier than a decent laptop would otherwise show any age, so it makes almost no sense whatsoever (except perhaps some kind of a small improvement in size due to simpler construction) to not be able to replace those. Maybe people get their batteries replaced at a shop or they just put up with degraded batteries, too.<p>I agree it replacements and upgrades should be doable, and that it would be responsible, and I&#x27;d appreciate it if at least models marketed towards developers, engineers and other technical professionals would have that. Most people probably just won&#x27;t care enough, though.')
