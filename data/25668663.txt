They are merely &quot;asking&quot; you to agree to updated terms, i.e. their contract with you.<p>GDPR allows processing of data under various legal bases. They use consent (opt-in) only for things like accessing your camera. For sharing data with other Facebook services, they rely on a &quot;legitimate interest&quot; (opt-out) instead. In theory, you might be able to object to processing under a legitimate interest, but they make it rather cumbersome. Which processing activities they perform under which legal basis is actually well-explained in the privacy policy, if you manage to find the correct section (it has a rather labyrinthine structure).')
