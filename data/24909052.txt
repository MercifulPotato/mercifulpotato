At best it&#x27;s a slower Uber (drives more timidly and slower) with the potential to be cheaper. So let&#x27;s customers trade time for money. But uber pool already does that and accounts for about 10% of rides - in other words it&#x27;s not a trade off the market demands.<p>Then add to that it&#x27;s had like ten billion dollars of investment. So it needs to turn into an uber sized company or it will be a failure. Not exactly standard Silicon Valley MVP style prove the business model, acquire customers, and then get series A investment.<p>Even if it can solve self driving, it could still fail as a company.')
