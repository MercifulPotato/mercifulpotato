I was looking at buying a high speed camera for work and emailed Lauri for advice.  He had reciently put up a video comparing the budget friendly Kronos camera to the much more expensive Phantoms.  He wrote back a comprehensive email that addressed all my concerns and helped me decide to pull the trigger on buying a Kronos 1.4 camera.  That was a few years back and I still have no regrets with the purchase.  I am still very grateful that Lauri took the time to help me out.')
