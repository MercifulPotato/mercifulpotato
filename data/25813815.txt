I spent ~1 hour setting it up on a fresh Ubuntu 20.04 VM.<p>I then on-boarded my wife, brother, father and mother without issue. I just sent them a text with screenshots and detailed instructions on what to do. Everyone&#x27;s in, and we have E2EE group chats going. Within ~20 minutes of sending instructions everyone was participating in chat.<p>The only issue encountered was that my mom entered the wrong homeserver URL (I set up the sign-up page to be join.subdomain.tld and the homeserver to be chat.subdomain.tld and she entered the former into Element). My dad was able to resolve the issue quickly for her.<p>All clients are Element [2] right now, though I plan on trying Weechat [3] this week.<p>Honestly, I didn&#x27;t expect it to be this easy to do after seeing all the complaints on HN. I subscribed on Patreon yesterday and wish you all the best of luck!<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;matrix-org&#x2F;synapse" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;matrix-org&#x2F;synapse</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ZerataX&#x2F;matrix-registration" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ZerataX&#x2F;matrix-registration</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;element.io" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;element.io</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;poljar&#x2F;weechat-matrix" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;poljar&#x2F;weechat-matrix</a>')
