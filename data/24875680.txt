Item(by='khazhoux', descendants=None, kids=[24877365], score=None, time=1603497417, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24872754, text='There are several abilities that can be called &quot;perfect pitch&quot; -- identification vs recall, automatic vs labored. I&#x27;ve never seen this categorized before, but here&#x27;s my attempt:<p>1. The ability to immediately identify a pitch name from listening.  This is the common definition.  It is analogous to a native language speaker recognizing a spoken word -- it&#x27;s automatic and requires no effort.<p>2. The ability to &#x2F;recall&#x2F; a pitch from memory accurately.  When you sing a tune, are you singing in the same key as the original recording?  Some people can&#x27;t do this.<p>3. The ability to identify a pitch name from listening, not immediately&#x2F;reflexively but by mentally matching it against a well-remembered reference pitch.  This requires (2) and also requires some work on your part, to remember a &quot;catalog&quot; of reference pitches.<p>4. Ability to recognize a chord type and root, either automatically (like #1) or by mental reference to some well-remembered chords (like #3).  Of course, the root can be ambiguous and tricky to find.<p>I can&#x27;t do #1 (immediate automatic pitch recognition) but once in a rare while it happens.  I can do #2 easily -- mentally recall or sing any remembered tune within probably 25 cents.  That means I can tune a newly-strung guitar, e.g., pretty well (though not perfectly) by just remembering a reference low E (first note in Airbag) or drop-D (first note in Everlong).  I can do #3 with some mental effort -- requires me remembering my catalog of opening note for a handful of songs&#x2F;pieces, and then doing a slow mental match.')
