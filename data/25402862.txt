But you also can&#x27;t just make stuff up and get people to take you seriously. There&#x27;s some rigour to making and presenting your arguments. Very different to gender studies.<p>Except that a lot of it is just made up! Both the Greeks and Romans were happy to make up foundational and battle stories to support their cultural lodestones; we don&#x27;t <i>really</i> know much about how Rome was founded other than that it certainly wasn&#x27;t Romulus and Remus. Even our best period sources (Dionysus of Halicarnassus and Livy) were (1) 800 years too late, and (2) under immense political pressure to &quot;prove&quot; (there&#x27;s that word again) that the myths were real.<p>And note: the greatness of Rome is conditioned on the greatness of their founding myth, which goes from Romulus and Remus to the great Aeneas of Troy[1]. The greatness of the Western neoclassicial period (democracy, free speech, property, capitalism!), in turn, is conditioned on the greatness and intellectual <i>rightness</i> of Greece and Rome. There&#x27;s a reason why George Washington is <i>apotheosized</i> on the Capitol Rotunda, and it&#x27;s not just because Brumidi thought it would look cool.<p>If you can see why these kinds of observations and analysis might be interesting, you can get an inkling of why people find gender and other critical studies interesting: they don&#x27;t exist to <i>destroy</i> Western culture, only to reconcile its lionizations with what we <i>actually</i> know. And, as it turns out, we don&#x27;t know a whole lot other than what our progenitors <i>want</i> us to know.<p>[1]: This, among many other reasons, is why Rome had its own reactionary anti-Hellenic scholars. Modern conservative groups frequently borrow their names. Parallels abound.')
