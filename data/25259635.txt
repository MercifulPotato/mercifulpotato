Like, on context switch to userland, the kernel puts the chip into whatever ISA is in the respective process&#x27;s binary. And the syscall instruction and interrupts put the chip back into the kernel ISA. So you would have backwards compatiblity, but new stuff could use the faster ISA. I guess my main question is if there would be enough die space to support two separate instruction decoders.')
