That could describe Chrome, especially if you include other Chromium-based browsers, like Edge.<p>2) &quot;X&quot; is lagging in support of web standards and holding back use of those standards by developers. That second claim doesn&#x27;t fit Chrome well, it&#x27;s more typically used against mobile Safari. The combination of mobile Safari&#x27;s share of mobile traffic, relatively slow feature release pace particularly for features in certain segments (PWA), its exclusivity on Apple mobile devices, and the longevity of said devices makes the claim somewhat accurate though still far from the miserable standard set by IE.')
