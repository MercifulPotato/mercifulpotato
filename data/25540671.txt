What I would like to see is a post-mortem with mitigations -- how did this happen, and how will they prevent similar occurrences in the future. Instead, most likely nothing will happen. And I will not be surprised if the &quot;firmware update account&quot; will be back in the next release, probably still insecure, but hidden better so that random researchers won&#x27;t stumble on it.<p>I wish there were some sort of liability for the manufacturers for the cases like those. For example, if a person runs a red light by accident and get caught, they get a fine and an insurance premium increase. We need something like this for IOT suppliers as well.')
