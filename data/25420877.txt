Item(by='feralimal', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607969077, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25419731, text='That&#x27;s a great quote, and I&#x27;ve enjoyed PKD&#x27;s work.<p>As a skeptic, I would agree that I would not claim to know so much.  I have lots of hypotheses though.<p>And, as a skeptic, you might think that there would not be much to say...  but then I find myself swimming, nay drowning, in a world of unfounded opinion and hearsay.  So much baseless belief.  I think I can see the contradictions and unfounded assumptions in whatever narrative is being presented.  In good faith, I try to point out the errors as I see them, to the best of my ability.  I think of this as a service - helping to discern belief from knowledge.<p>But evidently it is not appreciated.  I am flagged, people think I am hateful (I don&#x27;t believe I am).  In all, people do not appreciate the genuinely skeptical position, even if they pay lip service to it.  They prefer to go along to get along - to do whatever their unprincipled, lightly considered, free-style way - whatever is most expedient at the time.<p>PS: &#x27;I am posting too fast&#x27; so I cannot submit this response.  Its not that I don&#x27;t want to continue the conversation, but HN puts a block on unpopular opinions such as mine.  Skeptical voices cannot be heard!  But I will try to submit this in a few hours (it was 3 yesterday), even if the conversation has moved on by then.  :)<p>Does it amaze you that freedom of speech to have a different opinion to others, one that I think I can reason and evidence, should prove to be something that requires censure?  I&#x27;m amazed.  Did you think that HN was better than this?  I did.')
