Item(by='ifokiedoke', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605123236, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25060418, text='I quite enjoyed the beginnings of this essay &amp; the parts of assessing risk and mapping out problem spaces. But the essay seems to take a weird turn about halfway through (&quot;3: The Prepared Lifesylte&quot;) where the author begins to give their opinion on how folks should best live their lives _in general_, under the guise of suggesting that it&#x27;s a &quot;Prepared Lifestyle&quot;.<p>For example:<p>- 3.3. Learn new skills --&gt; supposedly this is to counteract the risk of your job market shifting (&quot;develop useful and marketable secondary skills&quot;), but the example list is pretty random and not necessarily all that economically pragmatic. So it just seems more like the author believes people should have hobbies...<p>- 3.4.5. Don&#x27;t Hurt Yourself: Just in Case, Keep your Senses Razor Sharp --&gt; Which basically says, don&#x27;t drink or do drugs because that raises the possibility that you&#x27;ll get hurt? I mean, absolutely it&#x27;ll be crappy if an earthquake happens while you&#x27;re high &amp; sure if you&#x27;re piss drunk you might do something dumb to harm yourself but if you really wanna talk about avoiding injuries... taking recreational drugs is probably like on the bottom of the list of things to worry about for anyone who doesn&#x27;t have substance abuse problems. Feels a lot more like the author just being prescriptive about lifestyle choices.<p>- 3.6. Get in Shape ---&gt; The author proceeds to dedicate 4&#x2F;5 of this section to how (in their opinion) someone should change their diet to lose weight. There is then 2 sentences on how &quot;being able to walk or bike for several hours is likely good enough to deal with all practical scenarios we talked about thus far&quot;. If that was really what mattered, one could recommend an actual exercise routine and probably spend less time lecturing folks on their theoretical obesity. Physical fitness is correlated with weight, but they&#x27;re often unrelated. After all, plenty of regular (non-obese) people can&#x27;t bike for hours at a time (myself included! I have terrible hip problems from a desk job, even though I can do plenty of pullups &amp; work out regularly). If you want to be able to run long distances, you have to run. Same for biking. To focus on weight seems disingenuous.<p>...and so on and so forth.<p>I do wish that the author wouldn&#x27;t couch their personal opinions on how others should live under the guise of disaster planning. But the rest of the article is fantastic &amp; very well thought out.<p>(EDIT: formatting)')
