Things like the linux large receive offloading bug that would receive larger than MTU packets because of offloading, then drop the packet (and send ICMP needs frag) because it&#x27;s larger than the MTU of the destination address. I fixed the FreeBSD bad behavior when getting such an ICMP, but it would be nice if systems operating as routers would update their kernels a couple of times a decade. I could (and have, elsewhere) rant about more MTU problems, but let&#x27;s just say, they&#x27;re out there, they&#x27;re stupid, and it&#x27;s hard to get them fixed. Ugh.')
