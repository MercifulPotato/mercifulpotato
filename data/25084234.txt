That being said, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s fair at this point to equate what&#x27;s going on on the left to what&#x27;s going on on the right. They are leagues apart.<p>That&#x27;s not to say that the same thing couldn&#x27;t happen on the left or that the people on the left in some way are superior. Quite the opposite. I think the people on the left are just as susceptible to the type of effects happening on the right.<p>I often wonder what would have happened if Trump had run as a democrat in 2016 instead talking about being pro-choice and how we need to get medicare for all etc. If he had run against someone like Ted Cruz, I would not be surprised if a lot of the left (myself included) had voted for Trump and excused all his talk as &quot;locker room talk&quot; or &quot;speaking his mind&quot; just like the right ultimately did. It may be nothing more than an accident that the right was the side that &quot;fell victim&quot; to his antics.<p>This brings me to a serious worry of mine. A lot of people are talking about how Trump is too incompetent to successfully install himself as a dictator, but that the next person may be much more competent. These &quot;warnings&quot; are directed toward the right. However, there&#x27;s nothing that prevents the next dictator wanna-be from being on the left, and the left needs to be equally vigilant.')
