That&#x27;s also been my impression, though it&#x27;s hard to actually <i>believe</i> schooling doesn&#x27;t accomplish more.<p><i>On that note:</i>\nHad I stayed in college, I would&#x27;ve been a senior this year. I recently brought over a college friend to discuss a paid internship at my company with him, and was very underwhelmed with what he had accomplished during his university tenure (this being a quite prestigious institution). From the stories he told of professors assigning grindingly futile projects to his lack of knowledge about relatively widespread concepts like distributed hash tables, it was a rather disappointing conversation.<p>I still think the institution of the university is hard to replicate elsewhere, but the content (and maybe the people) certainly need an update!<p>Thank you for the note about Knuth&#x27;s book. I&#x27;ll check it out in more depth â€” I have the PDF version sitting in my downloads folder. My startup is currently being acquired, but once that&#x27;s settled I&#x27;ll have time for some holiday reading :).')
