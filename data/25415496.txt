Maybe not her.<p>&gt; <i>Murrow&#x27;s withering criticism of McCarthy was somehow a plot by US intelligence?</i><p>Of course. When you find weakness of a side, you don&#x27;t expose it to the public. You let them be the &quot;other side&quot; while you blackmail them for power. McCarthy was not a good politician and he bit more than he could chew. So, there was a power shift that happened internally at that time because of McCarthy&#x27;s work... but he had to be silenced and curbed because of how he handled things.<p>&gt;<i>That a German newspaper was coordinating with spooks to expose Mossack Fonseca?</i><p>Yes, definitely. If you don&#x27;t know that CIA was involved in Panama Papers, you know nothing.<p>&gt;<i>I find that orders of magnitude harder to believe than that they were good people dedicated to the truth.</i><p>Oh I belive a lot of people are dedicated to the truth. They just don&#x27;t end up doing very well when the truth is not good for the establishment. Look at Assange or Snowden... or even McCarthy.')
