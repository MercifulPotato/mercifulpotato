You will have to do the work, then convince the maintainer to accept it. If the maintainer is unresponsive, you may work for nothing. This seems the case here: we don&#x27;t know why the maintainer is unresponsive. And people can&#x27;t casually upload a new version due to strong ownership culture.')
