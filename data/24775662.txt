You absolutely <i>must</i> be editorial in what you present to people who are higher up in the decision process and are less able to interpret the data. It often isn&#x27;t just the money people, it is also your bosses and their bosses. It is a matter of presenting things with an eye towards the best possible outcomes, and understanding where things would get confusing for someone who is only half paying attention.')
