For example, have you personally verified that the earth is round</i><p>I am consistently skeptical about outrageous claims, particularly in ideologically charged contexts. Or try to be, anyway -- I&#x27;m not a robot and I&#x27;m of course subject to bias, like all humans.<p>For example, I dislike Trump but if I read something truly outrageous about him I tend to be skeptical about it. In Spanish we call it &quot;avoid buying rotten fish&quot;, i.e. do not believe any stories about your hated enemy, just because they sound like something he would do, until you can have at least some degree of verification. Because sometimes those stories are planted maliciously or are plain wrong.<p>In the case of North Korea there is the problem that the country is so secretive -- unlike the US with Trump -- that it&#x27;s truly hard to get confirmation of just about anything, so the rumors fly easily. If something <i>sounds</i> true about North Korea, then it <i>must</i> be true!<p>That the Earth is round is non-controversial. I don&#x27;t see how it&#x27;s wrong to double or triple check sociopolitical claims though.<p>I do believe North Korea is a hereditary dictatorship and that their people suffer, in case you were wondering. This doesn&#x27;t mean I will automatically believe <i>any</i> claim about that country.')
