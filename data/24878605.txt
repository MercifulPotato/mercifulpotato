Construction starts based on unrealistic expectations of huge profits, then as expenses explode, the hope of profit disappears. Projects will complete if the builders are susceptible to the sink cost fallacy, or if they do not need to compete with cheaper forms of energy.<p>And if low operating expenses is a good thing, then solar and wind and battery storage are far better than nuclear on that front.')
