I believe home streaming new releases will compete with theaters, but I don&#x27;t think it will completely replace them. Anecdotally, my wife and her friends all love going to the theater to see movies and I expect they will resume doing so post-pandemic. I am a homebody, but my wife is not; so given the option she would prefer to get out of our house and go to the theater.<p>What I&#x27;m curious about is how this will impact distribution arrangements once theaters do re-open. I could see it going one of two ways:<p>1. If studios start streaming new releases, they can&#x27;t offer theaters the same kind of exclusive distribution that they could in the past, allowing theaters to demand more favorable terms<p>2. Since studios now have alternative distribution channels, they don&#x27;t necessarily need theaters to distribute their new releases, so studios can demand more favorable terms.')
