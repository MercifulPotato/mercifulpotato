Also the error handling is far inferior to the more principled approach taken by Rust&#x2F;Haskell.<p>&gt; ...I can tell you right away that the Rust code will never be properly understand.<p>I think this is an unfair characterisation: if I did this with my c#-writing coworkers, I think they’d certainly get a cursory understanding of Go quicker, but it wouldn’t take that much longer to get a grip on Rust and they’d write better and more correct code in Rust.')
