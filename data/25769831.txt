Tether exchanges BTC for USDT<p>2.  Tether prevents people from exchanging USDT for USD<p>3.  Tether immediately sells their newly gained BTC for USD<p>4.  Ideally Tether would back USDT with a 1:1 in assets in USD.<p>Point #4 is under debate.  But since #2 exists it&#x27;s unclear that even if #4 is true, Tether would stop a run on USDT.<p>What it really looks like is that Tether figured out a way to extract capital out of the crypto market by buying assets and replacing them with worthless IOU&#x27;s.  Meanwhile the founders have walked out the back door with suitcases of cash.')
