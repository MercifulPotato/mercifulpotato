It&#x27;s a formal part of the state. And it&#x27;s raison d&#x27;Ãªtre is to ensure that decision making around standardization actually happens.

If you want to travel far, go with many.<p>The organization of a state catering to many millions follows the latter part of that principle, for better or worst. Standardization doesn&#x27;t guarantee the optimal solution to a problem, it guarantees a workable solution for the majority of a given problem space.<p>And that&#x27;s exactly what public governance is about. Ensuring the continued existence of the state as a legitimate, legal entity that governs and serves public interests at large.<p>&gt; The issue at hand is no mechanism for feedback.<p>Well, it&#x27;s perfectly feasible to... just e-mail them or give them a call. The NIST ITL CSRC lab can easily be reached via their website. [2]<p>If you want to know the decision making process that went into a standard, you can submit a FOIA request.
