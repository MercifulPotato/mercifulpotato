Wayland <i>aligns</i> Linux with the philosophical &amp; design differences of other OS&#x27;s, it doesn&#x27;t diverge at all.<p>In the same way that X&#x27;s unique snowflake design hasn&#x27;t significantly impacted cross-OS compatibility, why would Wayland make this any harder? If anything Wayland <i>reduces</i> cross-OS complexity as you can finally have a compositor API on Linux like you have on literally every other OS, which greatly reduces the friction for things like embedding video within an app.<p>But otherwise right now on any cross-OS application the design is going to assume that composition, clipboard, and keyboard shortcuts are all independent systems. Only on X is that not true. X is the unique, unorthodox design in the broader world of &quot;all OSes&quot;')
