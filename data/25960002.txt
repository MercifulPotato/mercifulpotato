And I do appreciate the write-up. However.... (and there&#x27;s always a but) does this page convert better? And if it doesn&#x27;t, will they have the guts to rollback?<p>I don&#x27;t know anything about the politics behind github and the employees. I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;re all wonderful people. This is just a projection from my company. Even if the new flashy design performed 20% worse, it wouldn&#x27;t be gotten rid of. They would say something like &quot;well, 20% isn&#x27;t that bad. it just needs time to bed in&quot; or something like that. Fast-forward a year, and we still have the crappy performing good-looking page!')
