Item(by='henrikschroder', descendants=None, kids=[25107369], score=None, time=1605492967, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25107023, text='Yes, and the parentheses of methods obviously work as a compiler-mandated &quot;style&quot; that make it obvious that you&#x27;re running a method. I know Visual Studio warns you about properties with the wrong casing, and I&#x27;m pretty sure you can make the compiler throw errors for those as well, so you <i>could</i> enforce it on a project level at least, even if the language itself doesn&#x27;t.<p>But I agree with you on the Kotlin examples in the article. Even though it&#x27;s been a while since I last did Java, my gut reaction is that it looks wrong, because it looks like I&#x27;m directly accessing a field.<p>So you need a little bit more than just the feature itself, you need something to distinguish them from fields when you&#x27;re looking at code, or you&#x27;re gonna run into surprises. Whether that is casing or syntax highlighting or naming conventions, I don&#x27;t care very much, as long as there&#x27;s something.<p>Of course, lack of discipline can screw it up, but you <i>could</i> name the getter for x &quot;setY()&quot;, and make it delete the entire filesystem when you call it. You can&#x27;t guard against stupidity like that...')
