But recognizing that we have a system that is openly biased against people without financial resources seems like something we should change.<p>I understand that DC rarely uses cash bail and has a 40+ year track record showing that 90% of accused show for their trial dates and &gt; 90% are not re-arrested before trial. So maybe since that system seems to work for the most part, we could use that as a basis? Or at least require a very strong burden of proof before we presume people guilty because they are not wealthy?<p>How much better is the cash bail system at producing defendants at trial than DC&#x27;s system? Is it so much better that it&#x27;s worth ignoring our Constitution?<p>If nothing else, we spend ~$17B incarcerating innocent (again, per our law) people. Seems like an incredible waste of money and human potential. Maybe we try something else.')
