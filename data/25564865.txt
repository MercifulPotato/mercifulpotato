I have a few shipping lines worked out, but many remain. I built this so I didn&#x27;t have to manually update the status of our on-the-water containers.<p>If you&#x27;re familiar with the industry, you know that you get limited time to pick up containers at the yard, empty them, and then return them, without incurring fees and charges.<p>This library helped us avoid many detention and demurrage fees.<p>There are many closed-source solutions for this, however, I have yet to see an open source solution. Hoping to fill that gap.<p>Never released an open source library before, feedback and guidance is welcome!')
