When a proposition has historically allowed for legislative editing, it&#x27;s typically to allow for unthought of edge cases to be handled without going again through the ballot prop process. Far as I know, of propositions that allow for legislative editing, requiring a 7&#x2F;8th majority is unprecedented.<p>The legislature can always work around this, however, with a simple majority, by passing a proposed constitutional amendment to be approved by referendum.')
