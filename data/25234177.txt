It has good throughput and low latency, and comes with archivers that can delete old entries, roll over databases, and compress log entries using dictionary compression; compression that looks for common elements across small messages and extracts it into a common dictionary.<p>So that&#x27;s the sales pitch. Now let&#x27;s do the fun question â€“ how and why did it get here?<p>I started off this blog post by writing out the requirements for a forensic logger as if I had total knowledge of what the goal was. But that&#x27;s not what happened. The real story is messy, discovering the requirements piecemeal, and involves lots of backtracking over several months. I think it&#x27;s more interesting and human to talk about.')
