In that lens, we foresee a similar use for satellite imagery data, gathered through a platform, ours or other satellite service providers, and made available to other users. The cost of entry for utilizing GPS is hidden under these platforms and service taxes, and we look to develop a low cost of entry for utilizing satellite imagery for platforms to use and burgeon; hence the example of things the engineers building GPS never expected their data would be used for! I’ve spotted a few commenters on here who are hoping to use low-cost imagery for just that.')
