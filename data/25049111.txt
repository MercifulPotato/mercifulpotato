After getting a folder containing a ballot, I take it over to a closed stall to mark it and feed it directly into the scanning machine when I&#x27;m done. Safe, secure and results in immediately knowing that your ballot is valid and accepted.<p>As a sibling comment mentions, states and cities have a great deal of freedom in terms of the &quot;how&quot; of voting and some do it better than others.')
