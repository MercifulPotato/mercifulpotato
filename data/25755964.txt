And no one is saying that tech workers randomly won the lottery and should shut up and just be grateful.<p>But to imagine that suddenly having the fruits of your labor yield 10-100x the wealth that others in life can ever hope to produce, and think that it&#x27;s just your hard work and not a function of having been blessed both with good talents and an environment in which your value can be exploited -- is sheer arrogance not to acknowledge that.  Or be offended that someone points it out.   What does being on HN have to do with keeping a sense of reality?   We need to create a protective bubble of thought that doesn&#x27;t offend millionaires?<p>As Warren Buffett has said, <i>&quot;I was born with a talent for capital allocation.  If I had been born in rural Africa, my talents might never have given me the wealth I have today.  I would not be so different from my secretary.   Our positions might even be reversed.  I thank America for that difference.&quot;</i><p>Maybe the word windfall triggers you in a way that suggests it should be taken away and you didn&#x27;t &quot;deserve it&quot;.  No one said that.   Yet also, everyone in such a fortunate position tends to grow to think they deserve it fully as a result of their talents and work.  When in fact an objective person should see how much the factors have aligned to give you this gift.<p>Just because you read HN doesn&#x27;t mean you are exempted from realizing how lucky you are.   We&#x27;re not <i>that</i> much of a bubble I hope.')
