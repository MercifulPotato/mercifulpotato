It&#x27;s not clear why controllers are a negative - do you similarly criticize the PS5 for having a controller and not meaningfully changed?<p>2. &quot;The product hasn&#x27;t changed meaningfully&quot; - here, &#x27;meaningfully&#x27; is a weasel word.  50% more pixels, for a device where pixel density is important for usability.  A 25% ($100) price drop, in a device that is now significantly cheaper than gaming consoles.  The ability to drive better graphics with a tether to a video card.  (BTW, this is a &lt; 2 year product cycle for a bleeding edge device.) What do you consider meaningful?<p>3. &quot;nobody is buying these things&quot; appears to be incorrect, literally and directionally.  Expectations are for 3M units sold in 2020.  Pre-orders were 5x for Quest 2 versus Quest 1.  Perhaps you meant to say &quot;me and my friends haven&#x27;t bought one&quot;?')
