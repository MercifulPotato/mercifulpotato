The idea was that the Security Target (definition of the system) could declare conformance to a standardized Protection Profile which consumers could use as a shortcut to understanding what was promised.<p>However, nobody looks at STs nor PPs except the vendor and the certifier, so all that work is for naught.  You could absolutely get a CC cert with the environment that it is unplugged from a network.')
