Item(by='jcranmer', descendants=None, kids=[25369729], score=None, time=1607570061, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25369154, text='The rough gist of the argument is that only legislatures are empowered to choose the method of selection of electors, and therefore governors (like Texas&#x27;s governor) or courts (as in North Carolina) that order changes to election procedure render the entire count of the election invalid.<p>(You&#x27;ll note that the examples I cite are not states that Texas is suing, and that should give you some indication of the likelihood of success.)<p>[Side note: that&#x27;s one of the arguments. The actual brief is kind of a legally incoherent mess, so it kind of hops around from argument to argument a bit; the other main argument, which most of the amici seem to want to focus on, is that PA&#x27;s Supreme Court improperly adjudicated PA law&#x27;s propriety under the PA Constitution, and therefore Texas has right to settle that dispute in front of SCOTUS, despite SCOTUS dismissing an appeal alleging exactly that just yesterday.]')
