If the code I&#x27;m writing is supposed to be an user-facing &quot;finished&quot; product, then it&#x27;ll probably be in my best interests that if people want to make something based upon it that I&#x27;ll be able to see some of that work, so I use (A)GPL. Has worked pretty well for me so far, I still believe that the copyright system, and indeed IP law in general is deeply flawed and in dire need for reform, but that&#x27;s how I make do for now.')
