Day 1 10:00 - Day 1 14:00 means you need a hotel room Day 1. Day 1 22:00 - Day 2 10:00 (more like 6:00 IME tho) means no hotel room for Day 1.<p>Train stations in Germany at least generally have luggage lockers, so you can just leave your stuff there. It&#x27;s not hassle free, of course, but pretty convenient. Not sure if that&#x27;s common in other countries.')
