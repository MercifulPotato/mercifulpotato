Item(by='ghaff', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610545021, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25761195, text='&gt;we are going to see some sort of professional regulation in software engineering<p>That could trivially exist. There is PE licensing in other areas of engineering (and used to be in software) although it&#x27;s not super-common outside of civil engineering given the purpose is mostly to sign off on stuff that goes to government regulators. Of course, it probably doesn&#x27;t make much of a difference--the ACM and IEEE already have codes of ethics. And, by the way, that now means you probably can&#x27;t be a software engineer if you don&#x27;t have a 4-year degree from an accredited school along with some other requirements.')
