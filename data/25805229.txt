Arguing over an issue that no one at the meeting actually understands is a sure way to waste everyone’s time.”<p>This always sounds good in theory but ends up with unnecessary individuals falling asleep during meetings. I prefer either a staggered approach to meetings where the likely unnecessary people are only invited to the end of the meeting OR are simply “on-hand” for the meeting in case they need to be pulled in.<p>I don’t care how critical the input is, if you pull someone into a three hour meeting and they only contribute five sentences, they’re not going to be happy with you.')
