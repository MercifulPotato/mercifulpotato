Item(by='jnxx', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604164336, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24950670, text='&gt; What we should demand of these projects instead is &quot;we can provide this amount of renewable power 24&#x2F;7&quot;.<p>Humans have always adapted to power being available in different quantities and forms over time. This is why we have corn stores, mills, corned beef, and cold houses. No farmer expects that the sun makes his corn grow in January. In the end, we adapt to our environment, and we have done that though all the ages. Today, we can make it technically much smarter, for example by adding a price signal to electricity, and generating hot water for doing laundry during strong-wind night hours. If this is cheaper and more efficient than battery storage, then why not do it?')
