We tried a bunch of stuff, but one thing that we noticed was that we were playing a lot more casual games with our friends and family since the pandemic. It was pretty enjoyable. We tried the same with our colleagues and it was definitely much better than a Zoom happy hour. The game provides some structure which removes the awkwardness and there is some amount of participation from everyone on the call. We are now working on a product (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;getlounge.app&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;getlounge.app&#x2F;</a>) that helps teams organize these game happy hours.')
