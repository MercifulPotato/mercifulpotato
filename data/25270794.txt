I was there back in 2017 and everyone I spoke to was very against it, and I remember when I looked up the stats they also showed the majority weren&#x27;t for it. Still looks like it&#x27;s a close issue, statehood is a big deal and affects everyone dramatically, kinda feel like it should have overwhelming support, not 51% of 52% of ppl... that&#x27;s actually only 26% of eligible voters voting for it.')
