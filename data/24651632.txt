There are historians who are warning that lots of the information in the upscaled images are ahistorical (blue jeans in the 1910s) so people should view this images as interesting but not accurate views of history. The journalist is the only one saying anyone should stop anything. None of the historians in the article ever say the youtubers should stop. They&#x27;re just saying pretty much: &quot;Hey, history cares about the context and accuracy of sources and these images are worse sources than the originals, they&#x27;re good entertainment but bad historical sources&quot;. Pump it through a journalist and this is what you get. It&#x27;s at this point I make some ironic point about how the journalist is using his neural net to upscale the story, inserting innaccurate information to the picture to create a more entertaining piece than the underlying facts.')
