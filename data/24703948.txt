I already have a second layer for programming specific functions. I could add a third, but it&#x27;s more mental load. It&#x27;s not worth it.<p>Things that I&#x27;d put onto this:<p>* Mute&#x2F;Unmute for Zoom\n* Screenshot key\n* Bind to a few key apps so I can switch between them quickly\n* Media and volume keys (so I can use a smaller keyboard, but have these within react)\n* A few emojis just for fun.\n* I&#x27;d likely have a toggle so it could serve as a num pad\n<i>')
