I&#x27;d love to see you expand to cover those, focusing on the many smaller muscles in the neck like SCM&#x2F;Scalenes&#x2F;Occipitals&#x2F;etc.<p>I did some things on-and-off for posture (mostly rear delts), but what I did consistently, and think helped the most, was heavy (for me) deadlifts.<p>I&#x27;m curious: how many pullups can you do? I ask because they take a lot of lat strength, and your lats do a lot of work holding up your back.')
