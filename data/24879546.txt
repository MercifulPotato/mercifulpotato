Peace pipes and tobacco weren&#x27;t a problem until the industrialized mass production of cancer sticks drove the manufacturers to reuse literally every ounce of waste through chemical reprocessing. I can&#x27;t find the research right now but one paper I read on historical gambling mentioned that there is far less evidence of gambling as addictive behavior before urbanization because of a lack of opportunity and strong ties in small communities that kept both gamblers and bookies in line. It wasn&#x27;t until the innovations in transportation in the 19th century that real estate speculators started building gambling enclaves like Atlantic City, Las Vegas, and the casinos along (and on) the Mississippi river.<p>Showing ads - aka manipulating human behavior - is now the most profitable. The same thing is going to happen now: the purveyors of the addiction will continue to drive the dystopia to its ultimate conclusion until it gets regulated into the ground (all of the above), loses the largest lawsuit in history and gets culturally sidelined (tobacco), and&#x2F;or everything but the gains get dismantled (Sacklers).')
