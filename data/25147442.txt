Cuda actually encapsulates GPU computation.<p>AMD has HIP, which is closer the Cuda but HIP seems less developed.<p>But I believe the basic problem is AMD doesn&#x27;t make sufficiently high end GPUs to compete with Nvidia in ML.<p>Personally, I don&#x27;t care what happens in the cloud, just what I can buy. I would note Nvidia does have competition in the cloud from Google&#x27;s TPUs and I assume any large cloud vendor is going to negotiate with Nvidia. While I&#x27;d love AMD to be cost-effective for ML somewhere, it seems they aren&#x27;t &#x27;cause that&#x27;s not what they&#x27;re targeting.')
