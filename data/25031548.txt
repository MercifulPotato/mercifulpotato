And for what it&#x27;s worth, I&#x27;m Canadian, but I&#x27;m pretty happy with the moderate dealmaker Biden as the eventual nominee (and President-elect). I agree with you that given the existing situation, a public option as opposed to a complete replacement of the existing system is a more realistic path to providing healthcare to everyone, with less room for catastrophic error.  Unfortunately it seems unlikely that even that will happen now, but who knows.<p>As for the rest, some aspects of it do look a bit unrealistic to me.  Others look ambitious but morally right, and something I&#x27;d like to see up here too, like a real focus on basic housing as a universal right, and a corresponding push to end homelessness.  Regardless, you did help me see the opposing point of view; thanks.')
