People on average take a long time to develop the intuition about numbers and units. Just look how the US resists to change to metric units. Just using UTC would require everyone require a new intuition about times, and what is even worse, a different one in each location. Time zones are bad enough, but they keep the rough approximation that 12:00 is about the middle of the day. And in some regions, people just tend to be a bit &quot;late&quot; to compensate for their timezone weirdness.<p>Also, it would make any kind of writing about times basically impossible. Whenever you write a sentence like: &quot;they met at 18:30&quot; most people would understand that this means the early evening. But when you read: &quot;they went for a swim at 20:00 UTC&quot; you don&#x27;t know what that means, until you know where they meet. And happen to know the timezone offset. Or have to google it. Every time you read a sentence like that.')
