Item(by='scottlamb', descendants=None, kids=[24815110], score=None, time=1602946232, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24809680, text='Neat. Looks pretty similar to the ODROID H2+. Some differences I see: the Odyssey has soldered-on RAM and eMMC, the extra M.2 slot, fewer USB3 ports, and 1 GbE rather than 2.5 GbE. I think they&#x27;re similar in price (once you add the missing RAM and storage to the ODROID H2+).<p>Is 110x110mm a standard form factor? Are there cases available that could fit one or two 3.5&quot; HDDs?')
