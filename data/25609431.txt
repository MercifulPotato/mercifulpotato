Item(by='YokoZar', descendants=None, kids=[25609493, 25609455], score=None, time=1609552186, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25609266, text='This entire article assumes that the vaccine provides sterilizing immunity (where you can&#x27;t spread it) rather than just disease protection (where you get and spread the virus but aren&#x27;t as symptomatic).<p>But even now no one knows if these vaccines provide sterilizing immunity, as they were only testing for disease protection in the trials.  Some even theorize some vaccinated individuals might be _more_ contagious, as they are less likely to socially distance and could be more likely to be asymptomatic carriers.<p>Indeed the article itself is evidence of this risk, as the author seems to advocate giving the vaccine to people who are willing to pay a lot so they can go party.<p>That said, if sterilizing immunity is provided by the vaccine, then a lot of the arguments are more plausible.  But I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s valid to just assume that, and it&#x27;s not fair to health officials who don&#x27;t assume that either.')
