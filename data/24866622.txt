Or maybe AB 5 and Dynamex and Borello. Or maybe just Dynamex.</i><p>The very recent <i>Dynamex</i> and the relatively old <i>Borello</i> decisions are <i>California Supreme Court Cases</i> that take precedence over California legislation baring a California Constitutional Amendment or sweeping labor reform. AB5 gets rid of ambiguities, not create them. That&#x27;s why the intro to AB5 reads:<p><i>SECTION 1. The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:<p>(a) On April 30, 2018, the California Supreme Court issued a unanimous decision in Dynamex Operations West, Inc. v. Superior Court of Los Angeles (2018) 4 Cal.5th 903 (Dynamex).</i><p>AB5 is meant to bring state regulations in line with the courts, which just established new and important precedent for California labor law in <i>Dynamex</i> that created new ambiguities in a critical set of laws. That decision doesn&#x27;t supersede <i>Borello</i>, which is a well litigated topic that any lawyer specializing in California labor law understands.<p>Thank you for the reference to AB2257 [0], I didn&#x27;t know about it. A cursory scan implies that the legislature is responding to real situations like Vox Media&#x27;s laying off of hundreds of journalists [1], more Borello (!) [2], some exceptions that reasonable people can argue is common sense or corruption [3], and a bunch of other boring stuff [4]. I don&#x27;t have the time to really dig into the new bill but if you can name any specific section in either bill that you find particular egregious, I&#x27;m interested to know.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;leginfo.legislature.ca.gov&#x2F;faces&#x2F;billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201920200AB2257" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;leginfo.legislature.ca.gov&#x2F;faces&#x2F;billTextClient.xhtm...</a><p>[1] <i>This bill would delete the existing professional services exemptions for services provided by still photographers, photojournalists, freelance writers, editors, and newspaper cartoonists.
