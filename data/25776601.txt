I assumed CSS transitions would be nontrivially more performant since it&#x27;s a more declarative API and the math would be done natively by the browser, but according to MDN the performance difference is negligible in most (though not all) cases if you&#x27;re using requestAnimationFrame in the JavaScript version: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.mozilla.org&#x2F;en-US&#x2F;docs&#x2F;Web&#x2F;Performance&#x2F;CSS_JavaScript_animation_performance#performance_comparison_transitions_vs._requestanimationframe" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.mozilla.org&#x2F;en-US&#x2F;docs&#x2F;Web&#x2F;Performance&#x2F;CSS...</a><p>The main case where CSS transitions are meaningfully faster appears to actually be transforms themselves, because for those the actual <i>transition</i>, too, can be moved to the GPU, whereas a JavaScript-driven transition still has to be run on the main CPU thread.')
