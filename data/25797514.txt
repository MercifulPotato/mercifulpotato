Compared to Python, it&#x27;s more performant, lightweight, portable and robust [0].<p>Unfortunately, the language itself is &quot;quirky&quot; at best. Its has unusual syntax, variables that are global by default, and pervasive use of `nil`. I personally also dislike build-your-own-object-system and the language&#x27;s conflation of lists and maps.<p>I too have been looking for an alternative to Lua - I want a language like Python with an implementation like Lua&#x27;s, which I could use both for embedding and standalone command-line applications. I&#x27;ve even considered building something like this myself - either from scratch or, perhaps, as a fork of MicroPython.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lua.org&#x2F;bugs.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lua.org&#x2F;bugs.html</a>')
