The book was great (much better than my professor) and the explanations of how number theory makes up the majority of the math our modern encryption uses were great. I had never heard of a Galois field until that course, and his text book did a great job explaining what they are and why it makes AES possible.<p>In general, encryption algorithms are so neat. We take some obscure (at least to me) math topics and we can use them in ways to create these incredible algorithms.<p>Right now, the most exciting thing in the world of crypto for me is the NIST competition for a post-quantum crypto algorithm. I&#x27;m very excited to see what comes out on top.')
