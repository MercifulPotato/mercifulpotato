It’s great to hear you are working hard on your project.  You may have missed the essence of the advice you were given, though.  You can’t be at “beta” if you haven’t yet engaged with customers.  You may be at “alpha”, but you  probably have some revisions and decisions to make before you are truly are ready to formally test and verify.  To answer your question about pre-marketing, you might consider a landing page with a small demo and place for interested parties to leave an email address.  But first, work with 10-20 people on your current prototype and listen to what they say.  Then go back, revise, and then get ready for broader testing.  I hope you find this helpful, and good luck with the project!')
