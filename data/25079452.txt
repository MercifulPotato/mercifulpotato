A user upgrading a newer version of a single system component risks breaking the whole desktop: systemd, libdrm, x11, whatever and something else doesn&#x27;t work. I&#x27;m even excluding drivers here but again it&#x27;s clear what happens when a user finds that out for themselves on Linux. If they even have the time and energy to do all that digging and googling of cryptic errors.<p>To save yourself the time and frustration, Just keep using Windows 10 with WSL2. I don&#x27;t have any reason to dual boot to a Linux desktop any more due to this.')
