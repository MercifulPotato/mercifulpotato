Seeing as I use a number of issue trackers and code review systems daily and most of them are trash. I&#x27;m very happy for git to serve as a compatible core and I can &quot;easily&quot; move between systems as they improve.<p>Basically I am glad that git does source control well. And I prefer that there is a marketplace of issue trackers, patch management and CI software layered on top. Until we have a clear excellent solution I don&#x27;t think there is a need to bind them together.<p>Let there be choice!')
