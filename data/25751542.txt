That&#x27;s why I keep trying Matrix periodically ;) But it&#x27;s been 6 months ago again.<p>But the problem was not really for myself.. I know where to click, even though it annoys me. The problem was with the other family members that have to verify every time when I add a new browser to the mix.<p>And if they don&#x27;t I don&#x27;t see all the chats which makes it unreliable.<p>Also, I don&#x27;t like the way it exposes that complexity: Why do the other channel users need to know exactly which devices I log into :) They should just know it&#x27;s me. This is what most other apps do right but Matrix doesn&#x27;t.')
