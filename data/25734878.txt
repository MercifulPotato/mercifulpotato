Your argument is essentially that <i>any</i> belief could&#x2F;should be protected. I don&#x27;t think you mean that, so I urge <i>you</i> to try to come up with a more coherent formulation.<p>I would start by exploring the differences between what it means to hold a religious belief vs a political one. Maybe start by comparing how each of the above has changed, or the associations thereof with their respective ideals over, say, the last 1000 years. Maybe then proceed to identify from where a religious belief manifests vs a political belief. Finally, you could look towards the kinds of answers of which each respective belief offers explanatory power (i.e. What kinds of questions does religion answer vs politics?). We could probably even take this a step further and look at the history of each as well no? Political leanings have existed <i>at least</i> as long as religious beliefs. At one time these were likely the same! So what is it about the history of politics and religion that has lead us to the the kinds of separation we have reached today?<p>I have confidence you can come up with many kinds of differences. Good luck!')
