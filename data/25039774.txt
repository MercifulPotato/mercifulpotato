This is simple - Amazon have optimized their product to maximize their profit. Amazon have a shop that people continue to use despite the fact that it&#x27;s full of scams and knock off goods. Amazon make <i>huge</i> profits from that, so they have no problem with it at all. It only becomes a problem if the customers stop shopping there, and that&#x27;s not looking very likely.<p>It&#x27;s Amazon&#x27;s <i>customers</i> who have a problem. Don&#x27;t expect Amazon to fix it.')
