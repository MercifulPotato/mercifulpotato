Item(by='bsanr2', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601753308, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24670764, text='&gt;People still think that people making 6 figures are the elite and cheer every time a progressive income tax targeting someone marginally richer than them is introduced by their government. They are not the enemy, they&#x27;re not the people lobbying the government so their business can make extra millions or avoid paying taxes with loopholes.<p>Every single person in this country that makes more than $100,000 has outsize political clout and the capacity to change things for the better, and simply don&#x27;t. Your retirement is more important, or your children&#x27;s education, or your career. Fiddling while Rome burns.<p>&quot;But the cost of living.&quot; What about it? Take a stand. <i>You make $100k, $200k a year.</i> Collapse the property value pyramid scheme with direct action. Throttle your mortgage payments. Throw out eviction notices. Hire gangbangers to protect your house when the police come to throw you out. Organize with your neighbors to build a series of self-governed mini-ethnostates based on the first two digits of your house addresses, where your trashed credit score and criminal record are meaningless.<p>Clearly I&#x27;m halfway joking. I&#x27;m not clever enough to come up with a real solution. But to act like making twice, thrice, quadruple the average household income as an individual still leaves you handcuffed is farcical. You all pay too much for necessities and you buy goods and services you don&#x27;t need, and you use it to justify inaction while 2&#x2F;3 of the rest of country languishes in sickness and poverty. Figure out what you&#x27;re willing to sacrifice to make this better for everyone, gather it up into a big ball and catapult launch it at the walls of the establishment. If a few days off work and some posterboard can set cities ablaze, the power of someone with 5-6 figures to burn and the willingness to really do something substantial would be awesome indeed to behold.<p>And (completely serious this time) don&#x27;t tell me that people with six-figure incomes don&#x27;t donate to political campaigns because you do.')
