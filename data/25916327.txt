I would read anything challenging, even if I wouldn&#x27;t understanding.<p>I was also reading books of lyrics. I remember reading lyrics of Metallica, Iron Maiden, Sex Pistols songs, way before I actually listen to their music. That gave me an appreciation of the words&#x2F;meaning.<p>On the Sex Pistol&#x27;s song &quot;God Save The Queen&quot; they sang:<p>&quot;God save the queen\n&#x27;Cause tourists are money\nAnd our figurehead\nIs not what she seems&quot;<p>I am not discussing the political aspect on the governing systems (Kingdom vs Anarchy), but the phrase &quot;cause tourists are money&quot; has so much wisdom in it. In modern &#x27;american&#x27; language we would say &quot;money talks, BS walks&quot;.<p>Just like NBA shat up and rolled over (oh yes they did) for China, Netflix (and the likes) do for Saudi Arabia.<p>There was a discussion a couple of days ago regarding users migrating from WhatsApp to Signal&#x2F;Telegram and how &quot;a few friends&quot; declined, forcing the &quot;many&quot; to either ostracize them, or stick to WhatsApp.<p>MBS&#x2F;Saudi Arabia do the same. If you want us, shut up and keep the status quo (murder, rape, inequality, torture). They got trillions of $. Wegot two options. Shut up and roll over (Netflix, NBA), or isolate them and allow them to develop similar&#x2F;close services. The third option that &quot;slowly they will join us&quot;.. well.. how slowly is slowly? 1 year? 5? 100? never? I fear they (SA&#x2F;MBS) will always be 100 years behind this &#x27;democratic&#x27; curve.')
