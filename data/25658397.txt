By sharing capsule collections other users can mix-and-match different combinations and create outfits that people can like&#x2F;up-vote. Going further I&#x27;m trying to add the ability to find outfits that contian items they have in their wardrobe. With the eventual goal of adding a graphing data base (and possibly some ML, to help try figure out what clothes match - This is usually VERY regional, based on occupation, music taste, and a lot of other factors, the fact that it&#x27;s so subjective is what makes it a fun project to work on :)<p>I&#x27;ve build the main app using Rails &amp; VueJS but would be really interested in teaming up with someone technical to help drive the platform forward, but especially somone (no tech skills necesssary) to help build the community and try get more people on board (I have lots of ideas and thoughts on how to do this, but not enough time between a full time job, and trying to build it.<p>Feel free to contact me on HN or send me an email to paris@unstitched.xyz if you&#x27;re interested or just wanna chat a bit mroe about it :)')
