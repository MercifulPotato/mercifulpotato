I have a few free weights that I keep nearby and have worked out a short and simple routine that I don&#x27;t mind doing. It takes about two songs to finish, so I guess 6-8 minutes. Any time I&#x27;m starting to lag or I&#x27;m stuck on a problem I walk over and do the routine, then come back to my desk much more alert.<p>One nice aspect of having one (or a few) regular routines is that it&#x27;s easy to see progress. Even with just a few very short sessions most days I can lift much more weight than when I started.')
