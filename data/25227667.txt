How good employer could tackle it? At one place I worked, there was a hard 5pm cut off and regardless what was happening people had to leave the office. Any temptation to stay late was nipped in the bud. I can imagine people would still continue working until late from home anyway. If work is an escape, people will find a way. I learned one employee would take their laptop and go to a nearby pub and work in the secluded area of the premises. He said he could do either that or end it once and for all. Didn&#x27;t want to hear about therapy.')
