It is possible that they both dislike that activity <i>and</i> benefit from it, but I couldn&#x27;t read those tweets without some skepticism.<p>I for one find that most really high quality blog posts I read are not really on medium&#x2F;dev.to&#x2F;itnext, unless some large organization has committed to making every employee post there, but rather on small blogs run by people who pay the $5&#x2F;month or year or whatever to run their own blog. Maybe I just haven&#x27;t looked around enough.')
