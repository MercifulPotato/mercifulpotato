Basic health care is stuff like eating right, exercising, good hygiene, etc. We overprescribe drugs in part because things have swung too far in a commercial direction. A drug is a solution we can sell. A walk for your health is not.<p>And then we wring our hands when this leads to the kind of situation described in the article. But I know from long experience that no one will take you seriously if you try to talk about non drug solutions.')
