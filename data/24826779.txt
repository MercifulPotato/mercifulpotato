I agree with that.\nI believe that we still haven&#x27;t figured out how much software we need. Or put another way: Every software breeds new software.\nHow did we get to low code platforms in the first place? Because of software. Who is using low code? Specialists. What can you build on top of platforms? More software. What established new ecosystems? Software.\nSoftware is a tool. There is still virtual reality to come.
