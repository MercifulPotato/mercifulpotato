Do you think you have anything to learn from them by engaging in a good faith discussion?<p>My point being maybe you think 95% of MAGA-hats are off their rocker, and Trumpism taken as a whole is grossly misguided. I don&#x27;t really disagree. But is it possible that there&#x27;s some core nugget of wisdom to take away. Something, perhaps that your current worldview is glossing over.<p>Instead of just writing off the political beliefs of literally half the people in America, maybe we should really be super certain that we make a genuine attempt to understand where they&#x27;re coming from.<p>At worst, we&#x27;ve wasted some time talking to idiots. But my guess is if we make a good-faith and honest attempt to find the best and brightest Trumpists out there (instead of just smugly dunking on the dumbest trolls on the Internet), that maybe, just maybe there may be a kernel of truth underlying their ideology.')
