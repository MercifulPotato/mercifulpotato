I love seafood and even spent a summer working at a lobster pound. I just don&#x27;t get the appeal of lobster. On the other hand... scallops. Whether they&#x27;re fried, baked, sauteed or wrapped in bacon... the food of the gods. If it weren&#x27;t for the environmental issues I&#x27;d eat them everyday.<p>To each their own!')
