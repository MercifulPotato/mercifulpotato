I did that with my desk. It took 15 minutes and 10 bucks for a clean looking desk. No visible wires except the ones sticking out the back, in clips so they can&#x27;t fall behind the desk.<p>The idea is cool if you&#x27;re into elaborate (expensive?) custom desks, but it seems more like an design school final than something of practical use.<p>Believe me though, it looks nice, I can tell you worked hard on it. I just don&#x27;t get why build a business around it now instead of iterate on it as a hobby until you get something of use for the average desk worker.')
