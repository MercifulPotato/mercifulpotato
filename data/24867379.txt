The nice thing about PhDs is that they typically know how to write well. Most software engineers are terrible writers. In general, most engineers are terrible writers.<p>When I look at a resume and I see that someone has a PhD and has published a few papers I am much more comfortable hiring them. They almost definitely know how to approach a large writing project and break it up into smaller pieces. They&#x27;ve had training in how to work on large writing projects and they have atleast 1 experience of doing so and finishing it. Of course I&#x27;ve encountered PhDs that are terrible writers, but they&#x27;re an anomaly.<p>I doubt this transfers well into other fields or positions where writing matters less. Most programming positions don&#x27;t require strong writing skills, for example. All other things being equal, when I am hiring I prefer PhDs over non-PhDs, because in my experience they&#x27;re better writers.')
