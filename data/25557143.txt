Ironically this ends up with a more bloated core. Or perhaps the modularity is probably designed to provide more differentiation.<p>Need POPCOUNT, have to implement the B extension.\nNeed vectors, have to implement scatter gather. Also Can&#x27;t merge the register file with the FP registers.<p>In reality what will happen is people will choose instructions from these extensions and implement them as custom isa.<p>This will lead to a lot of non-portable code. Until some one combines all these useful ops into another standard extension. Repeat.')
