They are capable, but overly conservative.  They should have been in a hurry 10 years ago.  It&#x27;s well documented that they weren&#x27;t and were resented for it.  AMD came up with a winning strategy (multi-die packaging) and Intel still doesn&#x27;t seem in a hurry to catch up.  You could swap &quot;AMD&quot; in that sentence with &quot;Apple&quot; and maintain the meaning.<p>When superscalar or simultaneous multithreading came out you didn&#x27;t see competitors mill about waiting for the customers to forget about the advantages.')
