Most of the regulations surrounding financial transactions are there to protect <i>you</i>, and other market participants.<p>I wish crypto people had the chance to spend one day in a bank, working on regulatory issues. The vast majority of them are all about either protecting the clients, or the market, or society in general.<p>Edit: to expand a bit, most of that regulation is there to ensure that a bank doesn&#x27;t screw you, or to enforce transparency for you, or to ensure that illicit money doesn&#x27;t enter the system (which is also in your interest), etc.')
