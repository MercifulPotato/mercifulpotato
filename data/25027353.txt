This is usually around 25 years.&quot;<p>Literally the last sentence of my post is &quot;Newer systems have a lifespan of around 25 years.&quot; What is your point?<p>&gt;&quot;The cables themselves have a lifespan, but it&#x27;s far longer than 25 years.&quot;<p>No this is incorrect. There are a many factors that limit the lifetime of &quot;wet plant&quot; - chief among them are fiber hydrogen exposure, which causes attenuation. There is also glue and insulation aging as well as corrosion. And &quot;the cable&quot; in submarines systems always includes all of the passive optical components, alignments, joints and passive electronic components. Extending these system is generally on the order of 5 years. That could hardly be classified as &quot;far longer than 25 years.&quot;')
