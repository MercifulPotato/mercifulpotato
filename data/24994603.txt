Have you ever heard a dad half-joking about how reluctant he felt to let his daughter go out on her first date? (Or jokes fathers sometimes tell about cleaning guns when first meeting her new boyfriend, etc.)<p>There is a &quot;letting go&quot; involved, and especially so when she gets married: someone else will be the first man in her life now. &quot;Giving her away&quot; in the wedding ceremony symbolizes that &quot;letting go&quot; that the dad does--hopefully willingly, joyfully, and knowing the man she&#x27;s marrying will love her dearly.')
