Item(by='JeremyNT', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610681518, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25775614, text='The reality here is that Senators like having the ability to hide behind the filibuster so they can pretend to be for certain legislation that appeals to their base without worrying that it might actually pass (i.e. when such legislation would anger their donors or otherwise interfere with their actual priorities). When such legislation is filibustered, they raise up their hands and say &quot;well what can you do, I <i>would</i> have voted for it but the other party didn&#x27;t let me.&quot;<p>The real issue at play is not having 51 &quot;real&quot; votes in support of a particular measure. The filibuster is a stupid procedural distraction used to excuse inaction, and the people shouldn&#x27;t be tricked by this nonsense.')
