It&#x27;s a tired argument to say it&#x27;s superficial and shallow, but there are tons of people still doing dating apps like Tinder, Hinge, Bumble, etc. If you think about it more, I think this is a statement on just how much demand is out there [to meet new prospects] to put up with such a miserable experience.<p>When I tried using these apps, I found myself trying to reverse engineer the algorithm to figure out exactly how it was ranking me and how to optimize my match rates. Most of it comes down to picture quality and your looks in those pictures. I learned this by running my own A-B tests using different pictures, but unfortunately the apps don&#x27;t really give any stats on which pictures on your profile are and are not performing.  This gave me an idea to create an app to do just this. I called it Cupid&#x27;s Critics, and you could upload candidate pictures and get people of a certain demographic to vote on them and collect statistics before pushing them live.<p>What I realized is that this is a band-aid to a broken system. I think a new system is needed entirely, which is why I am now trying to figure out how to make group dinner party dating scale.<p>If anybody is interested in building it out with me, please send me a DM.
