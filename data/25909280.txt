It is not like this is a major focus of the article! It’s just a small detail in the overview of the hardware. Seems very strange to be so upset by this.<p>b) If you ever write software for something that isn’t a desktop or server (eg a printer, a robot, some new shiny tech) then the hardware details of RAM are absolutely relevant and can’t be abstracted away by a nice alloc API. I can understand not wanting to focus on areas like this (devices are not my cup of tea) but I can’t understand deciding it’s ipso facto irrelevant because you’re a programmer.')
