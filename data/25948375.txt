It&#x27;s in our culture.<p>This really doesn&#x27;t track historically. Lots of voices have been historically silenced by American majorities because of hurt feelings or &quot;decency.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s also worth noting that America hasn&#x27;t been uniformly ahead of the curve in terms of granting rights to those that were originally denied. Probably the worst example is getting rid of slavery, which was far more bloody than in many other places. In some other areas we&#x27;ve been ahead of the curve, in some behind. But note that some of that also came from the courts in controversial ways. The first amendment has not correlated to a better track record at granting groups their rights.')
