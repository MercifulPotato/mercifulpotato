My grandmother has owned her house for much longer than that.<p>* edit: all you downvoters need to look at the claim being made instead of bringing up different issues. credit cards are not mortgages. &quot;couldn&#x27;t sign&quot; is not the same as &quot;needed a cosigner&quot; or &quot;discounted rates&quot;. the original claim implies that women could not own houses through a bank loan, which is very much false.')
