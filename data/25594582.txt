Which is plain ridiculous. Apple is pretty collaborating in this transition. Not paying for development of every remotely popular project under the sun does not make them “noncollaborating”.<p>Apple ships a Python.framework and a user-facing python3 installation through CLT, so I expect them to contribute to CPython. And they did. They don’t ship anything remotely related to PyPy, so I don’t expect them to do anything. A gesture would be nice, but that’s being nice.')
