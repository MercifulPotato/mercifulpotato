Things can be built despite of the technology. I saw this especially at an employer who was heavily invested in golang. Countless times I&#x27;ve thought to myself that they wouldn&#x27;t be having the issues they were having, sunken costs, reinventing the wheel, etc. if they used a proven technology like the JVM instead of drinking the kool aid and using the latest fad of the day. Tons of money was sunken into it, and it was made to work by force, but not everyone would be able to bear that cost, and it still causes massive inefficiencies due to poor tooling.')
