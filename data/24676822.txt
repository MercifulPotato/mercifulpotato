When it comes to deployment you just compile it to a binary file.<p>Cap’n’proto also has plain text and JSON serialization formats if you really want to have your deployed config file be directly human-editable and deserialize from that. I was just noting a very cool feature of having your config written in cap’n’proto and it’s what Cloudflare uses to maintain a bunch of config internally if I read Kenton’s allusions to it correctly.')
