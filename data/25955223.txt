FWIW, getting results that good almost always requires hardware MMU support, which is usually the largest bottleneck in these kinds of things. Without that you&#x27;d be lucky to get within the same order of magnitude.<p>Furthermore, having worked with QEMU in several binary translation and emulation projects, I cannot say that it is designed with performance as its first priorityâ€“TCG&#x27;s number one consideration seems to be portability and ease of supporting new architectures. If you look at TCG-generated code it&#x27;s pretty &quot;stupid&quot;; almost no optimizations are applied at all. This isn&#x27;t necessarily something I fault QEMU for, it&#x27;s just clearly not a priority. Or hasn&#x27;t been, I guess; but it seems like this might be changing and I&#x27;m very interested to seeing where it goes.')
