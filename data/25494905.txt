If they have any reason to believe it might be true and don&#x27;t do everything in their power to stop it, it&#x27;s their responsibility.<p>Billionaire Apple shareholders simply chose increasing their wealth at the expense of poor people they took advantage of in developing countries. And this has to stop, and we have to stop saying it&#x27;s acceptable.<p>Capitalism failed. It failed harder than any other experiment humans ever tried, and it and the wealth equality it creates has to be destroyed.')
