Item(by='alasdair_', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611867791, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25941689, text='&gt;Why should Robinhood pick a winner (siding against their own customers)?<p>Because Robinhood&#x27;s <i>actual</i> customer is Citadel, not the retail people making the trades.<p>Citadel gave $2.7BN to Melvin Capital a couple of days ago. It stands to lose that money if Melvin (and Citron etc.) can&#x27;t fully cover their short positions.<p>A good way to make the stock price go down and allow Citadel to make money, is for RH to only allow selling and not buying of GME.<p>It&#x27;s utterly appalling market manipulation.')
