Server machines at the time capable of holding 64GB RAM were beasts, IIRC on the order of hundreds of thousands of dollars.  A desktop machine with 512MB memory was considered way more than you needed.  I used a Toshiba Tecra 9000 laptop with 256GB for mostly Java and C++ development and never felt like I was anywhere near maxing it out.<p>PAE might not have met Amazon&#x27;s needs for holding their catalog or whatever.  If they were trying to directly address a data structure that was larger than 4GB, they would have needed some sort of trickery as PAE was usually implemented kernel side to provide separate 4GB address spaces to individual processes with more than 4GB total physical backing.')
