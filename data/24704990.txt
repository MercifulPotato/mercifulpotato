Item(by='db48x', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602040757, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24704937, text='You need a pump (and a filter) to recirculate the water, a heater for hotter water, and you need volume so that you can arrange everything so that they aren&#x27;t touching and can all be washed. With a washing machine the size of half my sink, I&#x27;d be able to wash my largest pot and nothing else. With my small dishwasher, I can wash my largest pot plus almost everything else that&#x27;s likely to need washing. Plus you&#x27;ll want a seal that can keep in the steam, and some insulation to reduce the amount of energy you use continually reheating the water. Where does the lid go when you&#x27;re not washing something? Does it lie flat on the counter next to the sink, taking up space you won&#x27;t be able to use for anything else? What about the hinges? They&#x27;ll be splashed with water repeatedly when you use the sink, so they won&#x27;t last forever.<p>But sure, you could build a dishwasher into a sink; it&#x27;s not impossible.')
