My first attitude was that it was useless after hearing years of complaints. This machine has the physical escape key and I believe that combination really works.<p>I&#x27;m not using the Touch Bar constantly, even when typing on the built-in keyboard. Discovery is slow because you have to become familiar with which options are available in specific applications and for specific contexts. This is a legitimate problem. Over time I&#x27;ve built up a decent number of uses that I know are there and make life better.<p>The negativity is unreasonable to me. It would be very interesting to know how much a Touch Bar increases the cost of each MacBook. To me it seems Apple took a section of the keyboard very, very few users used and replaced it with something that probably can be helpful to most users at least some of the time.')
