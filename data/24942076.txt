There&#x27;s a pretty large library of such games hosted on pico-8&#x27;s website.<p>There are some open-source alternatives like TIC-80 and PixelVision8. Personally, I&#x27;d only recommend them over pico-8 if $15 is a serious barrier or open source is an absolute must. They all have their various strengths and weaknesses, but pico-8 seems to be the best optimized for pure, unadulterated fun.')
