The key thing I think I may have done differently is that I got involved in things that provided opportunities to be engaged with people.<p>For example; I joined my local Masonic lodge and started doing Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu.  Between those two things alone I find I have regular enough interactions with a variety of different people that I naturally find out about, and am invited to events and activities that more than make up for the loss of social media.<p>I&#x27;m not suggesting everyone join a Masonic lodge (obviously) or take up Jiu-Jitsu.  There are a great number of things everyone can do that gets them around other people in a way that is natural and fulfilling.<p>Also--and this, I find, is critical--all my old friends are still friends and they call or email or text me and I them.  Anyone who claimed to be my friend but couldn&#x27;t be bothered to get in touch with me after I dropped social media was never a very good friend to begin with.')
