I suggest trying wrestling! It sounds funny, but it can be a serious workout. I mean the Greco Roman style. You don&#x27;t have to stand. Your bed can be the limits(boundaries.) It&#x27;s all about pressure, strain, push, pull. And it can be a lot of fun, and produce laughter.\nSecond choice, pillow fights. Thats another proven workout, that&#x27;s fun!')
