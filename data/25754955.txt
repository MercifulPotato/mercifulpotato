As I understand it, essential workers can continue working whether or not they&#x27;re vaccinated (yes, some will get seriously sick, but it won&#x27;t significantly impact the economy). Rather, we want to vaccinate them earlier than non-essential workers because they&#x27;re more vulnerable by the riskier nature of their work. However, they&#x27;re not more vulnerable than the elderly<p>The key point here is that essential workers have a much greater exposure to COVID and much less control over the degree to which they are exposed to COVID.  Most elderly people don&#x27;t work.  Those that do (and don&#x27;t qualify as essential workers) can work from home.  It is much easier for these people to minimize exposure.  None of this logic has anything to do with race or any other form of diversity.  None of this logic is questioning the fact that COVID is more dangerous to the elderly if they contract it.  It is simply recognizing that from an ethical perspective it is likely fairer to prioritize the vaccine for people who are least able to minimize their own risk of exposure.<p>&gt;and yet the CDC recommends prioritizing them over the elderly because the elderly are disproportionately white while essential workers are disproportionately non-white. At least, this is how I understand the argument.<p>Diversity factored into 1 of 3 subcategories in 1 of 3 top level categories.  It isn&#x27;t fair to say the &quot;CDC recommends prioritizing [essential workers] over the elderly because the elderly are disproportionately white&quot; when it is just one piece of a much larger and more nuanced discussion.')
