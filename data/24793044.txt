Even languages most people think of as pure (like Haskell) indeed have side effects of various sorts (exceptions, nontermination), which are often considered relatively &quot;benign&quot; but still greatly complicate proofs about and within its type system; and depending on how strictly you define &quot;effect&quot; even a language like Coq or Agda may not qualify (is allocation an effect?  What about OOM?).')
