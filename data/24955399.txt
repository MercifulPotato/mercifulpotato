However, in this specific case, it appears that as of the current code, not many external contributions remain.<p>The author of the original issue in the meantime forked the repo and continued to document the issue there [1] as it was being constantly closed, but as is evident from his own `git blame` analysis, most of the contributions are from staff, and the external contributions are basically negligible.<p>There&#x27;s one author with 30 LOC, one with 10 LOC, and the remaining 12 contributors average less then 4 LOC each.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;christianbundy&#x2F;octotree&#x2F;issues&#x2F;1#issuecomment-719981875" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;christianbundy&#x2F;octotree&#x2F;issues&#x2F;1#issuecom...</a>')
