For a beginner cook it is great.  I found that it produces inconsistent sizes for anything besides &quot;mince&quot; so yeah, garlic works, or onions for salsa.  Nowadays I would recommend taking a knife course (or at least some youtube studying) and using the chopping time as a break from thinking about work.  Prep work can be cathartic, and even if time-consuming it is not time-sensitive.<p>Edit: realize my comment sounds negative about that chopper.  while I don&#x27;t use it anymore, it&#x27;s cheap enough and worth trying if you are on the fence or don&#x27;t enjoy the prepwork.')
