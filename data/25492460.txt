I advocate that a computer science or software eng curriculum strongly needs a semester or two of the history of the practice. What roads have been taken in the most important areas and examine all the dead ends and why they were abandoned.<p>So much of the new-shiny is just a badly implemented rehash of ideas that we already know didn&#x27;t work out in the past, if we only knew. Because we mostly don&#x27;t, as an industry, it seems like an exciting new idea.')
