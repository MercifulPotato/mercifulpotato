People leave, focus changes, memories fade.<p>It&#x27;s not a unique occurrence that I wonder &quot;why the hell is it done like this?!&quot; only to find it was a decision I was part of with developers who had left in a least-worst-change trade-off. Jira or products like it help us avoid repeating the same mistakes.<p>Put another way, part of the art is not just the code, but the code that&#x27;s not there. Jira&#x2F;tickets are one way of managing that data.<p>And at other times, it&#x27;s just a tool for bureaucracy, I get that.')
