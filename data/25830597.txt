One reason is to become aware of the thoughts and behaviors that trigger them. This has a surface-level application: dismantle negative triggers, build positive triggers, feel good more often.<p>But another mechanism is meta. One of the worst elements of depression is the belief, &quot;I feel terrible all the time for no reason, and I always will.&quot; This probably isn&#x27;t true. You feel terrible sometimes, for reasons you can identify. You also feel okay sometimes. The trick is to notice this. CBT putting it in your face on a regular basis can force an update to your model of feeling. Then when a negative emotion comes, it doesn&#x27;t have a big powerful story about helplessness and permanence to interact with. The story was responsible for most of the suffering. Without it, the emotion passes in less time and with less intensity.<p>The waves roll in and then collapse. Tides change, moon phase changes, weather changes, seasons change. You don&#x27;t have to believe the whole thing is going to stop to appreciate that conditions will be favorable again.')
