I haven&#x27;t had luck finding a new position :(<p>I&#x27;ve looked at data engineering, systems engineering, signal processing, project management, and architecture roles. I&#x27;ve done some of each of those in my current position and I&#x27;ve enjoyed them much more than the machine learning I&#x27;ve done. But I also don&#x27;t feel like I know enough of any of them where I could make a lateral move and have any degree of success.<p>When I&#x27;ve applied to jobs, I&#x27;ve sometimes gotten an interview for the role I applied for and got one job offer that turned out to involve a substantial pay cut. When I hear back, I feel like most of the time the person who calls me wants me to work on their data science team and then gets kind of confused (and sometimes offended) when I tell them I don&#x27;t want to work as a data scientist anymore.<p>How do I make this transition? Is it just a matter of time or do I need to approach things from a different angle?')
