Item(by='toast0', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611694598, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25920117, text='&gt; But in the case of web-applications, there&#x27;s probably no way to really predict the &quot;cost of performance&quot; before you start processing the service request (what if its a Facebook request to a really old photograph? Facebook may have to pull it out of long-term storage before it can service that request. There&#x27;s no real way to know at the load-balancer whether a picture-request would be in the cache or not... at least, not before you process the request to begin with!)<p>I worked at Facebook, but didn&#x27;t touch anything related to this; so this is all conjecture.<p>The load balancer can&#x27;t (or shouldn&#x27;t) predict the cost to service a request; but the thing that generated the url for the image could; and that prediction could be passed in the url for the balancer to act on.<p>If you really need to balance by performance, it&#x27;s probably simpler and accurate enough to provide frequent load feedback to the balancer. As long as you have a lot of requests, simple things work pretty well.')
