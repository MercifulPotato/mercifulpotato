You never know what opportunities exist unless you look. What you thought was your first choice might not be where you actually end up.<p>2)If you do go through the process of sending out resumes and interviewing, go into it with the attitude that if you get an acceptable offer for what you think will be an interesting position, accept it and move on.<p>As long as you leave a job on good terms, with a two week notice, you can always go back in the future. Never (never!) burn bridges. The world is small, and networks matter!<p>Always follow up with any job offer that you receive but turn down. Keep it short, keep it factual, be polite. Thank them for the opportunity. Note that if a company gives you a good faith offer, and you turn it down, it will be harder to get an interview there in the short term. In the long term, they took a chance on you once, they&#x27;ll take a chance again.<p>Network, network, network. I cannot stress that enough.<p>With the final note. Never (never) burn bridges.')
