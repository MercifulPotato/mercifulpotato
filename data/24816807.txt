Item(by='KronisLV', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603017026, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24816689, text='For starters, Podman doesn&#x27;t support anything like Docker Compose ( <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.docker.com&#x2F;compose&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.docker.com&#x2F;compose&#x2F;</a> ) out of the box, which makes it harder to orchestrate deployments that need multiple containers locally.<p>There is podman-compose as a drop-in ( <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;containers&#x2F;podman-compose" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;containers&#x2F;podman-compose</a> ), but last i checked it wasn&#x27;t supported by or developed by RedHat themselves, hence no first-party support. In addition to that, the feature parity just isn&#x27;t there.<p>Also, there is no docker.sock, which tools like Portainer ( <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.portainer.io&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.portainer.io&#x2F;</a> ) need to interface with Docker, hence no control web apps and other tools are available for Podman.<p>Besides that, there is also Docker Swarm ( <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.docker.com&#x2F;engine&#x2F;swarm&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.docker.com&#x2F;engine&#x2F;swarm&#x2F;</a> ), a lightweight orchestrator which can be a simpler alternative to Kubernetes in smaller and more resource constrained environments, which isn&#x27;t available in Podman. In addition to that, Docker Swarm&#x27;s deployment format is also extremely similar to the Docker Compose one (with additional functionality added for multi node clusters), which allowed for getting started with container orchestration in a more simple fashion.<p>If you&#x27;re in a Kubernetes shop and simply need something for Kubernetes to interface with, then containerd (which Docker uses internally) and Podman are largely comparable.<p>In other circumstances, Podman doesn&#x27;t have complete feature parity with Docker, despite popular claims and despite its architectural improvements.')
