I can imagine scenarios where the contact took place towards the rear of the car (and therefore not at the primary focus of sensor attention), the cyclist goes careening off to the left or right and the car blithely goes on. I&#x27;m not saying such a scenario is impossible with a traditional car but it&#x27;s a dam sight harder to ignore.')
