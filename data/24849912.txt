Their changes <i>were</i> more efficient logically, and I&#x27;m sure it would have saved a few milliseconds per call - whereas my claim of increased complexity was a more subjective judgement.<p>In the end, it came down to trust&#x2F;authority - but they might have been more convinced, or felt better about the decision, if I could produce some numbers from my side, like a measurement of cyclomatic complexity based on static code analaysis.<p>Perhaps that could have justified the existing higher abstractions, to weigh their (almost negligible) performance cost against the value of reduced complexity - keeping the code base simpler to understand.')
