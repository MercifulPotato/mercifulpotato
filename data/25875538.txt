Most inserts don&#x27;t split pages, so are around n worst case pages, but once in a while you get 2n updates where most of them are half full, and so compress better.<p>So how does that compare to logical replication? (Also I imagine packet size plays a role, since you have to flush the stream quite frequently, right? 1000 bytes isn&#x27;t much more expensive than 431)')
