I deleted my Facebook and Instagram accounts nearly a decade ago. Recently, I&#x27;ve been searching for artists to commission for work, but everyone uses Insta for their portfolios now instead of an openly accessible website. Browsing Insta without an account is a PITA because you constantly get blocked from content until you log in. So I caved and tried creating an account.<p>Go to the registration screen, enter all of my info, and submit. Get a weird error message along the lines of &quot;your information is incorrect; please enter your phone number to verify your info.&quot; Enter my phone number; &quot;your information is incorrect.&quot; Get booted back to the login screen. Try to log in using the credentials I just entered and get an invalid email address message. Try to create an account again with that email; &quot;that email address can not be used to create an account.&quot;<p>So I tried two more times, first registering with all the correct personal info and a different email address. Same result. Try again with yet another email address that I have never used to sign up for an account, this time entering random personal information, using a different web browser, and connecting to the hotspot on my phone instead of my wifi. Still the same result. Ask my significant other to log in on my browser with her account; works just fine.<p>Funny, why do they claim to know my personal information better than me? How would they even know all of that information? I don&#x27;t know what criteria they are using to decide that I am not a valid person and therefore not allowed to sign up for their service. The only option I have left is to create a new email address and try registering an account using it and some fake identity.')
