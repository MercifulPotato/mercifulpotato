For example the news that Obama wanted to renegotiate the &quot;SOFA&quot; agreement before he even took office made me regret my decision to vote for him in `08 and I did not vote for him again in 2012 because I already knew he would not end those wars.<p>The only actionable thing I&#x27;ve really done since is keep others informed via FB of our progress to end those wars but for the most part interest in that fell off long ago with their yellow ribbon car magnets so it hasn&#x27;t amounted to much real action.')
