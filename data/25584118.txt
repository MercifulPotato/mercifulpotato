It boggles the mind that anyone could have believed that replacing many of the core productive bits of the economy with fluff like management (and ownership), finance, and hospitality would lead to anything but weakness.  It&#x27;s not like people in other countries are going to do most of the actual productive work and continue to let Americans lord over them indefinitely.  Under that plan, America would just seem to climb until everyone else realizes there&#x27;s no there there anymore, and then it will fall to a 3rd world economy who&#x27;s main advantage is people there will be desperate enough to work for low wages for the new wealthy countries.  Of course, some Americans will experience wealth over their lifetimes as that happens, but they&#x27;re basically getting fat and happy by eating their family&#x27;s seed corn.')
