Item(by='evrydayhustling', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602335812, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24735718, text='This goes against my intuition in several ways, so I&#x27;m curious if there are examples to discuss.<p>- Scaled deployments have Segment connecting many systems run by many teams, so the cost of coordinating a replacement can go up just as fast as Segment&#x27;s.<p>- High growth companies have fires everywhere, including other infrastructure, so it&#x27;s not obvious that Segment makes it to the top of the list.<p>- I expect the bulk of Segment revenue is not from companies with &quot;high growth&quot; by HN standards but scaled enterprises with high complexity and lower growth.  These can dominate net rev retention even if there are smaller companies growing faster.<p>Again, no data to support the above, just a different narrative.  Anyone have facts?')
