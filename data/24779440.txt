I don&#x27;t know if they are legally banned or whether it just culturally lacks a market, so I&#x27;m openly asking that question here to people who understand German labor laws.<p>The only overnight operations during my short time there I really saw were essential services such as in security, hospitals, and transportation industries.<p>Night shift workers do take a huge health hit, both physical and mental, and a social life hit, and I could see a government like Germany&#x27;s putting some controls over night shifts for non-essential services, so wondering if that was the case or not.')
