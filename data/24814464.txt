It&#x27;s particularly bad for conferences with lots of people - the audio quality is choppy and often unintelligible, and often the audio will just cut out entirely after a couple of minutes. Moreover, the video and screen sharing features don&#x27;t seem to work reliably either.<p>I&#x27;ve had drastically better experiences with basically any other system: Google, Microsoft, Cisco&#x2F;Webex, Gotomeeting.... all seem to actually work. I haven&#x27;t tried Apple&#x27;s group facetime but they&#x27;d have to work pretty hard to make it worse than Zoom.')
