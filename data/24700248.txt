App Platform supports custom domains today, but we do plan to roll out enhanced functionality around domain management very soon. Today we support pre&#x2F;post-deploy jobs with cron job coming soon, as well as a persistent storage solution. In addition, beyond the $7 price point we support MySQL&#x2F;Redis&#x2F;Postgres as opposed to just Postgres. We will also be rolling out App Platform to many more of our DigitalOcean regions very soon and have an exciting roadmap what we can&#x27;t wait to get built out and released. Thanks so much for checking out the product and providing your feedback.')
