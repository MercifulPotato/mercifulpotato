Perhaps Uber doesn&#x27;t even maintain the dataset for addresses themselves either, and is using a service from someone else, like Google.<p>This kind of makes you think that in this complexity of distributed, scalable systems with microservices, message queues and other systems, eventually the complexity will be too much to actually understand and maintain - be it because of a low bus factor and people leaving due to churn rate, or extremely high effort needed for maintenance.')
