I lost a number of friends because I was so convinced I was morally correct and they were wrong on topics like immigration and capitalism.<p>I&#x27;m aware of a few cases now where subscribers of TYT have killed people, but it&#x27;s hard to know how direct those conncetions are. I know for me TYT definitely misled me and caused me to believe everyone who didn&#x27;t share my views were evil and I have wondered before what I might have done had I been a violent person.<p>I don&#x27;t really know what the answer to this is. I know for me YouTube was also part of my deradicalisation process. Listening to people like Sam Haris allowed me to shift into the centrist I am today.<p>Given the very low numbers of people who people who commit violent acts like these part of me wonders if we exaggrate the problem. Young men have always been fairly poltically radical. I think it would be incorrect to assume radicalisation is any higher today because of the internet. These types of events have happened for a very long time.<p>I know often findings like this are followed by calls for censorship, and it does bother me today when I see content online obviously lying or misleding people about news stories to push a certain narrative. Still, given how poor of a job YouTube and factcheckers have done at trying to combat this stuff (as they often also have their own political agenda) I&#x27;m personally not convinced censorship is the right answer.')
