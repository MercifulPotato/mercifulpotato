Are you suggesting we should prioritize the aggressors over their victims, just because they happen to look like you? Or because they&#x27;re at a higher risk of committing terrorism?<p>Also, that doesn&#x27;t scale. Getting someone a therapist costs a good amount of money, getting them on meds is dirt cheap. Convincing someone who doesn&#x27;t trust you very much they should go see a therapist is going to be a very hard sell.')
