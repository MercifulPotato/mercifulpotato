Thanks to the increased collateral requirements, They were facing liquidity issues and had to restrict buying of GME.  There was no way around that.<p>The problem is that they continued to allow customers to sell GME and lied about their rationale to their customers who could no longer buy it.<p>If a large broker exclusively allows a stock to be sold, not bought, the trajectory of that stock&#x27;s value will be pushed downward.  It&#x27;s in RH&#x27;s interest to see GME go down (or at least go up slower).  Lower prices mean less of a liquidity problem for them.  It also <i>really</i> helps out their biggest market maker partner.<p>It would not have been a conflict of interest if RH prevented customers from trading GME outright while they got their liquidity issue patched up.  It would piss off potential sellers and, if the stock price went down, would result in objective losses for them which, IMO, RH should be liable for.  That is a tough choice to make, but it would eliminate the conflict of interest.<p>A stockbroker&#x27;s value is in enabling customers to easily trade their stocks.  If they cannot do that, they deserve damage to their reputation.  If they cannot do that without engaging in conflicts of interest, they deserve to be investigated.  Last week they failed on both fronts.')
