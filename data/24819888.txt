Those are not towns with very small minority populations. The people who are fleeing are the ones that have the means to, and work remotely.<p>&gt;Residents there feel increasingly threatened by scenes of racial protests in the state, fearing that somehow they&#x27;ll be subject to oppression.<p>Residents in SF, Oakland, etc. are tired of their cities being looted, tired of stepping over feces, urine pools, and needles, tired of being accosted by the aggressive homeless, tired of paying some of the world&#x27;s highest rent for a city they can no longer enjoy (shut down), tired of being robbed and victimized by &quot;teens&quot;, etc.<p>&gt;And for my own insight on this, people are not usually entirely honest, except when in company of others of similar mindset.<p>I agree. Liberals and leftists screech about how wonderful diversity is, but always end up fleeing for whiter, more homogeneous cities, states, and countries.<p>&gt;Over hearing at a family gathering, I learned that the main reason a relative of mine is leaving california for maine is because &quot;there will be less crime because there are fewer black people&quot;<p>That is an objective fact though, whether you like it or not. The amount of mental gymnastics leftists have to play around that is astounding.')
