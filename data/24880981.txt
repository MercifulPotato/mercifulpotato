Also the usage of other accounts is likely a symptom of a post limit. Either he can respond to you with another account, or he can ignore you because he can&#x27;t respond with the same account. Either way these actions are not sanctioned by the site.<p>&gt;You keep comparing apples to oranges in order to fabricate an argument. There is no systemic genocide perpetrated by the USA<p>You can call it whatever you want. There was a sponsoring of troops by the US to slaughter people abroad for over a decade.
