And any attempt to spin this as &quot;solving a real problem&quot; ignores that Google employs tens of thousands of professionals who are trained to follow the approach above in response to solving problems. This is a business decision and the stakeholders aren&#x27;t ad-blockers, they&#x27;re ad networks.')
