Yes, I guess if the book isn&#x27;t about humans at all then he has the ultimate get-out clause with respect to the plausibility of utopia. It would be less interesting to me though. The interesting thing about post-scarcity utopias, to me, are questions like &quot;would it work&quot;, &quot;if yes how do we get there&quot; and so on. Whether utopia would work for theoretical beings is ... well, it&#x27;s sci-fi, so fine, whatever. But I guess it wouldn&#x27;t have any relevance to questions of politics or ideology.')
