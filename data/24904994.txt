Maybe that is what you mean &quot;hackable no-code&quot;? (edit: you mention low-code in your landing page) If that&#x27;s the case, and since the lingo in the no&#x2F;low-code movement is already established, maybe it&#x27;s better to use it so people have a better understanding of what they can do with your platform, faster.<p>Trying to create a project fast, I can quickly understand there is a learning curve required. At least steeper than other platforms. It would be very valuable if the first thing that happens when I log in for the first time is a walkthrough. Also, give some pre-made templates so people can modify those to their need. And by doing that they will learn the platform.<p>First impression is that I don&#x27;t quickly understand if what I can create with abstra is websites, Saas, mobile apps, etc.<p>-All the best!')
