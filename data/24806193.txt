Item(by='barumi', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602892890, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24805837, text='&gt; But there does seem to be a difference between say using FLOSS project X as a dependency in my app vs AWS tweaking it, introducing it as a direct competitor to X, and leveraging their huge marketshare to sell it.<p>Is there really a difference at all? You&#x27;re complaining that a managed service is somehow &quot;a direct competitor&quot;. Compete in what? I mean, am I really competing with the project if I get a few instances up and running?<p>By your line of reasoning, they are actually helping the project grow and establish itself as relevant piece of infrastructure. Somehow I don&#x27;t see this being used as a justification to demand a share of the revenue the other way around.<p>In the end, all I see is people complaining that someone who uses a project that was always freely distributed happens to have deep wallets, and somehow hey feel entitled to some cash just because a third party is rich. Where does this make any sense?')
