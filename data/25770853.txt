As someone who should probably step away from my computer <i>a lot</i> more though, I&#x27;ve got to disagree that &quot;it&#x27;s getting late&quot; isn&#x27;t a valid excuse, because I use it all the time and I mean it when I say it (i.e. it&#x27;s 4am and I have to wake up for work in 6 hours).')
