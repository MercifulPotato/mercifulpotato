So if your program didn&#x27;t fit into memory, a good chunk of it could run in an overlay area.<p>So for example your code could have an always-resident portion  say from 0 to 100000 octal (the lowest half of memory) and an overlay area from 100000 to 140000. We had a program that has an input, calculation and runtime phase so it suited the overlay model; programs that needed all their code in memory at the same time by comparison would not be suited to overlays (especially on 8&quot; floppies, where loading an overlay was accompanied by plenty of mechanical noise).')
