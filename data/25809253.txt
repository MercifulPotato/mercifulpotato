So her “projection” isn’t based on some random beliefs, but grounded in a relatively rare shared experience with the subject of her study.<p>In addition, historians and anthropologists routinely project to varying degrees in trying to interpret the “why” of history in addition to the “what”. And the fact that there’s a lot of speculation going on, is my default expectation as reader. No need to write it into every article on historical interpretation.<p>So I find her observations an interesting avenue of interpreting some aspects of Beethoven’s musical evolution.')
