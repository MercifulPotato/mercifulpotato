Law ends up used selectively to enforce order. White collar criminals aren&#x27;t disrupting the order of things, so no need to prosecute them.<p>In America, the correct phrase should be &quot;rule of law.&quot; Under a &quot;rule of law&quot; society, white collar criminals would be prosecuted. As to aggressively, no, not necessarily. Predictably and fairly are much more important.<p>&gt; Many conceptions of the Rule of Law place great emphasis on legal certainty, predictability, and settlement, on the determinacy of the norms that are upheld in society, and on the reliable character of their administration by the state. Citizens—it is said—need predictability in the conduct of their lives and businesses. There may be no getting away from legal constraint in the circumstances of modern life, but freedom is possible nevertheless if people know in advance how the law will operate and how they have to act if they are to avoid its having a detrimental impact on their affairs.
