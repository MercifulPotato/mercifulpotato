I almost wonder if this zero tolerance mindset creates an all-or-nothing mentality in kids when they realize they aren&#x27;t allowed  to defend themselves. And if this mentality (equivocating criminal record and expulsion with the end of one&#x27;s opportunities and life) leads to more extreme behavior - hey, if the cops are going to be called for punching my bully, why not take it further?')
