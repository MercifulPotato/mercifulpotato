That wasn&#x27;t even a large outage, just constant failures all over because the ice weighed down and broke power lines. 34 people died, a huge number of farm animals died, and that was with the military being called in to try to help everyone.<p>You take out all electricity to a major city like Toronto in the dead of winter for a week, thousands would die from the cold.<p>Take your &quot;liveable climate privilege&quot; outta here, lol.<p>[0]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;January_1998_North_American_ice_storm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;January_1998_North_American_...</a>')
