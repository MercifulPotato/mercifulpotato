AFAIK wake word activates the advanced speech recognition. Wake word speech recognizer is a more &quot;primitive&quot; speech recognition model, which can&#x27;t understand anything other than the words it was trained for (like &quot;Hey Google&quot; or &quot;Alexa&quot;).<p>So, now, removing it means the advanced speech recognition runs all the time? Which is always &#x27;on&#x27; and can understand everything spoken? Sounds like potential privacy invasion.')
