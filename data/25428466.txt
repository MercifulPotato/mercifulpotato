Whataboutism is  even worse for the environment, there is always something you can do better and life has many facets. The danger of your comment is that people use this to justify not doing anything while continuing to fly and act irresponsibly, and pretend that they have some kind of moral high ground.<p>Even a small change like one individual not eating palm oil can be the first step towards a sustainable planet.')
