Hardly anyone ever mentioned that the US started meddling in Russian elections more than two decades earlier.<p>Granted, I think the current &#x27;setup&#x27; with the US being the archenemy suits the Russian government just fine for domestic audiences, which is especially ironic as it actively hurts real, independent, democratic movements.<p>It also suits US defense contractors, &#x27;cyber&#x27; experts and various grifters offering to combat misinformation.')
