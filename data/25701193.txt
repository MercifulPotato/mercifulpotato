It&#x27;s like they looked at Bash and thought &quot;hmm, too safe&quot;.<p>Everything is a string, even lists are just semicolon-separated lists. The argument expansions rules for calling functions are literally impossible to remember. All variables are implicitly defined as empty strings. Typos silently break things. `if` is completely broken. The separation of the configure step from the build step is needlessly confusing and makes some things impossible. This is just scratching the surface.<p>It does have a couple of redeeming qualities: they have a pretty great versioning mechanism which allows them to make breaking changes. Though inexplicably they haven&#x27;t used it to fix any fundamental flaws, only little tweaks. And most importantly it has been around for ages so loads of the many many weird C++ compilation knobs have been solved.')
