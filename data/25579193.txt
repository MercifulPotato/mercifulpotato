He has a &quot;foreign sounding&quot; name and there were no deaths or nighttime SWAT raids as a result of the bogus bomb threat his teacher called in.<p>&gt;Ever hear of a woman called Breonna?<p>If you&#x27;re referring to Breonna Taylor, I don&#x27;t think she was accused of building bombs and no-knock warrants are an entirely different issue IMO from warrantless searches resulting from bomb threats.<p>From perusing the wikipedia list of unsuccessful terrorist attacks [1], I didn&#x27;t notice a single alleged bombmaker who was killed by police. Including many who were foreign-born and who were of African-American or Middle Eastern descent.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_unsuccessful_terrorist_plots_in_the_United_States_post-9&#x2F;11" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_unsuccessful_terrorist...</a>')
