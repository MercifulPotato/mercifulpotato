Let&#x27;s ask some top politicians and government agency directors, do you think you&#x27;ll have it in control? Of course they are going to answer yes. Let&#x27;s run a big story: &quot;Country X has crisis in control&quot;. What is the value of news like this?<p>What if in March, a Finnish news agency had interviewed US president Trump&#x27;s office and maybe US CDC Director Dr. Redfield, asked them if US has the pandemic situation in control, and after they replied yes, then ran a story &quot;US has pandemic in control&quot;? Would you say that&#x27;s ok â€“ after all they&#x27;d be honest about the limits of their reporting, and are just citing their sources.')
