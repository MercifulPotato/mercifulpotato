Geocentrism required epicycles. Then Keppler came up with his ellipses. Then Newton unified celestial and terrestrial laws. Maxwell &amp; Einstein allowed us to view time as less special dimension than we thought it wasâ€¦<p>I won&#x27;t presume about the initial state of the universe, to the extent such a notion is even meaningful. But the fact that it is governed by mathematics, and relatively simple maths at that, sounds likelier and likelier every quarter-century.<p>And I&#x27;m not even talking about everyday life, where we can observe in practice that the simplest theories about who ate the last cookie (little Mike, who lives in the house) are more often true than the more outlandish ones (magical imps, which we never witnessed).')
