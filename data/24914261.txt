So as long as people don&#x27;t notice, you can get pretty much anything passed in the US. It works even better when all the well funded special interests hilariously decided to move to the far fringe edges of their respective parties and will never get consensus. Lowers the barrier for consensus for the rest of us since most of Congress is just waiting for things that can have bi-partisan support. Been a fun and cheaper than usual few years for me.......')
