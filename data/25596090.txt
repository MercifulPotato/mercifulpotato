I personally would lie in this case, and I believe most Quakers would as well.<p>A more subtle example: exaggerating the effects of climate change to motivate people to take action, for example claiming that Miami will be underwater in our lifetimes if we don&#x27;t act. A lot of people I know <i>do</i> fudge the truth in this way, even if it isn&#x27;t a conscious act of lying. I personally am not in favor, partly as a matter of faith, partly because I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s an effective longer term strategy, but at the same time I think the argument for it is defensible.<p>BTW, a very good inquiry using that particular example is Dan Ariely&#x27;s interview on Amanpour: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=aLheBtBpZQw" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=aLheBtBpZQw</a> ; this example comes up at about 14:10. I can really recommend watching it, as Ariely is really trying to understand human behavior, not just retconning principles to justify his personal positions.')
