Even on my work Windows laptop, I can never be sure that it will suspend, and half the time you wish it wouldn&#x27;t because then your VPN connection will time out, etc.  Thus people walking around with their laptop open a couple of inches.  Much better to completely disable auto-suspend and get used to just pushing the suspend button and waiting the couple of seconds for it to react and <i>then</i> closing the lid.<p>That&#x27;s the main reason I can&#x27;t even be bothered to configure this (as in from the GUI) on my Linux machines.')
