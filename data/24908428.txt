It&#x27;s definitely an exercise worth taking. Nice transfer size, and I&#x27;m happy to see that the code is quite maintainable.<p>I do my wordsandbuttons.online in similar spirit: no dependencies, and all the pages are kept below 64KB. However, as the code base grows, I&#x27;m starting to employ scripts to do the grunt work for me. So while I don&#x27;t have dependencies per se, code patterns become dependency it its own right.')
