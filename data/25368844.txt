Apple&#x27;s ARM chips are pretty fast but their GPUs aren&#x27;t capable of rendering intensive 3D games at native resolutions yet, partially because Apple&#x27;s displays are so high-res. Previous generations Apple devices all had GPUs in them that I honestly consider lacking for the price you pay for the hardware.<p>The best macOS gaming rigs I can think off are the mac Pros, but those aren&#x27;t what most people are running macOS on.<p>At least Linux users can use the powerful NVIDIA cards in most of their machines. I suppose it&#x27;s possible to hook up an RX 6800 through Thunderbolt, but that&#x27;s quite a bulky and expensive solution that even fewer people use.<p>You can see this in the Steam survey. There are more macOS gamers than Linux gamers, but the gamers on macOS are almost always running on an Intel GPU whereas Linux gamers are much more common to run a dedicated GPU from AMD or NVIDIA.<p>It makes sense to port Tabletop Simulator or Cooking Simulator to macOS, but for Cyberpunk you&#x27;re just not finding enough customers. Where Linux lacks the stability of the software stack, macOS lacks the hardware to run the stable-ish software stack on.<p>With CD:PR being generally reasonably DRM-free, I do wonder how much &quot;hidden&quot; Linux customers they have in their sales. Trying to get AAA-games from Steam to run in Linux is usually a fight with DRM software and the only way to win that fight is to pretend to be running Windows. If you can download the game from GOG without DRM, like CP2077, you&#x27;ll probably end up with more Linux customers than other studios manage to gather and your OS statistics will make more sense. There&#x27;s no way in hell that Linux will get any significant margin on the gaming market any time soon, but if the market will ever begin shifting, we&#x27;ll probably see it in a studio like CD:PR.')
