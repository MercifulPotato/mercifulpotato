I ran a couple benchmarks to prove the cap was working, and then just kept it at 1.0 for a few months, to prove my point.<p>It made a bigger difference on my ARM SBC, where I tried capping the 1,000 MHz chip to 200 or 400 MHz. That chip was already CPU-bound for many tasks and could barely even run Firefox. Amdahl&#x27;s Law kicked in - Halving the frequency made _everything_ twice as slow, because almost everything was waiting on the CPU.')
