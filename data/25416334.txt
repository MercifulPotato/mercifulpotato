It was rarely mentioned, but Windows has kind of the same with SmartScreen, for the same stated purpose of security.<p>But much more important than Apple&#x27;s or Microsoft&#x27;s evilness level, I believe we should have a discussion about what to do about malware which is code-signed. It&#x27;s not difficult to imagine that a determined criminal can find at least one badly secured 3rd party developer whose code-signing certificates can be abused.<p>This is not hypothetical, for example see this Microsoft postmortem:\nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;blogs.microsoft.com&#x2F;on-the-issues&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;13&#x2F;customers-protect-nation-state-cyberattacks&#x2F;\nwhich is about this attack:\nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.solarwinds.com&#x2F;securityadvisory<p>Modern software will update itself all the time and it&#x27;s sending back and forth data to clouds all the time, so there are very few heuristics left to go by to determine if a given piece of code-signed application downloading executables and uploading data is a useful app like WhatsApp or a malware to be stopped.<p>What&#x27;s your take?')
