You can target a diseased brain region (for stimulation, surgical removal, etc) or a mutated gene for deletion, but it&#x27;s not clear to me what &quot;targeting&quot; something abstract like a disease would mean.<p>`Ameliorate` means &quot;to make something better&quot;. It has the added implication that the situation is quite bad, but the intervention won&#x27;t totally restore things to normality. This is exactly what I meant: we don&#x27;t think this intervention is a silver bullet that will reverse the disease, but it seems like it should help--and our proposal is cheap and easy, so...consider it.<p>This also keeps Reviewer #2 from busting your chops over how effective the proposed strategies might be, which you&#x27;d be inviting with a stronger word like &quot;cure.&quot;<p>Here, you could also use `treat`, which feels like an intermediate-strength claim. &quot;Manage&quot; might work too though that comes with implications of its own too: to me, managing a disease suggests that it is temporarily being held at bay, or the negative consequences are averted without fixing the underlying problem.<p>I learned `ameliorate` in junior high--and was writing for people with PhDs--so I went for it.')
