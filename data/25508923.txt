So I had to make do with birthday&#x2F;christmas gifts and pocket money. During my university days my budget was pretty much just rent and food. I could afford a PC, maybe a console for playing games, but hardly any games unless I&#x27;d buy used ones.<p>Movies and TV shows, all pirated. I&#x27;d buy some DVDs if I was really obsessed with something.<p>Eventually I got a job, and streaming &#x2F; affordable PC games caught up with reality and met me half-way.<p>If you put a price on everything I pirated before that time, I&#x27;m not sure if I could have afforded that even if I stopped paying rent and buying food completely.<p>Too bad streaming is getting more fractured again. If I want to watch 6 TV shows, I have to subscribe to 5 streaming services.')
