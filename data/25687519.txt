And for a lot of us that run remote businesses, we don&#x27;t deal in cash and therefore, don&#x27;t need access to brick-and-mortar branches (which for me, is one of the few redeeming qualities for a larger bank).<p>However I will say... that the Achilles heel for these newer digital banks is customer service. If they&#x27;re going to lean into doing everything on the internet, they need to be investing heavily into live customer support. That&#x27;s been an issue for me with several banks in the past.')
