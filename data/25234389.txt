Item(by='arcticbull', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606527935, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25234340, text='So there&#x27;s a few things here.<p>&gt; Only there is no &#x27;oppressive system&#x27;.<p>I think this is open to debate, and it&#x27;s not fair to simply state it as fact given the evidence.<p>&gt; ... but an individual officer responding to 911 call and standing against an agitated individual with a weapon and who&#x27;s about to attack.<p>Indeed, but that&#x27;s also overly simplistic. A violent response is justified but isn&#x27;t necessarily preferred, and degree matters. Proper training in de-escalation, hand-to-hand combat, safety equipment, non-lethal, less-lethal and eventually if necessary lethal weapons are all available to officers.<p>How you pick is a systemic question. How much training and what kind is a systemic question. And the results are measurable. Indeed Canada&#x27;s per capita police shooting rate is 1&#x2F;10th that of the US -- and Canada&#x27;s pretty high as far as rich countries go! New Zealand police killed 2 or 3 people since 2015.<p>It&#x27;s overwhelmingly not a kill-or-be-killed situation, and further, the job of an officer is not to eliminate 100% of harm potential for themselves at all costs -- but instead to resolve the situation with the optimal outcome for all involved. The job is in fact risky, which is why the profession is so highly regarded.<p>I maintain the issue is one of accountability, between police not being held accountable for gross negligence, the unequivocal support from the police unions and of course, qualified immunity. I suspect people just want to feel like they&#x27;re being treated fairly. If you don&#x27;t hold anyone accountable it creates a negative feedback loop breaking trust and making the job more dangerous for everyone.')
