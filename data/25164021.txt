One can understand Hawking’s impatience – or downright exasperation – with some of the half-baked notions put around by refuseniks and would-be engageniks alike.<p>People justifiably take issue with some aspects of philosophy (postmodernism, for example, and its misuse of scientific terminology, as exposed in Bricmont &amp; Sokal&#x27;s <i>Intellectual Impostors</i>), and a few scientists certainly overshoot in their criticism, or make it unduly broad.<p>But I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s accurate to claim that &quot;today the &#x27;public intellectuals&#x27; often say philosophy is outdated or useless&quot;.<p>Lastly, even if one thinks that philosophy is largely useless today, that doesn&#x27;t imply at all that one considers &quot;21st-century American values [...] the best, final ones, never to be questioned again&quot;.')
