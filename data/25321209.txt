A number of my favorite San Francisco businesses have permanently closed and it&#x27;s an incredibly sad time to live through such a thing.<p>This is a small list of a few of my personal favorite places that are gone:<p><pre><code>  * The San Francisco Hound Lounge\n  * Walzwerk East German Restaurant \n  * Old Jerusalem Restaurant\n  * Lucky 13\n</code></pre>\nI can&#x27;t see how any business can operate in these conditions. It certainly feels like Government is playing favorites, dubbing big box stores as safe - while small businesses that made San Francisco a great place to live are falling on the knife.')
