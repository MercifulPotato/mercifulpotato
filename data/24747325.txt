I find it ridiculous to think that it&#x27;s not worth spending time, money, and research on smaller form factors if possible.<p>I will take the compactness and weight of a modern LCD over a CRT any day.<p>The only reason I had those CRTs was the smash bros gaming community needed them, as the nintendo gamecube natively outputs to 480p. Which makes modern displays untenable due to their upscalers, which take different amounts of time to upscale. (480p) CRTs are consistent.')
