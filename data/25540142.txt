It&#x27;s close to the bug seeker or pen-tester mindset. If the code seems complex you have to assume there is a mistake somewhere. You put yourself in the shoes of the one who write the code and try to imagine where some complex interactions could be badly anticipated. To exploit, you have to understand what went wrong.<p>Seeking the truth probably can&#x27;t be done in absolute. It&#x27;s probably a better idea to hold a variety of beliefs and Bayes updating them with the information you gather, but at the same time keeping in mind that other people may have received different information.')
