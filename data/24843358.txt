I&#x27;m not aware of any benefits Kiwi&#x27;s arriving post 2001 get, apart from some reciprocal medical care, and some allowances to buy property and so forth. Actual money-for-nothing benefits, not so much.<p>&gt; I believe if you were born in New Zealand, its still (relatively) easy to get Citizenship in Australia, but if you weren&#x27;t born in NZ and have NZ citizenship, it&#x27;s much harder.<p>Assuming we&#x27;re talking about the Skilled Independent visa (subclass 189)\nNew Zealand stream [0], then it&#x27;s easier than for people coming from other countries, but I wouldn&#x27;t say easy. It&#x27;s also about AUD$4000 per person.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;immi.homeaffairs.gov.au&#x2F;visas&#x2F;getting-a-visa&#x2F;visa-listing&#x2F;skilled-independent-189&#x2F;new-zealand" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;immi.homeaffairs.gov.au&#x2F;visas&#x2F;getting-a-visa&#x2F;visa-li...</a>')
