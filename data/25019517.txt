To claim otherwise is either to ignore history or to claim that we in the modern day have broken free of the trend. Either is more stupid and unhelpful than recognizing that the trend existed and continued to exist. Was it not a problem when the majority of the population was illiterate, or in the 1920’s when the majority of the population got their information from news sources that were wholesale fabrications?<p>Besides, Trump voters appear to constitute something like 22% of the US population. That’s less than half of 50%.')
