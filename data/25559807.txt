Unlike residential housing, commercial buildings are continuously refinanced. When the owner of a commercial building gets a new mortgage on their building, the <i>potential</i> for rent is weighed more by the banks than the <i>current</i> rent. The way the math works out, it’s much better for a commercial land lord to leave a unit empty for a surprising amount of time rather than reduce rent, because the impact on financing costs is typically larger than lost rent.')
