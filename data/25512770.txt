Beyond that, if they want to use the internet or their notes, that is absolutely allowed. That _is_ how the world works, after all.<p>Only tricky part is that the students themselves shouldn&#x27;t be able to collaborate since that can lead to one student taking the entire exam and sharing the answers, or many splitting the questions. I guess that could be remedied with question pooling, just requires a bit more effort.')
