A public school education costs anywhere between 10-14k&#x2F;annum per student.<p>2. There are 18 years of subsidized free public education.<p>3. The average home value is around 500k and sometimes higher. Average property tax bill is 6k. But often 15-20k in the Bay Area.<p>4. Homes that pay 15-20k in the Bay Area only get less than 8k-10k&#x2F;student. Oakland that makes still less in property taxes has a budget allocation of 14k&#x2F;student. This is a redistribution of taxes so everyone gets an education.<p>5. If A has 5 children and rent a home, education is still free.<p>If B is an undocumented immigrant picking strawberries for minimum wage and have 3 kids, education is still free.<p>If C has two children and pay 12k as property tax, education is still free for my two kids.<p>If I am 70 years old and my kids have grown up, my kids are paying taxes. I am still paying taxes on a property that I haven’t sold yet.<p>Why should I pay MORE taxes for a home that I paid mortgage for ..when all of my property taxes have been paid for 40-50 years. When I get no benefit out of the current school system but still willing to pay my promised share on the home that I finally own after 30 years of mortgage.<p>Trying to displace elders and seniors who have done their part to educate the children of YOUR loins is like robbing old people to buy candy for your kids.<p>The younger generation needs to grow up and stop being grabby. We should be taking care of our seniors. We stand on their shoulders. Pay your fucking taxes and raise your own kids instead of trying to chase older people out of their homes because you can’t manage your finances or elect leaders to do their jobs. Stop protesting and go to a city council meeting instead and ask why the taxes you already pay aren’t used for what they are meant for.. fucking hell! Show some fucking respect for all the freebies you enjoy from those who built these cities after wars and depressions and recessions before you were a twinkle in your fathers eye. Goddamit! California needs to fucking wake up.')
