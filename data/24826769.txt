This story was going viral regardless of anyone&#x27;s actions. What Twitter did was ensure it went viral in the context of the warnings of it being disinformation and Twitters efforts at containing its spread. Disinformation is powerful when the information spreads farther and faster than the facts or mitigating context. Ensuring the information is presented with full context is a significant win. If the goal is to reduce this story&#x27;s ability to influence the election, then Twitter&#x27;s actions were successful.')
