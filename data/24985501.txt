Highly promoted Windows 10 leaves rotten smell for every technically educated user. First thing you have to do is remove all crapware, preinstalled despite you paid for your OS. Then you probably should harden your privacy by disabling all telemetry features. When I forced to use Windows 10, first application I run is ShutUp10 [0], then I disable Cortana and block telemetry servers using simple script [1], which may be outdated, because I did not touch 10 for some time.<p>For personal purposes I use hardened Windows 7 inside Parallels, and hope to keep this configuration as long as possible. I suggested hardening guide post [2] (pdf) on HN, but few people were interested. Hope it would help someone though .<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.oo-software.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;shutup10" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.oo-software.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;shutup10</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;yuchdev&#x2F;windows_10_antispy" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;yuchdev&#x2F;windows_10_antispy</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cyber.gov.au&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;2019-11&#x2F;PROTECT%20-%20Hardening%20Microsoft%20Windows%207%20SP1%20Workstations%20%28November%202019%29.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cyber.gov.au&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;2019-11&#x2F;PROTECT...</a>')
