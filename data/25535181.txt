They don&#x27;t have anyone at all from the last place they worked who could vouch for their ability to write code&#x2F;design systems&#x2F;fix bugs?<p>I find that very hard to believe. Though I&#x27;m saying this from my experience, I have no &quot;network&quot; of people to rely on (and I&#x27;m not also on social media) unless you consider contact info of people I worked with in the past as a network.<p>Sure, if you have no experience, one would be tempted to go through the whole hiring filtration as a service, but as soon as you get a job, you can just let future employers ask anyone who worked with you in the past (while ignoring those that wont accept that) and provide contact info rather than jumping through the next hiring filtration as a service again. At the very least, you wouldn&#x27;t rely on the hiring filtration hiring filtration as a service funnel as much.')
