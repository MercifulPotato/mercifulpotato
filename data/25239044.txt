I don&#x27;t feel any burden from apple when using a mac. MacOS being a unix like operating system makes developing on it a breeze. On windows i need to use archaic developer tools like powershell. Linux commands I use on my production servers don&#x27;t work on my development environment. If I want to use git in a sane manner from the command line i need to install an emulator that has its own issues.<p>There is a reason almost all companies in silicon valley use macbooks for their developers.<p>&gt; but it&#x27;s not like a hobbyist is going to buy an Apple computer for embedded, web dev, gaming, PC applications, etc...<p>As someone else has said, this is exactly what people seem to be doing.')
