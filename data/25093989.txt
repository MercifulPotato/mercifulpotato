What’s interesting in the graphic in the link provided is that the correlation is present in basically every study shown. It’s very strong evidence for a correlation. On the other hand it’s very hard to explain  causality without bringing out general terms like “antioxidants” or, possibly much more likely, confounding variables. It would be helpful to look at confounding variables, but those aren’t available yetis the study is not public. Simply put, it’s an interesting presentation but you can’t draw much useful inference without actually seeing the content of the presentation. That and their study has not meant the rigors of a peer-reviewed article yet.')
