Its weird to me that people justify slow compilation times by pointing out how much work the compiler needs to do. And yet, if V8 can compile and launch my program in milliseconds, it seems like a similarly designed just-in-time rust compiler&#x2F;interpretter should be able to do the same thing.<p>I really hate that I needed to do this, but I recently acknowledged that my 2016 macbook pro just isn&#x27;t fast enough for rust development to feel good. I replaced it with a ryzen 5800 based desktop workstation for dev work. With my new machine a full build of a rust project I&#x27;ve been working on dropped from 2 minutes down to 20 seconds. Its an absolute delight and I highly recommend doing the same if you&#x27;re writing rust regularly and can afford it. Hopefully the next few years of CPU improvements will forgive our collective inability to engineer CPU-efficient compilers.')
