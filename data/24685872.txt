Item(by='stinos', descendants=None, kids=[24685948], score=None, time=1601888512, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24685779, text='<i>&quot;sleep(1)&quot; means &quot;sleep 16ms&quot;</i><p>You sure? According to e.g. the article it results in &quot;sleep anywhere between 1 and 16mSec&quot;. But this illustrates part of the problem here: arguably problematic use of Sleep() where other solutions are more appropriate and people not reading the documentation and&#x2F;or not realizing what it means.')
