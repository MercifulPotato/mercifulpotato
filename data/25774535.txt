They realised very early on that writing logs during runtime is essential for debugging purposes but also that it would kill the internal flash in no time at all.<p>With tmpfs backed log partition, you still need active log rotation. Logbufd was an in-memory ringbuffer that listened on the standard syslog socket, and if you spewed too much logs, you only killed your own ability to go back in time. If you fill up tmpfs before rotation gets a chance to rescue you, you will break all applications that don&#x27;t handle out-of-disk-space gracefully.')
