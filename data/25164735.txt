I have Thinkpad X1 Carbon 7th Gen and there was plenty of issues, especially with audio&#x2F;hardware support. For example:<p>- Laptop has 4 speakers and it took months until they started working properly<p>- There is weird cracking when using headphones (need to run command to fix it)<p>- Attaching&#x2F;detaching headphones will reset volume (created acpi hook which will change volume for me)<p>- Fingerprint sensor not working (fixed now)<p>- CPU throttling (need to use throttled fix)<p>- Sleep&#x2F;Suspend issues (fixed now)<p>- Of course some minor scaling issues<p>But in general, I&#x27;m very happy with my setup. I know about every service running and every package installed. This way I can keep my system lean and super fast.<p>Also, big thanks to people updating Arch Wiki, otherwise I would be completely screwed.')
