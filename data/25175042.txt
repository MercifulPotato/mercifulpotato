That&#x27;s why they all still exist in the way they are.<p>Just look at the name: &quot;file&quot;. And &quot;directory&quot;. Where do these terms come from? Right, from organizing things, mainly offices. And offices are organized like that because this is what is practical under the constraints of humans working with paper in a three dimensional space.<p>But looking at it semantically, almost no one really wants to only use files or directories. We mostly want to use semantical tags. And one kind of tag can be a hierarchical &quot;directory&#x2F;file&quot; tag - fair enough. But that&#x27;s only a small part of the picture, because we also want to tag our objects&#x2F;entities by date, creator, department, security clearance level, how long they have to be archived and so on. Using just a filesystem does not provide this, so we have to build on top of that.<p>And you can see that this is changing. Look at phones nowadays. They don&#x27;t use this anymore. Pictures are stored in collections&#x2F;groups, can be tagged and sorted in various ways. They can be seen on a geographical map. And much more. No one has a directory&#x2F;file structure in their head.<p>So the question is: does the OS still need to support that? Actually, maybe not. Maybe SSDs today can work much more efficient if we don&#x27;t assume everything must be a file.<p>Just wait, we will get there.')
