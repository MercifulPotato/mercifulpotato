Rurouni Kenshin selling something like 70 million copies of the manga by some old record I saw.<p>Anime programming on TV is a fact of life and not something people need to be &quot;into&quot;. But that is to say that there is a lot more dramas and mundane animated programming that wouldn&#x27;t have an economic rationale outside of Japan. A lot of it falls by the way side and then later turns out to appeal to Western audiences, even more rarely circling back to Japan for a closer look.<p>The anime <i>subculture</i> is niche in Japan. ie. The niche where people collect merchandise and have whole shelfs on display as a point of pride. That garners the same discomfort from the general population and potential dates as it would in the West.<p>That being said, the western market is MASSIVE as it is just a larger market and vibrant economy. Something doing &quot;okay&quot; in the US would be the same as shattering records in a Japan-only release. So enterprisers can resyndicate all the crap over to here and see what sticks.')
