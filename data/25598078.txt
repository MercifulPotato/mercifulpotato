In Washington state there were a number of bitcoin operations that started in areas with low cost power that promised to bring jobs to the area and my understanding was that the local power company often did upgrades to lines and substations to accommodate the added power needs -- the local taxpayers definitely would either pay for that capital cost or pay the additional maintenance costs down the road.')
