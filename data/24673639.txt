This is, my friend, how we regress as a society as no one challenges the status-quo.<p>I was hoping you&#x27;d provide some objective reasons that my comment was lacking, but you did none of those. I am open to hear and listen. We don&#x27;t broaden the perspective for flat earthers, right? If we did, we would regress.<p>If there is any glimmer of hope - it would turn Emojis like symbols in Japanese Kanji script. They&#x27;d become logographic characters that are universally recognized across all languages. But, we&#x27;re far from that. It needs to be formally included in the language, dictionary and schools.')
