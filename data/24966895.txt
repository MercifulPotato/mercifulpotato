Really great stuff.<p>I love this Pi 400 and think in the new year I will pick one up for my son. We have a Pi 4 that we use a lot and he loves but like you say in your video it is a bit annoying with this little box off the side with a bunch of cables coming out of it.<p>Not terrible by any means just annoying so I really love the form factor of it all being in the keyboard.<p>I have thought for a while now they should do this kind of form factor or sell a simple RPi branded monitor with a Pi built in so I am happy to see they thought about it too. A keyboard is much more practical than a monitor of course so it is a far more sensible choice!<p>Really hope this sells well and they continue with this kind of form factor in the future. Even a slightly bigger keyboard with a &quot;forehead&quot; (C64 vibes) would be excellent.')
