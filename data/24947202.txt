Your statistics and conclusions are wrong.  You&#x27;re selling this fiction that deafness is just an &quot;old persons&quot; thing.   You&#x27;re cherry picking perhaps a statistic about people being totally deaf, but inclusion and accommodation doesn&#x27;t just start when someone is fully deaf.<p>According to the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (see <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nidcd.nih.gov&#x2F;health&#x2F;statistics&#x2F;quick-statistics-hearing" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nidcd.nih.gov&#x2F;health&#x2F;statistics&#x2F;quick-statistics...</a>)...<p><i>Among adults aged 20-69, the overall annual prevalence of hearing loss dropped slightly from 16 percent (28.0 million) in the 1999-2004 period to 14 percent (27.7 million) in the 2011â€“2012 period.</i>')
