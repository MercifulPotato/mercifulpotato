I don&#x27;t think an <i>unconscious</i> conspiracy really counts as a nefarious cartel.  But the effect is very real: we ignore things like Red and Elm in favor of things like Rust and JS-et.-al. and I think a large part of it is that we know, deep down, that we&#x27;re getting paid to party, effectively.<p>As far as it being &quot;just the real world itself&quot;, sure, because that&#x27;s tautological.<p>&gt; you don&#x27;t wanna fight things like gravity, you have to build ugly and bulky flying machines until one day you have a teleport which will be so far ahead that you can throw away all your planes and airports on a whim. But until then the planes is your best bet.<p>But bad software isn&#x27;t gravity, it&#x27;s just bad software.  Westinghouse changed the emergency brakes on trains from default open to default closed (when the pressure failed) and saved who-knows-how-many lives and dollars (from trains not rolling down hills when the pressure failed.)  We are just really stupid.  Even when we build trains and things.<p>We should be so lucky to have the constraints of aviation on our software.  Wouldn&#x27;t be so broken and wasteful then.<p>Again, Englebart invented the &quot;teleporter&quot; in 1968.  (Changing the content of the metaphor doesn&#x27;t unbreak it.  We have the magic teleporting cure for cancer already, and have had it for decades.)<p>&gt; there is no way you can scrape existing process and rebuild it with better technologies from the ground-up, because you&#x27;ll starve billions to death in the process.<p>Yeah you hear that a lot but it&#x27;s not true.  (E.g. &quot;Treating the Farm as an Ecosystem with Gabe Brown Part 1, The 5 Tenets of Soil Health&quot;  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=uUmIdq0D6-A" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=uUmIdq0D6-A</a> )<p>It turns out again that we are just being stupid.  It&#x27;s an easy fix.')
