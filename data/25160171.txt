I bought a battery powered trim router and end up using that.  I think I&#x27;ll give this a try for bigger jobs.<p>I don&#x27;t have a planer and this looks like it could also be used to flatten boards that are 10 inch and smaller width by just setting the router depth to knock off a small amount.  It would take some labor to pass over an entire board.')
