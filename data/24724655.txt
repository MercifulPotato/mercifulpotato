Once you’ve communicated this boundary, enforce it. Defend it with all your might but with discretion for when it may need bending (but not breaching).<p>No need to carry the burden of guilt or shame because you’re making a deliberate attempt to triage where your attention is going at a given time with so many dings, pings and alerts all yammering for our collective attentions.')
