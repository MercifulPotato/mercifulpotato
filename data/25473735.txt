Item(by='nkurz', descendants=None, kids=[25473925, 25474169], score=None, time=1608337316, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25473619, text='Thanks, I wasn&#x27;t really aware of that distinction.  I haven&#x27;t read the decision yet.  Do you have a sense of how important the distinction actually is in this case?  I assumed the larger question was whether it was &quot;transformative&quot;.  For comparison, I was astounded by the decision that Richard Prince&#x27;s work was considered fair use: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.artistrights.info&#x2F;cariou-v-prince" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.artistrights.info&#x2F;cariou-v-prince</a>.<p>Quoting from that page (which I realize is just a synopsis and not a legal opinion): &quot;In order to be fair use, a secondary use must transform the original by employing it in a different manner or for a different purpose than the original in order to produce a new expression, meaning, or message. A secondary use does not need to comment on or critique the original in order to be transformative as long as it produces a new message.&quot;<p>Is this really less transformative than painting a guitar and some face paint on someone else&#x27;s photograph?  Given that both cases involved overturning the decision of a lower court, clearly both sides are arguable here.  It makes me wonder if this is really just a Circuit split, with different standards in different regions.  Is there a canonical Supreme Court case here with national precedent that would unify these decisions?')
