If there is an emergency that affects a metro area, you need to be able to get out of the area and then refill. In an ICE, it&#x27;s easy to drive 200 miles and then tank up in 5 mins. In an EV, you might be able to get 200 miles, but it&#x27;s much less likely that you&#x27;ll be able to refill in under an hour. If many people are evacuating, charging stations will be overloaded. Trickle charging can be done almost anywhere, but that can take a really long time.')
