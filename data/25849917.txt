I doubt it.<p>LOL, statistically speaking Apple is more likely to prove this statement wrong than right.<p>&gt; Will they bother the genuinely high-end market? No.<p>Really? To me if seems that this is _exactly_ the market which will see their shares being eaten up by AirPod Maxes.<p>&gt; With AirPods Max, Apple also isnâ€™t cannibalising its own AirPods and AirPods Pro models.<p>Duh. Yes of course not lol. These are different devices for different purposes. It&#x27;s like saying &quot;I don&#x27;t think Apple will cannibalise the tablet market, because iPads are also not cannibalising the iPhone models&quot;')
