They simply rebrand commodity cameras and IPS panels in a crap plastic housing and slap their logo on it.<p>Then they give the product a hilariously user-hostile product name, like “PQS GRT46782-WT” as an extra f-you to the user.<p>They don’t care about you because they have no ongoing relationship with you, and their executives mistakenly see their own products as commodities.<p>Combine this with the fact that most home users don’t care about good quality or even know what it is, and you have the current situation.<p>A friend once described the peripheral market as “Assholes selling crap to idiots.”')
