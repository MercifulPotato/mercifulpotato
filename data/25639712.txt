Even though I have spent twenty years self-learning and developing on the web, in 2016 I joined a coding bootcamp primarily to network with and learn how to collaborate with a team of engineers.<p>For the past couple years, I&#x27;ve been working remotely at a B2B SaaS startup, and before that I was leading a successful team of developers at a boutique marketing agency in the Twin Cities. I also run a successful side project: you might know me as @killedbygoogle on Twitter and have seen the Google Graveyard I started, killedbygoogle.com .<p>As an individual contributor, I&#x27;m a skilled front end engineer with a knack for building usable interfaces that make the experience of using technology a joy. In my next role, I&#x27;d like to find a great team where I can focus on JavaScript development, specifically in React or Node, but I&#x27;m open to working in the technologies I&#x27;ve listed.')
