He has open source projects that are prominent in the industry with 10k+ stars.<p>Personally, I feel sad and betrayed but understand the reasoning why. They mention it&#x27;s lower risk to bring the person on even though I&#x27;m doing a decent job at the moment. I have done nothing that would bring doubt to my skills besides not being experienced. My team mentioned it would affect their morale because they trust me and my leadership and mention that there could be a chance they leave because I won&#x27;t be the CTO anymore.<p>I tried to fight for my position but it was me still with the company or being fired.<p>Personally, I am for staying even after the fact due to my want of success for the company and everybody.<p>My question is, should I have fought for my position and continue the journey with me being CTO even with the risks?
