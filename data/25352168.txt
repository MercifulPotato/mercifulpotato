I&#x27;ve seen this in the workplace. You can have two workers with similar jobs, similar or even the same hardware and software tools. One person will constantly be cursing at their machine, running into indescribable hang-ups, and so forth. The other will just be cruising right along.<p>You&#x27;re tempted to suspect that the problems experienced by your one colleague are self inflicted, but you&#x27;d never suggest it out loud. The differences might be real, but due to a hidden cause. Or, some workers might be more &quot;accident prone&quot; when it comes to dealing with tech. I&#x27;ve even seen this with people who should be the most tech savvy: Good programmers.<p>Regardless of the cause, imagine that someone discovers a market appeal to the effect of: &quot;The problems are not your fault, we have stuff that just works.&quot; It&#x27;s a safe bet that the message will resonate with X percent of people. That&#x27;s a perfect market. And if Apple has discovered that market, we certainly can&#x27;t dispute that they&#x27;re successful -- possibly the most successful company on the planet.<p>On the other hand, if you belong to the other group, and somebody can make a less expensive product that you&#x27;re satisfied with, and it &quot;just works&quot; for you, then you&#x27;re happy too. They can be successful too, even if on a modest scale. I&#x27;d take 10% of Apple&#x27;s market. ;-)<p>At one workplace, long ago, two of us were using Windows, and my colleague couldn&#x27;t make it work at all, plus he sent me articles about Windows horror stories from magazines. I never had a problem. My friend ended up with Apple, and I kept using Windows. We were both happy.')
