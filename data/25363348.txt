In other counties, observers had to stand far away for &quot;COVID&quot; reasons, while dozens or counters of DEM observers were crammed together at tables.<p>In Georgia, observers were told to go home, and then people continued to count behind closed doors, unobserved. There is video and no matter how many news sources yell &quot;debunked&quot; ... there is no reasonable explanation for it. There was no water pipe burst. It was a lie and it LOOKS TERRIBLE.<p>If you want an honest election, then people have to not make up this shit. But everyone sees every single GOP&#x2F;Republican as some evil racist Nazi, so some of these things could have been totally on the books, but people threw out observers due to media fueled hate. The trouble is ... it&#x27;s impossible to tell. The percentage of rejected mail-in ballots due to signatures is far far below what is has been before.<p>It looks bad. It stinks. Anyone who is in the center and is truly looking at everything is likely going to make the judgement, even if their party won, the election was shady as fuck.')
