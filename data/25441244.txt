It&#x27;s not advancing science. I can stare at any given computer system, and come up with most of this guy&#x27;s ideas in a few minutes, and implement them in a short time. It&#x27;s extremely low effort. The papers aren&#x27;t even good - his power leak paper uses a SparkFun current transformer connected to the audio line-in of a computer (doesn&#x27;t get much lower tech than that) as a receiver, and made no attempt to actually trace the path the leaking signal takes, or use proper analysis equipment. I think he&#x27;s wrong when he seems to imply it&#x27;s a power consumption signal surviving backwards through the PSU (due to filtering); I think it&#x27;s just EMI coupling across it to the power lines (he didn&#x27;t analyze any of this, all he did was see the signal on the other end and everything about how it got there is an assumption presented as fact).<p>If he&#x27;d at least implement some clever modulations then the papers would at least have value in researching how to cram more data into lossy side channels, but he&#x27;s not doing that. All his modulations are textbook radio&#x2F;modulation 101 stuff with very conservative parameters and no attempt to explore the actual theoretical limits of the channel bandwidth.')
