Item(by='murgindrag', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603545772, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24878526, text='&gt; IMHO these laws just codify social mores without need of specific rationalization (like incest laws).<p>What&#x27;s curious is:<p>1) Going against social mores tends to cause psychological harm<p>2) Looking across history, plenty of cultures broke those mores without psychological harm<p>That&#x27;s not just sexual mores. All sorts of things. Corporal punishment is harmful to kids in Western Culture, but not harmful to kids in many other cultures worldwide (yes, with good evidence).<p>The evidence for what constitutes healthy person-person relationships is mostly culturally-situated, whether that&#x27;s parent-child, sibling, friends, work environment, or otherwise. The same behavior which might be considered a child abusing their parent in one country might be considered the parent abusing the child in another (and lead to actual psychological harm for the abused party).<p>It&#x27;s helpful to look at mores across cultures and  history to see which things are fundamental to humans, and which are culturally-situated. Of course, that doesn&#x27;t make breaking culturally-situated norms okay -- it still causes psychological harm.<p>What is more problematic is that we can&#x27;t talk about this in more than abstracts. I could pick dozens of concrete examples, and if I raised them in a public forum, my career would be dead.')
