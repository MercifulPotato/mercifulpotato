IMO that&#x27;s mostly bullshit.<p>Amazon, Google, Uber, Facebook (despite some cherry picked article from the video about it never being able to hit profitability) were all <i>hugely</i> popular right off the bat, and indeed, many people saw them as being more worthy successors to what were already huge businesses (e.g. the pre-Google search engines, MySpace).<p>In a similar vein, you often here how pg and other top VCs thought AirBnB was a horrible idea early on. Well, that&#x27;s just their own individual myopic vision IMO. Couchsurfing was already very popular, as were other vacation rental platforms like VRBO - it&#x27;s not hard to see how AirBnB could grow into that space.<p>If anything, what I see as the common thread is that the most successful startups executed extraordinarily well at just exactly the right time (e.g. there were other video sites before YouTube, but you didn&#x27;t really have enough broadband adoption until the late 00s the make it viable).')
