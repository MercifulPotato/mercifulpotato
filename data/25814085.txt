Item(by='lumost', descendants=None, kids=[25814200, 25814463], score=None, time=1610912175, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25810078, text='While it&#x27;s difficult to imagine a scenario in which humanity extinguishes itself, it&#x27;s easy to imagine scenarios which make civilized society difficult, and could preclude future advanced civilizations from ever emerging on Earth, these may constitute a variety of &quot;hidden filters&quot; which make exiting ones own solar system or mustering the energy to make oneself known impractical.<p>The article makes reference to a million year time horizon, however even earthly nuclear energy reserves may become strained on a thousand year time horizon.  As we&#x27;re all acutely aware, the great biochemical battery of fossil fuels is already operating on diminished capacity.  Planet&#x27;s such as mars lack the hydro-cycle to drive renewables, the organic legacy to support fossil fuels, and potentially the tectonics to enable surface extraction of nuclear fuels.<p>While a theoretical expansion outside of the confines of earths gravity to acquire resources from asteroids, or produce high concentrations of solar energy is currently achievable on  a 20-100 year time horizon, supporting the energy demands of the aerospace supply chain or considering regular space launches may be difficult in 2 centuries.  On a thousand year time horizon it&#x27;s entirely plausible that maintaining a purely renewable economy makes the production of certain materials impractically expensive when considering the concentrated energy demands of blast furnaces or industrial mining.<p>Similar collapse events have occurred historically due in part to the exhaustion of limited resources such as forests have occurred in the past in both Europe and polynesia.  If a similar event occurred in the future it&#x27;s entirely plausible that a future civilization would be unable to muster the resources to ever &quot;unlock&quot; the next set of energy production capabilities.')
