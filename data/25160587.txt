Sure, from time to time there is some overcorrection, but eventually things will settle down and the world will be better for it.  We should let people with compelling stories tell their stories!  Now that streaming is the norm, there&#x27;s room for everyone, now that we&#x27;re not limited to only the stories which are marketable for primetime.<p>Speaking from my own experience, I have been so so happy to see so much positive representation of LGBTQ characters in mainstream television &#x2F; movies lately.  As a kid, I had no positive examples of LGBTQ adults in my life, so I had no choice but to struggle by myself.  Whether we like it or not, many children learn about the world through television.<p>It would be difficult to express in words how deeply moved I was to learn that Disney Channel aired a children&#x27;s show (&quot;Andi Mack&quot;, [1]) with a gay main character, whose relationship with another male character was a major plotline.  Shows like this give LGBTQ kids characters they can relate to, and gives non-LGBTQ kids a positive story about someone who is different from them.  That children today might not need to deal with the same pain and isolation that I felt as a kid makes me so incredibly happy.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Andi_Mack#:~:text=Andi%20Mack%20is%20the%20top,the%20news%20as%20being%20historic" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Andi_Mack#:~:text=Andi%20Mack%...</a>.')
