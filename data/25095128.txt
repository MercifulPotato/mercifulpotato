So what are you all going to do? Create a democracy? Anarchy? A dictatorship? A federation?&quot;. No doubt a lot of people would like to insert themselves as new &quot;Benevolent Dictator for Life&quot; - imagine the uproar if Guido had appointed a successor who nobody had heard of, but had recently bought Guido a luxury yacht. What would &quot;fork the entire thing&quot; look like - would Apple do it? Google? FreeBSD? Microsoft? RedHat? Would the Python dev core fracture into competing groups of stay vs leave?
