The biggest issue is the RIFA caps going in the PSU.<p>As Apple I diy kits these are a little bit too modern for my tastes. I prefer my retro remakes to stick much more closely to the original design. The only real &quot;fake&quot; that I have is the PiDP 11&#x2F;70 front panel which has a Raspberry PI running an emulation as it&#x27;s CPU.<p>There are a long list of modern remakes around in the retro computing community, but most stuff earlier than 1981 uses discrete components so if the CPU is still available should be cloneable.')
