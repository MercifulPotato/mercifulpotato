Some treatments are so expensive and&#x2F;or niche that public programs likely wouldn&#x27;t cover them. Such treatments will probably always exist. (And if they didn&#x27;t, then that could he a problem by itself.)<p>Not in a single-payer state, no.<p>It&#x27;s also not really a problem in and of itself. You&#x27;ll find that if cancer treatments are actually cheaper and more effective than the status quo as demonstrated by a study that a single payer state will quickly take them up.<p>[edit] Frequently you&#x27;ll find these eccentric or fringe treatments that are incredibly expensive aren&#x27;t actually better per se. There is a point of diminishing returns in everything. If you paid $200K for cancer treatment, would you get a better outcome? $1M? $10M? $1B? No. We know what we know, and we have the tools we have. Healthcare isn&#x27;t a pay-to-win game. Generally if you find a way to pay more to get better care you&#x27;re just bumping someone else down the priority list. That may be acceptable in America but it&#x27;s not in much of the rest of the world.')
