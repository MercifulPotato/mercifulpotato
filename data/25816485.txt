This program spend 20 billion over 10 years designing the whole system on paper with very little iterative testing.<p>This not a prototype, this is the actual rocket that should fly. It has already spent over 1 year on the test stand to do 1 static fire. SpaceX did 3 static fire in ONE DAY last week.<p>Consider this, when SLS started development SpaceX Starship literally didn&#x27;t exist on paper, the engines didn&#x27;t exist, the facilities they were built in didn&#x27;t exist, they didn&#x27;t even have approval to build facilities.<p>So SpaceX designed a totally new engine, a engine mass manufacturing line, multiple new test stands, designed threw many iteration on the Starship design, build a totally new private space port with a huge manufacturing facility. All of this was done for a budget that is less then what SLS gets PER YEAR and not just a little less.<p>One year of SLS development could have likely funded all of SpaceX research and development over the last 10 years.<p>NASA simply should not build its own rocket. And even worse they should not blow unlimited amounts of money into these contracts while they are showing absurdly bad performance. In fact, I think the government should systematically be compensated with stocks of these companies when they go over budget and over time by this amount.<p>The whole program is political, it serves no function. Payloads like Europa Clippers are fighting politically for the right NOT to launch on SLS. Having SLS around forces NASA into suboptimal moon architectures. SLS is a political straight-jacked for NASA. With the SLS budget alone so many amazing project could be funded, it is hard to even comprehend.<p>We can &#x27;cut the slack&#x27; on this issue, but the issues keep coming and the rate of delay is pretty crazy and the cost are even crazier.<p>&gt; Let’s not forget also that it’s NASA who have also drastically changed their strategy and have enabled private companies like SpaceX to shine through their partnerships.<p>Fantastic, totally agree. Lets do more of that, and less giving Boeing and LM money for not performing well.')
