Wish them luck if you feel like it.<p>Interesting. I will probably negotiate a severance deal but not sure I have leverage at this moment. I&#x27;m imagining they would just laugh at it and just fire me vs giving me a good severance deal.<p>&gt; In the end, remember that you are not defined by someone else&#x27;s judgment of your merit and abilities. The only that matters is your view. Go start something new, and kick ass. Laugh at those guys when you roll past them on the street in your Aston Martin Victor.<p>Thanks for this! This is definitely my plan. And will probably roll in an Aston Martin Vantage than a Victor :)')
