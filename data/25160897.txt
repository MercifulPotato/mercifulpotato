The terminal is one program that doesn&#x27;t - but that&#x27;s fine with me because I don&#x27;t think of it as just another program - it&#x27;s more like a wholly different operating system or subsystem. Aside from that, the amount of work I have to do with memorizing extra keyboard shortcuts like `Ctrl+Shift+C` for the terminal is still overall less than what I&#x27;d have to do on a Mac.<p>I can operate the entirety of Windows or XFCE with just a few shortcuts that I&#x27;ve memorized (or not) while macOS will have you using the mouse or memorizing hundreds of distinct shortcuts - one for each separate function. Even something simple like switching windows - on a Mac you have to memorize 2 separate shortcuts - one for switching between programs and another for switching between windows in that program.<p>Macs also don&#x27;t have keyboard acceleration via the &quot;Alt key + underlined letter in context menu.&quot; They also don&#x27;t have a dedicated right-click key. These are super useful since I can hit a key to bring up a menu and then hit another key to activate a menu item - no memorization required.<p>I&#x27;ve never seen anyone operate a Mac with just their keyboard. Anyone I&#x27;ve ever observed on a Mac used the touchpad very heavily with low efficiency.')
