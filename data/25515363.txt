It was common to have parents drop off the neighbors kids at different school in exchange for a place to hang out after school and place at the dinner table that night while the parents worked OT etc... This was rotational and we often were at each others homes on different days of the week.<p>Bi-monthly neihborhood bbqs&#x2F;potlucks were typical things and were way less tense then some mandated HOA sanctioned community watch meeting where people just snitch on each other and was more a casual event to eat and build bonds share a dish from your families native land with our local neighbors. Many of those people had to leave as things got more and more expensive as time went on and it was a somber experience even to this day.<p>Then, to me, it abruptly went completely away in the 2000s when ignoring your community completely became normal, and I&#x27;m guilty of this, too; I no longer wanted to be a part of the new crowds or integrate into the new ones and sought refuge Online instead as those crowds that were made up of &#x27;less interesting people from somewhere else&#x27; so unless we had specific and obvious interests aligned I never bothered, and even then it would be short lived as they were built on very fickle forms of self-interest.<p>And this persisted until I left CA for the first time.<p>Again, its probably all survivor bias, and I knew way too many kids in the neighborhood or not far away who died due to gang violence (the shootings at the counter strike internet cafes were particular bad in my area) so I&quot;m not trying to glamorize that aspect. Its just that much like in places with incredibly cold and snowy winters you learn to appreciate one another and their roles in your Life, and since SoCal has perfect weather nearly all year around this was the closest thing that made us see past our superficial differences, and somehow latently knowing it could all go away in a flash gave a stark reminder of how valuable and integral that is to one&#x27;s quality of Life. You hear this a lot amonst the Korean survivors of the LA riots when the Police abandoned them and left them to fend for themselves, that really hit hard for me and was what made me look past my previously held prejudice of foul smelling kimchi and started eating, cooking and enjoying their cuisine.<p>&gt; And I thought my nostalgia for the leaded gasoline and burning asbestos tram breaks smells was odd.<p>I&#x27;m a big proponent of EV in a large part because I recall how light headed and nauseating I&#x27;d felt riding in the tailgate of a 70s pick up truck on the way to the local to in-n-out or to AM&#x2F;PM as well as seeing images of the smog of LA would creep in on bad days and the poor air quality all year round was most of my Life as a kid. I don&#x27;t desire for any of that, despite a large part of my career being tied to the Auto Industry I&#x27;m glad we&#x27;re seeing EV taking over as I remember how orange and brown the sky looked back then.')
