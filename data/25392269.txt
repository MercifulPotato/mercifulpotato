Both have front loaders, one of them has an excavator on the back. I run them in the fields (mowing, turning, baling, etc.) and in the forest (logging, skidding, forwarding, etc.). Tractors do not need huge engines to be useable on the farm, this is only needed for 3-swathe mowers, 10-row ploughs, high-speed baler&#x2F;wrappers etc.')
