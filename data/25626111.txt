Because of this, the whole first season can fail to make any sense, and so feel slow. You miss out on a lot of the value that the characters bring because you don&#x27;t know WTF is going on.<p>I tried 2 or 3 times at least to get into it, always failing a few episodes into series one. It took a further watch with the mindset of &quot;I&#x27;m going to watch regardless, and trust the recommendations that brought me to it&quot;. By the end of the first series, I understood the slang&#x2F;characters&#x2F;plot well enough to be rewarding by the rich characters and relationships and loved it. From there all the way to the end of the final series it was plain sailing.<p>I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s many other series that I&#x27;ve had that experience with, and I really wholeheartedly recommend struggling through the first series (and with subtitles is a great idea), as the whole thing is my favourite TV show of all time.<p>I think you&#x27;re right that it doesn&#x27;t have any big explosive events necessarily, but the story is so great that I don&#x27;t think it needs the artificial cliffhanger-ness that other &#x27;faster&#x27; series may have.')
