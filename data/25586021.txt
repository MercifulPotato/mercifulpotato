I went like 5 times to register the car, gave up 3 times because the lane was too long (once after waiting for a very long time) and twice after because we were missing some papers the first time. The DMV is really a horrible thing. They yell at you for no reason, treat you like shit, are just useless when you have questions, etc.')
