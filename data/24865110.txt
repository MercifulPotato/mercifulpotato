Submerge the pretzels for a few seconds just before baking. It does something to the outside layer of dough that results in the brown crust of the pretzel. In addition to the pleasant color, it also affects the flavor. Also, it makes it easier for the coarse salt to stick to the outside of the pretzels.\nNaOH immediately causes stains on clothes and wooden cutting boards and countertops. Obviously it&#x27;s also bad for your skin and especially the eyes, so be careful.')
