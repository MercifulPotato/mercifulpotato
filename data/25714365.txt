It&#x27;s not just ruining the lives of young people. It&#x27;s also ruining the lives of anyone who loses their career in old age but does not receive enough of a pension to retire. Optimizing an entire economy for a minority of savers and wealthy is misguided.<p>A lot of political anger is rooted in very simple economics. The economy is doing increasingly worse for the majority and that fuels extremism. Of course the extremism makes it harder to do the right thing because people believe in unrealistic promises that are never going to work out but they appeal to their own biases.<p>For example. Labor in China is very cheap. If Americans want to compete with China they have to reduce their incomes to match Chinese incomes. One idea is to introduce tariffs to raise the costs of products until they are high enough to pay for American labor. You can do this in theory but why on earth would you do it if China can do it cheaper? If you buy products from China you could still use the saved money to employ American labor. So the actual loss is not that great.<p>The only reason why the tariffs work out is that the labor market is not flexible enough. Low income workers need jobs and the jobs that are there are high skill. Training has to be paid by the workers themselves and the training is not guaranteed to grant a job. Even after acquiring a good college degree there is still a &quot;pseudo training phase&quot; during your first 3 years on the job. Converting low skill workers to high skill workers is too unreliable and expensive so it doesn&#x27;t happen and it gets worse the older the worker is.<p>If you could figure out a way to do training effectively and inexpensively your country would be significantly better off by buying Chinese products.<p>So what politicians will advocate is tariffs instead of better training. It&#x27;s short term vs long term thinking.')
