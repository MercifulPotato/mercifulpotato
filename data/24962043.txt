But I also think that it&#x27;s not technically incorrect to say that &quot;C is mostly a subset of C++&quot;, at least as far as most C constructs will work in C++ with only minor tweaks.<p>It&#x27;s a bit like saying that operating the windscreen wipers is a subset of knowing how to drive a car. It&#x27;s strictly correct, but it&#x27;s probably not where you should start nor where you should put most of your attention if you&#x27;re looking to get you license.')
