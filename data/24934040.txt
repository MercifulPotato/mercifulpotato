Glen wanted this agreement between editors and journalists: editors will not censor the journalists they employ. The Intercept violated that.<p>To put it another way, what&#x27;s more likely?: that Glenn Greenwald just suddenly decided he&#x27;d like to publish garbage articles, or that the Intercept is seeking to filter what content it publishes to achieve political aims?<p>Obviously it&#x27;s up to each individual to make their own call on that, but to me, it&#x27;s pretty obviously almost the latter.')
