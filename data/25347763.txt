Watching Youtube on the iPad having my iPhone lying next to it, pausing the video by taking one Airpod off. Then put it back and iPhone immediately steals AirPods Pro and I have to either connect them back to the iPad in Settings or play&#x2F;pause&#x2F;play&#x2F;pause&#x2F;... and wait about 20s seconds and they may reconnect. iPhone is lying face down all the time, no music or any sound activity in progress for hours.<p>I was initially impressed, but the quirks got more and more frequent and I actually hate the broken switching now.')
