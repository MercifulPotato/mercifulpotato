However, there is a route on dev that can show email content to CMs and they use this to obtain the magic link used to reset credentials.<p>Many of these debugging tools are great for devs to test things quickly but I&#x27;ve always felt very weary of having these exist in an app without some strict access control with 2FA. Ideally you&#x27;d not have them in the app at all, maybe just on local dev.')
