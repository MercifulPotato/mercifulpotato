I&#x27;ve been using and supporting Macs professionally since the 90s. In that time, I&#x27;ve had exactly one case where a day one upgrade broke something — 10.4 shipped with a bug where all NFS exports were read-only — as long as you did a check first to confirm that any commercial software you were using was supporting (e.g. Adobe sometimes had fairly long delays).<p>There are two common problems you&#x27;ll see frequently: a system which was already failing will be attributed to the new OS (I&#x27;ve seen people claim it broke their hard drive, when it was really just the first problem which couldn&#x27;t be excused as a fluke), and people will often say that their system got slow because Spotlight &#x2F; Photos were reindexing in the background.')
