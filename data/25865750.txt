I did once a week in the office but now remote only.<p>Lived in a row house (full house to ourselves) on a downtown city block.<p>large ranch on a big property<p>about 10 years ago<p>moved to send kids to school of choice<p>naked hot tubbing (aka privacy), quiet and nature<p>everyone knows everyone and is related to everyone (but us).<p>chose the location for proximity to school for our kids. chose the property because it had the facilities&#x2F;buildings we wanted<p>WARNING:<p>Small town politics is &quot;a thing&quot;. If you can accept that the guy who runs the local diner is the brother of the mayor and she is also sisters with the head of the school board and married to the public works guy and cousin to the zoning guy and they all are children of the editor of the local paper and you can accept that this one extended family will control all aspects of governance, then you will be fine. It was kind of a rude shock to us and a PITA to fix things after my wife had a fight with the zoning guy before realizing the network ramifications. If you have asperations for your kids, make sure they align with the social reality of community. We have a community of friends where it is expected that the kids will go to college but the &quot;town over&quot; from us had one kid in the entire graduating class who went on to higher ed.<p>BAD:<p>It cost us 20k to run cable to our ranch. Restaurants are sparse (if there actually are any at all) and will likely close by 8pm or sooner (9pm if it has a bar). In the city we rarely ate out before 9pm. Our kids complain about how far it is to get to an actual friend&#x27;s house. Be prepared to do a lot of driving. Forget about uber, grubhub and whatnot. The gig economy is that one guy who bartends at the burger joint <i>and</i> the bowling ally.<p>GOOD:<p>We were able to purchased our ranch outright from the proceeds of the sale of our city house that we had only managed to payoff 50%. When we lived in the city, we did not know even the person who lived next door to us. Now I know basically know everyone for miles around and they know us. You can&#x27;t swing a stick without hitting a trail head, fishing hole, park, or sports field. People might be slow to accept you but once they do you will feel like family. I coach several competitive youth sports programs and people call me &quot;coach&quot; when I am in town. All my kids have great friends. My home office looks out over our ranch from a high point and we are surrounded by state protected land on 3 sides.')
