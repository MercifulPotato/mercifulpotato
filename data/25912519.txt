I can see any commercial application like What&#x27;s App or FB or TWTTR being coy about speech and not having the privacy of their users in mind, and bending to prevailing winds --not having fast principles.<p>But Signal?  Signal?  Do these idealist engineers not envision the comms that can happen on e-e encrypted systems?  They don&#x27;t think criminals, hooligans, spies, unsavory people, sex criminals, drugs dealers, arms dealers, etc. would use the network?<p>Oh, but boy, wait, what if people in whose politics we don&#x27;t believe in use it?  Oh, noes.  In this case we have to be careful and raise concerns --but those other things, no, that&#x27;s why we believe in freedom of speech and e-e encryption.<p>Sigh.<p>They believe in things, until they don&#x27;t.  Which means they don&#x27;t truly believe in the principles they said they believed  in.<p>What&#x27;s that old saw, I believe in freedom of speech for the people I agree with?<p>Moxie should get up there next time and say:  &quot;If you only believe this product should be used by people you agree with, then you took the wrong job&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s like the Komsomol have come to town.')
