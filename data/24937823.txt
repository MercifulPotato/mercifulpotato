Groups like the FLQ, IRA, etc may have bombed civilian targets that really didn&#x27;t have to do with the government, but they were still clearly aiming at political change.<p>Which groups do you think is fear for the sake of fear? Lots of groups are characterized that way for propaganda purposes, and deep down inside there are probably more than a few that just want the world to burn, but im not sure any exist that literally claim to just want to cause fear without tying it to some broader political goals.<p>&gt; Trying to quickly or quietly overthrow a government is pretty much the opposite of that effect<p>I agree generally that quiet coups aren&#x27;t generally in the terrorism category, but i still think they have much more in common with terrorism than (apolitical) ransomware does.')
