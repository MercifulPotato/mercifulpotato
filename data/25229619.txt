With my income, which is well above median, only about 20-30% (2 to 3 % at median income according to the news iirc) of the homes that go on sale are within my mortgage limit. And to solve the on going housing shortages they are building a few new neighborhoods where, surprise, surprise, all houses start at 2 or 3 times that limit...<p>I have read that one of the reasons this happens, is that _everyone_ expect the buyer is better of if prices are higher. Thus brokers, appraiser and sellers all keep driving up the prices. As long as there are more buyers than houses this will keep driving up prices.\nAnd the big building companies, that do entire neighborhoods, are quite happy to keep the market scarce.')
