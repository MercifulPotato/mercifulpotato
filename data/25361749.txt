Even though the resilver will go faster with a mirror having one disk remaining on a mirror vdev compared to raidz2 (or higher) mirrors will increase risk of data loss irrespective of resilver times because of drop ship drive replacement time.<p>3TB resilver on my last mechanical drive failure took 6 hours 30 minutes.  Plus an additional 3 days for the drive to arrive.<p>With mirror vdev setups you lose significantly more space as well.  If you argue speed is worth it, then I would instead invest that money you saved going with a raidz2 with NVME cache and SLOG.<p>Users won&#x27;t notice the resilver event at all with a significant amount of memory and NVME cache + nvme SLOG tuned with a high &#x2F;sys&#x2F;module&#x2F;zfs&#x2F;parameters&#x2F;zfs_dirty_data_max and larger than default &#x2F;sys&#x2F;module&#x2F;zfs&#x2F;parameters&#x2F;zfs_txg_timeout.')
