Monthly payments are now under $500 a month.<p>It possibly would have been better long term to invest it but the peace of mind a low monthly payment brings is really nice.<p>If I can gather another largish chunk of money Iâ€™ll definitely be looking to get rid of the mortgage completely.<p>While it might not have been the best long term move you never know what the future will bring and also I think having that feeling of freedom right now counts for a lot too.')
