I had the Razer Blade Stealth in the running, but I was reading about support and longevity issues with them. Maybe they&#x27;ve been better recently? It&#x27;s difficult to build a track record of longevity.<p>I&#x27;ve had stellar longevity out of Apple hardware. I&#x27;m usually able to use it for a handful of years and sell it on ebay to put a good chunk towards something new. I have noticed certain models&#x2F;runs have specific issues, laptop keyboards are probably the most recent and obvious, but for the most part you know what you&#x27;re getting. Screen lamination problems or pinched monitor cable being a few others.<p>When looking at alternatives saving only around 20% on the cost made it difficult when not being confident about longevity or resale. Sadly, other aspects weren&#x27;t appreciably better (soldered on RAM, camera quality, performance, battery).')
