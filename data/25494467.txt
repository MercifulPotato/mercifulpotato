Both Canon and Nikon have gotten more serious on that front over the last few years. Especially their full frame mirrorless offerings are pretty nice and competitive. Sony is still considered quite good in this space but it is a lot closer than it was a few years ago.<p>I also bought a Fuji this year (X-T30), upgrading from an old Canon Rebel. I&#x27;m so far really liking it. For me it&#x27;s as much about the form-factor as it is about the image quality.<p>Regarding phone cameras; they are quite nice these days but it&#x27;s a different market. You can pick up a decent mirrorless camera for the price of a top range smart phone and it will give you a much wider range of options in terms of quality, focal length, stabilization, etc. That matters to only some people but those people still exist.')
