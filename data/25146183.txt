If you aren&#x27;t capable of performing precise and contextualized recall of trivia, then your engagement with the subject is going to be limited to diletanttery.  When I was a biochemist, there were several critical instances when recall of some minor thing that I had learned years or even a decade ago, sometimes even an offhanded comment in a journal club, enabled debugging a situation where there wouldn&#x27;t have been time to &quot;go to the library&quot; much less even know <i>where to start looking</i>.<p>I know it&#x27;s fiction, but think about the show House.
