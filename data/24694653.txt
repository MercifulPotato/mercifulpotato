The traditional remedies in Anglo-American courts, before qualified immunity and similar doctrines metastasized into impenetrable shields protecting government officers, come from tort law. But torts require a showing of damages. What are your damages from the NSA collecting all your metadata, or even from recording a conversation? Most people in the U.S. consent to letting companies like Microsoft or Google not only track all their online contacts, but literally analyze their e-mail for tracking and targeting purposes, and do it in returns for services that have an effective market value (to the user) of nearly $0.<p>IIRC, Scalia once said that he would ditch the fruit of the poison tree doctrine to return to old Common Law tort remedies. At Common Law the remedy for an illegal search was typically a claim of trespass, for which the remedy was often a token sum, such as $1, imposed on the officer, not much of an incentive to abstain from illegal searches, but right in line with the effective economic losses of property trespass or invasion of your digital privacy.<p>So when people talk about &quot;accountability&quot; in the realm of privacy law they seem to be referring to something beyond simple compensation for immediate harms; they seem to want to impose some sort of penalty. But what kind of penalty is appropriate to impose on some government bureaucrat just &quot;doing his job&quot;; and when entire departments of bureaucrats might need to be penalized en masse? Maybe we should penalize the supervisors, but at some point those supervisors are political appointees doing the bidding of elected politicians, who are supposed to be accountable through elections.<p>We already have doctrines like fruit of the poison tree that are crafted to disincentive illegal government prosecutions. An illegitimate guilty verdict is at least a quantifiable loss of liberty. But if there are no economic damages, no reputational damages, no illegitimate prosecutions, nor similar quantifiable consequences, I&#x27;m not sure exactly what we should be doing except electing into office politicians who will ensure our existing laws are honestly applied, and who will rid the statute books of unnecessary exceptions to the letter of the law.')
