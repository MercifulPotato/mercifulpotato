Item(by='steerablesafe', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602153819, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24707305, text='Monty hall is a conditional probability problem. Conditional probability problems are typically not intuitive and require very precise definition of the condition. Rule of thumb: don&#x27;t meddle with the condition.<p>An algebraic, Bayes-theorem solution to the problem:<p>The relevant events:<p><pre><code>  A_x = &quot;contestant first picks door x&quot;\n  B_y = &quot;Monty opens door y, revealing a goat&quot;\n  C_z = &quot;price is behind door z&quot;\n</code></pre>\nWe want to calculate P(C_z|A_x &amp; B_y) for certain combinations of x,y and z. I assume x=1, y=2 for the following calculations (A = A_1, B = B_2).<p>Assumptions:<p><pre><code>  P(C_z) = 1&#x2F;3, the price can be behind any door with equal probabilities\n  A and C are independent, the contestant has no prior knowledge of the placement of the price\n  P(B|A&amp;C_3)=1, that is Monty opens door 2 with probability 1 if the contestant first opened door 1 and the price is behind door 3, Monty deliberately picks the door with the goat, very important!\n  P(B|A&amp;C_2)=0, Monty never opens the door with the price.\n  P(B|A&amp;C_1)=1&#x2F;2, Monty equally randomly picks between two doors when he can.\n</code></pre>\nNow substitute into all the probabilities:<p><pre><code>  P(C_3|A &amp; B) &#x2F;&#x2F;probability for winning when switching\n  = P(A &amp; B|C_3)*P(C_3) &#x2F; P(A &amp; B)\n  = P(B|A &amp; C_3)*P(A|C_3)*P(C_3)\n    &#x2F;(P(B|A)*P(A)) &#x2F;&#x2F; P(A|C_3) = P(A) due to independence\n  = P(B|A &amp; C_3)*P(C_3)\n    &#x2F;P(B|A) &#x2F;&#x2F;expand denominator\n  = P(B|A &amp; C_3)*P(C_3)\n    &#x2F;( P(B|A &amp; C_1)*P(C_1)\n       + P(B|A &amp; C_2)*P(C_2)\n       + P(B|A &amp; C_3)*P(C_3) ) &#x2F;&#x2F; use P(C_1) = P(C_2) = P(C_3) = 1&#x2F;3\n  = P(B|A &amp; C_3)\n    &#x2F;( P(B|A &amp; C_1)\n       + P(B|A &amp; C_2)\n       + P(B|A &amp; C_3) ) &#x2F;&#x2F; substitute all our assumptions above\n  = 1 &#x2F; (1 + 0 + 1&#x2F;2)\n  = 2&#x2F;3\n</code></pre>\nWe can see that the condition B is not trivial and requires precise knowledge of Monty&#x27;s strategy. Meddling with this condition results in different outcomes.')
