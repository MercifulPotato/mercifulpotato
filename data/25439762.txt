This is exactly what our Constitution provides about our Prime Ministers. They can be anybody, even without a seat in Parliament (or current Prime Minister doesn&#x27;t.) The President of the Republic appoints them, probably even you because I don&#x27;t see requirements about citizenship or residency. They must be confirmed by a vote of the Parliament (50%+1) and that&#x27;s it. Actually, if they are not confirmed they still are Prime Minister until the President appoints somebody else. You can check Articles 92 to 96 of the Constitution at <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.senato.it&#x2F;documenti&#x2F;repository&#x2F;istituzione&#x2F;costituzione_inglese.pdf" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.senato.it&#x2F;documenti&#x2F;repository&#x2F;istituzione&#x2F;costit...</a> (PDF, English) from the site of one of the chambers of the Parliament.<p>I don&#x27;t particularly like this but it&#x27;s an example of how that is usual in Europe. Many other countries don&#x27;t have direct elections for their leaders. Given this status it&#x27;s normal that we don&#x27;t elect the President of the Commission.<p>Furthermore what really matters is the Council, made by the leaders of each country. The Commission is the government but the real power is in the Council. A Commission going against the Council doesn&#x27;t have any political backing.')
