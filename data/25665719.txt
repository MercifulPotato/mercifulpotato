The week after CHOP started was quiet. Comparing the shift from yesterday to today in DC&#x27;s Capitol Hill against the shift from June 7 to June 8 in Seattle&#x27;s Capitol Hill, the CHOP was extraordinarily peaceful. That&#x27;s mostly the comparison I was making by initially saying it was &quot;quite peaceful&quot;: the day before and the day after in those two locations.<p>But even then, the CHOP compared to the same location today (for example) is honestly pretty similarly peaceful. It was certainly a relatively violent time for that street, but I didn&#x27;t feel at all at risk walking through it. I also didn&#x27;t have any problem living 3 blocks away from a place that many news agencies tried to construe as violent anarchy.')
