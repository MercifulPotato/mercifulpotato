I don&#x27;t care if there is a single company or duo running the advertising market, and to what extent they are controlling prices. I also don&#x27;t want to &quot;open up the market&quot; so that more companies can participate in it. Privacy should be regarded as a fundamental human right, and the surveillance economy is based on the mass violation of that right. The lawsuits, and this write-up, completely miss that point.')
