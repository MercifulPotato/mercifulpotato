They&#x27;re small enough to carry in a large pocket and take great pictures. Full control, APS-C sensor and good enough image quality in low light. They are beautiful cameras. The only drawbacks people can mention are the fixed focal length (but you get f&#x2F;2, so you can shoot in somewhat lower light) and maybe the battery life.<p>If you want pure IQ, go for what everyone else has said. Get good glass &amp; an older full frame flagship camera. Quality used glass won&#x27;t depreciate much, but most bodies will lose 10%+ of their purchase price per year. A Canon 5d2 (or 7d2 if you take more action shots) with a 35f1.4 or 24-70f4IS can be had for $1,200 and can cover lots of situations.')
