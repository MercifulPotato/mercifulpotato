If you don&#x27;t abide by the initial permissions that people give, how do you decide whose feelings win out? The best you can hope for is to ask people explicitly in the original study whether they&#x27;re happy to be contacted for a follow-up - it&#x27;s not clear to me whether that was the case here.')
