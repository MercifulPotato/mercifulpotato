But that&#x27;s not true in this case.  The way I see it is you can suffer the more modest loss of freedom of mask wearing now.  Or you can ignore that and have lockdowns imposed on you later.<p>&gt;Unfortunately, masks became a political issue here in a way that probably had nothing to do with those dumb CDC press releases.<p>You want to believe that, but I think in your heart you know that is not true.  Those messages seeped into the public consciousness. I&#x27;d be astonished if they&#x27;re not being cited by MAGA et al against you now.<p>Generally, if you treat people like children, like the CDC did, they won&#x27;t respond by behaving like adults.')
