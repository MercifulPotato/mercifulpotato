Other solutions can be storing locations imprecisely to begin with, using pre-defined geobuckets, and so on, although remember that randomness by itself can be bypassed with enough queries since it will average out. It&#x27;s rare that you need to know <i>exactly</i> how far away someone is from you rather than a rough approximation. Telegram is definitely not the only product with this issue, but hopefully they fix it even so.')
