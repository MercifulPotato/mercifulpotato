A one-time pad generated with it would not suffice.  Not even if it has 127.6 bits of entropy in every 128 bits.<p>If you take the 128-bit chunks they reference, and throw that through a cryptographic hash function, <i>then</i> you&#x27;d be safe (don&#x27;t ask me to prove it).<p>But they don&#x27;t quite get there.  They talk about using one as a way to avoid throwing away entropy, but not as a means of scrambling up the 128 biased bits into a suitable PRNG.')
