Why not, right? It&#x27;s probably the most satisfying too, so we forget the bits where we document, explain to colleagues, organize, etc. Don&#x27;t forget that a lot of &quot;not working&quot; such as browsing a certain orange-and-beige website actually IS work as well: you wouldn&#x27;t be updated on what&#x27;s going on in the tech world if you didn&#x27;t read some new things regularly.<p>However consider that there&#x27;s entire classes of people who never do anything as satisfying as coding during their day. All they do is communicate in some way: making powerpoints, schmoozing with customers over lunch, sitting in meetings to discuss what the business should do. Typically you&#x27;ll never find one of those people saying they don&#x27;t do much. In fact, many of them feel compelled to sit in the office - face time - to look busy. If you were to narrowly define their work like I&#x27;ve done with software devs, many people would end up with maybe a couple of hours a day, mainly reading some docs to decide what their business unit should do.')
