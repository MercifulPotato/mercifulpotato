Item(by='Cullinet', descendants=None, kids=[25525260], score=None, time=1608775812, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25524048, text='At least in the UK, Monzo Bank gives me the ability to create and tear down virtual debit cards that I can name and use to individually identify which card I used. Each is complete with a CVC number.<p>It&#x27;s not one time unless you want to do the setup and teardown for every purchase, but the Â£15 monthly fee includes phone and other insurance and the app exports your account ledger to Excel and CSV. Customer service and vanishing transactions from the app ledger have been worrying me but I was promptly put in touch with management as soon as I dusted off a smidgeon of English idiomatic equivalents to &quot;wtf&quot; and this seems to have been caused by Transport For London running adjustments for the daily Oyster journey payment limit (via taking a holding charge placeholder payment in the way hotels ring fence for your stay on debit cards) so the final amount is adjusted the following day to enable the 0400 end of their day.')
