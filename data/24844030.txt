Item(by='lapcatsoftware', descendants=None, kids=[24845966, 24844381], score=None, time=1603243780, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24838816, text='&quot;You have to trust Apple&quot;, it&#x27;s said. But I suspect that if you actually knew how much your Apple devices were phoning home to Cupertino, you wouldn&#x27;t trust Apple anymore. Using Little Snitch (the kernel extension) was a real eye opener for me. Especially when I allowed Little Snitch to block all Apple processes (by disabling the built-in iCloud Services and macOS Services rule groups).<p>This may be a good time to remind folks of my blog post where I explain how Catalina phones home when you run unsigned executables, including shell scripts! In the article I mentioned that you can prevent this with Little Snitch. But that was the LS kext. Is it even possible anymore?\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lapcatsoftware.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;catalina-executables.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lapcatsoftware.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;catalina-executables.htm...</a><p>Let me just quote one comment from the HN discussion of that article: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23278253" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23278253</a>\n&quot;Making this about speed is burying the lede. From a privacy and user-freedom perspective, it&#x27;s horrifying. Don&#x27;t think so? Apple now theoretically has a centralized database of every Mac user who&#x27;s ever used youtube-dl. Or Tor. Or TrueCrypt.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s all too easy to dismiss the privacy violations that we&#x27;re not aware of. Out of sight, out of mind.')
