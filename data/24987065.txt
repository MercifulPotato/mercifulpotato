There were too many tiny parties with 1-3% which weakened the main parties, making it easier for the NSDAP to gain mindshare.<p>Back then powers were not sufficiently separated and the president had more power than he should. Both the president and Hitler wanted a more authoritarian state and worked together. Hitler failed to get a majority but he wasn&#x27;t satisfied with a coalition. He instead asked the president to arrange an emergency government to buy more time while Hitler used his goon squad to threaten members of the parliament to just quit or vote the way he wants until he finally got the majority of seats in parliament and then used that majority to abolish the parliament entirely.')
