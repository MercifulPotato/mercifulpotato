Someone might counter that the Unicode consortium accepts requests for new emoji, and that the paid membership needed for deciding which emojis get accepted is not filtered.<p>BUT! I haven&#x27;t seen a mention of which languages the submissions have to use. In fact, the process seems to be only described in English. That puts any culture where English knowledge is limited at a disadvantage.

To give voice to your culture when it comes to accepting emojis. You need to pay them 75 USD. Okay, that might be hard, but let&#x27;s assume you managed. You click &quot;join&quot;, and... It turns out you need a credit card. Not a local bank account, not even an IBAN account, not an e-peso, not anything that covers the methods of payments the little people use in half the world (there are even places in Europe where credit cards are somewhat expensive for people to have).<p>This obviously favors cultures where people are:<p>- rich<p>- English-speaking<p>- have easy access to credit cards<p>My pet theory says that Western sensibilities have led to a persistent lack of an emoji for ð“‚¸.<p>So yeah, please let&#x27;s abandon Unicode emoji and let people decide from the bottom up.')
