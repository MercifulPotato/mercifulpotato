Spit out a handful of domain names, and try contacting each of those a couple times each day. This way, the malware isn&#x27;t tied down to a specific domain or set of domains; the bot herder just has to register any one of the domains in the current day&#x27;s set, and if they lose the domain, they can repeat the process the next day.<p>The downside is that all the bots will generate a lot of DNS traffic checking for those domains. That&#x27;s what&#x27;s being detected here -- the NXDOMAIN responses don&#x27;t carry any desired data, but the malware can&#x27;t avoid generating them while it&#x27;s looking for its owner.')
