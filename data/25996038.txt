I got Stadia controller+Chomecast Ultra free as I have YT Premium subscription and enjoying* playing a few games (Example: Tomb Raider is pretty good on Stadia) but as much as I like the concept of playing any game without worrying about buying console or PC and thinking of how much higher the hardware specs required to run the game, It hurts to know in a couple of years Stadia is still struggling with expanding its game availability in any meaningful way. I am always nervous of buying a game thinking if the service would be discontinued by Google then I&#x27;d lose my content library. Google really needs to make sure to add every major game title (past classics&#x2F;platinum hits and future titles) on Stadia to really compete with Xbox or PS here.<p>* For anyone curious: I have 120 mbps internet connection and Stadia works fine on it.')
