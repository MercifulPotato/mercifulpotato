Each one of those shorts is <i>supposed to</i> have some kind of contract in place that can be used to cover the position (e.g. a call option that would ensure that the stock could be purchased, even if the options contract isn&#x27;t ITM). If there&#x27;s over 100% short interest, then it&#x27;s impossible for all of the outstanding shorts to be covered in that way (or, alternatively, the contracts to cover the short positions are naked, not the shorts themselves).<p>I&#x27;m by no means a finance guy and if I&#x27;ve misunderstood this, I&#x27;m happy to be corrected.')
