Would you need to raise prices to cover the additional cost of launching new spacecraft to replace old ones that run out of fuel and de-orbit after X years?<p>This seems like a bit of a chicken-and-egg problem - even if on-orbit refueling becomes commercialized by the time your spacecraft runs out of fuel, you&#x27;ll need to launch with whatever hardware is necessary to allow the &quot;tanker&quot; spacecraft to dock and transfer propellant. Defining that interface in such a way that spacecraft from multiple companies can all be refueled by a single &quot;tanker&quot; spacecraft seems tricky both from a technical angle as well as from a political&#x2F;social one.')
