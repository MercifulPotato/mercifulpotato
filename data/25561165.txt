It&#x27;s rural round here which isn&#x27;t really walkable (narrow country lanes with poor visibility).<p>Suburbs where I live are very walkable, with footpath on both sides of the road, and typically plenty of traffic calming. Rare to be more than a mile to a school for under 11s, maybe 2-4 miles to high school, half a mile at most to a bus stop.')
