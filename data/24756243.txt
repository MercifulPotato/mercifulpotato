I say that Facebook is within their rights (by your definition) to &quot;censor&quot; this. Personally I don&#x27;t consider this censorship.\nWhat else do you want me to say? You&#x27;re talking about this like if it was a science where 2+2=4, and that&#x27;s far from reality. That&#x27;s why I provided an alternate angle, showing that in other countries Holocaust Denial is a crime.<p>I&#x27;m not changing what &quot;freedom of speech means&quot;. I&#x27;m telling you that freedom of speech doesn&#x27;t come with extra rights to give you the ability to disperse your thoughts and Facebook is also well within its own freedom of speech rights (as a Corporate personhood) to enforce whatever content rules they want.<p>Either way, I&#x27;m not even trying to argue here. You believe this is censorship. Fine. I respect that and really don&#x27;t see that as an irrational thought at all. There&#x27;s some sound reasoning around your idea that this is censorship. I just think that trying to create blanket definitions for &quot;censorship&quot; or &quot;freedom of speech&quot; is an easy escape to allow people to behave like shit. That&#x27;s what I think. Totally a personal opinion, though.')
