In fact, Chrome runs JS via V8, which is what nodejs is using too!<p>It&#x27;s more correct to say &quot;If you want to learn Python, you need to install a Python runtime&quot;, which for me makes a lot of sense. Of course I need somewhere to run Python if I want to learn Python. Same with JS, you need some sort of runtime, either the browser or something like nodejs. Many people go the nodejs route, as you&#x27;ll end up probably needing or wanting tools from the nodejs ecosystem anyways, but some of us got started way before nodejs was even a thing, and some still do, nothing wrong with that.<p>&gt; A simple browser extension doesn&#x27;t need Node. It just doesn&#x27;t. The browser itself already packs everything the extension needs.<p>Yeah, this is absolutely true today, for both Firefox and Chrome. In fact, the browser extensions we develop don&#x27;t even have access to anything nodejs! This tool (web-ext) is simply a tool for making the developer experience better. You&#x27;re in no way required to use it. You can simply create your files and manually zip things up, sign it and publish. Although it gets a bit easier with web-ext.')
