Backup to external SSD or NAS. This is the backup you will rely on if your PC loses all data. It will be fast to replicate to.<p>2. Mirror the external backup to a second external SSD. And sync it every week or month. Sync more often if your data is changing a lot.<p>3. The third layer is an external HDD mirror for the long term off-site backups. HDD are cheaper and more suited for being switched off long term.<p>4. If you can afford the expense of a forth step, every year buy another external HDD and put the previous one aside as an archive to be brought into service if the current one fails to boot.<p>I recommend separating your data into some short of hierarchy and choose what needs to be backed up to what level. So if you have some software ISOs that you could repurchase&#x2F;redownload, then have a separate drive for junk like that and don&#x27;t have it go all the way through the backup steps listed above.')
