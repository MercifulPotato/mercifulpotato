This press release tries hard to position it as &quot;people left because of the severance was really good&quot; because that narrative is in Coinbase&#x27;s interest.  That may be true, but it&#x27;s also possible most of 60 people quit through this program because they were upset about it.<p>In an ideal world a reporter could answer your question by talking to many of the people who quit and ask what motivated their decision, but the severance package almost certainly came with an NDA that would make doing so impossible.<p>So we&#x27;ll likely never know.  Probably one should assume that the answer doesn&#x27;t look great for Coinbase&#x27;s narrative; if they thought it would, they might have done a survey and published data from it.')
