But it seems to be manifestly true if you look at human history <i>that</i> it works better once you try to scale society beyond the tribe.  (At least by my personal quality metric.  But I acknowledge that I am strongly biased by the fact that I&#x27;m a rich white guy in a society dominated by rich white guys, so I&#x27;m definitely open to alternative ideas.  But unfettered free speech doesn&#x27;t seem to me to be working very well, and I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a reflection of my white privilege.  The burden of covid, for example, is falling disproportionately on people of color in no small measure because of denialism.  That seems like a bad outcome to me.)')
