Item(by='xmodem', descendants=None, kids=[25242377], score=None, time=1606474056, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25226522, text='I&#x27;ve moved all of my side project dev to a M1-based mini with 16GB. It&#x27;s still lacking docker+virtualisation support, which is a bit of a headache, but I&#x27;m confident that&#x27;ll be resolved soon. Other than that, everything I need either has been ported or runs great in Rosetta. I&#x27;m blown away by how responsive it is. I often have three JetBrains IDEs, XCode, java, and a node server for the React frontend all running at once, and it just flys. Not only do things build in what feels like half the time, I have yet to notice a heavy build slow down everything else, which happens all the time on my Intel MacBook Pro.<p>Edit to add one downside I forgot to mention: It&#x27;s been a long time since I used a non-portable mac. One annoyance of the mini is that I feel like I&#x27;m being asked for my password every 6 seconds, which is much less of an annoyance on a portable because you have the touch sensor.')
