Putting pictures of equations mid-text combined with occasionally cut-off or accidental multi-line equations <i>kills</i> the readability. I mean, the author already spent the time putting most of the background into a Jupyter notebook, which is much more accessible and readable, even directly in the Github repository [1].<p>I would love to see Medium adjust their formatting to make it possible for something like Tables of Contents, or faithful rendering of notebooks that don&#x27;t just rely on Github gists, but until then, I think it does a huge disservice to the actual information that technical&#x2F;symbolic-math-including authors are trying to convey.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;WessZumino&#x2F;Random-Matrix-theory-for-pedestrians" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;WessZumino&#x2F;Random-Matrix-theory-for-pedes...</a>')
