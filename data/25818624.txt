On the one hand, you ask about practical, actionable stuff; on the other hand, you ask &quot;How many consecutive generations of people living to 100 does it take before it happens at a regular basis.&quot;. The answer to the latter question is not something you can really use for anything.<p>I sometimes wonder if the right thing for westerners wouldn&#x27;t just be a big sequence of photos of mid-tier Japanese restaurant food -- like what&#x27;s served at train stations -- with all the components broken down, along with a description of how a person fits those things together every day to have complete story for food. After going there a few times, I was surprised by how much healthier I ate, and figured out how to reproduce some of the effect back in the United States.<p>One category of difference with Japanese diet is things that are somewhat healthier at baseline. That is the way Japanese junk food is. A mochi is pounded rice, sugar and beans; and many sweets are actually filled with bean paste. A common kind of savory Japanese snack is grilled seaweed.<p>Another category of difference is eating the same thing but just in slightly different proportions. It&#x27;s quite common in the USA that you go somewhere and get a meal and it&#x27;s literally a piece of meat and a potato. Even at a good restaurant; but especially at less expensive restaurants. This isn&#x27;t about Japanese food versus other kinds of foods. If you got a German restaurant in Japan (they are somewhat more popular in Japan than in the USA) and you get a plate it will be like three different kinds of sausages (in small sizes) and one or two salads and one or two vegetable items.<p>This is not due to some kind of technical balancing or something like that; Japanese consumers just demand somewhat more varied food with more vegetables.<p>There isn&#x27;t a recipe or some weights or formulas. I just went there for 1-2 weeks at a time 5-6 times and tried a bunch of food and got used to it, came back and then wondered about what I could do differently. Everything that has changed in my diet as a result is entirely a matter of small adjustments -- adding vegetables at certain times of day or something like that -- but I did lose weight and have enjoyed other benefits like no acid reflux, no food coma, &amp;c.')
