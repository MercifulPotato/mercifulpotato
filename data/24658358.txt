The Indians that are from lower casts or from oppressed groups like Christians or Muslims are really great. But the higher castes are extremely insular, and treat anyone of any race poorly.<p>This might be taboo, but every time I see a situation where there are multiple Indians in a reporting chain, I run. If you have an Indian above and below, you will be bypassed on work, undermined, and given absurd directions, almost designed to drive you out. Then there is the case where if an Indian gets into management, they will start filling everything with their friends. Other management positions, they will start fighting to bring in some contractors from some place like Infosys. Its the death knell of the IT division at the company.<p>Being on a team where you are the only non-Indian means you will be an outcast. You&#x27;ll not be invited to meetings, they&#x27;ll talk in their native tongue to exclude you. I&#x27;ve been the only white guy working with Chinese, and they don&#x27;t do that. I&#x27;ve been in similar situations with Africans &#x2F; and African Americans and they will welcome you right along.<p>This is the truth, no matter how politically incorrect it is, and every time you walk into an IT office and there are 80% Indians, that&#x27;s the reason.')
