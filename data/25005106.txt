There&#x27;s no rhyme or reason besides &quot;might makes right&quot;, and the rules for businesses seem to change every week, so the growing public frustration is very understandable.<p>I&#x27;m proud of these students. It&#x27;s unconscionable that their institution did not inform them of these installations ahead of time. I&#x27;ve been a student who had to walk a couple miles for groceries, and I held my walking routes to be sacred during that time. If someone put a wall between me and fresh fruits during an exam week with no warning, I would have rioted too. And I bet my grandmother who lived through the Blitz would be rooting for them despite her zeal for giving things up for the public good.
