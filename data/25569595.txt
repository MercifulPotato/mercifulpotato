I usually have three or four different kinds of flower on hand and I recently picked up one called rockstar. I&#x27;m quite experienced but the latent effects of that strain is too much for me. I smoked a bowl last night at 9PM, its nearly 24 hours later and I still want to go back to bed. And I already guzzled three mugs of coffee. Good shit but hell no on a work night. Never have I had a strain that beat me up so much the following day.')
