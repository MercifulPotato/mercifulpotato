This is for fun, to some degree. One, we love Linode, they’re a great partner… Two, we love you, Gerhard, and all the work you’ve done here… We don’t really need this setup.

But beyond that, I think it’s important to remind our audience that we don’t really need this; it’s fun to have, and actually a worthwhile investment for us, because this does cost us money (Gerhard does not work for free), and it’s part of this desire to learn for ourselves, and then also to share it with everyone else… So that’s fun.
