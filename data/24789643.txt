Item(by='Symbiote', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602775894, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24789101, text='I just bought a 3D printer, partly for fun, partly as I want to print some mechanical keyboard cases.<p>I&#x27;ve only printed a few things so far.  Some board game tiles are perfectly smooth on the &quot;top&quot; (they were printed face down), and the very slight texture on the bottom makes a nice pattern when it reflects the light.  The bottom texture is as coarse as a typical cotton fabric, but hard not soft. In other words, I can feel the texture, but it&#x27;s even, like rubbing a pebble.<p>I also printed some chess pieces, which are essentially cylinders.  The texture is visible, but completely consistent all the way up each piece.<p>If this battery door really does show the &quot;limitation of an entry level 3D printer&quot; then I&#x27;m very glad I spent a bit more money.  I still know very little on this subject, but while choosing what to buy I found tutorials on building a printer from parts for â‚¬100 or so. This reminds me of the first print from something like that, before the expert showed how to correct the worst problems.')
