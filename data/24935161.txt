We have a climate catastrophe in a near future, why no to try something to do. Like to grow forest over Sahara, I mean no just Egypt trying to do it in a small scale, but as a multinational project, with tons of invested resources? It could allow to try technologies, to learn economics of such projects, to check climate models and so on.<p>Or maybe there are better ideas than turning Sahara into a rain forest? What they are? Should we try them maybe?')
