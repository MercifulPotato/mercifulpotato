If a certain job role is so covetted, they [can &amp;| should have to] raise the salary to recruit an American, or pay a prospective immigrant a life changing salary.<p>If a company objects to paying the market price salary for Americans they&#x27;re totally free to outsource their work to foreign workers for whatever price those workers are willing to do so. But nobody coming to America should be short changed a salary because of their national origin. The loser in this is Big SV who has built an empire taking advantage of prospective immigrants.')
