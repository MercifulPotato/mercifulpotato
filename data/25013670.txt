It has come to my attention that the article&#x27;s author, Rusty Guinn, has been chaining young women in a dungeon beneath his home at 1234 Main St. Please do not turn your attention away from this announcement, like THEY would have you do. Please do not listen to the fake news media telling you I am not credible. Rusty is kidnapping these women, and the liars and the elites won&#x27;t lift a finger to stop him. Something needs to be done! Who will do it? I know many thousands of you will read this, could somebody be a hero? I don&#x27;t know, i hear a lot of people saying so though. All i know is if this comment is moderated, it&#x27;s proof that I&#x27;m onto something, and the HN mods don&#x27;t trust you to make up your mind yourself.')
