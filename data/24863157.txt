From reading the blog post, it seems a new user could choose to either pay once for lifetime access, or pay yearly. However, since I’ve been given the upgrade and 1 year of membership for free, I don’t see the lifetime option. Presumably the discounted lifetime price will no longer be available by the time my 1 year runs out. How can I lock in the discounted price now?')
