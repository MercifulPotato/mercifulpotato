It would only add to the already rampant collection of information bubbles created by the producer-follower model used by so many social networking sites. Instead of a producer-follower model I&#x27;d like to see a subject-discussant centred model where you &quot;tune in&quot; to a field of interest instead of a single voice. I do not follow any single author nor have I ever done so, instead I rely on search facilities to find things of interest. I use RSS feeds to &quot;follow&quot; publications and discussion sites - like this one - which are authored by a multitude of authors and discussants in part to avoid getting trapped in an information bubble.<p>Instead of an option to follow certain authors there could be an option to follow certain subjects across time, e.g. &quot;free software mobile platforms&quot;, &quot;process control systems based on common single-board computers&quot;, &quot;decentralisation of internet services&quot;, etc. Posts and comments from all authors (no matter their score) can be returned on such a category in chronological order, with links back to their original appearance on the site. Categories could be created through search queries, curated by hand (similar to the way indexes like DMOZ [1] were maintained) or by using ML to track discussion trends.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;DMOZ" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;DMOZ</a>')
