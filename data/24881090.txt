It might suck, but at least it feels like accepting things as they are.<p>Also it just weirds me out, like I&#x27;ll end up trapped in an eternal versin of animal crossing or something. Of course religious people don&#x27;t think of it like that and it&#x27;s all more sublime and full of unity with god and so on but it still doesn&#x27;t sound great.<p>i don&#x27;t know if this is just the hacky pop-culture reading of Buddhism but I&#x27;ve always liked the idea of Nirvana more than the kind of stories told by the Abrahamic religions.')
