So I try it. And after a week or two, I realize what I&#x27;m missing from Emacs and go back. This has happened several times, because I keep thinking, maybe I didn&#x27;t give VSCode the fair shake it deserves. But VSCode never lives up to the hype, is not compellingly better than Emacs such that I want to switch, and is in some ways worse. Emacs gives me a computing environment that I can shape and mold to my needs quickly and directly, as I use it. VSCode is extensible; for Emacs, extending it is an integral part of working with it.<p>What&#x27;s more, VSCode is not even open source. It&#x27;s more like &quot;open core&quot;. The editor core is under an MIT license, but the binary you download from code.visualstudio.com is proprietary, as are many of the most useful plug-ins. Source ports like VSCodium are not first-class in the extension ecosystem.<p>Emacs, by contrast, is the next thing beyond open source: it&#x27;s software that describes itself. Whether that be the tutorial for new users, built-in documentation for every function or variable, or the ability to M-. into the implementation, whether in Lisp or C, of any function, the guts of Emacs are always at your fingertips. I get the feeling RMS intended &quot;free software&quot; to be a baseline, a bare minimum for protecting the user&#x27;s freedom. To truly emancipate the user, something like Emacs where the software actively aids the user&#x27;s understanding of its internals, is needed.')
