When you take in a dependency, you become dependent on it. That is necessary work.<p>It&#x27;s great to highlight that dependencies always mean work. There&#x27;s probably some deeper truth to that, at least in what I do. But that doesn&#x27;t mean all work is bad. After all, work is what we put in to make things, well, work.<p>I &quot;maintain&quot; a bunch of fixes (that is, forks) of upstream stuff that I use all around the place. I used to maintain a few packages just for recreation. I have selinux dependencies, ansible playbooks, system accounts, certificates, and a lot of other stuff that I need to maintain in order to make stuff work.<p>I guess I wanted to say don&#x27;t be afraid to maintain your dependencies. Sure, it&#x27;s work, but not unnecessary work.')
