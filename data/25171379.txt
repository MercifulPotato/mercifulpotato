On HDD, serial transactions can&#x27;t go faster than roughly twice the rotation time of the HDD per write, plus seeks, and on network filesystems they can&#x27;t go faster than four times the network latency (two syncs per commit) plus whatever the backing store needs.<p>The trick to getting high commit throughput is to allow the durability part of multiple independent transactions to be committed concurrently.  On a filesystem-backed DB this means writing multiple transactions per fdatasync.  It would be tricky for SQLite to do this because of its architecture as a library and synchronous API, but not impossible.')
