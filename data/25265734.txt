It all boils down to M1 processor being leaps and bounds better than anything Qualcomm offers.<p>Edit:&#x2F;&#x2F;Windows 10 like every Windows version offered since Windows XP is built on Windows NT(not Windows 95&#x2F;9x) which supported MIPS, Power PC and DEC Alpha.\nMore modern versions of Windows(up to server 2008) was also available for the itanium.\nMicrosoft knows how to make an OS just fine. The UX is a different story as of late but then again I a very happy I moved off MacOS.')
