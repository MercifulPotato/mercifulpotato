With a simple VM, you could fit it in a GPU kernel (keep in mind the language limitations) and then you’ll have no issues launching your huge batch in parallel.<p>I don’t know if genetic program generation has any useful applications however. Personally I am more interested in applying genetic algorithms to machine learning, i.e. neuroevolution. A few examples include NEAT and Uber’s reinforcement learning research.')
