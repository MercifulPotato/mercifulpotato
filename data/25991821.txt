A big part of it is that because I&#x27;m choosing my projects, I&#x27;m able to pick things that I&#x27;m naturally excited about working on. The other is that I&#x27;ve found a virtuous cycle of:<p>1. I build something new or add a feature<p>2. I write a blog post explaining what I learned<p>3. People read about what I learned and check out the thing I built<p>So, it&#x27;s a way to frequently attract users, even if it&#x27;s a brand new thing, and then having people test it out is motivating.<p>There are two times I recall struggling with motivation this past year:<p>While working on Is It Keto, it always felt like so much work and time before I could see if an idea was viable. Even just putting up a landing page for a new product and linking to it from the main site, I&#x27;d have to wait at least a week to get reasonable data on conversion rates. So, I found it hard to stay motivated when I didn&#x27;t feel like I had a process that was working and didn&#x27;t have confidence investing effort anywhere would yield results.<p>The other was toward the end of the year working on TinyPilot. I promised a premium version of TinyPilot by the end of the year, and I was trying to figure out how to design license activation for it. But that&#x27;s really boring because it meant several weeks of work on something that&#x27;s not useful to users. I kept putting it off because I was never excited to work on it. Finally, I realized I could basically just go by the honor system and ask users to install on one device per purchase, and that cut out a lot of boring work and let me work on improving the product again.<p>So my general experience is that when I&#x27;m feeling unmotivated, something is wrong and I have to make a change that makes me feel more naturally motivated to do the work.')
