Yes, people do use slightly different styles, but style is really easy to enforce - there are tools to do it automatically. And even if somebody misplaces a brace or writes `map(_.length)` instead of `map(x =&gt; x.length)` this doesn&#x27;t impact the readability as long people in your team know the language. If a project fails to meet the deadline because of the code style it is not because of people using different styles but because of developers bikeshedding about the code style in code reviews instead of doing real work.')
