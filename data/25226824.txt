If I put 10l in, I&#x27;ll be able to travel 160km.<p>It&#x27;s the swapping round that confuses me. I know it&#x27;s &quot;how much fuel will I need to go X distance&quot;, I just don&#x27;t grok it intuitively that way round<p>The &quot;per 100km&quot; seems arbitrary to me too, why not 60ml&#x2F;km.')
