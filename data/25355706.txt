Mean sunshine hours where I live is 3000hrs&#x2F;y. Assuming 100% efficiency, 100% solar irradiance, perfect angle etc for those 3000hours, we get ~10^10J of energy. Those are bad assumptions, but very generous.<p>In a gram of deuterium, per e=mc^2, we get ~10^12J. There is 100x more energy in a single gram of deterium than a year of intense sunshine. Deterium is far from rare -- 1 part in ~10,000. Consider the vast amounts of deterium in the oceans and realize if fusion becomes a reality, nuclear, solar, oil, wind etc all become irrelevant overnight.<p>I recommend this \n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dothemath.ucsd.edu&#x2F;2012&#x2F;01&#x2F;nuclear-fusion&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dothemath.ucsd.edu&#x2F;2012&#x2F;01&#x2F;nuclear-fusion&#x2F;</a><p>for a layman&#x27;s introduction of the energy scales involved here.')
