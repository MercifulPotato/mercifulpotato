Any views on this?<p>If it&#x27;s necessary for the interface, then it should of course be in the interface. But he was referring to the unnecessary placement of internal implementation functions into the class. This is all over the current codebase and it drives me _crazy_. In a healthy codebase, a header file is the best documentation yiu can have of a class, and polluting it with unnecessary functions that have no meaning to the user makes it harder to read and reason about.')
