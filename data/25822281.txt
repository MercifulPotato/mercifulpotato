Sure, it happens in things like games quite a lot, but the main use is actually _cryptography_&quot;</i><p>I&#x27;d be curious if that&#x27;s actually true.  I know XOR is used for non-cryptographic checksums, parity bits, maintaining key traversal order for associative arrays, overflow detection, etc. Lots of general purpose &quot;stuff&quot; that isn&#x27;t cryptography.')
