Keller, Bryan J. Norton, David J. Farrar, Phil Rutschman, Maclen Marvit &amp; Arty Makagon!  I look forward to deploying this tech to deal with fruit flies soonish.  I don’t even need to do a back of the envelope calculation to have confidence this is soon to be a viable first world niche product.  I think it’s likely viable at a massive scale (many millions of units) too.')
