On TouchID phones, it was always fiddly, double-touching (but not pressing) the home button, but the gesture that replaced it on FaceID devices feels natural. I was originally apprehensive about moving to a larger phone yet again after the iPhone 6, but it has more or less made &quot;big phones&quot; a non-issue for me.<p>There are one or two apps I use that seem to reliably have the touchUpInside issue you describe, so I wonder if it&#x27;s down to their implementation. The Redfin app in particular is terrible with this.')
