They just cover different use cases.<p>(b) makes the &quot;macOS is particularly bad for development because I found Jupyter&#x2F;Python deps difficult there&quot; argument moot, as messed up Python dependencies are the case in Windows and Linux as well.<p>And (g) says that Docker and co has superceded manually setting up Python environments for many (not necessarily all or even most) devs, mitigating concerns about managing multiple local versions different deps&#x2F;libs&#x2F;language versions to work with different projects (since you can now do that in different, isolated, virtual environments which are mini-OSes in themselves).<p>So (b) basically amounts to: &quot;It&#x27;s not macOS which is makes Python deps shitty, they are inherently shitty&quot;.<p>And (g) basically amounts to: &quot;Since Docker and co make local development dep issues mostly obsolete, even if macOS was bad at local deps, it wouldn&#x27;t matter as much today anyway as virtualization levels the field&quot;.<p>And of course, with the field levelled by (g), if you go for virtualized dev envrironments, you still get all the other benefits like e, f, c, and d.')
