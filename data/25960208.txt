I installed signal because I already have multiple others for video&#x2F;chat&#x2F;messaging apps and everyone is scattered across each of them. One more app? So what?<p>People in the media, twotter, etc act as if there is only one and that everyone is only on that one and its an all or nothing deal. Apparently you must only use one chat or video call app.<p>Here&#x27;s the list I an hooked into because of the &quot;network effect&quot; so far in no particular order. Irc, signal, imessage, slack, facebook, telegram, discord, sms, houseparty, snapchat, zoom, jabber(xmpp). I haven&#x27;t even listed the games I also play and their own chat, eg xbox.<p>I also run a chat server for projects and that is totally custom. Because it was a rainy weekend so thats what I built. Webrtc &#x2F; websocket are interesting to play with.<p>I&#x27;ve yet to install wechat. Thats probably still awhile off.<p>Addendum: these aren&#x27;t all on the one device either. That&#x27;s another assumption people in media often make.')
