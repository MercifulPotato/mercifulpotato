I enjoy reading plant folklore.<p>The shape and form of ginseng ..a kind of homunculus..reminds me of another root with a likely sinister folk lore&#x2F;mythology : Mandrake&#x2F;Mandragora*<p>I have grown several mandrakes..mostly mandragora autumnalis. I didn’t know what to do with it. So I bottled the root in vodka. I have three more potted ones. They do seem to have a ‘plant spirit’.<p>For a while..when I was gardening more than farming, I was fascinated by what’s known as poison plants. They have fascinating mythologies and even more fascinating chemistry. Turns out a lot of them are medicinal as well. We extract medicine from atropa belladonna, digitalis, scopolamine, datura stramonium, henbane, aconite&#x2F;henbane, the yew tree, hemlock and more. But fundamentally, they are all poisons. I like to imagine all plants as female archetypes. They cover the spectrum of maiden, mother and crone.<p>Before I got into farming, I tried my hand at art(badly). I found out that I lacked artistic discipline and firm strokes, but I was more comfortable with ‘colours’. It’s difficult to explain..each of the plant spirit had a different colour based on its qualities and nature. Cross referencing then with mythologies of the world, there is a rich collection of plant characters.<p>Thanks again.<p>* <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Mandragora_(genus)" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Mandragora_(genus)</a>')
