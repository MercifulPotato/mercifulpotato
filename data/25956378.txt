Shorting after it has dropped so much already is an unprofitable strategy. These are cascading liquidations and the valid strategy is to go long when the liquidations stop and you get a relief bounce that squeezes out the novice shorts who chased the move. People have different names for the strategy (wall drop long, parabolic long). Shorts are mostly covering (not initiating) during the drop. The only sophisticated traders adding to a short would be options dealers who need to gamma hedge, or delta one HFTs trying to capture a quick move based on short term order flow imbalance.')
