I&#x27;ve funded and contributed to many of them!<p>The most famous is probably OpenFL, which uses the Haxe programming language. It does exactly that. You can even use  Adobe Animate to author content for it.<p>The main missing pieces, however, are:<p>1) The abstraction inevitably leaks. HTML5 is just a fundamentally fiddly bundle of tech and there&#x27;s always this or that little thing that can shake loose.<p>2) The tech burden is fundamentally higher with an open source project no matter how you try. With Flash you never needed to even touch a command line or download anything other than the Flash authoring tool.<p>3) The community is smaller. Fewer tutorials, fewer people able and willing to help you out. It&#x27;s respectable, but back in the day Flash&#x27;s community was MASSIVE. You&#x27;d post on the forum and get a detailed technical reply in MINUTES.<p>4) Resources are thinner. Without Macromedia or Adobe&#x27;s pockets individual developers just have to bear the burden of dev&#x2F;maintenance themselves.<p>5) Flash portals are dead. Now everything&#x27;s about app stores for software and baked-out video for animation.<p>It&#x27;s still a great project and I use it myself, but IMHO it&#x27;s going to take someone to dump a bunch of money and time on top of these ongoing projects to recreate all the magic Flash had. There&#x27;s only so much a small community of open source coders can be expected to pull off.')
