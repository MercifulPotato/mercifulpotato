But with not enough eyes carefully reviewing the code security vulnerabilities will remain also in open source code. And once a bad actor finds it it will be easier to implement an exploit.<p>It&#x27;s not opening the source that makes the software more secure. It&#x27;s enough reviewers or white hats looking at the code. Security vulnerabilities in Linux (both kernel and user space) show that regularly.<p>Of course with closed source your external reviewers are zero, so that&#x27;s not the solution.')
