I&#x27;ve long said that if we are to launch any kind of significant space-faring civilization, we will need to some extent to become a different species, through cybernetics &amp; drugs or genetic engineering (probably a mix).<p>Our current biggest challenge is to make ourselves &#x27;smarter&#x27; (i.e. less susceptible to the biases baked into our DNA).  Otherwise, it&#x27;s likely only a matter of time before we cripple ourselves into an extended Dark Age or worse.  Constant setbacks resulting from too many of us having ignorant, emotional reactions to incomplete stories with insufficient facts means we&#x27;re all dancing on shifting sand.  It&#x27;s not a good foundation upon which to build a durable interstellar civilization.')
