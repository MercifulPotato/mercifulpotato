I have written enough code. I wanted to be in a position to get projects done for the business. To facilitate the work, to help guide it, to be a manager that programmers could work with. And so far, so good. I am way more stressed out than ever but this is my own making, and I am learning to live with what is ultimately a different kind of stress than  you experience as a dev.<p>I really like the comment about &quot;would you do it for the same money&quot;. If the answer is no, you are probably better off not doing it.')
