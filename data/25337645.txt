But you can right-click on it in the list in Steam and check the box that says &quot;Force the use of a specific Steam Play compatibility tool&quot;. Then select a version of compatibility tools from the list and see if it starts up. For me, it started fine with 4.11-13.<p>There&#x27;s also a room in Keen Software House&#x27;s Discord which is dedicated for unofficial Linux help. Sometimes a patch will break the game in an unexpected way. For example I remember a patch early this year that made it so that the version check would crash the game on Linux (something to do with KSH&#x27;s HTTPS certificate) and the easiest solution was to just null-route the patch server address in iptables or blacklist the domain in pihole until a later patch fixed the problem.')
