He&#x27;s not a dev on AutoPilot team.<p>It&#x27;s well documented that FSD is a architectural rewrite of the code.<p>Pre-FSD the input to NN were individual still pictures taken by the cameras.<p>New architecture feeds NN with video feed from all cameras.<p>New architecture is possible thanks to new FSD chip that is 20x better that was Tesla used before.<p>I don&#x27;t see what definition of NN would consider them the same system.<p>On YouTube you can find talks by Karpathy where he goes into detail about this stuff.')
