You don’t get a decent implementation of it by bolting it on after the fact. Breakloops need full access to the entire development system, interactively, with a computation and its call stack suspended in the breakloop’s environment.<p>Interestingly, while Ruby’s default REPL (irb) doesn’t have this, and Ruby’s (and irb’s) designers obviously <i>didn’t</i> think this facility through in the planning stages, Ruby <i>does</i> have an alternate REPL (pry) which has a lot of the advanced REPL functionality irb is missing but <i>also</i> doesn’t have this function built-in, but which does have a separate add-on (pry-rescue) which provides it.')
