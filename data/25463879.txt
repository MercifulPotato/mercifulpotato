If the unscrupulous actors are 10% less effective because of Amazon&#x27;s efforts, does that mean the &quot;purpose&quot; of the system has shifted 10% away from honest dealing? If Amazon all but eliminates dishonesty, does that mean the &quot;purpose&quot; of the system is to have an ever present, tiny baseline of fraud? At that point, better to use a different word.<p>It&#x27;s because of strategic equivocation between the &quot;actor&quot; being implied in the &quot;purpose.&quot; The implication is that Amazon creates the system and this is their purpose, but the cybernetician&#x27;s definition of purpose is more like &quot;the role this system plays in the overall society in light of all the infinite restrictions on everyone&#x27;s behavior.&quot;')
