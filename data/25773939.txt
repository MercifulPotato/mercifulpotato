I would make a counter example with depression drugs. A former colleague, lives in NY amd has his wife and daughter on anti-depressants. Upon inquiry on why they were drugged up, his response was both spine chilling and grotesque.<p>&quot;They&#x27;ve been feeling a bit down lately. &quot;<p>A medical professional saw fit to prescribe an otherwise healthy 12yr old and a healthy 34yr old anti-depressants because those drugs are legal. That was eye opening. The medical establishment is using their trust to peddle these drugs\nHave you met someone taking anti-depressants then they stop?<p>I havent.
