Pretty much anything that sends my mind off into a cool direction works well. Some narrators are better than others (Stefan Rudnicki has a great voice, and William Dufris does a wonderful job of voicing characters).<p>I searched high and low for headphones that I can sleep in. I can&#x27;t sleep on my back, so big cans are right out. I hate earbuds and things that poke into my ear canal, and headband-like arrangements slide around, are hot and compress my ears painfully. I finally found a set of small, disk-like phones that fit flat and in the center of my ear, just outside the ear canal; with a little extra padding these are very, very comfortable.<p>[The product I liked are Bedphones, from dubslabs.com; they are expensive, but I found them totally worth it. I use the wired version, and they tend to tangle badly unless you take a little care wrapping them up, but I <i>hate</i> having yet another device to charge]<p>----<p>&quot;Really? Doctor, I think your stories are simply divine--&quot;<p>&quot;Thank you.&quot;<p>&quot;Oh, I really do. I put one of your tapes on my player and let it lull me to sleep almost every night.&quot;<p>&quot;Higher praise a writer cannot expect,&quot; Jubal said with a straight face.<p>- Robert Heinlein, <i>Stranger in a Strange Land</i>')
