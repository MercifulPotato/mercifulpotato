Nothing at all like an iPad: the e ink makes it look like paper, and even the tip of the (passive) stylus feels like writing on actual paper (it &quot;scratches&quot; ever so slightly, even if it obviously doesn&#x27;t actually scratches the screen).<p>It also doesn&#x27;t do fancy stuff: it&#x27;s black and white, and doesn&#x27;t do OCR on device at all. It&#x27;s basically just a notepad that is synced to your other devices (without the manual picture step, and you can get svg instead, etc)<p>To me it&#x27;s too a notepad what a kindle is to books: a single purpose device that does it&#x27;s job very well.<p>Oh yeah, and about two weeks of battery life is pretty good.<p>I realize I&#x27;m starting to sound a bit like a sales rep... but I&#x27;m just a fanboy user.')
