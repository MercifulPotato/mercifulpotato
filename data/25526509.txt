Part of its importance, compared to some of the other movies you’ve mentioned, is the story of how it got made &#x2F; that it got made at all. Welles had zero film experience, yet was fully funded, and the movie itself was a direct attack on one of the single most powerful men of the era. Welles himself was a larger-than-life character and that’s probably half the reason we are still talking about <i>Kane.</i> Art isn’t created in a vacuum, after all.<p>I’m not sure what a modern equivalent would look like, but imagine a $200 million studio film that eloquently attacks the heads of CNN, The NY Times, and another half-dozen top media firms. That sort of thing would never get made today.<p>Thanks for the other suggestion though, I’ll look into it for sure!')
