This checkbox is ignored (or really, visibly re-enabled during the auth flow).<p>It is very easy to end up in a situation where your org suddenly has full control of your personal Windows device. It is also very easy (again, because of broken auth workflows) to end up with your personal MS account on your work PC. OneDrive can then at any point (most likely after a Windows update) start downloading all of your personal content to your work device.<p>Microsoft has been trying to blur the lines between Windows and Office. IME, this has made both fundamentally untrustworthy, because it is very hard to know what I am authorizing (and they will explicitly ignore&#x2F;reset my choice anyway) and where my data will end up.<p>It feels very bad to know that, at any time and without warning, Microsoft can begin sharing my personal data into my work-managed IT systems.')
