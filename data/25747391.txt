AMD still hasn&#x27;t overtaken them in low core count performance in the laptop space and this should hold them off from doing that until at least Zen 4 (late Fall-ish or so) or open Intel up more time to continue changing its momentum if Zen 4 falters any. In this space the M1 is still miles ahead both (i.e. AMD&#x2F;Intel can generally match the performance or the power budget with their latest designs but the M1 can do both at the same time). On the desktop side the Rocket Lake S should just eek out Zen 3 on single core performance albeit ~6 months (or about half a product cycle) later. Certainly good news for Intel as it keeps them from being steamrolled in a single year but that means AMD still has higher momentum, a time advantage on the next release, a guarantee that TSMCs new 5nm process they want to use works (as used in the M1), and a significantly better many core position.<p>AMD has their presentation shortly but I wouldn&#x27;t expect more than news on Zen 3 mobiles (which may dampen Intel&#x27;s presentation a bit but probably won&#x27;t outdo them) and Zen 3 Epyc (server, likely to wipe the floor) this early into it on the CPU side.')
