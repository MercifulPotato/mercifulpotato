I am starting to use it more and more with every week and I am really enjoying it.<p>Interesting side effect was that for a long time I wanted to have a comfortable note system that would allow to store ideas related to books I am reading, side project, work  projects etc. And I could never keep a system because I always over complicated requirements for that notes system in my mind. Now I just started to use my journal for that, it’s fairly unstructured and would be hard to use as a reference once I have a lot of content, but that’s absolutely fine. Just the act of taking the note in journal is super helpful. And with a few distinct journals in the app I have enough structure to keep it useful')
