As I understand it he wants to run signal as a lifestyle business, and he has private donors keeping everything afloat. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;ll stay independant if Moxie ever leaves, but hopefully there&#x27;s a stable org structure. Source: The JRE podcast he did a couple months back.<p>Also if they ever sell out, the server &amp; clients are completely opensource. It wouldn&#x27;t take much for someone else to fork the whole thing and run a competing service if we ever need to.')
