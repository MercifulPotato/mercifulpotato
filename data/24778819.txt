FT is like changing the reference frame. Similarly, the movement of planets are more easily described in an heliocentric model than in an Earth-centric model. You can write the transform between those two models, but this does not increase the complexity of the solar system itself: you don&#x27;t add features, which is exactly the issue with software.<p>A slightly better analogy would be the shift from Newtonian physics to relativist physics, that describes more accurately how things move. However, you still don&#x27;t add complexity to the described thing, you just discover more of its complexity and get a more complex description as a result.<p>What we have here is simply the effect of something we know one expect of as Parkinson&#x27;s law [1], which is a specific case of the Induced demand phenomenon [2].<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Parkinson%27s_law" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Parkinson%27s_law</a>\n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Induced_demand" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Induced_demand</a>')
