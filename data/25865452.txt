The estate we were dealing with was a bit of a mess, so we basically had nothing to go on except some bank&#x2F;credit card statements. We were able to contact the banks, deactivate all the credit cards, and contact some services to request refunds for several months of service. We didn&#x27;t have any trouble getting those refunds after providing the death certificate.<p>Obviously, it would have been much less of a hassle if we&#x27;d had the account information from the beginning, but there were much more annoying problems to deal with than deactivating Netflix.<p>If you&#x27;re really concerned about this, make sure you have a will in place and beneficiaries defined on your financial accounts. That is probably just as important as making sure your dependents have immediate access to your money.')
