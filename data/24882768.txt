I&#x27;ve lived plenty of places where, being poor, I couldn&#x27;t afford to travel to planned parenthood.<p>Lots of folks get pregnant on these: Most folks can&#x27;t take birth control pills perfectly. (I Personally cannot use hormonal birth control at all without major side effects, and wanted to be sterilized - but that&#x27;s not generally an option for childless women)<p>Abortion is legal, sure: But it isn&#x27;t free either and in some states, it takes travel and things to get there.<p>Expecting folks to put their child up for adoption is simply cruel. Besides, we should look at more than financial viability for folks. I&#x27;d rather help folks raise whatever children they have than sell children off (taxpayer funded is the way to go) and I&#x27;d much rather foster homes and adoption of older children be encouraged.')
