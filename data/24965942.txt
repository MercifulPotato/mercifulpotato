If they failed to show though, you should be able to get a default judgement eventually.<p>(note - GDPR is in some cases privately litigable, so you don&#x27;t need to wait around for a snail&#x27;s pace regulator - you can indeed sue for relief and get your legal costs back in the award. I&#x27;d expect a lawyer would take this case on a contingent basis given how clear-cut the GDPR is about your right to access your own data).')
