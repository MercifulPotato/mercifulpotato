I think I read about Zoomquilt in the mid 2000&#x27;s in one of the magazines I used to buy. And I think they included a copy of the swf on the cover disc, which was nice because I probably didnâ€™t have Internet on my computer back then.<p>The magazine where I read about it and got the swf from was I think either Digital Creative Arts magazine, or Digital Arts magazine, or Computer Arts magazine. All of those were different magazines I used to buy from time to time. Could also have been ImagineFX magazine or in one of the web design magazines.')
