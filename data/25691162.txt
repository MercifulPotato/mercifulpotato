It&#x27;s impossible to implement -- unless of course we have no private ownership and the <i>government</i> runs and pays for everything but I feel like that would be even worse.<p>Cable TV didn&#x27;t want to run &quot;offensive&quot; shows because their advertisers wouldn&#x27;t pay to advertise with them if they did.
