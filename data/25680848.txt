I believe that many people were arrested any time the protests turned violent or in cases of significant vandalism. I know there were many highly reported arrests in my part of the country from the parts of the protests that went out of control.<p>Still, they weren&#x27;t insurrectionists. They weren&#x27;t trying to put someone in power who lost the election. That&#x27;s an important distinction. Maybe we shouldn&#x27;t compare them at all, but if we&#x27;re going to, what MAGA did was worse.')
