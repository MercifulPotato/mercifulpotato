I think there is a practical middle way that protects non-technical users without usurping their privacy, and also a way to give same extra control to power users. I think it&#x27;s fairly straightforward:<p>- instead of OCSP use CRLs or a better technique that allows MacOS to verify locally if a certificate is valid. This would preserve user privacy and wouldn&#x27;t risk slowing down the user&#x27;s computer in case things go wrong. It would also introduce slightly bigger risk because of the increase in the validity window, but I think that&#x27;s a price worth paying. Regarding the size of the CRL&#x27;s, there should be some cryptographic techniques like accumulators, bloom filters etc. that could improve the size.<p>- allow power users to add separate trust anchors in cases where they deem appropriate. The same way you go to Control Center to allow an app that was downloaded from the Internet to run, you could also be allowed to add another certificate from a developer you trust.<p>I think these 2 improvements could go a long way in restoring goodwill for Apple.')
