Soon new .eu registrations will be restricted to any natural person, company or organization residing in or established in the European Union, Iceland, Liechtenstein or Norway. This means that customers in the UK will no longer be able to register new .eu domains. Plus, .eu domains that are currently registered to UK addresses will be revoked.<p>These changes may take effect as early as March 30, 2019, but the deadline could shift as Brexit negotiations continue.<p>In light of these new policies, we&#x27;re no longer offering .eu domains to UK residents. We also urge UK residents with .eu domains to consider their options: either update your registrant information to an .eu-compliant address or replace any .eu domains with other available options. &quot;')
