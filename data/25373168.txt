If Red Hat had made this decision earlier (i.e., making CentOS 7 the last version), or made good on their promise to support CentOS 8, I doubt there would be anywhere near as much outrage.<p>Yes, they certainly broke their public commitment; I totally agree that they should have either announced that there would be no CentOS 8 from the beginning, or announced that CentOS 8 would be the last such beast, and after that CentOS would be stream-only.  And it would be totally reasonable for the rest of us to take RedHat&#x27;s other public commitments with a grain of salt from now on.<p>But that doesn&#x27;t rise to the level of &quot;betrayal&quot; to me.  To me, betrayal implies a stronger sense of obligation -- generally from mutual dependence.  I just don&#x27;t think that organizations have that much obligation to people who are consuming their loss-leader.  (See also Travis-ci.)')
