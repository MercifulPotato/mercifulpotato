It matched my mood, sure but it wasn&#x27;t helpful. For years.<p>Now - don&#x27;t laugh! - I am listening to <i>80s synthwave</i> compilations on Youtube all day long. <i>80s synthwave!</i> - I can&#x27;t think of any other music genre that sounds more lighthearted and unworried and it really helps to brighten my mood. The effect is enormous.<p>Other things I currently do to keep my sanity is lots of walking. The effect of physical excercise on me is pretty great but I really need to get the heart pumping and to sweat. This is as easy as putting on too many layers of cloths for the temperature&#x2F;activity and a few inclines&#x2F;hills also helps. Being out in the sun (if the schedule makes it possible) and at the fresh air also improves my mood. Walking through a forest also soothes my mind. Also: walking <i>faster</i> than I normally would helps because I need to concentrate to walk faster than I normally would - which means I can&#x27;t think of anything else i.e. it is actually keeping my mind free of other (sometimes negative) thoughts.<p>Neither of this actually solves your problems of course but it might help to cope with some of their effects and put you mentally in a spot where you can better reason about solutions.<p>Let me know if there is anything you want to talk about and all the best!')
