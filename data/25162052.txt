All Bluetooth audio streaming uses lossy compression.<p>- AirPlay has the capability of playing across a much larger distance and with a solid connection between devices than Bluetooth.<p>- When using AirPlay youâ€™re actually capable of controlling the volume of the Airplay speaker (not just the volume of the device which transfers to the Bluetooth device).<p>- Airplay can stream to multiple output devices. Bluetooth is one-to-one streaming.<p>- AirPlay caches multiple minutes of Audio (or Video). AFAIK Bluetooth does not cache.<p>A sibling comment talked about using a Sonos with Bluetooth, but having delay issues. There is no lag on AirPlay:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;HomePod&#x2F;comments&#x2F;gt4g40&#x2F;lag&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;HomePod&#x2F;comments&#x2F;gt4g40&#x2F;lag&#x2F;</a>')
