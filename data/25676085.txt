From hand-joystick, to motorcycle handles or a steering wheel with levers, turn-switches, pull-crank and pedal, a piano, fishing rod, etc. The controllers can be augmented to so many forms with just some cardboard and software. No need for specialized controllers like before.<p>Its ability to accommodate 2 players with a single control-set is also amazing.')
