Item(by='webmaven', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605637540, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25099697, text='<i>&gt; Not a chemist, but AFAIK current market available &#x27;biostarch polymers&#x27; (AFAIK always PLA; which may be marketed as made from corn, sugar cane, etc.) are actually extremely environmentally unfriendly because of the massive embodied energy required to create the industry-ready polymer from the bio-waste material. Their single benefit is nominal biodegradability.</i><p>Also not a chemist, but this is reminiscent of &quot;bamboo&quot; fabric that is just Rayon made from bamboo cellulose instead of wood pulp cellulose.<p>As such, it can be a bit more environmentally friendly to produce, and amenable to production in a closed-loop facility, but isn&#x27;t any more recyclable or biodegradable:<p>Eg. From &#x27;Abundance of microplastics in the world&#x27;s deep seas&#x27;[0]:<p><i>&quot;Rayon -- a humanmade non-plastic polymer used in personal hygiene products and clothing -- contributed to 56.9% of the total fibres seen, with polyester, polyamides, acetate and acrylic among the others recorded.&quot;</i><p>Which isn&#x27;t at all the same thing as fabrics made from actual bamboo fibers (often called &#x27;bamboo linen&#x27;).<p>The whole &#x27;greenwashing&#x27; thing is super annoying to me, because even when regulating agencies are doing their job properly, so much wiggle-room is left for what marketers are allowed to imply with entirely true statements.<p>eg. The label lists the fiber content as &#x27;bamboo rayon&#x27;, and the marketing says &quot;made from environmentally friendly and biodegradable bamboo!&quot;, Which glosses over that the process used to turn the bamboo INTO rayon may not have been environmentally friendly, or that while rayon is biodegradable, sort of, if it&#x27;s in a landfill it&#x27;s going to stick around a long time.<p>And then I try to imagine  consumer labelling requirements for all materials, sources, methods, and lifecycles, or summarizing these into a simple environmental score, and despair.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedaily.com&#x2F;releases&#x2F;2014&#x2F;12&#x2F;141216212253.htm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedaily.com&#x2F;releases&#x2F;2014&#x2F;12&#x2F;141216212253.h...</a>')
