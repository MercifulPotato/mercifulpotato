Does this mean if you go to a post office in another area you won&#x27;t be able to access your account? With the prevalence of online banking, do the already busy USPS offices really need to be a retail location for a bank?<p>Why can&#x27;t the USPS just offer these services themselves? Especially since the bill reimburses member banks for operating costs related to FedAccounts. Might as well cut out the middleman.')
