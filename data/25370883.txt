Item(by='mehrdadn', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607585408, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25370573, text='(Layman here, take everything with a truckload of salt.)<p>I&#x27;m actually <i>not</i> sure they&#x27;re &quot;very&quot; different risk profiles, though it isn&#x27;t unreasonable to assume that before you analyze the situation further. My reason is that contagiousness peaks around 2-3 days before symptoms appear, and the false negative rate for a test is <i>100%</i> just 4 days before symptoms appear. [1]<p>Now consider that tests themselves normally take around 3 days to come back. That means if you find out your test results just 1 day before symptoms appear, they&#x27;ll be based on your viral load from <i>three days prior</i>, where (as mentioned above) the test would&#x27;ve had a <i>~100% chance</i> of producing a false negative! (Things improve a little for a 2-day turnaround, not that much.) In other news, the only time you can really expect useful results is <i>on (or after) the day of symptoms</i>... at which point you would <i>already</i> be staying home.<p>I do see 2 places where this argument breaks down:<p>- For asymptomatic carriers. I don&#x27;t know what the rates are like, but asymptomatic people won&#x27;t know to stay home without a test, so tests would seem to have <i>some</i> value there for the purpose of making public gathering safer. However, intuitively, I wouldn&#x27;t expect it to be a game-changerâ€”I&#x27;d only expect it to stretch the runway a little bit (say, get you a few extra days&#x2F;weeks), but you&#x27;d still be back at square 1 having to shut things down afterward.<p>- For people who aren&#x27;t cautious and would go out to dine even amidst symptoms, but <i>wouldn&#x27;t</i> go if they test positive. Which seems ironic because you could say reckless behavior here would (in some sense) seem to create a positive feedback loop justifying more reckless behavior. That not only seems like a questionable way to justify public policy, but it also seems to suffer from the same problem as the last item: it&#x27;d only delay the inevitable by a few days&#x2F;weeks.<p>- For rapid tests (&lt; 1 day, preferably &lt; 1 hour). I don&#x27;t expect rapid tests will be available to the masses for everyday activities.<p>So, at least on my end, with traditional testing that takes 2-3 days to come back, it&#x27;s entirely plausible (and moreover, likely) to me that testing has low utility for these particular purposes. But I would love to hear an expert&#x27;s explanation that takes all these factors (and more) into account.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medical.mit.edu&#x2F;covid-19-updates&#x2F;2020&#x2F;07&#x2F;when-should-i-be-tested" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medical.mit.edu&#x2F;covid-19-updates&#x2F;2020&#x2F;07&#x2F;when-should...</a>')
