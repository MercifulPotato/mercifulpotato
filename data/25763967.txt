Item(by='tomxor', descendants=None, kids=[25765330], score=None, time=1610554434, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25763477, text='&gt; I know that in the past 15 years lots of tech-savvy people have opted for Apple products because &quot;they&#x27;re still UNIX under the hood, and unlike Linux they just work out of the box&quot;. But being Unix-like DOES NOT mean to be developer-friendly! Apple is still an opaque developer-unfriendly company even if it provides you with a native bash!<p>That was true over 10 years ago (was certainly a big factor for me), but i&#x27;m not so sure it is for most people anymore. I remember back when I bought macs (more than 11 years ago now) they used to proudly advertise their &quot;UNIX&quot; certification and tout the BSD&#x2F;Mach origins, I think this is when most of the original OS team was still there.<p>But today it seems to be one of the most neglected aspects of the system. Each time one of my colleagues with a mac tries to run one of my considerate bsd&#x2F;gnu friendly scripts I discover most of their userland has not actually been updated in 10 years. I end up getting them to install brew and replacing every binary used in the script... and yet bizarrely things like ZSH suddenly pop up as the new default shell.')
