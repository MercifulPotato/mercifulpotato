Also, since they offer no warranty for non original Apple hardware, it wouldn&#x27;t impact much their corporate users base, which often are forced to use the real thing.<p>One side effect of making their own line of CPUs, and a system that as for now, runs only on them, however, could also be seen as a way to kill the Hackintoshes &quot;competition&quot;, or it may be just a nice side effect for them. Time will tell.')
