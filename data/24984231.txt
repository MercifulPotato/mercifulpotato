Very minor bump in peak bw they would configure, I&#x27;m at 15M&#x2F;768k and that&#x27;s as high as it goes.  Network is garbage though and lots of time it&#x27;s saturated upstream.  $30K to run fiber to the DSLAM...if it was a fiber fed box I could probably get enough neighbors on board to swing it...but no.')
