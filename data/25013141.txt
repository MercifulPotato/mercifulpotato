I&#x27;m not good at marketing and find it difficult to adapt advice from articles I&#x27;ve read on that topic. Whenever I publish a new book, I put them up for free for a few days and I still get paid as both leanpub&#x2F;gumroad allows paying more than the price set.<p>I post about my books on reddit&#x2F;hn&#x2F;twitter and other social sites. Getting attention is hit&#x2F;miss, for example my recent book had good response on <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;perl&#x2F;comments&#x2F;jognf5&#x2F;i_wrote_a_cookbook_on_perl_oneliners&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;perl&#x2F;comments&#x2F;jognf5&#x2F;i_wrote_a_cook...</a> but not much here <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25006829" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25006829</a><p>I&#x27;m active on stackoverflow and reddit subs related to programming. I&#x27;ve had readers thanking me for the help and some have mentioned that they found out my books from my profile. And I learn a lot too from trying to answer questions.<p>Based on my experience, the biggest lesson I&#x27;d say is not giving up.')
