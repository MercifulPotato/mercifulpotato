The ones I had experience with in The Netherlands were also terrible. On a MacBook Air 2012, my &#x27;f&#x27; key would always get stuck. I went to our local Apple authorized service provider, which was also the store where I bought the MacBook Air.<p>First they tried to put the blame on me, arguing that I removed the keycap before (I didn&#x27;t). When they were finally willing to repair the laptop, they first gave me a lecture about how I should thank them for making an exception, because they were not obliged to repair the keyboard if I damaged the key by removing a keycap (which again, I didn&#x27;t).')
