But the reality is that most of the current major open source projects are all basically corporately sponsored. It&#x27;s not the Cathedral and the Bazaar, it&#x27;s the Cathedral and the anchor tenants at the local mall. And they&#x27;re all contributing funds to build the Christmas display and Take-pictures-with-Santa spot near the fountains. It&#x27;s open to the public, but the moment somebody starts busing in hundres of tourists they get upset.')
