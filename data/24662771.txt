Does that make privacy and climate concerns something reserved for &quot;people with privileged life&quot;? It seems quite clear to me that&#x27;s not the case. They are both a concern for everyone but some have more freedom to spend time caring about them. Lot of people are struggling with other more immediate issues, but that doesn&#x27;t reduce in any case the importance of privacy.')
