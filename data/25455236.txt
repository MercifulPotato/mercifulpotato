Item(by='amadeuspagel', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608210725, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25452310, text='&gt; “Search while writing” reminds me of an idea I’ve had passing fanciful interest in: a device that universally ingests all the content I’ve read, words I’ve typed or said, and topics I’ve heard.<p>You could build a limited version of this with a browser extension, but the greatest problem with it would be that note taking also helps prioritize, and for everything you&#x27;ve ever read to show up in ThinkType would distract from your own notes. You would have to have priorities, with automatically added notes having a lower priority then manually added notes.<p>But for now I&#x27;m going to focus on making it easier to save notes, maybe build a browser extension that makes it really easy to select text and save it as a note.<p>&gt; I think it’d be clearer if a quick summary sentence of ThinkType’s functionality came in a block before the inspiration-monologue part. Reading that while searching for the gist of ThinkType sapped at my curiosity a bit.<p>I&#x27;ll try think of something, but I find it hard to explain.<p>&gt; This helps assuage my concern that I might miss something when searching for it later, eg if I don’t choose the correct term to search for, or had a typo in the original note.<p>I thought about this problem, but I worry that having two spell corrections, one from the browser and one from ThinkType would be irritating.<p>&gt; If there was a separate desktop app where all this functionality was first class, I would use it, because then I could use CMD+Tab to switch to that app, while keeping my VSCode windows for my coding.<p>This reminds me a bit of emacs vs vim: With emacs (and roam and notion etc.) the idea is to have one instance of the program always open. But ThinkType loads so fast then you can use it like vim: Open it in a new tab whenever you want to write something down. And that has the advantage that it&#x27;s easy to work on several notes at the same time.')
