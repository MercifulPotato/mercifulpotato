Looks fascinating from the outside, but it gets really boring really quick.<p>Everything military is a good example. Who doesn&#x27;t like the idea of working on secret, state of the art technology? Truth is, the secret part mostly gets in the way, because of the &quot;right to know&quot;, you don&#x27;t really know what you are working on, and you may not even have internet access on your computer.
