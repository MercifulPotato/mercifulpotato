Parasitic practices such as lending money with interest and shorting are the basis of the modern economic system. Practices that we&#x27;ve known for literally over 1400 years to be bad, yet we continue to engage in them, then cry when things go south.<p>If we want a proper economic system, we should have proper fundamentals. Ban shorting, ban interest, ban packaging debt and selling it in packages, etc. encourage proper investments (not casino gamblings) and things will improve drastically.')
