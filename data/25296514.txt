Item(by='millstone', descendants=None, kids=[25298132], score=None, time=1607036170, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25294912, text='&gt; if a future is inert, how can it ever detect that it is ready to make progress and call wake<p>This is the crux, and I wish the discussion started by posing and answering this question.<p>Futures are NOT inert. This is referenced only obliquely:<p><i>When a future is not ready yet, poll returns Poll::Pending and stores a clone of the Waker copied from the current Context. This Waker is then woken once the future can make progress</i><p>The passive voice &quot;the waker is woken&quot; obscures the fact that the Future <i>itself</i> is responsible for arranging the call to wake(). This means that the Future maintains some sort of dual active presence: it owns a thread, or a timer, or adds a file descriptor to an fd set, etc.<p>An example from futures::io::AsyncRead::poll:<p><i>If no data is available for reading, the method returns Poll::Pending and arranges for the current task to receive a notification when the object becomes readable or is closed.</i><p>So `poll()` is a misleading name: it is not a passive check but a hook for the Future to materialize its dual, active half.')
