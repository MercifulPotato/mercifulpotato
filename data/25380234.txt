The problem seems to be that instead of the &quot;serverless panacea&quot; they were promised, the code they built can now only run on one of many Google servers, none of which are theirs. No way to kick the tires at all.<p>It honestly reminds me of debugging a Jenkins pipeline. Something that was designed to be super generic of a runtime but yet the tooling can inexplicably only live on computers that are not your local development machine, and all of it is maximally painful to stub or test or debug to seduce you into &quot;just running it live&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s like the opposite of the &quot;small agile team&quot; thing they were talking about. If your program requires 7 API keys and some cloud environment to do a test run, I want no part of it.')
