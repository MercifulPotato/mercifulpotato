Free of charge <i>no charger, wink wink chuckle</i>.<p>&gt; However, even without a fan, there is no tradeoff with performance.<p>There most certainly is a trade off with performance. The Macbook Air throttles after around 10m of extensive work as far as I know. The marketing claims no such thing, either. It just claims that the Macbook Air is thin and fan-less.<p>&gt; real problem is that most people hate the sound of their laptop’s fan cranking away while they are trying to get work done<p>This is a bit of a generous interpretation. Instead, I&#x27;d argue that Apple thought how they can differentiate, and came up with the idea of reducing fan noise, which can be considered a &quot;cool feature&quot;. The fact that their faulty keyboards on the previous 3 (?) generations of Macbooks were insanely loud and obnoxious somehow didn&#x27;t matter in their quest for silence.<p>The article strikes me as looking too deep into something it idolizes. Yes, Apple is great at marketing. Can you get away with the same writing if you&#x27;re a small or a medium-sized company? Depends on who&#x27;s your target audience (and I&#x27;m sure it also depends on your brand).<p>Funnily enough, the article doesn&#x27;t mention target audience. It doesn&#x27;t mention why certain tactics work (or when would they not work). It takes Apple&#x27;s claims at face value, without deeper thought.<p>I think a fellow commenter summary of &quot;sell benefits, not features&quot; is fair to the article, as the article doesn&#x27;t offer that much more.')
