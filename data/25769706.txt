It&#x27;s exactly &quot;notify&quot;<p>-&gt; click on the node \n-&gt; node is now ready to move\n-&gt; function executes desirable effects to all DOM tree based on the movement<p>- It&#x27;s not framework. You can implement this solution regardless of what you are using. Even async rendering. It doesn&#x27;t matter how you start rendering. From above to root or otherwise.<p>- This is the only solution, taking into consideration the above pontins, that executes &quot;stream of write requests&quot; to the browser. It doesn&#x27;t write&#x2F;read then do it again. No lagging. All manipulation runs smoothly 60fps.<p>- Every change in DOM is registered and updated in the DOM store and exposed. So you can implement (any DOM manipulation) whenever you need in your app.')
