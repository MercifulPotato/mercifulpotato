At its core, algorithms can merely be something defined deterministically, and programmed by hand by a human being.<p>By the way, the system I described isn&#x27;t something in actual use by machines (I hope). It&#x27;s just the thought pattern of biased people in my country, a sort of mental short cut used to determine what level of service you get.')
