It would mean a catastrophic interruption to the customers application exactly when its the most popular&#x2F;active. And theres no practical way to determine whether the customer is “trying it out” or running a key part of their business on any particular resource.<p>Well, this is true, but this is also true of a lot of limits, like limits.conf. Sometimes you really want to spawn loads of processes or open many files, but a lot of the time you don&#x27;t, so a barrier to limit the damage makes sense.<p>There is no one solution that will fit everyone: people should be able to choose: &quot;scale to the max&quot;, &quot;spend at most $100&quot;, etc. If my average bill is $100, then a limit of $500 would probably make sense, just as a proverbial seat belt. This should never be reached and prevents things going out of control (which is also the reason for limits.conf).')
