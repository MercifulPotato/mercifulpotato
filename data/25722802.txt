That&#x27;s from twitter&#x2F;reddit not banning more and earlier, to the FBI and law enforcement failing to investigate, to individual police opening doors or declining to stop criminals literally entering the buildings.<p>Everyone thought &quot;the next time I&#x27;ll do something, someone else will catch this in some other office&quot;.<p>I get why, its political and touches on censorship and people rightly hesitate to use power (not the law enforcement side, that&#x27;s their job). Plus you&#x27;re making money from ads next to pages of QAnon or Stopthesteal or whatever other BS is there.<p>But that&#x27;s just my opinion. As you say, we should have a real investigation with witnesses and experts and actual factz. Congresd is the right place for that to happen imho<p>I hope something actually comes of this. It would be shameful for it to be buried because its hard and no one wants to be less able to mobalise <i>their</i>side...')
