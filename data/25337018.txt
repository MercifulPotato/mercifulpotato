So just to be clear, it fully completes the installation and boots normally the first time, but fails to boot after I install the first Windows Update. I have successfully run Windows 10 on this particular device in the past, which is weird. I only reinstalled it to use a larger SSD.<p>Some Googling suggests it might be a USB device issue. I also have a weird issue where out of nowhere my onboard Realtek Ethernet stopped working in Windows (though works fine in Linux), so I&#x27;ve been using a USB 3.0 Ethernet dongle.<p>Something&#x27;s rotten with my machine. But I&#x27;m not exactly sure what. I&#x27;d likely use it more for work related tasks, but it&#x27;s so frustrating dealing with this crap that just plug my MacBook into my monitor and call it a day.')
