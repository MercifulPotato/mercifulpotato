For example I don&#x27;t want to fight carbon dioxide.\nI rather want our technology to not disturb the global biological&#x2F;chemical balance much more. So I support better adopted technology.<p>And fighting pollution, well, I actually have to restrain myself not to physically attack people who I witness dropping plastic garbage into nature. \nBut the pollution which is already there, I can only clean up.<p>So fighting polluters, yes. But fighting pollution sounds like a oxymoron to me, because fighting in itself is mostly dirty and damaging by its definition. War just leaves a mess. So I don&#x27;t think the martial language really helps the cause.')
