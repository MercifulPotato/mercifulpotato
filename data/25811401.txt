Item(by='tomjen3', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610897149, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25810929, text='&gt;I challenge anyone to find the difference between believing in a pedo ring in a pizza store vs the day of judgement and the layers of hell, angels, demons, resurrection, etc.<p>Pizza stores exists. Some owners&#x2F;operators of them engage in crimes. Pedophiles exists. Given the number of both it wouldn&#x27;t be plausible for there not to be a pizza store owner&#x2F;operator who is also a pedophile.<p>Pedophile networks for (some of the) rich and powerful exists and they have to source their victims somewhere and abduct them. While it wouldn&#x27;t have to be a pizza joint that is used for cover (a laundromat or some other small business would work just as well) there isn&#x27;t a good reason to not use a pizza joint.<p>There is no evidence at all of hell, angles, demons and there is no way you can have ghosts haunting places where they were abused or treated unfairly and not have any at Auschwitz, yet nobody has ever taken a picture of any there.')
