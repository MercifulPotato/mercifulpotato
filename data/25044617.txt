Item(by='lifthrasiir', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605006146, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25043731, text='&gt; The downside with not using the merge button is that the message in the PR says “closed by [hash]” instead of “merged in…” which causes confusion to a fair amount of users who don’t realize it means that it actually means the same thing! I consider this is a (long-standing) GitHub UX flaw.<p>This is so true, if the automatic detection of the PR merger vs. closure is hard (and I can see some reasons why) there should at least be a switch for maintainers to update the outcome message.')
