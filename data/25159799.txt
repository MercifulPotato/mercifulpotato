Lets say I actually were to buy 100 x 10TB drives. I know that I can span a ceph cluster across those drives (e.g. CERN has created some 30PB cluster in the past). Can I use 100 drives in a RAID-Z?<p>I&#x27;m asking because the main advantage I can see for a zettabyte file system (ZFS) is at larger scale, thus I&#x27;m interested in how to actually use it e.g. for a server setup of a company that needs to save data on many disks.')
