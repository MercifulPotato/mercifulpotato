This kind of &#x27;Christmas tree&#x27; bill, where all kinds of personal favourite measures are added to some kind of must-pass legislation, is common.<p>Having briefly interned in both Parliament and Congress, I&#x27;m not entirely sure which is the better&#x2F;worse system. Parliament certainly wouldn&#x27;t allow this - but then, if the government wants giveaway bills its basically got the power to put them through Parliament with little-to-no oversight. Where Congress has independence, it also has this kind of legislative log-rolling and low-level corruption. I prefer the UK system, but it&#x27;s not clear-cut.')
