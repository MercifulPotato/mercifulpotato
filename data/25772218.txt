In this case, Clark county used a machine to sort mail-in ballots and to do a first pass validation of signatures. For 453,248 ballots. For reasons, including that the signature exemplars from the DMV were less than 200DPI, 70% of the ballots were viewed as sketchy, while 30% were found machine-okey-dokey and passed on without further review. The complaint wants those 130,000 votes invalidated.<p>The interesting thing is that the 70% that required manual review, 1-1.5% were initially rejected due to signature mismatch. Most were &quot;cured&quot; by voters (presumably by officials actually contacting the voters), leaving 0.3% to be completely rejected. The court notes that Washoe county (not using the magic machine) had a pre-cure reject rate of 1.53%. [So, if I have my sums right, the complaint wants 130,000 (30% of mail-in votes) plus some unknown number (greater than 1%) of the remainder invalidated, full stop, because between 1,400 and 6,900 were invalid. Or something.]<p>The complaint also includes Nevada&#x27;s electronic voting machines (&quot;not less than 1000 illegal and improper votes&quot; counted and &quot;not less than 1000 legal and proper votes&quot; not counted). And no less than 15,000 illegal and improper mail-in votes from out-of-state. And the USPS, which was &quot;directed&quot; to deliver mail-in ballots where the addressee was deceased, moved, or had no known affiliation with the address. No less than 500 votes from dead people. There are also allegations of fraud in vote counting and observation. (It&#x27;s a laundry list.)<p>According to the court, the Agilis sorting machines were determined to be ok in a previous case, Klaus v. Cegavske (which I have yet to look up).<p>As far as evidence, the court ordered the contestants to disclose all witnesses and evidence they intended to use by 5:00 pm Nov. 25. The contestants did not issue their first deposition notices until Nov. 27. Therefore the contestants&#x27; evidence consists of non-deposition witness declarations, with no cross-examination.  The court considered these hearsay.<p>Michael Baselice offered expert evidence on the incidence of  illegal voting based on a phone survey. He was unable to identify the source of his data and conducted no quality control. Similar questions faced Jesse Kamzol&#x27;s analysis of various databases of voters. Scott Gessler&#x27;s report lacked citations of facts and evidence and did not include any exhibits in support of his conclusions; his conclusions are based on a handful of affidavits. The complainants&#x27; experts were found to be of little or no value, but were not excluded from consideration, although given little weight.<p>The defendants provided a stack of testimony that court judged credible (including Dr. Michael Herron and the president of the company manufacturing Agilis).<p>Based on Herron&#x27;s testimony, the court finds no evidence of a higher rate of voter fraud associated with mail-in voting. He also found that an illegal vote rate of 0.00054 percent between 2012 and prior to the 2020 general election. Herron testified that the contestant&#x27;s implied double voting rate was 89 times larger than a conservative academic estimate. He finally testified that the contestants provided no persuasive evidence that fraudulent votes affected the presidential margin of 33,596 votes. (Gessler also testified that he had no personal knowledge of any voter fraud.)<p>The court found that the record does not support allegations of problems with provisional ballots.<p>The court found that the Agilis machine did not accept any signatures that should have been rejected and that the record did not support a finding that ballots with improper signatures were counted.<p>And on, and on. The court finds that the record does not support the allegations of the complainants, hearsay declarations included, under &quot;any standards of evidence&quot;. The contestants failed to meet their burden and the case was dismissed.<p>I&#x27;m going to bed.')
