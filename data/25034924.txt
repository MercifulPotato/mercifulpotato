I strive to first form a reasonable conceptual model of my approach before implementing it in code.<p>This was probably the key takeaway for me. Too often, specially when I&#x27;m solving hackerrank&#x2F;leetcode challenges, I jump straight into the code without bothering to think about the problem first, at least for a moment.<p>Now I keep a physical notepad to write and&#x2F;or draw at least basic models of whatever non-obvious problem or issue I&#x27;m given. I&#x27;ve noted that it&#x27;s helped me quite a bit, at least to give me a general idea of what I should do.')
