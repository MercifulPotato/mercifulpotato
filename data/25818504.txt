You still get it mildly and can spread it once vaccinated. People outside at-risk groups who aren’t vaccinated yet can die. We don’t know how long the vaccine is good for—maybe we have to get it once a year like the flu, who knows? I’m a gambler and I’d bet we’ll be wearing masks for years, and possibly forever, depending on how the thing mutates and behaves.<p>My parents think they are gonna get jabbed then it’s off to happy hour, and that just seems incredibly simplistic.')
