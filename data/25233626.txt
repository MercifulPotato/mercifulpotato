Other symptoms include paranoia, distrust, high levels of stress, and outbursts of violence.<p>Without giving away the &quot;whodunit&quot;, it suffices to say that the villain takes advantage of the symptoms to accomplish the villain&#x27;s goals.<p>---------<p>A virus that affects the brain, and causes a predictable change of behavior makes for a most interesting &quot;murder weapon&quot;. With some careful planning, the villain is able to have some cause-and-effect, the paranoia &#x2F; violent outbursts of the villain&#x27;s victims was used to make the villain&#x27;s conspiracy deeper and more mysterious.<p>Its not like the villain can read minds: but knowing that a victim will slowly grow more paranoid and violent as time goes on is sufficient for the masterminded plan to be carried out.<p>As such, it was insufficient to solve &quot;the murder&quot; of the story. To find the mastermind, you had to understand the meta-weapon. Yes, X killed Y in the local landfill, but X wasn&#x27;t the mastermind... just another victim to the paranoia that the mastermind infected upon X.<p>----------<p>An unusual crime weapon is most needed for a mystery. By making something unusual, it provides a dramatic promise to the reader that the story is worth following.')
