My family, my parents, my friends, my colleagues, my 91 year old grandmother, my potential clients, my actual clients, the support line for the webshop I order from, the support line for my supermarket, etc... <i>Everyone</i>.<p>I can&#x27;t speak for other countries, but in the Netherlands WhatsApp is undeniably a part of your social infrastructure.<p>It doesn&#x27;t matter if any of those other IMs have feature parity, better security or stricter privacy. There&#x27;s just no one to message.')
