I thought that doing what github did would be enough, but now I&#x27;m not so sure because of one thing and some comments I saw here that might be related to that.<p>I would still like to improve any application I might create depending on how it&#x27;s being used (to know what features to improve, which ones could potentially be removed or changed, etcetera). Keeping logs of this kind of usage would still go against the GDPR? I thought that it wouldn&#x27;t as long as it was aggregated data without using any of the users&#x27; personal information. But some comments here have led me to believe that it would go against the GDPR regardless because it would still mean separating unique users.<p>Hoping someone more familiar with the law sees this comment. I mean, I can think of multiple ways to aggregate that data, even with unique users, without using personally identifying information, but I&#x27;m not sure anymore if that&#x27;s enough.')
