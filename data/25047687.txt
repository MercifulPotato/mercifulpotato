I have pretty good specs and decided to try to switch my PC over to Linux. At the time all I really wanted to play game-wise was Civ 6. It had a linux port so I&#x27;d imagine it would be fine. Dear God was I wrong. I tries it on Ubuntu and it was the only &quot;officially supported&quot; distro. The game was flat out unplayable, FPS drops to the point where I was watching a slide show, UI animations lagged, and attempting to start a multiplayer lobby froze the game at a blank screen, my graphics card showed up as &quot;Unknown Device&quot; despite being dected fine by the Nvidia drivers. I tried for months to figure out was going on. I made sure my graphics drivers were straight, updated firmware, even upgraded to a much more recent kernel and tried different Ubuntu versions. Nothing would work and no one was able to help me out at all. The best lead I found was some very old comments about how the Linux port had atrocious CPU optimization and had basically no multicore support.<p>Anyway maybe close to a year later, I tried again with Fedora, it ran a bit better, which I imagine to be the work of better updated kernel + system packages, but I had to keep it on the lowest graphics settings to make it barely playable. And this was on a system with a decent mid teir graphics card at the time, more memory than I&#x27;ve ever needed and a Ryzen 9. On top of that there were quite a few updates that completely broke cross platform play and apparently modifying version string resources could hack around that at the risk of desyncs.<p>To this day most people ive met that play Civ 6 on Linux swear to me that it runs perfect, so I have no idea what was going on. I&#x27;ve also been told running it via Proton might actually run better but I haven&#x27;t tried.')
