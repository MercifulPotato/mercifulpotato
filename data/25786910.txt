Every Stacks 1.0 transaction was a Bitcoin transaction.<p>The lessons we learned from that deployment for 2+ years is that (a) it doesn&#x27;t scale that well and (b) it&#x27;s very hard to modify Bitcoin and get new changes accepted (for good reason), so you end up with very limited scripting.<p>To fix the two limitations of Stacks 1.0, we worked on Stacks 2.0 which has a separate blockchain (so scalability independent of Bitcoin) where settlements still happen on Bitcoin and, more importantly, a full smart contract language without modifying Bitcoin itself: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;clarity-lang.org" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;clarity-lang.org</a>')
