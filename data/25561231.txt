A stronger hand might be needed.<p>We need to impress upon corporations to look at the long term condequences and any executive looking to keep living the good life to prioritize environmental&#x2F;social matters with a high level of awareness and scrutiny before any machinations relating to increasing topline growth (figuring things like this out is why C-Suite execs get paid more than the presidents of most states)<p>To that we need a harsh route and I reckon the need for high profits will apply enough pressure for proper investment in R&amp;D and allows new entrants to get a piece of the pie. Raising the bar will never stop progress -if it did we&#x27;d still be boarding some suspect aeroplanes amd driving ridiculous death traps we might call cars.')
