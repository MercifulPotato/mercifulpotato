Yesterday I was doing some keyword planning and got a negative (-) cpc and cost.  I looked everywhere to try to determine what that meant and didn&#x27;t find anything.<p>They have online chat support, so I tried that.  I got routed to a sales rep who called me on the phone and who, after taking all my information while basically ignoring my question, finally heard me.  She didn&#x27;t know the answer.<p>She sent me a support link which was the same one that routed me to her.  I told her this and all she could say was she was sorry and she couldn&#x27;t help unless I was ready to launch a campaign.<p>I honestly don&#x27;t think she knew anything.  I&#x27;m suspicious that these are indy workers getting routed prospects by Google.  I don&#x27;t know.  The whole thing was sleazy.<p>Years ago when I managed to get someone on the line she stayed with me until my problem was solved.  And this wasn&#x27;t even a problem (or maybe it was?  wouldn&#x27;t be the first bug I found on their site).  I was just asking a question.')
