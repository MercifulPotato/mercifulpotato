If you want to transfer wirelessly from the device to your laptop&#x2F;PC&#x2F;etc you need to register with Onyx&#x27;s portal and sync from there, thus it&#x27;s a more cumbersome to use. Normally I just email the document to myself because unlike Remarkable&#x27;s devices it has Android OS and normal browser being installed.<p>[1]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=EdQ5sXTJRMI" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=EdQ5sXTJRMI</a>')
