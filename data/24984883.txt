I have never been disappointed.<p>The last printer I purchased was a Brother.  Some people criticize them for the quality, but they seem to be fine for home and small office use.  They don&#x27;t play games with toner and are reasonably compatible with whatever you throw them on to.<p>Yet you do have to be careful when choosing lasers.  Some vendors seem to use the same approach as inkjet printers when it comes to supplies, and it affects both consumer and corporate models.  I also recall doing a fair bit of research on Brother printers to ensure I ended up with a good (but inexpensive) model.  That being said, at least there are options.<p>EDIT: negation in the wrong place.')
