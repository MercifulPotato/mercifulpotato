They also forgo Lt&#x2F;Rt for DL&#x2F;DR. Maybe I&#x27;m too video centric, and these make more sense to an audio centric person???<p>[0]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;trac.ffmpeg.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;AudioChannelManipulation#Listchannelnamesandstandardchannellayouts" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;trac.ffmpeg.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;AudioChannelManipulation#Listch...</a>')
