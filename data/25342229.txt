I update this reference page as I come up with better visualizations and explanations. The last major update was in 2018 when I rewrote it from using d3.js to using vue.js. It greatly reduced the amount of code I was writing, and also let me make the page more interactive. I then added lots more (doubled coordinates, links to papers, axes legends, diagonal directions, side by side comparisons) and improved most of the existing sections. In 2019 the changes were minor, rewriting the map storage section and improving performance. In 2020 I improved the cube&#x2F;hex animation, the pixel-to-hex section, and added Rust sample code. There&#x27;s lots more I could add to the page[1] but I don&#x27;t have any specific plans for when I&#x27;ll get around to it.<p>The page is svg- and js-heavy. I prerender the diagrams on the server (try loading it without js!). Then using IntersectionObserver on each section of the page, I swap the static diagrams and text with interactive versions. This improves load times somewhat, because almost no JS has to run on page load.<p>For printability I process the page with xsltproc, extract all the links, and turn them into footnotes. Try print preview on the page to see these. Unfortunately the diagrams are broken when printing in Chrome (it works in Firefox) so I need to investigate.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.notion.so&#x2F;redblobgames&#x2F;f8bc2f44fba94607afa9c06711d23245?v=0766432cb1534ce582ce35b33cbbef7e&amp;p=7d2d4d624bc5483dafbe615d75ab3902" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.notion.so&#x2F;redblobgames&#x2F;f8bc2f44fba94607afa9c0671...</a>')
