If this was the main mechanism we&#x27;d use more effective immunosuppressants. As is, stronger immunosuppressants show worse survival rates. You want to keep some immune system activity to not get a secondary infection and fight the virus.<p>Corticosteroids also kickstart healing process (not really in COVID) and regrowth - you also race against tissue destruction. Most importantly they barely reduce scar formation. And they actually improve breathing via action on alveoli as well as reduce swelling.<p>The specific two to use are hydrocortisone and dexamethasone based on studies thus far, in critical patients - ones put on respirators. (Prednisolone could also work.)')
