My post was a reference to enjoyability more than functionality.<p>I have definitely read novels that were long, yet rote and simplistic even in their native language.  =)<p>But they were not works worth reading in any language IMO. They could probably be satisfactorily machine translated (with some human editing) but the result would not be enjoyable except for ultra diehards of the genre who are simply happy to be reading a work from that particular genre, quality of prose be damned.<p>Those enjoyable xianxia&#x2F;xuanhuan you mention were either rote and boring in the first place, or they were wonderfully written and had the life crushed out of them by a machine translation that dispensed with all nuance.')
