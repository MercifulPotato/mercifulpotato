So you can argue all you want about the ethics &amp; morality of the ~100 deaths&#x2F;year or so from automated car crashes. But that&#x27;s far preferable to the current situation.<p>Why do people (in particular people without robotics experience) keep assuming this will happen any time soon without any evidence whatsoever? &quot;We must move over to self driving cars as soon as they are safer&quot; is fair but it&#x27;s almost tautological.<p>The only numbers we have so far show that <i>despite</i> only testing in near ideal conditions (e.g. Waymo choosing to test in suburban Arizona rather than Manhattan or rural snowy Midwestern areas), the accident rate for autonomous vehicles is actually <i>significantly</i> higher, <i>not even</i> counting &quot;interventions&quot; which every company measures in its own inscrutable way.')
