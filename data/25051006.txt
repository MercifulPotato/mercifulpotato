Microsoft has had an ARM version of Windows for years. I would have thought they would have lept to support Bootcamp on these new Macs.<p>Why and for who though? Yes, there is an ARM version of windows, but there is pretty much no software for it - and most of the Windows ARM software (Office?) likely has already iOS versions and will have upcoming Mac ARM versions.<p>I have the feeling that 99%+ of Bootcamp users use it for x86 software.')
