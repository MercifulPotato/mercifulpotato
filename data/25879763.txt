MicroPython is written in C, so whenever you&#x27;re using modules implemented natively then you&#x27;re only paying for a small boundary crossing.<p>For example, all of the machine API is typically <i>very fast</i>. I&#x27;d be surprised if you&#x27;d notice a significant improvement sending SPI buffers directly from C. But it&#x27;s way more convenient from MicroPython - especially considering you can do it live at a REPL.<p>If you&#x27;re spending a lot of time processing in MicroPython then yes, you&#x27;ll notice a perf hit. But, if that&#x27;s the case, carve out the perf-sensitive code and create a C module in MicroPython; it&#x27;s straightforward.<p>It&#x27;s akin to the way that CPython is considered slow but by using libraries like numpy or pandas the real-world performance is decent.')
