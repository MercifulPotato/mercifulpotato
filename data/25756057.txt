Item(by='LukeShu', descendants=None, kids=[25756386], score=None, time=1610496957, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25755694, text='The &quot;obvious&quot; answer for me is EXWM; since I&#x27;m an Emacs user anyway.  The things keeping me from EXWM (besides just finding time to make the switch) are that:<p>1) I&#x27;m concerned about Emacs being single-threaded; on the boxes that I use Wanderlust (an Emacs mail client) on on large folders (such as the git devel mailing list, which receives thousands of emails every month), Emacs can stall for 10s of seconds.  Packing on even more of the system to that single-threaded event loop worries me (especially if I can&#x27;t even switch to another program during that stall).<p>2) I&#x27;d like to try Wayland at some point, so it seems like if I&#x27;m going to go through the trouble of switching, it should be something that is future-compatible.')
