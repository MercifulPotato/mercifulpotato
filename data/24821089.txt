It is because <i>everyone</i>, especially ignorant people think they know what&#x27;s wrong, and they are never mistaken (just read &#x2F;r&#x2F;talesfromtechsupport).<p>If you want to get past this, make sure to write in a way that&#x27;s uncommon from ignorant people. Include what you have tried, what makes your case special, write with good spelling and formatting, use the technical terminology right to show you are experienced etc.')
