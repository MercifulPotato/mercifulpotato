It&#x27;s that it doesn&#x27;t make sense to do so and then blame the restaurant for the burger not being as fresh as it would be if you got it in-person.<p>Also note that I&#x27;m not claiming that this is simply due to people being dumb. It&#x27;s just my experience that, in the absence of an explanation for why someone does something &quot;obviously&quot; dumb, it makes more sense to accept that they&#x27;re dumb than it does to be &quot;perplexed&quot;. There&#x27;s a cultural barrier against communicating openly about differences in intelligence, and it can lead to blindspots if you rely on it too much tk explain people&#x27;s behavior. But it&#x27;s my observation that the pendulum has swung so far to one side that many people don&#x27;t even like to consider that others may be reasoning poorly.')
