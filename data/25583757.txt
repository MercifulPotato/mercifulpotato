Drivers tend to assume that their intent to stop or not to stop is obvious and don&#x27;t bother with a clear signal like flashing their lights or waving visibly.<p>From the pedestrian&#x27;s perspective, it can be hard to see the driver at all (small movements of the hand can be invisible in sun glare; direction of gaze likewise), and also hard to tell what they&#x27;re doing. Just because they&#x27;re slowing somewhat as they approach doesn&#x27;t mean they see you or intend to stop.')
