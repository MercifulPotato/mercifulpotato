Item(by='bumby', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612138723, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25983876, text='&gt;<i>I think it&#x27;s borderline offensive to assume that the &quot;vast majority of women&quot; won&#x27;t become &quot;skillful enough&quot;</i><p>I think there’s some miscommunication here. The qualifier is that most wouldn’t become skilled enough to overcome the strength disadvantage. To be fair, the same would apply to men with the same strength disadvantage although that would be less likely due to the lower likelihood for the same strength disparity. Most people won’t spend enough time developing that skill. If I had to speak in broad terms, it would probably take a purple belt (maybe a strong blue belt) to overcome a large strength disadvantage with even a moderate amount of athletic ability.  Most people won’t put in that time, irrespective of gender. If you disagree, join an mma&#x2F;boxing gym (that actually spars) and see what percentage of people stick with it for 4-5 years. I would venture a guess that most people who flippantly advocate BJJ as a solution probably haven’t been in a real physical altercation and don’t know how it would go down. And no, sparring&#x2F;rolling in the gym doesn’t generally equate to this type of altercation. I never claimed its not effective because it can’t handle every situation (because nothing can).  BJJ is not worthless, it’s just pragmatically a low percentage solution.<p>I’m not quite sure why you’re taking so much as borderline&#x2F;highly offensive but it rarely leads to providing clarity in discourse. Again, there is real danger with instilling false confidence (I.e. when confidence outstrips one’s abilities) whether you are offended or not. I’m not interested in placating someone at the expense of putting them at higher risk.')
