The article is focusing on surgery to reduce pain. Pain can&#x27;t be measured externally, it&#x27;s subjective.<p>Most surgery is not like that, it involves some objective condition. Such as before you had an appendix, now you don&#x27;t. Before your bone was broken in the wrong shape, now it&#x27;s the right shape.')
