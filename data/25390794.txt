If anything I&#x27;d expect the effect to be negative, especially with polarizing people like Pompeo or Pelosi. (You&#x27;ll never convince me that a significant portion of mask-wearing in &quot;blue&quot; states isn&#x27;t due to Trump&#x27;s famous opposition to masks.) Many of those who wear masks do so because we are aware of the respiratory pandemic underway, and not pathologically selfish.<p>Certain sports stars or perhaps &quot;country&quot; musicians could have a one-time effect on mask rates if they really went hard, but each time we fire one of these bullets it&#x27;s used up. If &quot;Florida Georgia Line&quot; go all-in on masks, they won&#x27;t be cool enough to tell us about vaccines.')
