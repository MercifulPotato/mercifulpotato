We still (in my opinion, unfortunately) have a legal system that is way to heavy on &quot;word of the law&quot; vs &quot;intent of the law&quot;.<p>We saw some of this a couple weeks ago. True intent is hard to prove through words, and context is super important.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, I seriously doubt that someone on reddit who made an market-manipulation-incriminating statement and made a couple hundred bucks will face punishment. I suspect that when all of this is looked at at the end, the &quot;gains&quot; will be rather bi&#x2F;tri-modal. A ton of people losing money, a bunch making a little bit (relatively), and then a small handful who make absolute bank. The group on the right are the ones who will have to be careful&#x2F;worried.')
