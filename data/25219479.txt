You will need a keyboard anyway, and by the time you&#x27;ve added that you may as well just get a MacBook Air and use the device emulation in Xcode instead of trying to run natively<p>Because then I wouldn&#x27;t need to own a laptop. I prefer work on a desktop most of the time, and I already own an iPad Pro. It seems silly that I need to own a third device for what basically amounts to company policy. And the advantage the iPad has is that the keyboard is detachable. When I&#x27;m just browsing the internet or watching Netflix I can remove it and hold the device in my handsâ€”something I can&#x27;t do with a laptop.<p>&gt; Sideloading will never happen - not because of money, but because it makes no sense to destroy the security model for 95% of users just because 5% of users want to run as root, or some nearly-but-not-quite approximation.<p>There&#x27;s no reason it couldn&#x27;t be buried in settings and approved on a per-developer basis. This is how it already works for enterprise apps: you install the app via a browser, but then you have to go to Settings to confirm you trust the distribution certificate used. The only change required would be to allow any developer cert rather than just those belonging to the enterprise programme. This is essentially exactly how notarised apps work on the Mac.')
