Maybe you don’t like the thought of your code being used in weapons; that’s perfectly reasonable. Maybe you want to rid the world of such weapons; also reasonable. My advice would be that open source is not the right model in those circumstances, and that to really solve the problem you’ll have to be politically engaged.<p>Littering code with booby traps and publishing it is an absolutely <i>awful</i> idea, one that should not be acceptable to us as a professional community.')
