This applies both to a traditional programme, and to deep learning. Programmes are after all written to satisfy human needs, even if it is an obfuscated C contest.<p>For instance, imagine you have a black box that observes the horse races, Twitbook, the betting market and so on, and based on those observations executes bets for you with a bookmaker. The execution of the orders has a measurable effect on your net worth.<p>You might write a traditional programme which takes all of this data, and based on some ETL, statistical models and probability calculations, executes orders.<p>You might do some ETL, plug it all into a neural network, tune it and execute orders based on the results.<p>Your traditional programme is very complex, and combinations of small bugs may have large effects on the results. Your unit and integration tests may themselves be wrong. Formal testing possibly reduces the expected value of the system and is an arse to carry out for any large system. The expected value of the system itself becomes harder to reason about as the system grows, based on the operation of reading and understanding the code.<p>The internals of your neural network are also difficult to reason about in some ways. It is difficult to understand the workings of your neural network and specific parts&#x27; effects on the measured effects of its output. It will take time to tune it and build the most profitable model.<p>Both implementations of the black box may be backtested, and some sort of trust can be established over the expected value of each implementation. Both implementations allow the operations of running, and measuring the results of running. Both implementations are difficult to reason about in various ways.<p>We are perfectly happy to give money to people for them to do things without fully understanding their inner thoughts and the processes behind those thoughts.<p>Which is the golden duck?')
