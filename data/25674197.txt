Assuming you&#x27;re interested in the former, you can advance the simulation in discrete time-steps using approaches like the intelligent driver model mentioned in another thread. Chapter 4 of <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.cs.utexas.edu&#x2F;tech_reports&#x2F;reports&#x2F;tr&#x2F;TR-2157.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.cs.utexas.edu&#x2F;tech_reports&#x2F;reports&#x2F;tr&#x2F;TR-2157.p...</a> is a different approach to the discrete time system that tries to handle complications that come up when applying to OpenStreetMap, like having a vehicle cross multiple roads and intersections in a single 0.1 second timestep, due to really short roads. If you&#x27;re willing to throw away detailed movement (including acceleration and lane-changing), you can try a discrete-event approach, where you say &quot;this vehicle enters one end of a road at time t, don&#x27;t calculate anything for it until t + best_case_time_to_cross&quot;. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dabreegster.github.io&#x2F;abstreet&#x2F;trafficsim&#x2F;index.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dabreegster.github.io&#x2F;abstreet&#x2F;trafficsim&#x2F;index.html</a> has some ideas there.<p>2) Another option with much less detailed traffic simulation, but much more UI focus, is abstreet.org')
