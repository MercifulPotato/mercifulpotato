As a former professional pianist, I&#x27;d repeat what I feel like the limitation of such a program: it does teach you note reading, which is nice, but really basic piano technique is a necessary preamble. You mentioned that your boy spent a whole day on this; with a bit of guidance, a full beginner after a few hours should be able to play this very simple melody with one hand, and to add a couple of bass notes with the other, for a much more satisfying result (for the player and for the audience). I know it because I&#x27;ve done it with many children in the past.<p>So you should probably add something like some introduction material &#x2F; tutorial... maybe a couple of videos.')
