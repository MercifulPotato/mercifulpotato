I earn ~8x the salary my Mum ever earned, I earn more than anyone I know that I went to school with. I can support myself and my family. I started paying attention to my spending last year and realise around half of it was on stuff that I not only didnt need, but felt better without (tbh it was mostly takeaway food).<p>Buying a house was hard despite my &quot;high&quot; salary, thats ridiculous, but I don&#x27;t think the solution is to earn more. I would like to see more support for my mum who lost her job of 28 years due to COVID, I would like to see less homeless addicts on the street due to lack of support, I would like to see the people around me working as hard as they can barely able to pay rent to have more options.<p>Seeing what tech has made of the Bay Area and asking for more of that please is misguided imo.')
