I think it will address your concerns with a rational counterargument.<p>Basically, yes, you could, in theory, maybe, sort of, possibly, build a similar system without a public blockchain. But why? I&#x27;m sure there are people who can build houses with a few hand tools, but there&#x27;s a reason we have power tools and heavy machinery â€” they are more efficient and fit the job better. The same goes for blockchain in this case.<p>If you can point out where my logic is incoherent, please do, but to me the following: &quot;oh, just set up a distributed git repo or database with checksums and append-only permissions that you control but replicate to other servers not controlled by you so that you can&#x27;t tamper with the outputs and read from that global state and verify against the other mirrors of the database or repo every time you read from global state&quot; sounds like a stupider alternative to blockchain.<p>This is what blockchains were made for!!! Distributed consensus!')
