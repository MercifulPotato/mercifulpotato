Sci. degree at Concordia University isn&#x27;t actually &quot;listen[ing] to someone slowly recite a PowerPoint&quot;. Having attended a public University in Canada myself it certainly wasn&#x27;t my experience (and also not very expensive, &lt;10K a year). Of course, as with most things in life a lot of the benefit of an activity is what you make of it, not just what is on offer to the passive consumer.<p>Upon completing the article my main takeaway was that the author would have been a lot better off just toughing it out at Concordia in the first place. If you are the sort of person that tries something once for a few hours and then just backs away from it entirely they way this person did.. it&#x27;s really something!')
