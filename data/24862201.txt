That&#x27;s the entire reason for the multi-level cache hierarchy to exist in the first place.<p>Graviton2 doesn&#x27;t even have a particularly large total amount of cache, the only part of the cache system that&#x27;s bigger than both AMD and Intel is the L1D. L1I is the same as AMD, L2 is same as Intel, L3 is smaller than both (talking about current-gen server chips). That L1D can indeed make a big difference in certain workloads though.<p>The L3 is actually pretty small for how many cores there are, ARM recommends 1-2MB&#x2F;core for the N1 cores in the Graviton2 and it has 512KB&#x2F;core. AMD has 4MB per core in Zen2 albeit with a slightly weird setup where the L3 is localized to 4 core clusters.')
