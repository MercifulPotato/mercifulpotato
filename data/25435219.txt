For example, one might believe the story &quot;this smoke is getting me through the day, although it&#x27;s literally going to kill me.&quot;<p>Carr suggests once you truly accept smoking adds nothing to your life, and only takes away from your experience, only then does the motivation to quit rise high enough to boost your willpower to actually cease smoking. It&#x27;s an interesting idea and something I&#x27;ve found to be true in my own life.')
