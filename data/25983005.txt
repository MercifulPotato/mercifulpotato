Back in 2005, someone got very steamed about short selling, and then got a journalist to write a somewhat confused article about it. It&#x27;s not clear anything was actually wrong then, but in any case, the rules have been changed a few times since then, so there doesn&#x27;t seem to be any obvious relevance to current times.<p>It&#x27;s also worth noting that there&#x27;s no real theoretical basis for why naked short selling would be harmful, no real empirical evidence showing it is harmful, no general laws against it, and the structure of the market allows and expects it to take place in some specific cases. If your mental model is that the stock market is a tool to allow people to trade a fixed number of concrete objects back and forth, this probably seems odd, but since that&#x27;s not really a good model of how the stock market works or is intended to work, it&#x27;s not clear that means much.')
