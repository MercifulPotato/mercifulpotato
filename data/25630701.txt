While they make up the majority of Googleâ€™s workforce, they often lack the benefits of salaried employees<p>I don&#x27;t know how it works in the US, but in the UK contractors benefit from tax advantages compared to salaried employees, although HMRC is actively trying to kill the contractor market by tightening IR35 rules.
