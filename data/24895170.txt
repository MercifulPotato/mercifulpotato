And you can&#x27;t quite decouple the two; there&#x27;s a continuous lineage; institutions didn&#x27;t get reinvented with the revolution:<p>* US is a common law jurisdiction, and indeed, pre-colonization UK courts sometimes act as precedent for post-revolution US courts.<p>* US courts come from colonial courts<p>If you&#x27;d like to read more:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;History_of_the_American_legal_profession" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;History_of_the_American_legal_...</a><p>&quot;Legal procedures in the 17th century were quite informal, with judges discussing issues directly with the people involved in the case.&quot;<p>&quot;Colonial legislatures passed laws to fix the fees lawyers could charge for standardized procedures and maintain these fees relatively low. This often led some lawyers to handle a high volume of cases more speedily.&quot;<p>... and so on.<p>By the time the US formed, you had plenty of lawyers, but you had plenty of people representing themselves (and in cases above what would go into small claims).<p>The concept of statutory legal fees is a good one. It&#x27;s present in a form in the German legal system. It&#x27;s limited; you can pay more than statutory fees, but you can&#x27;t recover more than statutory fees if you lose. That&#x27;s still powerful. I know of a case where a big party PROBABLY owes a small party a few million dollars, but if they came out liable for opposing side&#x27;s legal fees, they&#x27;d be bankrupt. And the litigation would cost a few years of their life.<p>And yes, cases were simpler, but that&#x27;s as much a property of the unnecessary rising complexity of our legal system as of the cases. Modern cases shouldn&#x27;t be so complex.')
