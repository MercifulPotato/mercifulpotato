Ask yourself some questions:<p>- Does these repositories change together ?\n - If the code is not together, one repo should be linked to the over via what (git tag ? version number ?)\n - All pieces of the application are contained within a context ? Or they can be split (example, 10 micro services and 1 frontend, but 5 of those micro services are also used by another frontend in another project).<p>The main goal is to make things easier, some PoC and experiments may make it more clear because it really depends on the situation.')
