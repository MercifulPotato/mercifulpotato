Both protocols are old enough now to have had ample opportunity.<p>And I can&#x27;t tell if Moxie really means to improve the status quo or works for some three letter agency and builds just enough metadata opportunities into popular messengers and opportunistic encryption into WhatsApp to be helpful without being suspicious. To avoid redundancy, I posted these only yesterday and it includes some of the reasons: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25669531" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25669531</a> <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25669267" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25669267</a><p>They don&#x27;t cover everything unfortunately but I&#x27;m also getting annoyed with the ephemerality of HN. What&#x27;s posted last week is forgotten and never looked at again. I can try to find old posts that cover it or type it all out again (and it&#x27;s a big claim so very few people will even take the time to read a big comment with reasons in the middle of another thread). I&#x27;m also not denying he does good stuff, just that there are enough weird opinions (decentralization = evil, anybody but us = evil, bug bounties = evil...) that I carefully look at what he makes and would rather there were better alternatives than their central servers.<p>Signal is still the only realistic messenger to use for good security and usability, unfortunately. Wire is a good second but Signal is definitely more smooth and I&#x27;d still recommend that to the general public, with the asterisk that it&#x27;s an American company and that they should try Matrix if they&#x27;re feeling adventurous (Wire falling somewhere in the middle, at that point you might as well try Matrix).')
