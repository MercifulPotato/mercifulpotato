By comparison, current undersea cables use one repeater for amplification every 100-150km, at a cost of ~$1M each.&quot;<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.spiedigitallibrary.org&#x2F;conference-proceedings-of-spie&#x2F;11276&#x2F;112760R&#x2F;Breaking-the-silica-ceiling--ZBLAN-based-opportunities-for-photonics&#x2F;10.1117&#x2F;12.2542350.short?SSO=1" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.spiedigitallibrary.org&#x2F;conference-proceedings-of...</a>')
