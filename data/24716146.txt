Type of plastic, use case, source of the recycled plastic, and type of injection molding machine all come into play.  In practice, it&#x27;s probably less than 1&#x2F;3 of post-consumer plastic by a decent margin just because processing god knows what plastic people put in the bin into something you can injection mold requires massively expensive sorting, cleaning, treating, and re-pelletizing.<p>An interesting point to consider here is that if oil production ever goes down for whatever reason and virgin plastic prices go up as a result, post-consumer plastic recycling becomes a more attractive business prospect.')
