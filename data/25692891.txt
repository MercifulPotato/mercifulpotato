Ignoring the argument that what happened in DC was the culmination of Trump&#x27;s incitement throughout his presidency, his order to his supporters to march to the Capitol, and claiming he would be marching with them, was _the_ direct call to action. It was given during his in-person speech in DC. Why should Twitter ban him for that?<p>I think he was banned because Democrats took control of power and FAANG is telegraphing their compliance to those now in charge of how they&#x27;re going to be regulated. They&#x27;re going to over-correct, as they&#x27;re starting to do with banning Michael Flynn and more will follow.<p>Anyone on YouTube or Twitter that doesn&#x27;t outright refer to the people who broke into the Capitol as terrorists or insurrectionists are getting demonitized&#x2F;banned -- literally forced groupthink influenced by who is allowed to monetize their videos. People on the left are trying to extend the culpability of those who broke the law to those who voted for Trump. Implying nearly 70 million people are themselves insurrectionists.  I don&#x27;t think this will be good for the Internet the next time the GOP gets enough seats to pass legislation. I&#x27;d be happy knowing that&#x27;s the worst of what&#x27;s to come.')
