There are of course luxury brands that do target these people exclusively, but they aren&#x27;t big companies.<p>Apple is a very strong brand so they can achieve high markups, but even they have price ceilings on what&#x27;s reasonable, at least for their bread-and-butter products. Moreover, you can not just &quot;decide&quot; to be profitable like Apple by imitating its approach to product design and pricing.<p>That is not to say that you can&#x27;t build a profitable company targeting the particular niche of users ready to spend $30&#x2F;month for an email client. You just can&#x27;t scale it.')
