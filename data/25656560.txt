Of course the ECB won&#x27;t insist there is no inflation if they themselves have defined housing to not be included in the definition they use to measure inflation. This doesn&#x27;t mean that the parent commentator is wrong nor does it imply that ECB is correct in their definition. For most people, housing is a significant cost in day to day life, and will of course be felt as inflation, regardless of how it&#x27;s defined and measured in monetary policy.<p>If it were up to me, housing should also be included in the definition of inflation. That would be a good way to lay bare the downsides with an aggressively expanding monetary policy.')
