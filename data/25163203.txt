I&#x27;m relieved, that at least we got something in return: derisking mRNA as a delivery method, and showing that it&#x27;s far superior to older ones. You&#x27;re right that we don&#x27;t have medium &#x2F; long term data yet, but this article is quite relevant:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jpost.com&#x2F;health-science&#x2F;could-an-mrna-vaccine-be-dangerous-in-the-long-term-649253" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jpost.com&#x2F;health-science&#x2F;could-an-mrna-vaccine-b...</a><p>Linial explained that “mRNA is a very fragile molecule, meaning it can be destroyed very easily... If you put mRNA on the table, for example, in a minute there will not be any mRNA leftover. This is as opposed to DNA, which is as stable as you get.”\nShe said that this fragility is true of the mRNA of any living thing, whether it belongs to a plant, bacteria, virus or human.\nAs such, she said the worry should not be that the mRNA won’t get into the cells and instead will stay outside, floating in the body and causing some kind of reaction. Rather the concern should be that if it doesn’t enter the cells, it will disintegrate and therefore be ineffective.')
