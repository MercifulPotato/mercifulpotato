Whatever your opinion of the quality of healthcare you get may be, it is an undeniable fact that the cost is rising and has been rising at rates far above the rates of inflation. This has been happening for a long time, but it really accelerated after Bush signed a law that said Medicare was not allowed to negotiate drug prices. (Although, I am sure there are other reasons).<p>If you are lucky enough to have an employer that loves you so much that he&#x2F;she is willing to pay ever increasing cost for your medical care, good for you. But I can tell you that you are in a tiny, tiny minority. As things currently, stand medical care costs are scary high and they are getting higher every year at a very scary rate. And most employers are looking at ways they can limit their health care costs, most of the solutions resulting in limiting benefits for employees.')
