Item(by='kriro', descendants=None, kids=[25465708], score=None, time=1608280796, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25463877, text='I&#x27;ve played it for 12 or so hours on my non-pro PS4. Had to restart once because the controls stopped working (&quot;mouse cursor&quot; just moved to the bottom of the screen&#x2F;huge delay in input) and one time a hint overlay got stuck and covered 1&#x2F;3 of the screen and couldn&#x27;t be closed. Savegame reload fixed it (the other bug required a restart).<p>The gameplay is fun and I don&#x27;t regret buying it (physical copy). But I&#x27;m a sucker for the cyberpunk theme and Witcher 3 is probably my #1 console game of all time so maybe I&#x27;m willing to accept too much. Far from unplayable though and I don&#x27;t really care for maxed out graphics so the look and feel is just fine for me.')
