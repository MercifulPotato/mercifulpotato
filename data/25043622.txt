Loading the page took awhile, sifting through emails felt sluggish, etc.<p>Nothing like JIRA or other really slow sites, but just enough to be noticeable and annoying. Like I could &quot;feel&quot; the JS-heavy frontend doing more than it needs to in order to display a list of emails, or show a single one. Meanwhile it&#x27;s nagging me on the left to add contacts to my GTalk, or Hangouts, or whatever they keep renaming that thing to.<p>The whole tabbed inbox thing didn&#x27;t really help me. There are some &quot;promotional&quot; emails that I want to see in my main inbox, but most I don&#x27;t. But with the tab system, I still have to check it all the time to avoid missing the ones I care about. So instead of decluttering things, I now have more places to click on to see what I have.<p>There was something about them disabling Exchange support a few years back. This made emails arrive much slower in my inbox on my iOS native client. I can&#x27;t remember the specifics of that, or if IMAP is now functionally equivalent, but I don&#x27;t care anymore.<p>And I just really would like to see my inbox and the currently-selected message at the same time. AFAIK, you have to choose between the message list or a single message; can&#x27;t see both.<p>-------<p>So, after typing all that, I just logged into it again to see if my complaints held up. It seems faster now. I discovered I can disable the tabbed inbox (probably always could). I can enable a right reading pane (probably always could), and change the theme to a dark background (again...).<p>I got it almost looking like my Fastmail setup. But they&#x27;re 2 years too late, and the font rendering is kinda crappy on my non-HiDPI external display anyway<p>So I guess now the only reason I don&#x27;t use Gmail anymore is because Google.')
