When you write Orleans code, the presumption is it will be executed on a remote machine, but you don&#x27;t have to address that machine. The Orleans host does the work of actually assigning ownership of grains and distributing the load between silo nodes. So in your .NET code you simply have to instantiate a grain like you would any other plain old C# class (actually there&#x27;s usually a factory IIRC), and then you work with its async Task-based methods (a standard and boring concept in modern .NET) which may or may not communicate over the network.')
