What I have here is a todo list app where you can perform CRUD actions on the todo list (add todos, delete them, update the done state).<p>The front end is in React and the back end is an Express API that talks to a Mongo instance.<p>Next actions include\n- Making this a full fledged product by throwing in login functionality, authentication, ability to create multiple lists\n- Honing my HTML&#x2F;CSS skills to build components for the above purposes\n- Deploying this to Heroku')
