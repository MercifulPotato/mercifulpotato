In my case, I don&#x27;t run any applications like that directly on my storage filesystem by default. Those sorts of files and directories, including my linux home directory, are on a non-redundant SSD. If there&#x27;s a failure, I accept the risk of losing that data. 90% of the time the data either doesn&#x27;t matter, or is redundantly stored somewhere else, such as a git repo. A typical use case is digital photos; I may dump them into my desktop directory at first so that I may view and sort them, and they&#x27;ll live there for an arbitrary length of time. I simply won&#x27;t delete them from their SD card until they&#x27;re copied into the storage filesystem.<p>Also, I have enough disks laying around that I usually have a 2nd cold backup to wipe. So, I have some inadvertent temporal redundancy going back a year or two.<p>When I make a conscious decision to copy files over to my storage, I have piece of mind that I&#x27;ll get physical redundancy within hours, and will get picked up by my cold backup eventually.')
