A couple of years ago the speculation was that Voice would be cancelled. See e.g. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.computerworld.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;3564825&#x2F;google-voice.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.computerworld.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;3564825&#x2F;google-voice.h...</a> :<p>&gt; But then, well, Google...Googled. It let Voice languish for years, without any attention or updates, then awkwardly half-merged it into Hangouts and had it rot away unattended for years. And we all know how the whole Hangouts saga ended (or is still in the process of ending, I guess we should say).<p>&gt; A few years ago, though, something unexpected happened: Following years of neglect, Google suddenly brought Voice back to life.<p>You can find discussion of it on HN, e.g. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=19022660" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=19022660</a> :<p>&gt; Don&#x27;t get me started. I think my Google Voice &#x2F; Hangouts account will be deprecated soon, or has been, and will be eliminated, or maybe not. It&#x27;s not clear. It never is.<p>&gt; Google voice has been all but deprecated at this point. The form for buying credits has been broken for a year, and calls calls to my google voice number no longer get forwarded to my phone &#x2F; google hangouts.<p>Perhaps if you didn&#x27;t live through all this, you don&#x27;t get why people find it annoying.')
