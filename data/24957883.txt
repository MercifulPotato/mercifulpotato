Here, one industry (AI, object tracking) replaces another (cameraman). I would make the wild guess that this creates more jobs than it eliminates (because tech is not yet perfect or sometimes not applicable). The nature of human professions change all the time. Brickmakers or coopers also took pride in their profession. In the future, being a football match cameraman might just as well not be the best way to provide a useful service to others.')
