The overall effect is a substantial improvement. I don&#x27;t use the touchbar too much, but it is a moderate improvement over F keys for me (I appreciate the return of a physical escape key).<p>Subjectively these two keyboards are pretty similar (I slightly prefer the previous ones). Scissor switches are all pretty mediocre; the shape to fit in a laptop just forces very sharp compromises on the design.<p>I also think making the key tops larger was a mistake, but it is also a relatively marginal difference in practice. Part of the goal may have been to increase the space available for international legends. (That&#x27;s why IBM and every other vendor increased desktop-keyboard keytop size and switched from a spherical to cylindrical shape in the 1980s.)<p>In terms of typing experience alone, I like the Apple laptop keyboards from circa 2002 better than any of the laptop keyboards since. And the Mac Portable keyboard from 1989 is <i>way</i> better. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Macintosh_Portable" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Macintosh_Portable</a><p>* * *<p>Edit: in response to: &gt; <i>TrackPad, being too large in Post 2015 models causing much higher false positives</i><p>Let me highly recommend getting a Japanese language keyboard, which looks like this: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.keyboard-layout-editor.com&#x2F;#&#x2F;gists&#x2F;da70b0140c8a29b34cad7c28ef8b3f95" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.keyboard-layout-editor.com&#x2F;#&#x2F;gists&#x2F;da70b0140c8a29...</a><p>... and then remapping the letter keys to be wider separated, along the lines of: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.keyboard-layout-editor.com&#x2F;#&#x2F;gists&#x2F;a578960e19e2c95654e4f79b9bbe6501" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.keyboard-layout-editor.com&#x2F;#&#x2F;gists&#x2F;a578960e19e2c9...</a><p>Moving your left hand slightly left and your right hand substantially to the right relative to a typical US-ANSI keyboard will keep you from accidentally palm-swiping the trackpad.')
