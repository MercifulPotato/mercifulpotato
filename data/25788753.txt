Item(by='jacobolus', descendants=None, kids=[25788831], score=None, time=1610702951, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25788428, text='&gt; <i>key travel 2019 1mm vs. 2015 1.3mm</i><p>The comparative overall height of the keyboard modules is more than 0.3mm different, and the new computers are dramatically thinner and lighter than the previous ones. The overall effect is a substantial improvement.<p>Subjectively these two keyboards are pretty similar (I slightly prefer the previous ones). Scissor switches are all pretty mediocre; the shape to fit in a laptop just forces very sharp compromises on the design.<p>I also think making the key tops larger was a mistake, but it is also a relatively marginal difference in practice. Part of the goal may have been to increase the space available for international legends.<p>In terms of typing experience alone, I like the Apple laptop keyboards from circa 2002 better than any of the laptop keyboards since. And the Mac Portable (!?) keyboard from 1989 is <i>way</i> better. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Macintosh_Portable" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Macintosh_Portable</a>')
