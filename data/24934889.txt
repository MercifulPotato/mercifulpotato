He notes that <i>&quot;Everything gets interpreted through this lens of, ‘Which side are you helping, and which side are you on?’&quot;</i>  It&#x27;s absolutely true that this framework is unhelpful for comprehending the situation, that it makes it difficult to forming a coherent philosophy, and and that it makes it impedes the process of learning about and sharing complex ideas.<p>But there is an obvious outcome where this gets published, people realize that Biden has flaws, and choose to elect Trump instead as if he did not have flaws. There is no chance of an outcome where people realize that Biden has flaws and elect a different candidate without flaws instead.
