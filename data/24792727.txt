I&#x27;ve been trying to get my bookmarks under control, and I decided to start evaluating Raindrop.<p>My biggest issue up front was how slow and somewhat clunk it felt. For something that manages bookmarks, it needs to be fast an unobtrusive. It shouldn&#x27;t feel like a chore to create a bookmark.<p>Maybe I was using it wrong.<p>In any case, I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;m ending the experiment early.<p>I truly hope they can sort these issues out.')
