To me it comes across as selfish, he only wants people to use acronyms that he personally knows, even when they&#x27;re not talking to him.<p>For instance I work on aircraft. Basically every component has its acronym. Yes, it&#x27;s hard when you&#x27;re new to the area. But nobody is going to take the time to write or say &quot;Integrated Drive Generator&quot;, &quot;Power Control Unit&quot;, or &quot;Over-Pressure Shut-Off Valve&quot; every time. Everyone spends their day referring to components.<p>Most documents have a lexicon however, and there&#x27;s a web interface to search them.')
