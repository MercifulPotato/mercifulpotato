I try not to over sell it to non-devs, but I do have a fair amount of customers who are hacking at Divjoy projects while learning to code and are very happy with that.<p>Since all the boilerplate works out of the box you can skip over a bunch of stuff (like understanding how auth works under the hood), but generally there&#x27;s some custom logic you need to write and you&#x27;ll want to pickup some JS&#x2F;React to do that.<p>Any integration with Authorize.net would be totally done by you. You could export a codebase with Stripe payments so that you can at least see how payments logic ties in with UI.. but you&#x27;d need to then strip that out and replace with your own custom Authorize integration.')
