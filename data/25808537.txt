After 25 I never really had any job.<p>I&#x27;m working on a backpack and carry gear startup in India, which feels like David vs Goliath. Every competitor in this space is too big. VC or Funding is out of question as no one heeds or supports physical product startup. I don&#x27;t have money to bootstrap and crowdfunding isn&#x27;t big in India (used as new charity funding platform).<p>Only good thing is the backpack manufacturer is very supportive, open minded and keen to produce interesting product (which very rarely happens with Indian manufacturers)<p>I&#x27;m stuck and I feel confused with not much moves left on my board.<p>Any life advice? Should I quit and do a job? Should I take loans and push harder?')
