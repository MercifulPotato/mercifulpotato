It works there not because French reactors can respond meaningfully to short-term meteorology, but because:\n1) France is connected to a continent-sized grid and \n2) All of France&#x27;s neighbours are nowhere near 80% nuclear, so will buy this baseload power.<p>If Germany, NL, Denmark, Spain, UK et al. had 80% nuclear France&#x27;s  nuclear power would become uneconomic.<p>It&#x27;s the grid and unique political considerations, not those plants&#x27; responsiveness that makes it work for France.')
