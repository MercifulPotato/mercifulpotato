Primordial stars converted those to heavier elements - carbon, nitrogen... and at some point in time between the first stars exploding and spreading the heavier elements into the universe, and now, the first RNA molecules were formed. <i>What was the chemical process that produced them</i> is the specific question here. Not where in universe this happened. Although that question is exciting as well.<p>Nothing stops from using Darwin&#x27;s idea here as well - there was a puddle on a planet, somehwere else, long ago and far away...<p>Panspermia makes the argument actually more complex, not simpler.
