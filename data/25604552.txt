I won&#x27;t say the whole budget will be wasted away, but I hold no hope of something useful coming out of it.<p>The ECB has been buying trillions of euro&#x27;s worth of dubious government bonds and bank debts for the last couple of years. Also every year the EU pays hundreds of billions worth of subsidies to European farmers so that they are able to sell their goods below global market prices. I would say that this 145 billion is as good an investment if not better than what EU money has been spent on so far.')
