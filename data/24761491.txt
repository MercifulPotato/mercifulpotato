That&#x27;s why nazi germany existed in europe, not in america. I love people bringing up europe as some example that we should follow. They most definitely are not.<p>&gt; And free speech is still doing just fine.<p>No it&#x27;s not. That&#x27;s the point.<p>Free speech exists to defend offensive&#x2F;fringe&#x2F;hateful speech. Popular speech doesn&#x27;t need free speech protection after all. If free speech exist to protect anything, it is holocaust denial. Think about it. What good is free speech if it can&#x27;t protect the most offensive speech?')
