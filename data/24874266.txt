However, portability libraries such as Dissect[0] allow for saving the stack state as normal Lisp data that can then be inspected using the system inspector.</i><p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;shinmera.github.io&#x2F;dissect&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;shinmera.github.io&#x2F;dissect&#x2F;</a><p>Still, you can fully preserve the full stack information as Lisp data along with the whole heap, dump the image, and then inspect the dumped core as if you inspected any other Lisp image. This is already a big quality improvement over digging in dead crash dumps or - worse - textual, printed stacktraces with no other information available.<p>Therefore, I think that the statement &quot;you can&#x27;t use saved images to debug errors in SBCL&quot; is somewhat far-fetched, really.')
