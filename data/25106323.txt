I will also cynically suggest that everyone else seems so happy and normal, that no one else really has problems. Then you might start to find me off-putting, impolite, condescending, all of which are actually just unwanted side-effects of my symptoms manifesting in social situations; after the conversation ends, I will surely start to ruminate and regret what I said, realizing that I am a PoS for having left a piece of negative energy in the world, and that the world would be better without my negativity. But since everyone in this thread is chiming in about their situation, I feel perfectly at home, because now I don&#x27;t feel like the odd one out.')
