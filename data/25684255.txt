It&#x27;s so generic and lacks any investigation or insight; I could copypaste this as a reply to any software project post on HN and it could vaguely apply in the same way (but not specifically apply).<p>Case in point with JS libs and the following line: &quot;You are going to start adding modules and eventually you&#x27;re going to have a whole ecosystem&quot;. This happens with individual JS-built products using libs, but definitely does not happen universally with most JS libraries. Take React, the first comparator referenced in the post title: its ecosystem is entirely 3rd-party addons and the core is focused and single-purpose to this day. They&#x27;ve added a lot of internal complexity to their vdom implementation which adds code bloat, but it isn&#x27;t what this commenter is describing.<p>Vague comments like this never apply to all cases (often apply to no cases). It&#x27;s a lazy comment that contributes nothing without being specific to this new library. You need to read the code and develop some genuine insight to have this type of commentary.')
