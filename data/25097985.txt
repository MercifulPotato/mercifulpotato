It&#x27;s not as simple as the Argos, but I basically don&#x27;t touch buttons on it otherwise. If only it didn&#x27;t have the clock built in.<p>My second best microwave was a Samsung. It was terrible in the way all Samsung products are EXCEPT it had a &quot;sound off&quot; button so your microwave didn&#x27;t wake the whole house when it finished cooking your 1:00am burrito. After about 3 years (standard for Samsung products to become garbage) it stopped working and I replaced it with the 3 year newer model that didn&#x27;t have the volume kill switch.')
