Discussing that COVID19 is real, that masks help, and that pooling health care resources was needed for the imminent future. Fortunately, my local area is doing good on stockpiling PPE, expanding hospital beds &#x2F; resources and more.<p>The issue is that a good chunk of America decided that COVID19 was a fake virus that only afflicted China, no wait, only affected Europe... no wait... only affected liberal cities. There was no way for it to spread around the country.<p>Sad fact: its too late to change the nursing situation now. Your state is either ready for this, or it isn&#x27;t. Too late to change things. You had since January to prepare (when China announced to the world the COVID19 issue), maybe March (when New York City announced to the country that COVID19 arrived on our shores).<p>What we can do is start the propaganda campaigns needed to get mass vaccinations ready.')
