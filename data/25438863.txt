They will just make a bunch of requests. That is what usually happens in the real world.<p>However, the difference is that with REST, it all just looks like isolated independent requests. With graphQL it becomes more clear that someone wants to query all comments in just one query, so it&#x27;s much more easy to detect and optimize for that case.<p>For me, GraphQL wins here.')
