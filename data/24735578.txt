Oracle can come after anyone using Java if there is substantial money to be made.<p>So Java is only free as long as money keeps coming in for Oracle, once it dries like for SCO, they will go after anyone using Java API to extract money.<p>Also this shows subtle difference between open source  and free. In a legitimate open source licensed software copyright and right to change is granted and company cannot sue others just based on copyright like Oracle can sue anyone using Java API.')
