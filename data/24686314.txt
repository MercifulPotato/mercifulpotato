There&#x27;s no rule that states that every life form that ever existed must have any descendants. In fact the opposite is true, the vast majority of life forms were exctinct.<p>Famous case in point are the Ediacarean fossils in Newfoundland, the first known multicellular organisms. No descendants live today, they are completely extinct. Without these fossils we wouldn&#x27;t even be aware of this branch of the evolutionary tree.')
