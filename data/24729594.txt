We (the world) are doing so many things at once now to try to handle the pandemic, but my impression of all of it, is that we really have no idea what we are doing, what works and what doesn&#x27;t, why things seem to be out of control, and (controversially) how bad it actually is in the grand scheme of things.<p>IMO science is most definitely not comparable to religion, but I will concede that -for most people- its role in their lives is very similar.')
