Unless it’s limb removal you go in and either do the procedure or go in and don’t do the final setup.  The ethics is interesting as surgical procedures can become common without any actual testing of effectiveness.<p>Overall about 1&#x2F;2 of surgical procedures have had double blind tests and of those about 1&#x2F;2 passed the test.  Which suggests something like 1&#x2F;4 to 1&#x2F;2 of surgery’s are ineffective.')
