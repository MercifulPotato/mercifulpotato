Not one.<p>Some idiot <i>chooses</i> to try to make it political in nature and a bunch of other equally uninformed idiots believes the original idiot or takes up the cause.<p>Example 1: SaaS company is breaking no American laws and ICE isn&#x27;t either. The fact you even think its morally correct to deny them service screams how ideologically possessed you are. Here&#x27;s a hot fuckin&#x27; take for you... don&#x27;t illegally  come to America.<p>Example 2: I don&#x27;t know enough about intellectual property and open source contributions to have an opinion.<p>Example 3: Maybe you&#x27;re not doing politics, maybe you&#x27;re just not a shitbag.<p>Example 4: Maybe you don&#x27;t give a shit and just want to be left alone.<p>Example 5: You&#x27;re just a controlling asshole, not politically against Palestine.<p>I <i>would</i> say, &quot;I hope you get the point&quot;, but you won&#x27;t... because its clear just from these examples alone you&#x27;re so politically motivated that you can&#x27;t see the world from any other vantage point.')
