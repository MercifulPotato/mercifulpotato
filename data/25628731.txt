With a startup, your goal is to iterate the fastest. You cannot afford to be spending more than 1 day of time on your continuous deploy system before you have your first paying client.<p>Given the size to your team, you should also have been spending near zero time on documentation. Documentation should be in the form of sticky notes and Slack messages.<p>I think you’re very talented technically, but you should not work on startups until you are able to emulate more of the successful technical cofounder patterns.<p>If your code and processes can scale to 100x of your time expected volume, this is almost universally a sign that you have failed to optimise for what matters.<p>This also goes even if you’re building something like AWS. AWS engineers do not build over-engineered systems that can handle 100d of its expected volume.')
