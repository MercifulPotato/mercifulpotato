Opensource will very much benefit from less freeloader companies like Apple, and less companies of lesser rectitude hanging around OSS projects.<p>Is that so? Which examples do you have where Apple freeloads some GPL software? As far as I can tell Apple stopped adopting any GPL-3 code and effectively has stopped updating GPL-2 dependencies.  They are in the process of completely removing it.<p>On the other hand Apple still contributes actively to a lot of non GPL licensed Open Source code including LLVM.')
