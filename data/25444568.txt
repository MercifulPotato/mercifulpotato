Item(by='jacurtis', descendants=None, kids=[25446485], score=None, time=1608136566, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25443997, text='My concern with this is that it will likely take at a minimum 1-2 years for tire manufacturers to research new compounds that eliminate this chemical. Then it will take probably another year, at best, before manufacturing plants are transitioned over to build this new compound and we start to see the new compound trickle down into new tires. Then it will take 2-4 years to propagate that compound across the entire product line and&#x2F;or industry.<p>Once the compound is readily available across the industry, then we can rest assured that new tires will be &quot;safe&quot;. But tires have a usable life of 2-5 years depending on the type of tire. So it will take many more years before people with &quot;non-safe&quot; tires purchase new ones that are &quot;salmon-safe&quot;. Remember also that some people (generally as a result of financial concern) may drag tire use out to 8 or even 10 years.<p>This puts a timeline for &quot;safe tires&quot; at 10-20 years from now! I hate to shout &quot;doomsday&quot;, but the Salmon may not have that long. Salmon only live 2-3 years on average before spawning. According to this article, 90% of them are dying due to this chemical during their trip up Puget Sound urban rivers to spawn. Salmon are already operating at low population rates. So we may not have decades to sit and figure this out.<p>As a more immediate alternative, I would like to see if there is a way to neutralize or catch this 6PPD chemical with some type of &quot;filter&quot; in the road runoff pipes or a road-coating that could be installed in critical areas. This would seem like a more immediate solution that wouldn&#x27;t require global or national &quot;buy-in&quot; from tire manufacturers.<p>And of course all this assumes that tire manufacturers care enough to save the salmon. This is the type of thing that regulation is useful for instead of relying on tire manufacturers to &quot;do the right thing&quot;.')
