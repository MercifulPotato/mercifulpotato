I will try to be mindful and any heart spiking statements made are not intentional.<p>Many things to tease out here:<p>1. Parents are the legal owners of a child’s DNA until the child is an legal adult. Personally, I subscribe to this position.<p>2. Child rearing must be(imo) in the domain of the parents in charge and not the govt or peer group or popular opinion.<p>3. Children’s brains..especially teenagers..are not well formed and are not capable of making a well formed decision. Studies say that it’s not until age 25 is a brain considered fully formed to make rational decisions.<p>4. Teenagers should absolutely talk to medical professionals about what is distressing them ..physically or emotionally. I don’t think there is any debate about trans teenagers wanting to gather more information and research before making very powerful changes that are also likely irreversible.<p>5. Finally, not everyone is going to accept personal choices of the 7.5 billion odd others. We just keep on creating newer categories of protected classes and placing them in untouchable bubbles with the expectation of immunity from general opinions. This isn’t helping said protected classes at all and only making them more vulnerable.')
