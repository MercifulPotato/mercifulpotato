I am sitting here in a t-shirt right now and the part of my back that is up against my chair is rather sweaty.<p>Likewise, feet sweat in shoes.<p>&gt; However, it is important to note that if the body as a whole is kept warm enough, hands and feet will not be greatly affected by lower indoor temperatures.<p>Again, not true in my experience.<p>&gt;  While insulating your neck and feet will greatly improve your thermal comfort, there is no need to wear gloves or caps indoors.<p>If the indoor temp is below 65f I am not going to be typing anything for very long. For that matter at around 68f I&#x27;m starting to get uncomfortable.<p>Truth of it is, I&#x27;ve worked in more than one office where I was stuck wearing a cap indoors.')
