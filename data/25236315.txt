You could have used &quot;extensive&quot; or something ;)<p>Anyway, what I&#x27;ve seen when comparing the performance of tools, is that Artillery, which is running on NodeJS, is perhaps the wors performer of all the tools I&#x27;ve tested. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because of NodeJS or that Artillery in itself isn&#x27;t a very performant piece of software (It also consumes a lot of memory, btw).<p>If you want the highest performance, there is one tool that runs circles around <i>all</i> others (including k6), and that is wrk - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wg&#x2F;wrk" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wg&#x2F;wrk</a> - very cool piece of software although it is lacking in terms of functionality so mostly suitable for simpler load testing like hammering single URLs.<p>(I don&#x27;t know how fast wrk2 is, haven&#x27;t benchmarked it)')
