The KDE ki18n library that is one of its primary dependencies which extends Qts internationalization faculties is... about 7k LOCs. Almost all of Kritas immediate dependencies are small shims except for Qt itself which is produced by an already profitable corporation. So qtbase is about 2.3M LOCs but the Qt Company has ~300 employees with most of them working on it.<p>Krita with its &quot;killing it&quot; manages to employ 4 people full time to work on development. That is on an install base of several millions of active users. The closest competitor to Krita is probably Paint Tool Sai, a proprietary Windows only program that is made by a for profit Japanese corporation as its largely only product that employs around ~10 people. Getting actual employment figures for Systemax Software Development is actually really hard...<p>Point is Krita is likely shuffling along with half the full time paid employees of its principal competitor while also likely having a larger installed and active userbase due to it being free software and cross platform. They aren&#x27;t &quot;killing it&quot; at all, especially if you compare it to the elephant in the room at Adobe with a hundred man development team at least making insane amounts of revenue off licensing of Photoshop.<p>Its revenue is nothing close to hoist the weight of the entirety of the free software ecosystem upon when it doesn&#x27;t itself come close to even competing in the field its doing a really good job competing it on a tiny development team.')
