Most water has <i>some</i> hardness, but mine varies between 20 and 60 grains of hardness, which is quite high.<p>As you cannot tell the perfect amount of soap to add, unless you know the precise hardness at that moment, water like mine which is variable means a simple thing.<p>I am simply forced to add 3x the soap of the &#x27;low range&#x27; of my water hardness, thus ensuring the clothes are effected by the soap.<p>Yet with amounts like that, all the soap has a difficult time washing out.  Vinegar really helps, as an acid, to nullify the soap and wash it out.<p>So my target is not SLS in specific, just &#x27;soap is a base, so acid should help get rid of it&#x27;, which seems to work.<p>Some organisms cannot handle acid as well, so it may help in other respects.')
