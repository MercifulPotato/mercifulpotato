Imagine  depending on a CPython implementation detail that depends on an implementation detail of a specific C compiler. Those things do happen and they make programmers&#x27; lives miserable  sometimes, but imagine how often that would happen if C didn&#x27;t have a spec that all compilers strive to implement.')
