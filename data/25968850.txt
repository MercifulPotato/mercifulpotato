You can look at them and call many of them &#x27;left&#x27;, but other than that they&#x27;re not really compatible. Some are nationalist, some are unionist, some are progressive, some are regressive (often within the same party!) What do you think they have in common? What direction would they work?<p>For example are the Liberal Democrats part of your left block that would win? But when given the choice they coalesce more readily with the Conservatives in practice.')
