Item(by='TeMPOraL', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611880724, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25951849, text='I don&#x27;t know anything about stock trading, but I think I can piece an idea from some HN comments I&#x27;ve seen earlier.<p>The exchange between A and B isn&#x27;t direct, or instantaneous. The actual money transfer takes days, and there are parties in between that make it possible to pretend it&#x27;s immediate - much like with insta-transfers of money between the banks. Apparently, these parties are on the hook for any money that is &quot;in flight&quot;, so they need to have a substantial buffer.<p>Once you get this many people trading on a stock this volatile, apparently the buffer in the middle isn&#x27;t sufficient to cover the risk, so the parties in the middle stop accepting these trades.<p>EDIT: &#x27;imladyboy quotes the source from which I pieced most of the interpretation above.
