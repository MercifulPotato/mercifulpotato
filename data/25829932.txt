Item(by='apple_innocent', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611029765, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25829024, text='Because I the user am running a forward proxy to encrypt all outgoing HTTP requests, I do not have to rely on &quot;HTTPS-only&quot; on the server side.  I enforce &quot;HTTP-everywhere&quot; on the client side.  That&#x27;s the theory anyway.<p>To be honest there are still some sites that do not, and will probably never, offer HTTPS and I have to account for those with the proxy setup.  For these websites I might assign them a different local IP that does not add encryption.<p>In running this setup there are some times where I find that for one reason or another &quot;HTTPS-only&quot; on the server side has failed to catch every instance where <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;</a> should be <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;</a>.  I use many different clients, the least of which is the modern browser which may have some whizbang features to try to enforce &quot;HTTPS-everywhere&quot;.  The clients I use more are simpler, less complex and do not have such features.  Instead of relying on the modern browser, I rely on an extensive proxy configuration to make sure everything gets encrypted (when appropriate).')
