I&#x27;d go even further. I don&#x27;t read malux85&#x27;s comment as an attack on your understanding personally. I read it as referring to people like the blog post author, who clearly don&#x27;t understand the basics of the tools they&#x27;re complaining about.<p>No one is screaming in rage about anything here. We do tend to get frustrated hearing complaints from people that are unwilling to take even the smallest amount of time to learn before complaining about the state of things.')
