Right now I am just learning about CNNs and I just bought a gaming laptop specifically so I wouldn&#x27;t have to rely on Paperspace and vast.ai for everything.<p>So at the moment I am probably going to try to take advantage of the laptop a bit more.  In the future if I have a contract or am trying to get a ML contract I may take advantage of some of your features which sound like a big advantage.  How does the detection and automatic saving of models work?  Seems pretty hard to do that.  Does it work with the latest keras for example? And so I can just skip down to the cell that uses the trained model?  To be honest I haven&#x27;t used it much but I guess I thought if I committed the docker process after doing the training then I would already be able to use the trained model when I ran that image again.<p>My real goal is eventually to actually build a relatively novel real-time computer vision system for a simulated robot.  So at some point I am not sure that Jupyter is going to be right.  But I like it so maybe I can stretch out it&#x27;s utility.')
