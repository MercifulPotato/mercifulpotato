His answer is: a psychopath.  A person without any moral sense who will pursue their goals single mindedly and with no scruples whatsoever.  How in the world did we hand over complete power over our economic affairs to such monsters?  There is no such thing as a corporation that&#x27;s not evil... like the scorpion in the fable of the fox and the scorpion, &quot;don&#x27;t be evil&quot; is contrary to their nature.')
