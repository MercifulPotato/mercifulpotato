I remember spending weeks trying to figuring out if I could break drm in the latest video game (&#x27;tricking&#x27; starforce in splinter cell 3 was such a cool thing). Then I moved on to academia where I felt the ethos extended. Academia was life consuming and by the end I just had to leave.<p>Now that I&#x27;m job hunting post-phd, I&#x27;m trying to rekindle that excitement in something...and I don&#x27;t feel it. Grinding leetcode or memorizing some companies &#x27;leadership principles&#x27; has been the antithesis of creativity. Everything feels like marketing. I wish I had kept up with old friends instead of spending my weekends in the office.<p>Funny enough, I&#x27;ve been brewing beer&#x2F;kombucha and cheesemaking as a distraction.<p>I guess I&#x27;m getting older?')
