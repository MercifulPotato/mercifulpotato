You&#x27;ve basically just said: &quot;That shopowner has a right not to deal with blacks, why do they keep harassing that poor man by trying to buy his goods?&quot;.<p>&gt; I will note the irony about people saying that we should respect society “decisions” when they didn’t respect Trump becoming president since day one . Come on pal drop the dishonesty.<p>Those people didn&#x27;t leave pipe-bombs at both party headquarters, call for their own Vice President to be hanged, or storm the Capitol building though. It&#x27;s both transparent and dishonest to try to equate the two. Especially when you consider that Trump was one of the people peddling the birther nonsense about Obama and that pretty much everyone involved with the trump campaign was actually found guilty of some form of corruption. Trump himself has only escaped charges by virtue of being the President.')
