I have a very similar set of tools for a pure-Emacs workflow to this:<p>- org-roam\n- org-noter\n- persp mode with persistent sessions\n- vterm + eshell\n- various plugins for org bibtex &#x2F; latex<p>All of this in Doom Emacs gives me the same functionality.<p>I do admit that it took a large amount of time for me to cultivate this over several years, as it does for most workflows. It&#x27;s very hard to jump ship, even when the grass may be objectively greener, because one has to actually be productive today instead of postponing until one&#x27;s fonts are just right and keybindings are perfect!')
