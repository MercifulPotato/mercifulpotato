These articles about the environmental impact of Bitcoin and PoW are valid, but they&#x27;re ancient news.<p>It&#x27;s telling that there&#x27;s no mention of Ethererum or PoS. Are they simply unaware? I doubt it. While I&#x27;m also concerned about the ability of ETH to smoothly transition to PoS, it would be an enormous win for crypto.<p>So why publish this article now? It could just be the usual profiting from cyptophobia. But many people probably want prices to go down so they can stock up before the ETH upgrade.')
