What&#x27;s wrong with a third party having it? Its out of fear of them abusing that data. So then you have to ask yourself, what counts as abuse? To me, its any time a company uses the data against me, in order to make me spend money or buy products. This is EXACTLY what Google does with my data. They use it to find out what the best adverts to serve me are, that give the highest likelihood that I will click on them and buy something. Given the amount of garbage adverts they have, I do not trust Google for a second: I&#x27;ve seen plenty of Google and Youtube adverts for outright scams, exploitative garbage like Raid Shadow Legends, have heard reports of malware being served, etc. As long as Google happily serve these adverts on their network (and they don&#x27;t even respond to reporting the adverts, as plenty of HN submissions have shown), I don&#x27;t believe they can be trusted, in general and certainly not with my data.<p>Therefore, I do not want Google to have any data on me and that&#x27;s why I am against this and other acquisitions.<p>Besides just the data, its also Googles record for shutting down services they buy and their non-existent customer support.')
