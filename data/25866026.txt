It is a moral good to provide value to customers such that they voluntarily choose to give you money in exchange for that value.<p>These people have this bizarre fusion of capitalist and communist reasoning, I really can&#x27;t reconcile it. On the one hand they seem to think profit is fundamentally evil, but on the other hand they seem to think the problem is that Elastic isn&#x27;t being allowed to monopolize all the profit.<p>Well, which is it? Did Elastic release non-restrictively-licensed free software out of the goodness of their hearts, giving it away with no expectation of a return? Or did they create this codebase purely for profit, and thus have no claim to moral highground? It&#x27;s all so silly and childish.<p>And the biggest irony is, Elastic is already a successful business. They&#x27;re trying to pretend their business model is not viable as long as Amazon keeps operating, which is just gaslighting.')
