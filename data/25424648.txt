Item(by='musicale', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607987355, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25424544, text='Usually I&#x27;m mostly done after beating a Diablo game a couple of times at various difficulty levels, but I still find them fun to play periodically. I think the fact that they become tedious after a while is not a bad thing since otherwise you&#x27;d never stop playing! They are also fun and easy games to pick up and play with friends or family (especially D3 in couch co-op mode.)<p>Regarding game vs. IRL skills, I enjoy Guitar Hero quite a bit, but Rocksmith actually improves your ability to play a real guitar.<p>Rock Band drums are pretty close to electronic drums though, and vocals are actual vocals.<p>And as I&#x27;ve mentioned, Ring Fit Adventure (which I&#x27;m still playing) kind of levels <i>you</i> up. I found similar effects with Wii Fit, where years after stopping playing (and switching to non-balance based exercises) my sense of balance was surprisingly better than it had been before I started playing the game. I expect other physical games like Dance Dance Revolution are good for physical coordination, and I expect twitch games such as FPSs are good for eye-hand coordination and reaction time.')
