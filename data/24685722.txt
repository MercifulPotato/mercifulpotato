After a certain length, the instability issues you point out cause problems, so usually they have a shorter genome. But I&#x27;d say that earliest life forms had shorter genomes anyways. Also, not every copy has to work out. You can see that with viruses, there are viruses where errors in manufacturing render most created viruses inactive.')
