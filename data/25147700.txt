Apple&#x27;s payment processor should be chosen because it&#x27;s better, not because you have no other choice.<p>I&#x27;d like to note though, that users also should be free to choose the processing service that best serves their needs, not because they have no other choice. I&#x27;d much prefer paying with Apple Pay instead of Paypal. If Apple ever allows developers to provide different payment processors, I hope they make it mandatory for developers to also include Apple Pay as one of the options (just like they did with Sign in with Apple).')
