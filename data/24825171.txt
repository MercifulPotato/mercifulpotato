For example, Google Listen was definitely killed. I used to use it and there was no migration path to anything else Google. I think Google Music didn&#x27;t do podcasts then, and regardless it still doesn&#x27;t if you&#x27;re outside the US or Canada. So definitely killed.<p>For Google+, it says &quot;Google Photos, Chat + Meet, Calendar Features, etc.&quot;, but these are in almost no way equivalent to a social media style stream with communities and circles and such.<p>Similar with Latitude, IIRC it was merged into G+ and then killed. The equivalent feature didn&#x27;t exist at the time (not sure if it does now, my cause to use it then no longer applies.)')
