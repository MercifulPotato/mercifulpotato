Essentially your trading away some of your payload for the luxury of burning your engines for a shorter period.<p>Burning your engines continuously during a long journey isn’t practical with most of our propulsion technologies as they can’t carry enough fuel for that long a burn. The exceptions are mostly electric propulsion systems such as Hall Thrusters, which are very low thrust and aren’t useful for quick transits.')
