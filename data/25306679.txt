Use your aesthetic sense.<p>Horizontal scrolling is almost always a bad experience for the user. But 80 is way too restrictive. I&#x27;d say no more than half a standard monitor wide is the character limit. What&#x27;s a standard monitor depends on what&#x27;s used by the devs writing the code of course.<p>&gt; Source code should liberally use Unicode symbols.<p>Give it a few years. But make sure there&#x27;s a good normalization (there are several ways to print the same glyph on the screen that are different bytes in memory)')
