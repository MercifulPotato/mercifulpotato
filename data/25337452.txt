I think it&#x27;s more like:<p><i>&quot;take off as much as you like, but no more than you&#x27;ve earned; you earn 2 weeks each year and can&#x27;t bank more than 5 weeks&quot;</i><p>It&#x27;s a subtle difference, but an important one. I usually bank vacation time up to my cap (typically 240 hours, but recently bumped to 300 hours). Once I&#x27;m close I take every other friday off.<p>When coworkers ask about it my answer is &quot;I&#x27;m at the vacation cap, so if I don&#x27;t take this time off I lose it.&quot;<p>This statement acts as a double-edged sword. &quot;I&#x27;m at vacation cap&quot; signals that I&#x27;ve worked hard and foregone time off in favor of work. i.e. I&#x27;m a hard worker.  &quot;if I don&#x27;t take this time off I lose it&quot; signals that I&#x27;m not willing to leave anything on the table, and it shows that I value a work-life balance.')
