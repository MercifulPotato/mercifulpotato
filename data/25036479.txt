Time (thus money) has to be spent for that.<p>So the question is for the rest of us here: Do we want to keep replacing various OS libraries on our depedency trees because some people can&#x27;t keep maintaining them? Or shall we pay them? Or shall we maintain them ourselves? Somethint has to give.<p>To me, his point is at it&#x27;s core very correct: pay me or fork it.<p>The rest is chit chat')
