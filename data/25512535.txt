The plastic bristles. Well fuck. There&#x27;s only one place all that plastic is going and that&#x27;s into my yard. So I popped off the head and dumped it in the trash (the handle had not committed any crimes, and they are reusable, which can save a bunch of space).  There are several natural fibers that are about as tough as plastic, but they&#x27;re exotic so I couldn&#x27;t tell you how long the carbon footprint is, but at least I have less plastic in my yard.<p>The dryer vent, however, is an unsolved problem.')
