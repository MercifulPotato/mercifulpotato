The &quot;actors&quot; that created many of the problems we suffer under are dead or dying - or quite simply, too rich and powerful to be easily or effectively held accountable.<p>I think I&#x27;m being downvoted because most of us that post here on HN are either thoroughly entrenched in the system in some way, or we&#x27;re elevated beyond these problems which mostly affect poorly educated lower class people.<p>We have tons of FAANG employees that post here, tons of wealthy entrepreneurs, lots of startup founders, etc. None of us really have jack shit in common with poor disenfranchised people. But we better start making it a priority to look into, else I fear we&#x27;re going to find ourselves in a very unenviable position.')
