You intentionally spread it in a misleading way, and at this point enough counter-evidence has been provided to you that you must know you were wrong, which means you are now arguing in bad faith. Nowhere on that page does the CDC claim that current COVID-19 vaccines prevent the spread of the virus (in fact they explicitly <i>disclaim</i> the vaccine&#x27;s effect on herd immunity), but you selectively quoted to make it seem as though they might have said that.<p>To be fair, a large portion of the blame lies with whoever wrote the copy for that CDC marketing page, as they are intentionally obscuring the fact that these vaccines do not prevent the spread of the virus. It&#x27;s easily understandable why they are obscuring that fact and I suppose we should just be thankful that they haven&#x27;t spread any outright lies on that page, again by explicitly making no claims about herd immunity. Note that the page does explain to people that they need to keep social distancing after receiving the vaccine, which shows that the CDC does acknowledge privately that the vaccine does not prevent transmission of the virus.')
