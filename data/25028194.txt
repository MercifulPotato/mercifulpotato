Whether in the workplace or even in politics.<p>Leaders are not at the top, they are the foundation of everything. A good leader is the base of the team. The foundation the team is built on. They hold the team together from the bottom. Bearing the weight of responsibility and direction.<p>A good leader understands, their team&#x27;s success is their success and their team&#x27;s failure is their failure.<p>Anything can only be as strong as the foundation that holds it together. A leader who tries to stand at the top leaves no foundation for the team to work off and instead expects the team to bear their weight.<p>A leadership role is something that should be taken on with trepidation and the understanding that you&#x27;re taking on responsibility for the people working with you.<p>It&#x27;s up to you to guide things and yes it&#x27;s you that takes the blame if things don&#x27;t work.')
