Either the owner is on vacation, or has moved out, but it hasn&#x27;t sold or the new owner hasn&#x27;t moved in, and some alarm or other starts going off. Sometimes it&#x27;s the annoying smoke alarm &quot;replace the battery beep&quot; once per minute. Sometimes it&#x27;s something more annoying. I usually call the police or fire department and let them know. That&#x27;s the only way I&#x27;ve found to make it stop.')
