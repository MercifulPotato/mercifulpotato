The Pub&#x2F;Sub messages were tagged with `compress=true|false` so we could update downstream and upstream independently.<p>If you mean buffering log messages into a batched &#x27;frame&#x27;, then yes we did do this. We were taking about 500 log entries and compressing them into a single message, which was part of why the compression was so effective.<p>If you mean something different, then I&#x27;m at a loss and very interested in what you meant by the term!')
