For example, training a ML model or processing a bunch of photos takes an indeterminate amount of time.<p>I’ve seen some interesting ideas around CPU&#x2F;GPU monitoring&#x2F;tensor board&#x2F;checking in with TeamViewer&#x2F;etc but want to get an idea for the full variety of solutions out there for measuring (i) progress on your own code’s execution and (ii) progress on other programs you might want progress on (like an installer or a long render). What works for you?')
