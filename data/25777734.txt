I tried to get into a while back, but being unfamiliar with functional programming concepts at the time really got me. Learning a new language and trying to grep FP at the same time was too much for me :)<p>Now, I&#x27;m more well versed in FP in general, and I&#x27;m excited to give it another go! Everyone I&#x27;ve talked to who uses Elixir on a regular basis or professionally absolutely <i>gushes</i> with excitement and joy when they talk about it!<p>Well done, and thank you Jose!')
