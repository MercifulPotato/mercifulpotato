(disparity of environments). I have read the other recently post as well about &quot;Docker doesn&#x27;t work on the new ARM based Macs&quot;, but I don&#x27;t understand why. I mean, Docker has this in their website (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.docker.com&#x2F;use-cases" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.docker.com&#x2F;use-cases</a>):<p>&gt; It works on my machine! As a developer you know that one of the trickiest problems in software development is having to deal with environment disparity across different machines and platforms. Docker allows you to run containers locally, eliminating disparity between your development and production environments, and everything in between. [...] (Docker) is the ultimate answer to your portability concerns as containers can easily move across machines.<p>Is that not true?')
