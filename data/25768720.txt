(Might have been the other way around; this was about a decade ago.)<p>I don&#x27;t believe they would have been in much legal issues: they&#x27;d have to make sure the copy of DD-WRT they shipped was fine, but if you get updates &#x2F; flash your own, there&#x27;s no reason they&#x27;d be on the hook.')
