The non-adversarial systems you reference rely on the confidence that when a cop gets caught knowingly lying to get a warrant, that cop is fucked. Here in the US, it&#x27;s just another Tuesday morning at the coffee shop with the boys.<p>On the destruction of evidence, this one has always baffled me - so is there evidence or not? Presumably when I go to a judge saying I need the legal authority to kill some babies at 3 AM because otherwise the evidence will be destroyed... I have enough evidence to justify killing those babies, right?<p>... So this begs the question... Why do I need authorization to kill babies at 3 AM? In case the suspects destroy more evidence? What was my evidence to kill babies to begin with? Just a hunch? Because a judge should absolutely shit on that, and it should be adversarial. A judge should laugh when evidence for a warrant request is &quot;oh, I need the warrant because they&#x27;ll destroy the evidence for me to request this warrant.&quot;<p>From my rough observation of the news for the past 20 or so years, the evidence of these crimes these babies died to protect has never been worth it. Maybe you know of a few where the death of a few babies were worth it because the crimes were so heinous. Every time I&#x27;m aware of - it&#x27;s just been drugs, which could have been done in daylight hours, with no dead babies.<p>Now maybe this is your point about unarmed police. I&#x27;m not sure. But a warrant tends to be a fuck ton of latitude (as I&#x27;ve said in prior comments - judges just hand them out like candy), so just send in cops who want to kill with their bare hands and you&#x27;ll get the same result, in my opinion.<p>I agree I&#x27;m being extreme, but that&#x27;s where we are today. We tried the whole &quot;let&#x27;s just all get along and try to fight crime together&quot; method, and it turns out cops will just lie to judges and go kill kids. This isn&#x27;t me doing a slippery slope &quot;what if&quot; scenario. This has already happened. A bunch of times. Too many times in my opinion.<p>So now it&#x27;s time for us to take away everyone&#x27;s toys until they can show us they can all be good.')
