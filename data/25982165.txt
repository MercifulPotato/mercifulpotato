The fact that this one situation is so incredibly newsworthy should be strong evidence of how unlikely such successes are in practice.<p>Further, a lot of the people holding on to $GME right now <i>will</i> be caught holding the bag once the selloff begins. Once the reversion happens, there won&#x27;t be buyers willing to take this rapidly-pluging asset at every price point along the way. Certainly some people will get out at sky-high prices, but the overwhelming majority will be left holding a $10 asset they purchased at $400+.<p>&gt; I made &gt;40% of my network in the first 2 weeks of January alone...<p>Only if you&#x27;ve sold. And if you haven&#x27;t, I do genuinely hope that you&#x27;re one of those who manages to get out in time. But even if you are, it&#x27;s important to realize that the eventual winners of this scenario aren&#x27;t going to be the Redditors holding on to $GME shares, but the wealthy short-sellers who manage to either predict the pop or simply have enough assets to hold on long enough for it to happen.<p>&gt; I have literally nothing to lose.<p>No, you had 4 digits of net worth to lose. And while that might not seem like &quot;much&quot;, it&#x27;s quite literally not nothing. And while you&#x27;ve been fortunate to win on this play, the statistics are pretty clear that plays like this keep more poor people poor than make the poor rich.<p>&gt; Keeping track of my bets even before getting into this, I was right more often than not, and I am aware of survivorship bias and confirmation bias. In the limit, it makes more sense to spend 4-5 hours per day learning about market analysis, observing trends close to me and making decisions about sectors&#x2F;fields that I know about.<p>First off, compare your plays to overall market returns, not to net-zero. Your benchmark over the past five years should be something around +90% (about 14% YoY returns). Actually, you need to be a little better due to trading expenses and (in the U.S. at least) short-term capital gains tax raets vs. long-term gains.<p>Second, it&#x27;s astonishingly easy to be profitable when the overall market is having record returns. The trick is not losing your shirt when the market goes upside down, and everyone thinks that part is going to be much easier than it really is in practice.<p>In sum, I genuinely wish you luck, but I&#x27;m sadly all too aware that the statistical reality is that spending 4-5 hours per day learning about market analysis and making trades based on your findings is overwhelmingly more likely to leave you poorer than richer.<p>You can find people who&#x27;ve become rich betting it all on black at the casino, but that money didn&#x27;t come from the house. It&#x27;s just redistributing funds from all of the other suckers at the table, while the casino takes home the real winnings.')
