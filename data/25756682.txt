Hell, pretty sure it&#x27;s going to happen (or at least be full steam ahead) in the first 100 days of Biden&#x27;s presidency. While I don&#x27;t agree with sweeping regulatory practices and would like to see a thoughtful plan of trying to increase competition instead, I can&#x27;t blame the political class&#x27; position. I find it even fascinating how far reaching this event has been and how anti-Trump politicians and organizations NOW finally see how dangerous Silicon Valley has become. In essence, Twitter went to war with the Office of President of the USA (not just Trump, but the position of USA president itself), right or wrong (I&#x27;m ignoring the moral&#x2F;ethics going on for the sake of this debate, though, Trump did overstep his bounds... putting it mildly). This fact shows they can and will do it again and to lesser politicians.<p>&quot;We took Trump&#x27;s voice away, we can do it to you too. We pushed anti-Trump rhetoric and silenced pro-Trump rhetoric... do I need to replace Trump with your name if you don&#x27;t do as we say?&quot; If there is no fallout for Twitter, how far can they push it? What if Biden decides to do some policies that Twitter isn&#x27;t in favor of? Does he get shut out too? The EU can see very well that the same thing can happen to them easily as well. Shit, even the ACLU threw an objection and concern over this and they hate Trump just as must as any other democrat. The big problem is, and you have to be fair, Trump put up a hell of a PR fight the past 4 years and did rather well up until the very end. Most politicians have crumbled from less pressure than what he experienced. Not many others will be able to hold out as long as he did. This extra weapon of social media and Silicon Valley taking down the public voice of politicians is really fucking dangerous, no matter the political spectrum. They&#x27;re a handful of billionaires or near to billionaires who have direct control of what a large portion of the human population sees as fact and truth... and they have no one to oversight them.')
