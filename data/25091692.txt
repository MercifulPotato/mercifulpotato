It certainly scares me, the thought of being flooded with thousands of spam emails daily, or the chance that my own emails would be falsely marked as spam since I&#x27;m not part of the major providers or because I did not configure it correctly. Don&#x27;t know how this can be solved though, email itself is too permissive, and too &quot;tweakable&quot;.')
