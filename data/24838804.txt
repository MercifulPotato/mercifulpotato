Certainly not slower or buggier in the least, so clearly YMMV.<p>It&#x27;s mildly annoying to re-learn the UI, but Chrome did the exact same thing to me years back when they, for example, dropped viewing every tab as a separate app in the running apps list. I refused to update for a year after that, very annoying. They all do this, I&#x27;ve resigned to it.')
