It would be a nightmare here if these companies start censoring everything that the government asks for.\nErdoğan is starting loose support. AKP (his party) lost all 3 of the major cities in local elections.<p>I think the best scenario for Turkey would be Facebook and Google deciding to pull out their representatives from Turkey.<p>Legally the next step of Turkey would be to block %90 percent of the traffic. Which would be equal to blocking these sites.<p>There is a lot of AKP&#x2F;Erdoğan supporters that use these services. This would weaken Erdoğan further.<p>Most educated people in Turkey do&#x2F;can use a VPN anyways.\nOnly Erdoğan supporters, which are known to have less&#x2F;none education (big surprise) would be effected from this.')
