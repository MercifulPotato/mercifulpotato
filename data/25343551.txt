Bombardier sold, Embraer tried to, and Japan, Russia, and China have all mostly sputtered on despite having well financed government backing.<p>To put this in perspective, 787 development cost $32B. 737MAX is expected to cost past $18B. You can&#x27;t bootstrap a startup if it takes tens of billions of dollars to get a plane out of the factory.')
