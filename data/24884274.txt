The two can be done in tandem, but not sequentially.<p>When we went to the moon, there were plenty of leaks being plugged. It was a worse society and world back then. Violent crime was higher. Racism was worse. Public health was worse. Famines were a thing. Civil liberties overall was worse. Treatment of the out crowd (e.g. at work) was worse.<p>There are plenty of leaks to plug, but this should not be a barrier to lofty goals.')
