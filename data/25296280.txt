They thought the paper is missing important information and doesn&#x27;t meet the bar. Fair point. That&#x27;s why there&#x27;s an internal review process. Her reaction was childish. She took it personally and emailed a rant to the Women list even though it has nothing to do with her being a woman, nor black. She also demanded to reveal the reviewers. (again it shows she is sure it was personal). All her public interactions so far show clearly what kind of person she is. She should join academia where she can publish whatever she wants. I&#x27;m sure she made a ton of money at Google and I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if she is going to milk more money from them via a lawsuit. She is a privileged woman.')
