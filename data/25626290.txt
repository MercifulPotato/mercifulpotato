The slang for a non-native was almost impenetrable. Now after I&#x27;ve watched the whole series four or five times (I don&#x27;t remember anymore), I can quote every scene and have a good understanding of the dialog. I definitely learned something.<p>This is funny btw, but I highly value most of David Simon&#x27;s series, and I&#x27;ve watched Treme, Generation Kill and The Deuce many times over. I didn&#x27;t really like any of these series on my first watch, but something pulled me back for rewatch. I&#x27;m glad it did. I think I&#x27;ve grown as a person while going through the stories they tell; all these series are now my absolute all-time favorite television.')
