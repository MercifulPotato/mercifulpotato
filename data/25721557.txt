Imagine how silly you look to the 99% of the population who uses a functioning file picker.</i><p>Been trying to point this out for years. I love Gnome (not sure why, I guess because it used to be lighter than Qt?) but it&#x27;s gotten really tired-looking. I think back to when I used to use Enlightenment on top of Gnome and everything was super-configurable and it looked way ahead of other UIs. Some things are still better, like semi-transparent terminal windows. But I can&#x27;t remember the last time I looked at Linux desktop environment and thought &#x27;wow.&#x27; A lot of things are...pretty clunky.*')
