Dave Barry tells this story:<p>(Beth) “… and then we want to take a plane from Point A to Point B.”<p>(Japanese travel agent) “I see. You want to take a plane?” “Yes.”<p>“From Point A?” “Yes.”<p>“To Point B?” “Yes.”<p>“Ah.” “Can we do that?”<p>“Perhaps you would prefer to take a train.” “No, we would prefer to take a plane.”<p>“Ah-hah.
