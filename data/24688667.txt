And, as most people who&#x27;ve tried to determine the direction an ambulance is approaching from will tell you: it&#x27;s really hard to locate objects based on sound emissions alone from within a car cabin because of the acoustics of a cabin end up reflecting the audio all around the driver.<p>If you want to stand out on a motorcycle, use your lights and wear bright, reflective clothing.
