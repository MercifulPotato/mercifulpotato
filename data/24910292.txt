GPT-3 can replace them all, without OpenAI needing to invest another cent in training for a particular customer&#x27;s use-case. That is in fact game-changing for the ML&#x2F;DL world and current applications thereof.<p>The counterpoint is that it would be significantly cheaper AND have better performance to fine-tune models to each customer&#x27;s use case than it is to just run GPT-3 at inference.')
