Also, their name and logo weren&#x27;t known when the Model S was launched, it is now, but it wasn&#x27;t when they launched. Tesla wanted their vehicles to be &quot;Normal&quot; looking. If there was any signaling going on, putting a token grill on a car which doesn&#x27;t need one was signaling <i>this is a normal car</i>. It was only after Tesla had built up a strong enough brand and reputation that they removed the needless grill on the trunk.<p>The door handles are not an EV design cue at all. They are only on 2 Teslas and no other EVs. They are meant to look and feel luxurious and futuristic and would not be out-of-place on any higher end car. Like the gull-wing doors, I suspect they were done that way because Musk thought they would look cool.')
