The author of the post is mistaken. Doesn’t stop people from claiming “big bad Facebook caught yet again” though.<p>If you try to search someone’s phone number, Facebook will only indicate that there’s an account with that number with steps to recover (reset) your password. Nothing else.<p>Go ahead. Find some random number in your contact book and search it. If there’s an account, you’ll see the email is almost completely masked out and that there’s no name given. If it didn’t work, try another number.<p>Facebook <i>does</i> show you the name if you’ve previously logged into that account on that computer.<p>Basically, there’s no GDPR violation because there’s no PII to get. A phone number by itself is not PII as it is not “personally <i>identifiable</i> information”; you can’t link it back to the person.')
