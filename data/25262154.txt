I don’t think you can chalk a 75% IPC gain to a die shrink. That’s a much bigger IPC uplift than Intel has achieved from Sandy Bridge to Sunny Cove, which happened over 4-5 die shrinks.<p>The total performance gain, comparing a 4.7 GHz core to a 3.2 GHz core, is 20%. But there is more to it than bottom line. The conventional wisdom would tell you that increasing clock speed is better than making the core wider because of diminishing returns to chasing IPC. Intel has followed the CW for generations: it has made cores modestly wider and deeper, but has significantly increased clock speed. Intel doubled the size of the reorder buffer from Sandy Bridge to Sunny Cove. Intel increased issue width from 5 to 6 over 10 years.<p>If your goal was to achieve a 20% speed-up compared to Sunny Cove, in one die shrink, the CW would be to make it a little wider and a little deeper but try to hit a boost clock well north of 5 GHz. It wouldn’t tell you to make it a third wider and twice as deep at the cost of <i>dropping</i> the boost clock by a third. Apple isn’t just enjoying a one-generation process advantage, but is hitting a significantly different point in the design space.')
