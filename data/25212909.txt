IIRC, it was the items they couldn&#x27;t update. So that is kind of a hack, but it works.<p>It would be ideal if it was host entirely on completely separate infrastructure, and even a separate domain, but I won&#x27;t hold my breath. Theirs is still more reliable than, for example, the IBM Cloud status page which was hard down during their epic outage back in June.')
