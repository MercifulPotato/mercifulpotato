Victims of mental illness may also feel emotional pain in ways that non-sufferers cannot comprehend. I have always had a &quot;tough guy&quot; mentality toward my feelings. I suppress them. I think when others know who I am or how I think it&#x27;s a weakness in business. Some leaders think its helpful. Either way, I don&#x27;t feel emotional pain the same way others feel it.<p>How do I know this? I&#x27;ve been around someone close to me who suffers from mental illness for most of my life. This is someone who can feel words in ways that most people feel getting shot. That person has been bed ridden for months because of something that was said to them years ago.<p>They didn&#x27;t choose to feel that way. They have tried therapy and drugs but to no avail so far.<p>They wish they didn&#x27;t feel that way but they do.<p>Criticizing this persons work, car, reactions, clothes, etc... will cause a massive disruption in their life.<p>If their information was leaked I can tell you they would seriously contemplate suicide over the public awareness.<p>I hope the people who released this rot in hell for what they did. They took some of the most vulnerable people and quite likely will cause them to snap causing that mental pain to release into others lives. Innocent people will suffer because of this data breach.')
