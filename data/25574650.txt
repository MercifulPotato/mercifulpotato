So you&#x27;re <i>&quot;Is it just that anything worth automating is worth specializing, and there are better robots for different specific tasks?&quot;</i> point is more or less it.<p>But also consider, while these bipedal, quadrupedal and wheeled robots can do all sorts of these in isolation, their ability to accomplish things autonomously in the chaotic, unstructured world outside the factory is little-to-none, accent on none. The Darpa Robitics challenge was essentially considered a failure, all entrant <i>failed</i>. Most could not do the &quot;walk to a door and open it&quot; challenge.<p>Similarly, Boston Dynamics sells their &quot;big dog&quot; walking robot to the military but it is seldom if ever deployed. It&#x27;s strong and faster than a horse with basically the use case as a pack horse. But well trained pack horse won&#x27;t injure if you get in front of it and will walk along with the troops on it&#x27;s own without a guy with joy stick directing it. And the Big Dog needs constant direction.<p>Basically, robots don&#x27;t have even the &quot;animal intelligence&quot; needed for real world activity.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;DARPA_Robotics_Challenge" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;DARPA_Robotics_Challenge</a>')
