I had a side job fixing computers for people, and it was always adware, viruses, etc messing things up.<p>Windows 10 isn&#x27;t perfect but it&#x27;s a much different time than multiple generations ago with Windows 95 &#x2F; 98, XP or even 7.<p>Back then you could visit a site and end up needing to format because of a virus, even if you were very much into tech.<p>Nowadays even if you disable Windows Defender and any active AV tool, it&#x27;s pretty unlikely you&#x27;ll get yourself to the point where you need to format due to a virus or some adware.<p>This is speaking from the perspective of someone who has been using Windows since the mid 1990s.')
