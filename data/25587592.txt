It was the #1 seller in the category, and had nearly 15,000 reviews and sat at 4.5 stars. It was cheap. Mine didn&#x27;t work. The box said it was 80 watts, but the included adaptor could only do 40 watts.<p>In the box was an offer for a $15 amazon gift card to give them a 5 star rating. I wrote a review on amazon, stating this. I got an email from amazon that my review had not been accepted this morning. I called amazon the previous night and the first person told me to &quot;contact the seller&quot;. It took a second person to tell me that blatantly bribing customers for reviews was against their policy. Clearly nothing will happen.<p>All I can think of is that the end user is no longer the customer for Amazon. They&#x27;re a platform for sellers, so the sellers are the new customers. Shame they never told the end users.')
