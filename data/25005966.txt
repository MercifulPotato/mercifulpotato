He was also arrogant as heck. The engineering team inherited his arrogance and it was quite an insufferable place to work. I left that company for a number of reasons, this was certainly one of them.<p>I get it. When I was young in startups a decade ago I was often called the rockstar or ninja. I was arrogant then too. It felt good. But it doesn&#x27;t do good for people who come into the company later. The culture is already toxic by the time the team is growing. Now that I&#x27;m older, I&#x27;m extremely mindful of this behavior now and make sure I don&#x27;t repeat these mistakes as a team lead.<p>There are tons of other tips and advice for this position too, but this was definitely the first thing to come to mind.')
