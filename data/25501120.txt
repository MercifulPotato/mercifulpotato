After a reorg, one of my colleagues on a different team (largely Master&#x27;s degrees in ML) told our new team member: &#x27;You shouldn&#x27;t be worried, being assigned to their team is an honor. They&#x27;re hardest to get into -- it&#x27;s full of people who didn&#x27;t just skip all the hard courses.&#x27;<p>In many ways, hiring advanced degree holders is a crapshoot. They have skills you probably can&#x27;t train, but often times come in with fewer software development skills than your undergrad intern, despite theoretically having more years of experience. You don&#x27;t need to know git to publish in IEEE, or write unit tests or readable code, or debug an edge case, and your only code reviewer is a professor who doesn&#x27;t care about this either. &#x27;Good enough to publish&#x27; is a far cry from &#x27;customers will pay for it.&#x27;')
