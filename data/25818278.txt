I don&#x27;t want everything to be &quot;secure web apps&quot;, I want to have native apps, and I want to have a choice of different platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux, etc.) each doing its own thing their way.<p>I don&#x27;t want to use Linux as my desktop because I don&#x27;t like their choices, the same way I don&#x27;t want to use Windows or macOS as my server, because I don&#x27;t like their choices.<p>&gt;<i>The future cannot be segregated by platforms</i><p>That&#x27;s a monoculture dystopia then, not a future where many competing ideas about what platforms can be, what OSes offer, what their core tenets are, etc. flourish.')
