That said, the Supreme Court also upheld forced sterilization of the mentally defective in the early 20th Century so I&#x27;m not at all sure 100-year old court cases would be expected to be upheld today.<p>I don&#x27;t really disagree with you in general. SWAT teams won&#x27;t be holding people down and injecting people by force. But the practical effect isn&#x27;t that different from a jurisdiction effectively requiring proof of vaccination to leave your house.')
