It also leaves Nio in charge of keeping the batteries up to date so your car won&#x27;t lose value over time like a 10 year old car with degraded batteries that won&#x27;t hold as much of a charge and take longer and longer to charge over time as the battery degrades and cost a heck of a lot to swap out. It costs about $16k[2] to get a Model 3 battery replaced. Nio is able to sell cars for about $10k cheaper by using swappable batteries.
