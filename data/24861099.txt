Apple apps tend to need regular updates to stay valid&#x2F;relevant over long periods of time and early on Apple had a lot of &quot;abandoned&quot; apps in the app store - subscriptions 1) keep the app developer funded&#x2F;engaged 2) keep the user hooked &#x2F; showing explicit value or bailing.<p>Fwiw, I agree, I am getting tired of the pervasiveness of subscription models, but I assume they are making good sense business wise.')
