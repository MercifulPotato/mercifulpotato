Looks more that she is abusing you.<p>I was married to a woman who behaved in a similar fashion. Calling me during work days for ridiculous reasons. Never satisfied. Needed constant attention. Took all disagreements as personal attacks. Needy, prickly, never thankful to anyone.

Try to speak to a professional if you believe she is narcistic. But NPS is (almost) not treatable. So the only solution is to leave if she is narcistic.<p>Luckily I managed that our kids stayed with me after separation. And for the kids protection, don&#x27;t leave the kid with her when you leave.
