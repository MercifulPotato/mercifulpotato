We have a section on pricing philosophy on our pricing page that explains this in a little more detail.<p>Just curious about this model, but if you keep only the essential features on the developer plan (good for startups but not much above that), while the enterprise plan requires more complicated features and SDKs that you may not be able to provide just yet because it would be expensive at this stage, wouldn&#x27;t it be a catch-22 situation of sorts?')
