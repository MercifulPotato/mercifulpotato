A bit sweet, but aptly named (&quot;cotton candy grapes&quot;). They taste eerily like cotton candy the same way that a cotton candy Jelly Belly does. Kids love them of course. The company’s &quot;gum drop&quot; and &quot;moon drop&quot; grapes are _amazing_.<p>They also sell something called &quot;rosé strawberries&quot; but I haven&#x27;t found them on the east coast yet.')
