Is it possible you are?)<p>- the link you posted only talks about police report, which is a source incredibly biased. Police reports are known to be falsified to protect the police and cover their abuses.<p>- we don&#x27;t even kill mobsters and still we have almost zero killings by the police and ten times less homicides per unit of population of US. It is entirely possible if you live in a developed country that is able to produce a civilized society. US is arguably incapable of doing that.<p>- in the end you support he idea that the only way for people of colour to not be shot and killed by the police is, using your metaphor, to avoid swimming . Which is called segregation. That&#x27;s why from a distance we look at US in horror. Because US is a scary society, not only for people of colour, but especially for minorities like people of colour, which are American, have been for centuries, but are not considered as such.<p>You should see a black American shot dead by the police as an American shot by the police. You still see at him like someone who&#x27;s dead because he dared to swim.')
