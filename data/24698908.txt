It&#x27;s very dangerously good at it. Facebook has also turned a blind eye to its platform being used to organize politically-motivated violence.<p>It needs to be heavily regulated or shut down completely.<p>.<p>.<p>That said, I don&#x27;t expect Washington to break up the tech giants. Meaningful anti-trust enforcement has not happened in decades and would go against very long standing, but unspoken, precedents against Washington harming large piles of money. Any action taken by the government would likely be for show (in no small part to pander to conservative fears over platform bias, and possibly to extract superficial concessions from the tech sector on this front), and would be very unlikely to survive the post-Trump Supreme Court intact.')
