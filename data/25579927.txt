Item(by='beaunative', descendants=None, kids=[25581075], score=None, time=1609318595, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25574439, text='Well, if this due process means some opaque process that government employs to put people in those &quot;camps&quot; then by literal meaning there is a process, and it&#x27;s done through that process.<p>Yet I&#x27;d say that&#x27;s very different from due process that we&#x27;d like to call it. In the very least the process itself should be well-documented and published, even if specific cases files are not available online for everyone. That&#x27;s the very reason why the government called it re-education camps, because the government, even in Chinese context, should only act in the framework that laws defined, and in this case, they are not.<p>I suspect that the Chinese government and the local Xinjiiang government expected criticism, and they are well-aware the policy is not ideal or just, and that&#x27;s why they wouldn&#x27;put it into  laws, because they are well-aware it would be impossible to pass. Since they can&#x27;t identify who&#x27;s terrorist, they round up every likely target, and put them under surveiliance just for caution. It should be said it was effective in achiving their goal, and they are aware of the collateral damage, but it&#x27;s the cost they think they can afford.')
