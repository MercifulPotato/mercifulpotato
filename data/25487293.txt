That&#x27;s why you have ARM chips from different companies. The difference with Apple was they are a majority share holder so they probably were able to fully retain rights. Seeing how successful Apple has been with their own chips, I guess Microsoft&#x27;s taken it as a green light. What&#x27;s sad is Microsoft&#x27;s been pushing towards ARM for what feels like forever but it hasn&#x27;t been up to part with x86. If I can honestly buy a Surface Book with ARM and still get a beefy laptop for a fraction of the cost I will happily buy the most expensive model. I also kind of hope this inspires them to work on Windows Mobile again in the future. They just need it to not lag too far behind Windows 10&#x27;s core, which I heard was an issue from Windows 7 Mobile to Windows 8 Mobile (there was 0 upgrade path &#x2F; it was a mess to upgrade).')
