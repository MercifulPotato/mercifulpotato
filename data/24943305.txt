It sounds a lot like the comment was arguing that people should do as much as the article&#x27;s author before they are allowed to &quot;pick it apart&quot;. That&#x27;s lazy thinking to me, &quot;that person has done a lot, don&#x27;t you dare criticize their article&quot;. And that, mind you, before anyone had even pulled apart the point, it&#x27;s some kind of pre-emptive argument to authority.')
