They are a response to years of harassment and unprofessional behavior at conferences. Conferences have always had a list of rules to follow and breaking the rules could get you ejected from the conference. In theory all a CoC should do is codify some bad behaviors that people believe to be acceptable but are actually not, so in that regard they shouldn&#x27;t be controversial.<p>You hit the nail on the head though: if the people enforcing the conference rules don&#x27;t act in good faith or don&#x27;t follow the rules then the rules don&#x27;t matter.<p>In theory a conference could just have a rule that says &quot;act professionally&quot; and if properly enforced that would be sufficient. On the flip side such a conference could have a petty tyrant rules lawyer for an enforcer and decide anyone they don&#x27;t like was not acting &quot;professionally&quot;.<p>There is no outside body that could (or should) be adjudicators. Conferences live and die by their reputation. All we can do is judge them by their actions.')
