I had a friend in high school who offered to mod my ps1. He put in some sort of mod chip and had to solder things if I remember correctly. He later on inspired me to attempt things like that myself. I mean he was some 15 year old kid soldering mod chips on peoples ps1. I always thought that was cool. Fast forward 15 years and I was doing the same to xbox 360. I don&#x27;t condone piracy but I also have 2 ps4 games that have stopped reading for me. I wouldn&#x27;t feel bad if I could play a ripped copy of the game I already bought.')
