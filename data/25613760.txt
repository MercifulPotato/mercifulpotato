Very silly and contrived, but for my son... who’d not seen it before, it was riveting before the ending. He tried to make sense of it, and I assured him, aside from Easter eggs, trying to make the movie make sense would be folly. As an example of a film maker in command though, it’s a good example of the director playing the audience like a fiddle.')
