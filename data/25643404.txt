It was a hypothetical choice between 2 models, with ECC or LEDs, at the same price. Hypothetical because most boards don&#x27;t offer the ECC support at all, and certainly not at the same price.<p>&gt; LEDs are a great opportunity to increase profit margin, so I&#x27;m not sure about your price conclusions<p>You confused manufacturing costs, price of the product, and profit margins. LEDs cost far less to integrate than ECC but command a higher price premium (thus better profit margins) from the regular consumer. Again supporting my statement that even if presented with 2 absolutely identical parts save for ECC vs. LEDs the vast majority of consumers will go for LEDs because they don&#x27;t care or know about ECC.')
