But &#x27;Docker&#x27; in this case refers to the runtime that Kubernetes uses to run container images on servers (&#x27;nodes&#x27;) where the UI&#x2F;UX features of Docker (like it&#x27;s CLI, image building capabilities, etc.) are not needed.<p>Container images nowadays can be built by a variety of tools, and run by a variety of tools, with Docker likely being the most popular end-user tool with the most history and name recognition. Others like Podman&#x2F;Buildah are differently-architected replacements.<p>As long as a container meets the open container specs, it can be built with whatever tool and run on whatever tool that also follows the specs.')
