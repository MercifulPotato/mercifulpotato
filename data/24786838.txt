Free speech in an empty room is not interesting. Free speech before the press is not like free speech after. Free speech now is not like it was in the 90s. Youtube and fb genuinely created a lot more freedom of speech in practice. They also monopolize it.<p>Lets not pretend that there aren&#x27;t costs, regardless of what way this happens.<p>That said, a world where the public, advertisers and politicians lobby a beseech youtube to restrict speech is a nasty one. This is going to be ugly.')
