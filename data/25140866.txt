Item(by='4pple33', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605725990, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25137202, text='I&#x27;m definitely considered a part of this generation of kids that grew up on the Iphone, and though I disagree with this blog on a lot of areas (as listed in the top comments), there definitely are things that this blog really hits home for.<p>Iphones and social media are a vice on my generation.  I used social media a lot a few years ago, but I had to quit it because I learned about nosurf[1] and how horrible for the mind these new technologies can be.  However, many people I know are stuck in this addiction - scrolling on Instagram 4+ hours a day, sending streaks[2] to 10 people at once on Snapchat, who screw up their sleep schedule just to get another anime episode in.  They obsess over the number of likes they get on each post and send empty platitudes to each other on their birthdays.  Of course these things I just listed are not the fault of each and every person, but a product of what happens when you bring together a billion dollar company who wants people to spend as much time on their app as possible, and an impressionable generation whose brains haven&#x27;t even finished developing yet.<p>From reading this, you may come to the conclusion that I&#x27;m some jaded teenager who hates technology and social media.  But I understand the magnitude of technology and the potential it brings.  I&#x27;d say I&#x27;m much more not only intelligent but wiser because of the countless podcasts, debates, lectures, articles, and music I&#x27;ve consumed in my &#x27;internet life&#x27;.  But that is beside the point - This parent&#x27;s experience sent a chill down my spine because it is almost exactly how my parents must have felt when I got my first phone.  We originally had a contract (not using it after 10, not using it in bed, etc.) but little by little my addictive brain pushed those boundaries, and when I didn&#x27;t get what I wanted I had tantrums.  And though I&#x27;ve curbed on my screen time (at least on my phone), There&#x27;s always that pull, always that invisible string that attaches me to my phone.  I guess what I&#x27;m trying to say here is that this experience that this parent had with her child almost exactly mirrors my parent&#x27;s experience with me, and most likely many, many other parents.')
