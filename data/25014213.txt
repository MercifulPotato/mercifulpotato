And sensors to do this already exist so no &quot;newness&quot; in this field.\nI mean sure, if they were talking about it being included for consumer usage in everyday mobile devices, then maybe thats a new thing? But the wording of that phrase seems to want to credit Apple for something newly coined or invented, which isnt the case')
