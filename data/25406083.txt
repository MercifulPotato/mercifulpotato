If the goal is to reduce overall traffic victims, then investing in speed control seems like the low hanging fruit.<p>The energy of vehicle (thus, the energy absorbed during impact by every object contained or hit) is proportinal with the square of the speed. Meanwhile, the reaction time available to avoid the collision drops linearly with speed, while the braking or turn distance increases more than linearly.<p>So the overall probability of accidents and their severity increases exponentially with speed.')
