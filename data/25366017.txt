I have wanted to do this for awhile and I think now it is more important than ever.  My views are for the most part what one would label as &quot;liberal&quot; as opposed to &quot;conservative&quot; in the common but highly reductive US political terms.  My social media bubble is an echo chamber so I only ever see strawman arguments in opposition.  I don&#x27;t talk about politics with co-workers for the same reason I don&#x27;t talk about sports or religion---it never ends well!<p>I want to meet smart people with politically different views who are also interested in healthy debate.  By &quot;healthy&quot; I mean you should both expect and extend respect for each other&#x27;s right to hold our opinions.  I would not be trying to &quot;convert&quot; anyone to my point of view.  I will be open-minded enough to admit to not having all the answers.  I will commit to logical, well-reasoned discussion.  Argumentation can be heated, but personal attacks are off limits.  I genuinely want to understand how other people think, especially those who have come to different views about topics than I have.<p>I would prefer a 1:1 format, or perhaps a small group discussion board.  Real time video would probably be best to promote honest discourse due to the human connection, but might be logistically difficult to arrange, and I also want both sides to have time to think before preparing responses.<p>Any interest?')
