Here I am, in the mid-west, working for a manufacturing company, as a programmer&#x2F;sysadmin&#x2F;devop in an engineering department, with 25 years of experience, making almost the top end of what&#x27;s possible for a non-managerial role, and my salary is NOTHING like that. I just worked with 2 of the world&#x27;s leading experts in my field -- they literally wrote and created systems to implement the government spec which governs most of our work -- and learned that their salaries -- while staggering in this industry -- weren&#x27;t even half of this. Sometimes I look at this disparity, and want to take a crack at switching industries, but, frankly, it&#x27;s intimidating. I guess it&#x27;s 25 years of conditioning. In old-school manufacturing companies, $400K is VP-level pay. There&#x27;s probably only a couple dozen people making that at my 30K-employee company. And here you are telling me that it&#x27;s just a &quot;standard rate&quot; for a devop with 10 years of experience. The difference in worlds is hard to wrap my head around.')
