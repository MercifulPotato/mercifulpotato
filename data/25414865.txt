Looks like the Bluetooth is on separate hardware here; lsusb reports it as a &quot;Foxconn &#x2F; Hon Hai&quot; chipset.<p>I don&#x27;t really use BT for anything, so I can&#x27;t comment on its quality.  WiFi has been completely fine, though.  Either way, I believe both the WiFi and BT hardware are soldered in on this model.')
