Don&#x27;t add anything more than the positioning of each element in the layout, along with their respective sizes.<p>After you&#x27;ve nailed layouts you can start learning to style components.<p>But start by learning how each element behave by default without styling ex. how input fields behave across browsers, along with their default properties etc. - It&#x27;s very useful when you need to style elements that have different default styling across browsers etc.<p>When you understand the default behavior of elements then you should start by learning how to make the most basic form of elements the same across all browsers by ex. changing default values to something that works across all browsers.<p>At this point you&#x27;re able to start styling your components entirely from blank and your styling will be the exact same across all browsers.<p>So this is where the fun begins. You should take one component at a time and think about how you want it to look and then break its &quot;look&quot; into parts like size, color, shadow, font, borders, positions, behavior etc.<p>Then simply start styling the component with one part at a time. Do not look up how to create specific components etc. (Like don&#x27;t take a class from SO and just apply that and try to understand it.) instead learn the required rules to style a component in the way you want with as little properties as possible.<p>Repeating that for all the components on your site will give you a pretty good all-around grasp on CSS.')
