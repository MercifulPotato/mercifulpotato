And the war on drugs.  And blue laws.  And the existence of borders, and the notion of citizenship.<p>No, freedom has <i>many</i> limitations.  Some of those limitations are justified by reducing or punishing harm to others.  Some are justified by reducing or punishing harm to self.  Some are naked authoritarianism.<p>We have a president who&#x27;s a proud authoritarian who literally celebrates violence against the press and summary executions by the police.  He&#x27;s spreading virulent disinformation with the <i>express intent</i> to overrule the will of the people, and he&#x27;s consistently signalling that insurrection is the remedy to his failure to do so.  Does your &quot;no &#x27;buts&#x27; regarding freedom&quot; go so far as to tear down democracy in favor of a would-be dictator&#x27;s &quot;freedom&quot; to commit treason?')
