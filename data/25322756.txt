What outcome are you wishing for?<p>as an amicable prompt to find a way to solve a trifling matter in a short time.<p>I mean, the &quot;professional way&quot; has nothing to do with managing to escalate to the CEO (how exactly did you manage to get his e-mail?).<p>Besides, a sentence like &quot;I will seek other means to recover the money owed.&quot; is ambiguous enough to be easily read as a threat, as there may be &quot;other means&quot; that are not legal.<p>So - still as I read it - you hassle the CEO of a company, and Mr. Herscu is tasked to understand what the issue is about, and as soon as he finds out that the matter can be solved with paying 88 US$ he pays, problem solved.')
