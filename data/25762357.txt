One that I can think of is to have a profile of what a normal sounding manufacturing floor is or lathe, mill, any machine that operates. If the sound profile changes you might be able to distinguish what component is failing on that machinery. This could possibly be extended to listening to organisms or ecosystems like the human biome to identify problems.<p>I know other tech might exist in this but I find the possible uses for this fascinating.')
