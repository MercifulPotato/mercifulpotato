They literally only fund startups whose only goal is to artificially launder revenue to corporations. For example, the startups load themselves up with debt and then they waste it all on Google or Facebook ads. Then they get acqui-hired just before they go bust so that the founders keep their mouths shut. Then the corporation shuts down the startup&#x27;s product...<p>They never cared about the startup or its product.')
