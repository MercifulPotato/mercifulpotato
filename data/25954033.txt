I&#x27;m open to it but X never really bothered me.  My setup on Ubuntu Mate just works how I like it.  I don&#x27;t really screen share.  Never edited xorg.conf either, although I did fight with xfree86.conf many times decades ago.<p>I think I tried stock fedora a year or two back to try Wayland but didn&#x27;t like gnome 3, so didn&#x27;t stick with it.
