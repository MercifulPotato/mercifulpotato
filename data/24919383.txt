C++ takes forever to learn (basically, it never ends) and people have <i>VERY</i> different senses of what &quot;clean&quot; C++ code is like.<p>And for that matter, even the same person might write in different styles depending on the situation. And the same exact style might be terrible for one situation but awesome for another.<p>With all that said, one &quot;good&quot; kind of codebase to at least <i>know</i> (even if you can&#x27;t emulate it) is the kind of codebase that is modeled after the C++ standard library. Some Boost libraries (not all!) are great examples of this. Probably the best example I can think of off the top of my head is Boost.Container:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.boost.org&#x2F;doc&#x2F;libs&#x2F;1_74_0&#x2F;boost&#x2F;container&#x2F;vector.hpp" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.boost.org&#x2F;doc&#x2F;libs&#x2F;1_74_0&#x2F;boost&#x2F;container&#x2F;vector...</a><p>Note that this does <i>not</i> mean <i>you</i> should write code like this for your applications, though. Boost is heavyweight with the templates&#x2F;headers&#x2F;macros and these classes are meant to be extremely generic. Your application-level code does not necessarily need to meet the same types of constraints, and it&#x27;s just not worth the effort in most cases (as well as being slower to compile). But if you <i>can</i> write this kind of code when it&#x27;s warranted, it ends up being very high-quality. (Some parts of this involve a lot of difficult work, like paying attention to exception-safety, that is often unnecessary. Other parts are quite simple and well worth picking up, e.g. liberal use of typedefs. And everything else in between.)<p>A more typical example of a codebase might be some of wxWidgets, e.g.:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wxWidgets&#x2F;wxWidgets&#x2F;blob&#x2F;v3.1.4&#x2F;src&#x2F;generic&#x2F;listctrl.cpp" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wxWidgets&#x2F;wxWidgets&#x2F;blob&#x2F;v3.1.4&#x2F;src&#x2F;gener...</a><p>It&#x27;s not in the style of the standard library (so you won&#x27;t find it to be as generic, exception-safe, etc.) but it&#x27;s pretty decent.')
