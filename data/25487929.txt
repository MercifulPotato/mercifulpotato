US and EU are day and night in terms of taxing and social system. In the US you have next to no income tax, much less public transport and social services. For this, in EU, you earn 50-70% of what you can read about in Valley blogs, but you get all this, and you don&#x27;t have to think about it. I think it&#x27;s a way, way better system, and I gladly earn less in return. (Note: In US maybe you get some of the above on a company benefit at FAANG-ish level, but then you depend on your employer for it).')
