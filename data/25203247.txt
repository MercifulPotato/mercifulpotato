I wonder if you guys have some creative algorithmic ways to go about this.<p>Recently I have noticed that I built up quite a sizeable unorganized collection of songs I listen to regularly, used to listen to, or situational songs.<p>Here is my strategy, first I dumped everything into &#x2F;Unclassified&#x2F; (which is also where new music is initially added).\nFrom there if I noticed I have more than ~3 songs per artists, I dumped that into &#x2F;{ArtistName}&#x2F; playlist.\nIf the number of songs per artist was large I further split that into &#x2F;{ArtistName}&#x2F;{Category}. \nFor example &#x2F;{ArtistName}&#x2F;{AlbumName}, &#x2F;{ArtistName}&#x2F;Singles New, &#x2F;{ArtistName}&#x2F;Singles Old etc..<p>From there I tried to organize those more for the mood &#x2F; situation &#x2F; thematically. This is proving somewhat challenging.\nTo make matters more complicated the music I listen to is split across 4 languages Russian, English, Finnish and Polish.\nSo far the more successful playlists are &#x2F;Russia&#x2F;Disco, &#x2F;Russia&#x2F;Doomer, &#x2F;Disco Polo&#x2F;.<p>I had a &#x2F;Chill&#x2F; playlist which ended up growing very fast, and as a result a lot of songs in it just didn&#x27;t belong in the same playlist.\nSo I have split them into &#x2F;Chill&#x2F;Laid Back and &#x2F;Chill&#x2F;Uplifting but I feel like this isn&#x27;t it.\nI think I need &#x2F;Chill&#x2F;X, &#x2F;Chill&#x2F;Y, &#x2F;Chill&#x2F;Z.. but I don&#x27;t know what the X, Y, Z should be.<p>Anyway would be very interested to hear how you organize your playlists.')
