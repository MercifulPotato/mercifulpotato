Then when you are experiencing some tough negative emotions you can&#x27;t express&#x2F;talk about them and then your secondary emotions come in from this frustration. What emotion that is is personal but often men will go to anger, &quot;it&#x27;s think it&#x27;s this thing that is causing me pain so that thing is bad&#x2F;stupid&#x2F;wrong&quot; but all along it was your own feelings coming from your own unmet needs that you could have handled yourself if you just had could have named and reasoned about them.')
