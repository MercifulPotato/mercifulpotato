If HN isn&#x27;t the right place for this, I&#x27;d appreciate any suggestions on where to look.<p>Recently,  I had an interview where a tech lead condescendingly commented on my &quot;lack of web app experience&quot;, which upped my anxiety around feeling stuck. I&#x27;m currently a web developer for a small agency, building marketing websites for clients. I have eight years of experience building websites and web apps for small companies and startups.<p>While I enjoy web development, I really want to shift to product management.<p>I&#x27;ve boiled down my available paths to the following:<p>1. Focus on learning algorithms for interviews, get an engineering job at a larger software company, and hopefully find an opportunity to shift into a PM role. The increase in remote positions has made this more possible recently, but I&#x27;m not convinced I&#x27;d get the right opportunities to shift to PM.\n2. Apply for PM roles at a generic tech consulting company. It could mean soulless projects at a nameless subsidiary for a few years.\n3. Find a startup that needs an engineering lead who can also PM. This worked for me in the past, but there are fewer companies these days that need that sort of help. \n4. Start my own thing. Hoping this results in a company that can pay me a salary, or at least the experience I can write about to get a job at a different company.<p>My main concern right now is that the most viable paths might not result in the right opportunities to switch, and I&#x27;ll feel just as stuck in two years as I do now.<p>Anyway, I guess my question is, what are the best ways for an engineer to switch towards product management, given their current role doesn&#x27;t (and won&#x27;t) offer any opportunity for relevant experience?')
