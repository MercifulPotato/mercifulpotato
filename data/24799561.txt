Do you put the dog in prison for patent infringement? Do you kill the babies?<p>It&#x27;s the same as if your dog attacks someone - even if it&#x27;s &quot;in their breed&quot; it doesn&#x27;t matter, you as the owner are responsible for its actions. If the dog is particularly aggressive it might be destroyed though.')
