Switching emails over varied greatly between services. Sometimes it all just worked and my new email would sign in to my account and my email address on the service was updated automatically. Some allowed me to sign in fine, but I had to contact them directly to update the email address. A number of times I ended up having to go through recovery processes.<p>I guess at least if you’re using your own domain, you’d be able to repoint mx records to do the recovery.<p>I tend not to use it for my personal accounts, but honestly, Google Sign In for our work systems has generally been a good experience. Works well for our small team, anyway.')
