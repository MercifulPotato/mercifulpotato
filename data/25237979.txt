Rarely does Amazon have the best price anymore.<p>I find their delivery times dropping..  Last order, I ordered and paided more for same day rush.. that came by the end of the next day instead.  They gave a $10 coupon but I literally picked the product based on it arriving that day and would have made a different purchasing choose if I knew it was coming tomorrow.')
