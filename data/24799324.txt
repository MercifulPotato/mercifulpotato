The only GPU feature of Renderman is a post denoising filter, which will otherwise happily fall back to CPU.<p>&gt; An OS architecture that doesn&#x27;t do DMA for maximum hardware performance just isn&#x27;t up to the game.<p>DMA has no effect on Renderman.<p>At this point, based on this history of this thread, I&#x27;ll have to conclude that you have no idea what you&#x27;re talking about at all.')
