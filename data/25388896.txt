Item(by='nr2x', descendants=None, kids=[25389177], score=None, time=1607711155, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25388040, text='I think if a device is a professional tool, as in a studio monitoring headphone one would wear while doing music production or mastering, it&#x27;s not obscene.  That said, these have no such use case, the lack of a wire means: a) latency that isn&#x27;t acceptable, and b) inability to master with high sample rates.<p>These definitely are in the &quot;gadget&quot; rather than &quot;tool&quot; category, and while there may be worse things to spend money on, or better ways to distribute wealth, I won&#x27;t disagree that these headphones belong in the same category as Gucci handbags.')
