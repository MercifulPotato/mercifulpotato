When you said this I wondered if it would be a good way to stop using Reddit. Then I remembered like generations ago I tried to stop using some website by making it hard to visit. Blocked it in the hosts file and everything.<p>One day I stopped what I was doing and looked at what it was. I was on the website I&#x27;d blocked. The way I&#x27;d done it was I&#x27;d forwarded the Xserver from a dedicated server I was running elsewhere and was browsing on a remote Konqueror or Epiphany or some shit.<p>It taught me something interesting about my Akrasia - the problem isn&#x27;t a lack of focus on a specific task. It was a task choice problem and a long-term incentive awareness problem. I wasn&#x27;t even aware I&#x27;d done all of these things to access the site I&#x27;d blocked. I&#x27;d auto-piloted through them. Fascinating.')
