And then there are all the RFCs and notes you need to also read and understand, and then you realize that the real spec seems to be Google’s implementation... that at least was how things felt in 2018. They totally might have progressed since then.<p>Yes, you can pick from the WebRTC buffet and build a good ingest protocol, but you need a lot of knowledge to do that - I would guess a tiny tiny number of people who read your comment know what DTLS or even STUN are.<p>I also agree that there is a branding problem, but I think part of it is that we don’t have a good name for this WebRTC ingest pattern. It deserves a name and some attempt at standardization so tools and software can start building towards it without supporting everything in WebRTC.<p>Because yeah, I think its the least-bad thing we have right now.<p>I think you must be the same Sean-Der who works on the Go WebRTC library? Thanks a ton - that’s serious open source work.')
