I would obviously return the money because this is such a &quot;lazy idea&quot; but if everyone did this we would see CO2 go down. The reason why it has to be done in this roundabout way is that apparently nobody except me likes the idea of a CO2 tax.<p>Maybe this grant is enough to employ eastern European researchers though.')
