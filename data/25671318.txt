The core (ventilator algorithm) is implemented on the STM32F411, there is just a serial link in-between.<p>The STM32 also monitor the Raspberry... If there is no heartbeat on the serial link, the STM32 shuts down the power supply of the raspberry, and ventilation goes on.<p>The fact is that it never happens yet during our tests (4 months uptime now for some devices). The ArchLinux is restricted to the bare minimum, and the Rust app do not overheat the CPU. Is it by chance, or not ? Before any MTBF conclusion, you need thousands of units running during months...<p>On another project of medical datalogger, I also put a little arduino as hardware watchdog. If no heartbeat of the main application, it just resets the Rpi.<p>I also use industrial SD card, which are far more reliable and provide SMART informations.
