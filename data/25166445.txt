Cutting the power or resetting the Pi seems to result in relatively frequent data corruption, and I&#x27;ve also ended up with several unusable SD cards.<p>However, switching to a read-only SD card and a RAM file system seemed to eliminate the file system corruption and SD card damage I&#x27;d been seeing in my Raspberry Pi-based design. No problem with power cycling the thing.')
