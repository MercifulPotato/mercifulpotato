Either you don&#x27;t\nplay the &quot;ministry of information&quot; role and have to live with\nthe fact that eventually your platform will turn into a more\nchaotic 4chan, or you start removing particularly excessive\ncontent at which point you crossed the only line that can be\nclearly defined.<p>This is one of the reasons I think old-school forums are\nsuperior in terms of &quot;web hygiene&quot;. You have a group of\nmoderators, each responsible for a clearly defined section and a\nuserbase small enough so rules are still enforceable. And the\npeople running it are not an untouchable megacorporation.')
