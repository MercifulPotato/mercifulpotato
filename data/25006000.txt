Item(by='pietrovismara', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604651168, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25005870, text='&gt;There is this weird trend I noticed on HN. Whenever the subject of money comes up, people start casually quoting Bay Area numbers like they are representative of the industry as a whole. I don&#x27;t think they are.<p>Americans (and capitalist supporters -usually people without a real capital-) are fixated with raw amounts of money. It&#x27;s very different from European culture, where we usually consider many other factors as quality of life first.<p>Also they tend to consider us as poor. I&#x27;ve been told several times in conversations &quot;nobody can afford iPhones in Europe&quot; and other nonsense like that. Hey at least I never had to worry about getting medical treatment. I can perfectly afford a stupid iPhone if I want but there are much more important factors in life than &quot;how many gadget can you afford to buy?&quot;')
