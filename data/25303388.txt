It&#x27;s not hard to find studies showing that Mondays and Fridays saw a disproportionate number (i.e. not just 20%) of single day sick days. And, I&#x27;m sure, the pattern wasn&#x27;t spread evenly across everyone.<p>Personally, although I&#x27;ve fortunately had much need to take an appreciable number of sick days, I favor them being separate because as others note, especially with a relatively limited pool of PTO days, there&#x27;s a lot of incentive to work sick.')
