Item(by='fennecfoxen', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607733915, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25393657, text='&gt; This is all the result of confusing 1st amendment rights with the right to access the audience that gathers at a particular URL.<p>No one is confused. The article mentions neither the First Amendment nor the Constitution. It only calls the matter &quot;un-American.&quot; This phrase is clearly a value statement, not some neutral and dispassionate assessment.<p>The line you draw to separate the government from the private sector is quite useful in other contexts, but does not affect the matter before us today. After all, in a democracy (which the Constitution aspires to be) the ideal of free speech itself must proceed from shared cultural values; if those values change enough, we might also expect the First Amendment to be repealed anyway.<p>Of course YouTube of course is not required to represent these purportedly-American values; just as surely, it may be criticized as &quot;un-American&quot; by those promulgating such values. A much more interesting argument would assess the extent to which the values in question are, in fact, American, whether YouTube&#x27;s choices are more representative (surely there&#x27;s a case for this) or simply more desirable (I note many here agree with them) -- and whether American (or &quot;American&quot;) values can coexist with these YouTube values.')
