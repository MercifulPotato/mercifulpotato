I had a difficulty making friends. I got really bad grades in school. Got in fights.  Made me depressed and I thought something was broken with me.<p>You can start with 5mg and then ramp up from there.  I&#x27;m on 15mg.  I can&#x27;t really feel 5m and 20mg is far too much.<p>At lower doses they won&#x27;t really have any side effects and then you can keep them on for 90-120 days to see how they tolerate it.')
