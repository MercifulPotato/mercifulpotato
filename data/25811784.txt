I can easily counter yours with mine:<p>I use such a dongle a lot whenever I am presenting on conferences etc, and have been doing so for many years (even before the all-out for USB-C&#x2F;Thunderbolt on MacBooks, there were no VGA ports, while many projectors still were; now I see a lot of HDMI, but still need the adaptor).<p>And I habe yet to have a single issue caused by that! Sure, damaged VGA cables and other weirdness, but never ever anything tracing back to the dongle.<p>In the same time I helped lots of people who struggled with their laptops with builtin VGA&#x2F;HDMI Granted, usually not the laptops fault but rather PEBKAC &#x2F; or people not knowing how to control Windows &#x2F; Linux. Doesn&#x27;t really matter: my point is that I see zero correlation between dongle usage and projector troubles.')
