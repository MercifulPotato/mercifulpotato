We have four different locations and four numbers that customers can call or text. We employ a remote operations team that handles the calls and texts.<p>I have spent hours searching for a simple service that can offer an online dashboard for texting and calling, and a phone app to receive calls on.<p>We are currently using Google Voice which is terrible (I cannot tell which number&#x2F;location is being called when I receive a call among other quirks).<p>I have trialed Grasshopper and Dialpad, both terrible online dashboards for texting. Horrible UI and the call quality is poor. Grasshopper doesn&#x27;t allow someone from abroad log in to the dashboard.<p>How has this problem not been fixed yet? What is so difficult about calling and texting on the internet?')
