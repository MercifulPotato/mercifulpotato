Attract more smart people, make it so young people can have lives and become doctors.<p>That might address the cost of labor.  The cost of medicine on the other hand is simple, the government should be funding research into medicines and then offering it for sale at basically the cost of production.  Only other way is to reform patents and whatnot, but it seems easier to just do the research with the top tier research facilities the US already has via the higher education system.<p>Thereâ€™s probably some other issues such as tort reform and medical equipment costs that need to be address too.  But I think all prices can be brought down by increasing supply.')
