Given the amount of energy stored in the system, this is a <i>LOT</i> of juice to have flowing down a wire.<p>Now imagine that it&#x27;s about that time of day when a bunch of cars get parked curbside, and plug in to the &quot;new&quot; charging infrastructure. I don&#x27;t know the numbers, I think we&#x27;re talking about insane current levels, meaning insane wire sizes being buried in the street.<p>Anyone know anything about this?')
