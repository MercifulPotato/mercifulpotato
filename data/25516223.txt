But at one point in the early 90s my dad got an offer to move to SoCal and we went out, I remember visiting schools and stuff, but we never actually went ahead with the move.<p>Apparently while we were there my dad witnessed the car in front of him being robbed at gunpoint, but decided perhaps that was a one off, don&#x27;t tell the family, perhaps it&#x27;s fine... then the exact same thing happened the next night at nearly the same spot.<p>So that was the end of my potential US childhood.')
