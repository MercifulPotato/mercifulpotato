I use the cloud at employer&#x27;s behest, but I don&#x27;t put my personal anything in the cloud that I don&#x27;t have to. No, I do not have anything to hide. It&#x27;s more of I have seen too many instances of services getting shut down, or deciding they don&#x27;t want to offer that service, or just plain going out of business to trust anything to a 3rd party. That&#x27;s before even deciding if they are able to maintain security and privacy.')
