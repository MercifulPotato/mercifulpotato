Teach people to think for themselves, critical reading,logic and analysis. This is the best inoculation against totalitarianism.<p>I agree that education is one of the best ways to combat this problem. I don&#x27;t necessarily agree it&#x27;s the best one.<p>&gt; Not that much has changed, except that people now rely on centralized, AI-driven funnels of information and entertainment.<p>There&#x27;s no reason why middle grounds don&#x27;t exist. We can guarantee Free Speech without everyone having access to Instagram, FB, Twitter...<p>I bet most of the problems could be solved by making these platforms pay to use. Moderation loads would get reduced significantly. Excessive tracking would stop (because now ads are way harder to justify). Accounts would NEED to be somewhat verified by a payment, which makes it harder for trolls&#x2F;manipulators&#x2F;abusers of the platform to hide new accounts etc.')
