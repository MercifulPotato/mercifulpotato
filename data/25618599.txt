It makes no causal predictions; others may make predictions about correlations, and these may replicate, or not.<p>I remember struggling with feelings I would describe similarly when being taught how to fit an ARMA model to the stock market. Professor was very proud of himself and I was baffled about why he&#x27;d thought he&#x27;d done something. Eventually I decided maybe such models serve a function in academics very similar to a compression algorithm. The end goal is simply to be able to describe the data without having to present the data line by line - nothing more. No predictive or support in decision making is implied.<p>The Big 5 model looks like it is a lot better than nothing. &quot;Do you normally feel good?&quot; and &quot;Do you normally feel joyful?&quot; are different questions, but determining when they are practically different requires a deep mastery of the language.<p>Mr. Banana makes some good criticisms and the model will probably be abused to justify some stupid stuff out in the wild as many things in psychology are. But for academic sense, being replicable is all the model needs to do unless someone comes up with something clearly better.')
