I&#x27;m not sure I see how the catcher&#x27;s mitt helps. Didn&#x27;t the legs and platform already have to hold the static weight of a fully loaded Heavy plus a fully loaded Starship, and now it just has to hold up a mostly empty Heavy plus whatever delta V or delta H at rocket cutoff...  Is that more than the empty&#x2F;full weight differential?')
