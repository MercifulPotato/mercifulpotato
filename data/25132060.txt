The other top grantors of undergraduate degrees to the Chinese elite include Renmin University, Nanjing University, the Central Party School, and the National Defense University.  The majority of the CCP elite graduated from one of the over one hundred lesser known universities in China.  Although in recent years, many have pursued graduate degrees, fewer than one hundred have obtained their master degrees from Peking U, Tsinghua, or Renmin, whereas 132 of the elite obtained master degrees from the Central Party School.  Even among the elite born after 1962, only a small share obtained bachelors or masters from Peking, Tsinghua, or Renmin.<p>That&#x27;s surprising, given the geographic concentration of the birth place of CCP elites outlined later in the article.<p>What does this tell us about upward mobility and meritocracy within the CCP?')
