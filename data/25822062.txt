This is partially due to location, plus I&#x27;ve done the megacorp thing and am not a huge fan. While I get fairly regular inquiries from recruiters, those don&#x27;t seem to be roles that are a good match for my experience and skillset. A lot of them seem to equate &quot;senior developer&quot; with ~5-8 years experience and can&#x27;t get their head around someone who&#x27;s in his third decade as a professional developer.<p>Is there a job board for grizzled software veterans out there somewhere that I don&#x27;t know about, or is it 100% network at this point?')
