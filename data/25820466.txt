I&#x27;m slightly sceptical of how healthy this Tulpa concept is because I don&#x27;t think the answer to loneliness is necessarily literally conjuring up another person.<p>Loneliness can be used as an opportunity for people to explore their own mind. Why they get anxious if they&#x27;re lonely, how to be more comfortable without someone else around, and how to confront uncomfortable states of mind without deflecting.<p>Given that a Tulpa is obviously not real and already part of the person who invents it I&#x27;m not sure if compartmentalizing that way is a good thing.')
