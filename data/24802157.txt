Money is a necessary requirement, because it buys visibility in all forms of media. But if we calmly look at what went on, Trump did more than just blast himself out to everywhere he could. Yes, he&#x27;s an unhinged demagogue, but he also played the media remarkably well. (Calling in to a newsroom and getting unsolicited airtime in the middle of an otherwise redundant programme?)<p>&gt; <i>As an aside, “neither” is an option in the U.S. but too many people have been convinced a third party vote is equivalent to throwing their vote away</i><p>You missed my point. The option I&#x27;m talking about is not &quot;neither&quot;. It&#x27;s &quot;none of the above&quot;. You need a way to actively express that you, as a voter, have considered the available named options and <i>rejected all of them</i>. Not by wasting a protest vote or abstaining to vote in the first place.<p>I don&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m saying this, but I honestly think an Australian-style mandatory voting regime would do well in the US. At least that would force the states&#x27; hands and make voter suppression a hell of a lot harder to attempt. Combine that with ballots that always have &quot;none of the above&quot; option, and you might start to see something shift.<p>What would you think happens to legitimacy if &quot;all options were bad&quot; gets a larger share of votes than your supposedly winning candidate?')
