This party says no at a shareholder meeting, the conversion isn&#x27;t happening.<p>CFO who led this found that last party were all ok with the move given explanation, and most owned BTC already. 1 holdout took some convincing. These big money-movers hold BTC already, in short. Yeah it&#x27;s not 100% of their assets, but this isn&#x27;t an argument about that.')
