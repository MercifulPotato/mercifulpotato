There is a reason there are no other cross platform UIs that are QTâ€™s equal. Creating a good looking cross platform UI that supports things like accessibility and provides a close to native app experience (or can) is a real slog of a programming project. It must also be constantly maintained as native APIs change out from under it, hardware advances (e.g. higher DPI displays, HDR), and UI trends change.<p>Pay for Qt or pay for developer time to maintain multiple versions of your UI. Your pick. Qt is probably cheaper in most cases.')
