This is a mixture of:<p>1) Stuff I&#x27;d learn by reading Hacker News, after a few months<p>2) Stuff I&#x27;d learn on the job, after a few months<p>I&#x27;m not downplaying that it&#x27;s important to know, but it&#x27;s like converting a set of free blog posts into a $5000 university course.<p>Is that an efficient use of student time or money? Probably not. They&#x27;re better off getting a summer internship, and getting paid to learn agile (and learning it better! working on an agile team will teach a lot more than listening to a lecture), or reading the anecdotes while procrastinating real homework, and posting in forums like this one.<p>It&#x27;s okay that courses at a university do little to prepare people for some realities. Courses are designed to teach big-O, differential equations, database architectures, the math of machine learning, and similar sorts of things where there&#x27;s enough theoretical depth that you CAN&#x27;T pick up elsewhere.<p>If a software engineer enters industry without knowing linear algebra, odds are they&#x27;ll never be a data engineer in a serious ML project, or even more so, work on serious ML themselves.<p>TL;DR: Content looks useful, but it&#x27;s an counterproductive use of tuition dollars and student time.')
