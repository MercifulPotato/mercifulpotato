If I &quot;parrot&quot; (Accurately repeat) the original statement, it does not in any way demonstrate understanding, only memorization&#x2F;note-taking.<p>Restating, summarizing, or paraphrasing, shows that I <i>understand</i> sufficiently that I can describe it in my own words rather than memorization.<p>Day in and day out I find that my team members who accurately repeat a statement of problem or solution, may not have a clue what it actually is. Only by asking them to summarize or paraphrase, do we both discover that there&#x27;s a lack of actual, internalized understanding.<p>(in negotiations, discussions or conflict, it&#x27;s also an opportunity to focus and agree on key points; accurately repeating may include any percentage of stylistic content)')
