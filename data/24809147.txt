I mean, maybe you can build a microwave link directly to a datacenter Atlassian is using to host bitbucket... but no.  To be fair, gamedev typically uses p4, not git, so maybe this doesn&#x27;t have much impact there.<p>Gamedev still sometimes resorts to at least partially airgapped networks, which is going to make VCS &lt;-&gt; JIRA integration a pain.  I wonder if this will finally cause JIRA to get replaced in gamedev.')
