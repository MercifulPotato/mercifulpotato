For example a Google employee&#x27;s spouse could likely get correlated. False positives sounds like a bad idea for a system that tries to match personal and work accounts. Also in my case it would be harder possibly because I have a ton of personal Google accounts.<p>&gt;A cookie shared between two accounts is even a stronger indication, as a person used the same browser to log in with both.<p>I never use the same browser for my work and personal accounts.
