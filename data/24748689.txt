The US is just barely ahead of Italy and is still trailing Spain and Belgium.<p>The present outbreak in the Netherlands is about 40%-50% worse than it ever got in the US. The present outbreak in Belgium is well over twice as bad as it ever got in the US.<p>Not only did France have a horrific and hyper deadly outbreak previously, now they&#x27;re displaying remarkable incompetence in allowing a record-shattering outbreak that is so bad the US would need about 140,000 daily cases to match it (and their outbreak is still getting worse). That&#x27;s just under twice as bad as the situation in the US ever got.<p>So France is never allowed to go near nuclear again, right? I forget how this virtue signaling America-bad thing works.')
