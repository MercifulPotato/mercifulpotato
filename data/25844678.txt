Process monitor shows a fullscreen black window. Launches xscreensaver --lock or something as a child process<p>2. Xscreensaver shows the lock screen over the top of the process monitor, with a password prompt<p>When the correct password is entered, xscreensaver signals to its parent process. Then both processes close gracefully.<p>If xscreensaver crashes without signalling, the process manager silently restarts xscreensaver.<p>None of that requires any changes to X. You&#x27;d just want to be sure xscreensaver is displayed on top of the process manager&#x27;s black window.')
