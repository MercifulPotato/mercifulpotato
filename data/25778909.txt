Cavalry could beat pretty much any group of non-cavalry unless they had a massive numerical advantage, so castles&#x2F;walled settlements were the way to defend against that, but they only arose by necessity.<p>Carol Quigley&#x27;s theory is that technology changes the balance of power, sometimes favoring centralized power other times favoring decentralized power. Cavalry&#x2F;knights&#x2F;castles favored centralized power because equipping knights with armor and feeding their horses required a lot of peasants. The invention of cheap firearms led to the masses having more power (and around this time democracy began to spread). Then tanks, ICBMs, aircraft, submarines, etc. centralized power again, where we remain today, although that may be changing with cheapish drones and semi-successful insurgency tactics.')
