Data is either PHI held by HIPAA covered entities or it&#x27;s not, and consumer health and wellness data that one would see as being equally sensitive but that involves consumer transactions with an entity which is not a “covered entity” as defined in HIPAA (including where the consumer takes information from a covered entity and provides it to the service, so that the service is engaged by the consumer but has no business relation to the covered entity) is simply not PHI protected by HIPAA.<p>On the other hand, the information you describe from a pharmacy customer isn&#x27;t “HIPAA adjacent”, it&#x27;s just plain HIPAA PHI. on the gripping hand, lots of places have fairly weak internal controls on access to PHI; there is no required independent certification of practices, only after-the-fact enforcement when an unauthorized use occurs, is reported, and is investigated. And lots of places that haven&#x27;t been caught out yet have training in what your not allowed to do with data, but inadequate controls on what you can do and inadequate auditing of what you have done.')
