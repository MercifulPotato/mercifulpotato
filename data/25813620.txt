Small acreage = 100 acre hubs with 20-25 swarming cobots.<p>I am skeptical about growing Terra produce in space and even about us consuming them out in space. How do we even digest food in space? I want to know more about that. I want to know what happens to our internal organs. How we age and how we process calories etc.<p>We are likely better off 3D printing our food and nutrients and calories in space. And some significant space ready body modifications would be required.<p>Having said that..keeping it technical..I am more interested in growing food in hostile environments here on earth. Or Mars like environments here on earth for wool gathering purposes.<p>Eventually some produce like lettuce and strawberries will be exclusively grown indoors. But forests and orchards and creating eco systems ..and soil food web is more important. And we need tech to assist us with that to regenerate our earth systems. As we automate them for earth, many of them can be tweaked or exported for space environments. Maybe.<p>Growing for Mars or space pushes my imagination and many good things have come from that.
