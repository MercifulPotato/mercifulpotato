This debacle seems to point to the death of &#x27;Ethics research&#x27; inside of corporations. What do companies stand to gain from hiring ethics researchers who are a liability to the shareholders? My guess is that the model will go back to using CSR budget to invest in &#x27;social good&#x27; non-profits and think tanks that stay at a safe distance while still mentioning you as a &#x27;Platinum Sponsor&#x27; and bringing you in for fireside chats.<p>(this is not me advocating against ethics research, or against bringing ethics into AI research; I&#x27;m just trying to be as cynically realist as possible)')
