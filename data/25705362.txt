A whistle-blower police officer confessed on a KBS documentary that the case was initially investigated as a murder case, but the higher-ups later forbade murder investigation, and hastily classified it as a “suicide”. [0]<p>Another man was seen suspiciously thrown out of a window at a disciplined services quarters (whose tenants are mostly police) [1], and yet the case wasn’t even investigated.<p>Neither of these cases is definite proof of Hong Kong police killing protestors. And yet without proper investigation, you can easily hide casualties even when there are.<p>I must stress that guns are forbidden in Hong Kong, whereas guns appeared in the Capitol Hill on Jan 6 among some protestors. It’s not surprising that Hong Kong police may have a milder response than the US police. You can’t compare apples to oranges.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;7y8f3l2Eve8?t=542" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;7y8f3l2Eve8?t=542</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;HongKong&#x2F;comments&#x2F;eo1l01&#x2F;zoomed_version_of_man_falling_from_police_quarters&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;HongKong&#x2F;comments&#x2F;eo1l01&#x2F;zoomed_ver...</a>')
