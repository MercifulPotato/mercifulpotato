Do you mind me asking why you feel like adding that disclaimer? Is it because you don&#x27;t want to seem demanding? What is the goal of &quot;just report that the bug exists&quot;?<p>The main&#x2F;only major problem I&#x27;ve seen with bug reports is when it&#x27;s actually user code, so if you can show why you are certain that it&#x27;s the library&#x27;s code that is buggy that&#x27;s best. If you can prove it with a code snippet, perfect. If you can point to a specific place of code and explain why it doesn&#x27;t work, perfect. Or just explain exactly what happened. TBH, as long as you are just not be like &quot;my code doesn&#x27;t work fix it&quot; you should be mostly fine.<p>&gt; Note: exception if the package is marked as e.g. &quot;unmaintained&quot; or such<p>&gt; Note: there might be some truly awful OSS maintainers, and some are infamous for it (e.g. Linus); but in my experience it&#x27;s very very rare to find a negative reaction to a helpful PR.')
