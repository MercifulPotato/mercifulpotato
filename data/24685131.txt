Item(by='jlokier', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601879787, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24684901, text='&quot;Europe&quot; is how it&#x27;s often described in the UK.<p>There&#x27;s a long history of using &quot;Europe&quot; in news or political writing to refer to the continent (excluding the UK), and also to the various political and administrative entities such as the European Union, EEC, EC, ECHR, ECJ, etc.  Also referring to &quot;Europeans&quot; as people in those countries.<p>Much as, say, &quot;China&quot; is use to refer to the political entity that is the Chinese government rather than the geopgraphy, and &quot;America&quot; is used to refer to the USA government, not the continent.<p>The way language is used, with &quot;Europe&quot; in the UK usually taken to mean &quot;that landmass on the other side of the English Channel to the East of the UK, <i>not us</i>&quot;, might be a reason why a lot of people in the UK have such cognitive dissonance over it that most don&#x27;t recognise they had &quot;EU Citizenship&quot;, including some great citizenship rights, which they will now lose at the end of this year.<p>Because for many, &quot;EU Citizen&quot; conjures up images from other countries to the East, immigrants by definition it they are in the UK.  Yet in reality all UK citizens have been EU citizens for decades.<p>Ireland is also in Europe and the EU yet people don&#x27;t think of Ireland when thinking about &quot;Europe&quot;, and sometimes not even when thinking of the EU, although the last few years of politics have raised the profile of the EU Irish border issues.<p>If you&#x27;re thinking it&#x27;s absurd rhetoric, fair enough, but you would be mistaken to think it&#x27;s just language of those who support the EU, within the UK.  It has a long history.')
