(At this point, the consonants are long since gone and the nasal vowel is correct Portuguese&#x2F;French. But the change would have originated in people speaking something closer to Latin, which doesn&#x27;t use nasal vowels, and being &quot;careless&quot; with their pronunciation.)<p>Is this what you&#x27;re talking about?')
