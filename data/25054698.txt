I&#x27;m starting up a side project and hope to make $100MRR in the first year. (I don&#x27;t want to spend all of my free time on it, but want to give it a go.)<p>Before working for FAANG, I had my own business. I was able to pay myself a salary that supported me and my spouse (who also worked) in the MidWest, and it was an exhausting 24&#x2F;7 job. (I literally answered a tech support call at 3AM on occasion.) Any positive amount of money coming in is great!<p>FWIW, I make the kind of money he&#x27;s talking about and I still think that an extra $600&#x2F;mo. is useful. I just refinanced my mortgage to save ~$400&#x2F;mo. I&#x27;m probably going to move to a different internet provider because mine jacked up prices. It&#x27;s not at all ridiculous to think that it&#x27;s good to save money no matter how much you make. (You do have to weigh the amount of time it takes to save the money, though. As you make more, you tend to be less willing to spend a lot of time on doing things to save smaller amounts of money.)')
