For all of us, things that hold us back the most are ones we refuse to see in ourselves. Meanwhile they are obvious to other people - who assume they must be as obvious to us and thus don&#x27;t say anything.<p>What makes the quick and frequent feedback valuable is that it&#x27;s easy and undramatic to give but can form patterns of irrefutable evidence about ourselves.<p>If I hear once from one person that I did X and caused Y, I can dismiss it. If I hear something similar from lots of different in many situations - at some point I have to admit there&#x27;s something to it and investigate.<p>If that sounds weird, just think about this: if you literally stank, would you want to know? Would you want to hear it casually from 3 people in the morning so you can figure out that you had stepped into shit on the way to the office? Or would you want people to politely not say anything all day, sparing your feelings while every one of them thinks you smell like shit?')
