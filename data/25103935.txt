For example if you are a software engineer that relies on the logic&#x2F;problem-solving part of your brain to be sharp and awake then do an activity perhaps in the evening or on the weekend that allows that part of your brain to sleep&#x2F;rest. This means engaging at something that allows you to use the creative thought process, or working with your hands perhaps on a mechanical&#x2F;fix-it task.\n- Music also helps with mood. But finding the time when you’re ready to relax and listen to something that jives with your mental state is a challenge. It’s all about finding the alignment.\n- Movies can be helpful in terms of the passive engagement and allowing you to escape your reality for an hour and half can be helpful.<p>Overall learning to combat the problems with anxiety and mental state are not easy. It takes some trial and error but I think the biggest piece of advice is finding ways to break up your routine is helpful. I have gone years doing the same thing over and over with days on forgetting to live a little...it’s not healthy in the long term.')
