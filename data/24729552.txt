That said, the game was (is?) rise and <i>fall.</i> Rising civilizations leave a heritage to be mined, so there is an overall direction of rise... but every one of the many scientifically advancing cultures in history has declined. It would be prudent to expect the same for ours.<p>That said, modernity has almost certainly changed at least some of the rules. Even the term &quot;The West&quot; has become complicated.
