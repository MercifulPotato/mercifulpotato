If you are topped up (which means you still have political standing) then you start a new vesting schedule.  So all those shares you worked for and vested — you can work for again!! Yay! Until another 4 years you are diluted. Yay! But likely there will be another round while you wait to vest the shares you already had!! Hahahaha!')
