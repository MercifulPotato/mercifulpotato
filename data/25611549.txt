Even with universal health care (which wasn&#x27;t <i>quite</i> what they have) it couldn&#x27;t possibly make up the difference for someone with college debt.<p>I&#x27;d argue that if you got a CS degree from an American college you&#x27;re probably just forced to work in the US simply because the other prospective employees can accept a lower salary due to a lower debt load. Maybe the best of the best can find a way to earn American salaries overseas but I really don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s as common as the HN crowd might assume.')
