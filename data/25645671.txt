Are you telling me that you <i>never</i> need to communicate with anyone outside of your organization? How do you intend to receive invoices? How will you communicate with outside vendors? Sorry, but you need some text-based way of communicating with people and email is the best way, that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s survived so long despite being problematic. If you have internal, asynchronous chat, why would you need internal email?<p>Sorry my dude, but business runs on email. Saying lets get rid of it is as na√Øve as saying lets get rid of Excel. It&#x27;s just not going to happen.')
