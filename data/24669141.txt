Knowing how much I walked around each day, how well I slept, what my heart rate was, etc. makes it a lot easier to understand whatâ€™s going on with my body and be more proactive about it.<p>meh, I had exactly the same with the withings, which is a normal watch but with captors, and it&#x27;s a gimmick. I have an Apple watch now, and I don&#x27;t use it all the time (it&#x27;s truly a hassle to recharge it all the time), but it manages to integrate really well with everything and always surprises me in how useful it is. Today I was at the doctor with Kaiser and they texted me when they were ready to take me with the floor and room number I had to go to, I quickly saw the notification on my watch and went there. Being able to take calls when I just can&#x27;t reach my phone is amazing also. When I watch a movie or listen to music I can quickly decrease&#x2F;increase the sound. I can use it as a remote for keynote. I&#x27;m still discovering things every week. If only they could make it so that it would last longer than 1 day.')
