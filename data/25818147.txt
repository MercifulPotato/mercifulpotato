Item(by='laverya', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610944038, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25813929, text='&gt; In fact it&#x27;s actually illegal for the state to create such a list.<p>To elaborate on this a little bit, <i>NO</i> state in the US has such a list - not one worth a damn, that is. For instance, NY recently mandated the registration of all &quot;assault weapons&quot; in the state, but compliance there is estimated to be in the single-digit percent range. (1m+ applicable weapons, ~45,000 registrations - the definition is <i>really</i> broad and includes essentially everything semiautomatic with a detachable magazine) These weapons were previously legal to own&#x2F;buy&#x2F;sell&#x2F;transfer, and would continue to be legal to own <i>if registered</i> - and registration <i>still</i> didn&#x27;t crack 10%.<p>Extrapolate to people that the police are likely to deal with in an adversarial manner, and you can see that a DB entry showing &quot;no guns at 123 Main Street&quot; is absolutely worthless.')
