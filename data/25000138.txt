WinUI 3 is just the &quot;third version&quot; of the UI component library used inside UWP originally, but now with bonus compatibility with WinForms and WPF.<p>To me that&#x27;s the opposite of &quot;stagnated&quot; or &quot;deprecated every two years&quot;. The UI parts of UWP and WinUI3 are more the same thing, just versions over time, than they are different. It just continues to evolve with each new versions that include new features (such as the new &quot;Now with much better WPF and WinForms support&quot; features for people in brownfield applications).<p>You should be excited about WinUI3 because it lets you dip your toes in what UWP added to the UI framework from your WinForms and WPF development. You&#x27;ll probably find it feels a lot more like WPF than you&#x27;d think given how demonized UWP&#x27;s UI framework has been. (It&#x27;s not WPF, of course, and there are compatibility breaks to learn&#x2F;deal with, but it&#x27;s still XAML-based UI design with a lot of very similar controls and tools in the toolkits.)')
