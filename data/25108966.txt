If I prefer Linux I don&#x27;t need an explanation. Personally I like the lesser restrictions (Both Windows and Mac are locking down more and more) and the higher customisation it offers.<p>But the thing about preferences is that they are largely a feeling. Therefore reasons don&#x27;t <i>have</i> to be concise or defined scientifically. One example: I hate the way Windows 10 forces me to update whenever it wants, and doesn&#x27;t allow me to turn off telemetry. Neither of those things will actually affect me very much: I would usually update within the required timeframe anyway and the telemetry is minimal.<p>However it is the <i>feeling</i> of increased corporate control over <i>my</i> machine, in a time where corporate surveillance is already rampant that makes me hate this.<p>So objectively these arguments are hardly valid but still I feel better moving to Linux (or rather: FreeBSD) as a daily driver. That&#x27;s ok as it is <i>my</i> preference :)<p>PS: I use pretty much all platforms every day for various reasons')
