It&#x27;s a guideline, not a hard rule. Signal actually rolled their own crypto and aren&#x27;t constantly criticized for that, on the contrary. Signal is praised for rolling it&#x27;s own crypto.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the Telegram crypto can (and should) definitely be criticized. But please criticize that they use &quot;bad crypto&quot; or &quot;strange crypto&quot; or &quot;unreviewed crypto&quot;, not that it&#x27;s their own. (And of course, substantiate such claims with references that can be discussed.)')
