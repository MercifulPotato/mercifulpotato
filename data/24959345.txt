Sharing non UI code has always been possible via C&#x2F;C++, but it suffers from several issues not the least of which is having to write C&#x2F;C++. The executions I&#x27;ve seen of this for example often bundle curl + boringSSL for an HTTP&#x2F;HTTPS stack instead of linking against the system provided networking libraries.<p>Aside from Kotlin I also think Rust with C FFI or WASM are good potential avenues to explore here. In the WASM case generic business logic can be written in Rust and compiled to WASM, platform capabilities such as networking&#x2F;GPS etc can be exposed to the WASM VM via functions provided by the host. Further, with WASM it would also be possible to run the same code across web, native clients, and the server.')
