Gmail would also presumably have to be Gmail and ads if it wasn&#x27;t operated for data to feed to the ads engine. I could see Android becoming a product for carriers without ads, cloud doesn&#x27;t need ads, how would Chrome operate as its own business without ads? Firefox is just paid for by Google search, would Chrome be the same, and would that be different enough to satisfy a breakup? Would you just split the ads team and data among multiple new companies and tell them they arnt allowed to talk to each other anymore?')
