Ship engines are dirtier in the sense that they produce worse NOx&#x2F;SOx (causes of acid rain) and particulate matter (causes of haze and breathing issues). These issues are serious, but they have led to countless articles with very misleading headlines like &quot;Big polluters: One massive container ship equals 50 million cars&quot;[1].<p>For global warming (CO2 and other greenhouse gases), shipping does create a decent fraction of emissions (~2% of manmade co2 emissions in 2018[2]), but nowhere near what land-based transport creates (trucks+passenger cars put out roughly ten times what boats do [3]). Attempts to address the particulate&#x2F;sox&#x2F;nox has included LNG powered ships[4], which allow unburnt methane to escape, which results in worse GHG emissions (but less of the &quot;emissions&quot; that allow headlines like &quot;shipping is as bad as 50 million cars!&quot;). And if you look at a different statistic, ocean shipping of goods seems almost responsible (eg, ocean shipping has the lowest &quot;CO2 per tonne per km&quot;, far lower than rail&#x2F;truck shipping[5])<p>All that said, reducing GHG emissions from shipping is great and necessary. I hope this project works out.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;newatlas.com&#x2F;shipping-pollution&#x2F;11526&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;newatlas.com&#x2F;shipping-pollution&#x2F;11526&#x2F;</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;maritimesky.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;08&#x2F;05&#x2F;imo-has-published-its-4th-greenhouse-gas-ghg-study&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;maritimesky.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;08&#x2F;05&#x2F;imo-has-published-its-4th...</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.transportation.gov&#x2F;sustainability&#x2F;climate&#x2F;transportation-ghg-emissions-and-trends" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.transportation.gov&#x2F;sustainability&#x2F;climate&#x2F;transp...</a><p>[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;theicct.org&#x2F;news&#x2F;fourth-imo-ghg-study-finalreport-pr-20200804" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;theicct.org&#x2F;news&#x2F;fourth-imo-ghg-study-finalreport-pr...</a><p>[5] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;timeforchange.org&#x2F;co2-emissions-for-shipping-of-goods&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;timeforchange.org&#x2F;co2-emissions-for-shipping-of-good...</a>')
