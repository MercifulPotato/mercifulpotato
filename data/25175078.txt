We knew we wanted an image manipulation program like Photoshop, but the name IMP sounded wrong. We also tossed around XIMP (X Image Manipulation Program) following the rule of when in doubt prefix an X for X11 based programs. At the time, Pulp Fiction was the hot movie and a single word popped into my mind while we were tossing out name ideas. It only took a few more minutes to determine what the &#x27;G&#x27; stood for.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s a shame how so many people these days want to change the name and destroy such an early and enduring example of gay representation in Free Software.')
