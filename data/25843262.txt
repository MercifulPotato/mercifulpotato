This pardon is supported by Kellyanne Conway. Mr. Erickson’s conviction was based off the Russian collusion hoax. After finding no grounds to charge him with any crimes with respect to connections with Russia, he was charged with a minor financial crime. Although the Department of Justice sought a lesser sentence, Mr. Erickson was sentenced to 7 years’ imprisonment—nearly double the Department of Justice’s recommended maximum sentence. This pardon helps right the wrongs of what has been revealed to be perhaps the greatest witch hunt in American History.</i><p>Yeah, BS.  Trump deserved to lose his Presidency then and there.<p>I also didn&#x27;t like the special treatment that Stephen Bannon received.  There is another person who deserves to rot in hell.<p>But my guess is that more than 2&#x2F;3 of these commutations I support.  And it has nothing to do with who commuted them.')
