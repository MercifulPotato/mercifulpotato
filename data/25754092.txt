For example, security code analysis software with hard-coded passwords that you hook into your build tooling, or in this case, ops software that instructs you to disable Microsoft&#x27;s security tools so they don&#x27;t flag problems with the agent.<p>In a similar vein I&#x27;ve had BMC software want the highest levels of access to Oracle DBs to do simply monitoring, and so on and so forth.<p>The other observation I heard Bruce Schneier make at a hacker con is more profound, and probably going to take a lot longer for national security actors to accept is this: the norms need to change. There is no longer a clear separation between &quot;our stuff&quot; and &quot;their stuff&quot; the way that there was a few decades ago, when espionage was more on &quot;your telco network&quot; or &quot;my telco network&quot;. As we&#x27;ve moved to pervasive connectivity it&#x27;s no longer possible to say, &quot;oh that backdoor will only be used by our side&quot;, or &quot;that hack will only affect their SCADA systems&quot; or whatever.')
