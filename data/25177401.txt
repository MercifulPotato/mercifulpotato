Therefore forcing things like Docker to switch to more architecture-agnostic ways of running? Or will people just use more remote VMs and container services?<p>I am also wondering how much of a hold the OS X UI has on people. Because I really enjoy using iTerm2, and having Homebrew and all the UNIX applications just a terminal away is great. They&#x27;re also closer than the Microsoft WSL way of doing things because you don&#x27;t have 2 home directories, multiple network addresses like you do with the latest WSL2 in Windows 10. (not to diss WSL2, it&#x27;s great, and can run many things much closer to a true Linux&#x2F;UNIX &quot;experience&quot;)<p>I guess, along with winning the lottery and a pony, I want the underpinning of Linux, the games and Microsoft development effort of Windows, and the UI of OS X.')
