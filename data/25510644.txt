This is just the same speculation that has been made thousands of times before for decades. Of course we can make big molecules from small ones in a lab. Of course life has to reproduce, metabolize and have a boundary from the environment. Pointing this out is not &quot;the key to the origins of life&quot;. It is still an interesting topic, but why cant national geographic discuss these things honestly?')
