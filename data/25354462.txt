As the estimates got bigger, so did the error bars, and if a task didn&#x27;t fit comfortably into one bucket then it was upgraded to the next.<p>We also had design discussions and poker planning for all of these tasks.  Estimates were almost always accurate, even if they weren&#x27;t very precise.')
