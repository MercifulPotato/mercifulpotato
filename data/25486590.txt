Although I&#x27;d been using arpnet for over a decade due to university access, I first encountered a &quot;web browser&quot; while working at Electronic Arts on the yet to be released 3D0 in &#x27;93 -&#x27;94.<p>However, nobody cared diddly squat about &quot;the web&quot;, it was empty or nonsense like usenet forums.
