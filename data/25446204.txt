The whole incident around Devotion being removed originally, unsavory as it is to the Western Audience, is also well in the past and for most people not anywhere in their active mindspace. Then along GOG announcing its release on their store only to backpedal a whopping, what, 4 hours later? No one 12 hours ago was actively condemning GOG for not having this game, they sure are now. And it&#x27;s not like they didn&#x27;t know about the previous drama.<p>Unless their goal all along was to publicly signal to China their willingness to kowtow, I have absolutely no idea what happened on the corporate end here, and it just makes the whole organization look incompetent all the way around.')
