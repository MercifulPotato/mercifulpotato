An apple is 100. &quot;Boring foods&quot; like boiled potatoes are circa 100 calories per 100 grams. &quot;Fun foods&quot; like chicken breast or ikea meatballs are 200 calories per 100 grams. Oil - 10 calories per ml.<p>And then you look at &lt;younameit&gt; cheesy crackers and realize that something is wrong: no way 30 grams of human food should be 200 calories.')
