In fact, there&#x27;s some evidence to suggest the opposite in the misuse of wearing a mask properly or fitting it properly,&quot; Dr. Mike Ryan, executive director of the WHO health emergencies program, said at a media briefing in Geneva, Switzerland, on Monday.&quot;<p>Certain institutions seem to use the epistemic standard &quot;if something hasn&#x27;t been rigorously proven to be a good idea, then you shouldn&#x27;t do it&quot;.  It&#x27;s the kind of logic that, consistently applied, would say you shouldn&#x27;t use parachutes in skydiving because there haven&#x27;t been randomized controlled studies establishing their effectiveness.  I think this is what incrudible is arguing against.<p>How did such logic take hold in the first place?  My first guess is that it&#x27;s something like, that&#x27;s the type of logic that lets them definitively say &quot;you <i>shouldn&#x27;t</i> take xyz homeopathic remedy&quot; instead of &quot;well, our expert doctor says he doesn&#x27;t expect it to help but he can&#x27;t completely rule it out, and there isn&#x27;t any good evidence that it does work&quot;.')
