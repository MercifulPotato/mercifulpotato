Like for example for determining access to scholarships or graduate programs.  Also suppose, for the sake of argument, that some percentage of the students are going to cheat, and suppose that it matters to the aforementioned grades.<p>Also I&#x27;m assuming a distance-learning option, perhaps due to quarantine, but the question generalizes to other reasons.<p>How do options 1 and 2 do anything at all to fight the alleged cheating problem?  Remote essays are very easy to cheat, just as easy as any other kind of remote exam.  Anything take-home is even easier to cheat.<p>The parent commenter is simply claiming that cheating just doesn&#x27;t happen enough to matter (at least not at Caltech, they claim).  That&#x27;s possible, I have no idea.  But it&#x27;s quite different from saying &quot;remote exams are bad&quot;.<p>---<p>As for why professors administer exams, btw...  a professor is going to spend such-and-such an amount of time on you and your class.  Maybe it&#x27;s 5 hours per week, maybe it&#x27;s 20.  Would you rather they invest that time into teaching, or marking?  Speaking as a former student and a current teacher, I tend to prefer it be spent on teaching.  If you agree that the teaching is more valuable then the marking, teachers should choose the least labour-demanding form of assessment, so they can get back to investing energy in teaching (and&#x2F;or get back to other responsibilities).  Exams are easier to grade than projects and essays.  A professor who chooses exams is usually saying &quot;marking is not a good use of my time&quot;.  (A professor who chooses essays or projects is usually saying &quot;marking is a teaching opportunity so I hate this but oh well&quot;).')
