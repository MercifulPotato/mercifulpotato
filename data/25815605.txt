However, perfect pitch is not really about Western standards or whether A equals 440. It&#x27;s the ability to remember a pitch in absolute terms.<p>As a musician, I have a finely-tuned sense of relative pitch. I can pick out chords and melodies easily, but I don&#x27;t know the reference key unless I hear an instrument and I&#x27;m told what note it is playing.<p>My son has perfect pitch. This became apparent when we watched the movie &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot;, and he complained that it was out of tune with respect to the Beatles albums he had heard.<p>I listened carefully to the two sources, and it turned out the movie was about a quarter tone flat compared to the recordings. Only a person with perfect pitch would notice that. The rest of us forget the absolute value of a pitch in a matter of minutes or less.')
