Microsoft seems to want to meet those &quot;computer as appliance&quot; users where they are (in education, in families, in secondary&#x2F;tertiary devices all around modern homes).<p>Microsoft seems caught between a rock and a hard place in branding this &quot;appliance OS&quot; effort. They want to piggyback on top of Windows technically (the NT kernel is still a good foundation, the capabilities-based sandbox of the UWP platform is modern enough to drive a good &quot;appliance OS&quot;, etc), and they seem to want to piggyback on overall familiarity with Windows in the design experience (&quot;it&#x27;s just Windows but lighter, see here&#x27;s a Start button with Windows logo&quot;) as a potential competitive advantage.<p>It&#x27;s almost painful to watch these competing problems fight each other (&quot;it&#x27;s just Windows, but it isn&#x27;t&quot; is a terribly subtle and confusing marketing message, and they keep learning that the hard way and trying to fix the &quot;but it isn&#x27;t&quot; rather than the &quot;it&#x27;s just Windows&quot;). Microsoft probably just needs to rip the bandaid off, take a play from Apple (or Xbox), and call it &quot;Surface OS 10&quot; or something.')
