I couldn&#x27;t really do deadlifts at a proper weight either, because my hands weren&#x27;t strong enough. But after just a few sessions (using wrist straps), my grip strength increased a lot, and my RSI complaints went away. TL;DR, deadlifts helped me beat RSI. They&#x27;re back now though, haven&#x27;t been to a gym this year and before that it was sporadic at best.<p>Squats, I had trouble with those as well; the trainer identified the cause pretty quickly, pointing out ankle flexibility. Another one to consider. Gave me a specific exercise to sort that one out.<p>We did a lot of the hip flexor ones as well, split squats I believe they were called? I was so bad at those at first, complete lack of balance and control. I mean even after a year they were still uncomfortable to do, but it was a big improvement.<p>Part of me would like to go for PT again because I lack intrinsic motivation so I need some other guy telling me what to do, but I can&#x27;t really afford it anymore.')
