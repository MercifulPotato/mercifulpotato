It seems really hard to guess these things.<p>Do they have the attention span to keep it divided for another half-century until things cool down, or do the hawks get voted out as crazy people, and they walk away after a few years leaving simmering hatred?<p>Does the USSR get its act together and finish what they failed to do in 1920? Perhaps on the same side as Japan since war in the pacific was also brewing... then we get WWII with different teams. Does the US still get the bomb first? Probably.
