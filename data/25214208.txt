I remember Garfield in both the newspapers and in book form primarily. Bloom County, Calvin &amp; Hobbes and the Far Side were lit however and it might be unfair of me to use them to contrast against because they were all masterpieces of creative genius. Maybe Garfield is best contrasted against other generic syndicated formulaic comics like Beetle Bailey, Hi &amp; Lois, Hagar the Horrible, etc.<p>The problem I think with formulaic comics is that there&#x27;s no vision after the original creator hands them over to someone else. It&#x27;s just making sure they draw the same way, and don&#x27;t say or do anything too controversial, oh that Garfield and his lasagnas, ha ha, etc.')
