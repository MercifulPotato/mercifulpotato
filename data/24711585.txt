Item(by='munk-a', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602098013, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24704869, text='I don&#x27;t believe so - I also struggled a bit with this question especially in my twenties - &quot;other people are able to overcome it and focus so maybe if I put enough effort in I&#x27;d be able to do the same?&quot; As I&#x27;ve aged into working in the job market it&#x27;s less of a concern to me, I have strengths and weaknesses, even with meds my attention to detail and patience with the minutia is lacking.  I&#x27;m concerned (especially while I was in the states) that shifting off of my meds could be a tailspin and end up being self-destructive - like hard drug use it&#x27;s something that the person inside of the bubble is not able to properly judge and decisions and actions that may be clearly poor to an outside observer may be viewed positively internally.<p>The early days of uni for me were the first time I was actually responsible for ensuring that my med supply continued and that&#x27;s a big part of why I&#x27;m hesitant to try tapering off of it - it was incredibly difficult for me to find the motivation or the energy to actually fill up my prescription if I had let it lapse and the days (up to eight in the worst case) I was without meds I completely dropped the ball on schoolwork and other responsibilities.<p>So I&#x27;m worried about tapering off since I&#x27;m concerned I might not be able to stop tapering or I would burn a lot of goodwill&#x2F;financial security recovering from the tapering off if it went poorly.  That all said, ADD is different for everyone with different levels of apathy and concentration, I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if mine was a particularly potent variety beyond what most folks deal with but, with meds, I&#x27;m able to cope and have a nice life.<p>The philosophical questions about personhood don&#x27;t really ever stop nagging away at you in the background, but I&#x27;m happy with things as they are - sorry if this was a bit of a downer response ;P')
