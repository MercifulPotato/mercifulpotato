Item(by='hn_throwaway_99', descendants=None, kids=[25742967], score=None, time=1610425010, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25733398, text='Agreed, like that it was prefilled, but just a note the article for Paul Graham is &quot;The Bus Ticket Theory of Genius&quot;.<p>But the image that came up wasn&#x27;t for a bus ticket, it was for a raffle ticket, which basically has nothing to do with a bus ticket except it has the word &quot;ticket&quot; in common. So on one hand it kind of highlighted what I don&#x27;t like about services like this in that you get relatively dumb results that are basically just doing keyword matches, and the images actually have nothing to do with the story.<p>Edit: OK, actually none of the images really make sense. Since these are curated results I&#x27;d expect them to show the <i>best</i> of what can be generated. Instead:<p>- TechRadar, <i>Apple&#x27;s privacy labels reveals Whatsapp and Facebook Messenger&#x27;s hunger for user data</i>: Show&#x27;s a Samsung phone<p>- AVC, <i>Temper Tantrum - AVC</i>: Maybe, kinda fits, but looks to me just like a sad little girl, not a girl having a temper tantrum.<p>- BBC, <i>The nuclear lighthouses built by the Soviets in the Arctic - BBC Reel</i>: OK, this one fits exactly, but the image is just taken straight from the blog post.<p>- Medium, <i>I’ve Been in Venture Capital for Two Months. Here’s What Still Makes No Sense</i>: A completely random picture of a forest.<p>- Pulse, <i>If There Aren&#x27;t Any Typos In This Essay, We Launched Too Late!</i>: A somewhat bizarro picture of someone on a scooter with a rocket on their back.<p>TBH if I wanted to promote my blog post I&#x27;d just do my own stock image search and use that instead.')
