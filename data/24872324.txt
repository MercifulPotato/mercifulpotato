I&#x27;ve found people tend to value the social standing of that &quot;few thousand&quot; people that make up their immediate society rather than the global collective. If anything, I&#x27;ve noticed a tendency to rail against the massive collective value because of it&#x27;s juxtaposition to that of the value system closer to home.<p>As a silly example, a giant pickup is a status symbol in cattle country while a tesla is a status symbol in some parts of CA. Both sometimes look down their nose at the other. I&#x27;m not making a case as to which is correct, just that I doubt people make their value judgement in response to some global society.<p>Since I have little presence on social media, I may just not have a good handle on how that skews the whole dynamic but it certainly feels more locally biased to me.')
