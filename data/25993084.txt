The basis for assuming there&#x27;s reinfection happening seems to be a seroprevalence survey done over the summer which estimated 76% of the population had antibodies to the virus.

The survey was done through blood donors and apparently they incentivized blood donation by offering people the results of their antibodies test as part of donation. Since testing capacity during peak infection was limited, this would give people who thought they might have had the virus (and likely did) incentive to donate blood and made the sample not nearly as random as it was presented to be.')
