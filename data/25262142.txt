These fast neutrons can turn otherwise benign heavy elements into weapons-grade fissile material.  There are detection techniques for this kind of breeding and Iâ€™d imagine any country capable of building a fusion reactor would also be okay with audits.  If you just want weapons-grade fissile material, there are far more economical avenues than a fusion reactor.<p>Also, if fusion reactors become more viable than fission reactors, then we could put a global ban on all fissile materials.  They would serve no purpose except for weapons.')
