Accordingly, Disputes will be settled through self-governing principles, established in good faith, at the time of Martian settlement.&quot;<p>SpaceX is trying to establish an agreement between itself and all its users, not enforce that agreement against third parties (as far as I can see). There may be a conflict if&#x2F;when a second provider establishes a colony on Mars, but nobody else seems to be working towards that goal, so it&#x27;s even more speculative than SpaceX&#x27;s ambitions.')
