In physics, my understanding is that the entropy of a collection of dice in a cup is decreasing over time: the entropy of 5 dice in a row is high, and 5 dice in a messy pile is low. In cryptography we say that this has &quot;generated&quot; entropy, implying that the entropy is increasing over time. Are these actually two separate definitions of the same word, or am I misunderstanding something? Is this a &quot;credit&quot;&#x2F;&quot;debit&quot; type situation?<p>[append] A brief internet search indicates that I&#x27;m mistaken about the physical definition of entropy and that it does increase over time, never (universally) decrease. That does clarify the confusion I have here but highlights that I clearly don&#x27;t have a very good mental picture of what &quot;entropy&quot; is.')
