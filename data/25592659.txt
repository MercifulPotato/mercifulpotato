Even when you give the instance a lot of CPU &#x2F; Memory. The problem is not only the Spring application itself, the DB seems to be missing some indexes or the queries are super badly optimized. God only knows what&#x27;s really happening under the hood, but my self hosted Jira instance isn&#x27;t any better (I&#x27;ve tried them both, cloud and on-prem).')
