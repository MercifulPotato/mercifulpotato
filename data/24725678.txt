In 2013 I was three months in to a new house I purchased when I got into a horrible clusterpuck at work, and ended up having to walk out. Not pretty. What I thought was going to be my saving grace never materialized. So I was then a) jobless, b) with a mortgage, and c) royally screwed. I became severely depressed and suicidal. What kicked me out of the rut was that I finally realized (nick of time?) that I WAS in a crisis. If you&#x27;re broke without motivation, then you need to put yourself into a crisis, survival mindset. Move out of your parents house and on to a sofa. Get rid of your car. Cancel Netflix and everything else you care about. Do something that will make a significant impact on your ability to pay the bills and take care of yourself. It won&#x27;t work for everyone, it&#x27;s extreme, but once I realized there was a crisis, and the significant impact was homelessness, I got to work fixing my situation.')
