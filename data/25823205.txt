Obviously, that&#x27;s not a valid assumption at all, which is one of many reasons why it&#x27;s such a problem.<p>Insurance companies each negotiate a rate for various services with hospitals. People pay different rates depending on the insurance they have, due to these different negotiated rates.<p>This creates a perverse incentive where hospitals want to list their &quot;cash&quot; price as being higher than the negotiated rates, otherwise insurance companies will come back to negotiate their rates down to the obviously lower cash price.<p>In reality, it&#x27;s usually surprisingly easy to get hospitals to give significant discounts if you tell them you&#x27;re without insurance and you&#x27;ll be paying in cash. Patients without insurance can often negotiate their bills down to a fraction of the original list price by simply calling in and telling the billing office they don&#x27;t have insurance.<p>It&#x27;s obviously not a great system.')
