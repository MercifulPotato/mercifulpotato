This is a hugely important problem and this interview and your presentation of it is a great contribution.<p>I think one of the things that gets lost when we talk about Eroom&#x27;s law is that the original data points were established before congress passed the Kefauver-Harris amendments in 1962 which set standards for clinical trials, iNDA process, and basically required that drugs show efficacy before they could be marketed.<p>An important part of those amendments is they made the drug companies go back and review the 4,000 drugs already on the market and provide evidence on their efficacy.  It took FDA a long time to work through that backlog, but when they did:<p>&quot;In January 1968, the Drug Efficacy Study panels finally reported their conclusions to the FDA.  They had reviewed over 16,500 therapeutic claims for 4,000 pre-1962 drugs.  Only 434, about 12 percent of those examined, delivered on all their promised claims.  Seven hundred and sixty-nine were marked as &#x27;ineffective&#x27;&quot; [0].<p>I bring that up to say two things:<p>1) Our baseline in examining Eroom&#x27;s law is a bit skewed because standards have been going up since the graph begins.<p>2) We should be careful in how we change those standards.  Many of them were bought with patients lives.<p>I need to go now, but I also want to address your comment on pricing.<p>Thank you again.  Really great work.<p>[0] Pharma - Gerald Posner - Pg 224. \n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Pharma-Greed-Lies-Poisoning-America-ebook&#x2F;dp&#x2F;B07THB8GRL&#x2F;ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=1609177152&amp;sr=8-1" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Pharma-Greed-Lies-Poisoning-America-e...</a>')
