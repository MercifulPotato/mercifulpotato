You can do fancy things like group your changelogs under headings if you want to make it easier to maintain focus for different audiences. A CAD tool I use, for example, lists every single bug fixed and references a ticket number with each. This is extreme, but much better than the opposite extreme.<p>It lets me know when I can stop using workarounds, or alert me to landmines I&#x27;ve unknowingly tripped and lets me go back to verify old designs.<p>Regardless of who the user is, a changelog is supposed to tell you what actually changed. If you&#x27;re not going to do that, don&#x27;t bother having one. But if you don&#x27;t bother writing one, I&#x27;m not going to bother updating to the new version. From my (the user&#x27;s) perspective there&#x27;s no incentive to do so unless I know what I&#x27;m getting. There could be anything in there, so I&#x27;ll stick to the devil I know.')
