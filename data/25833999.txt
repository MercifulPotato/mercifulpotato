But pretty much everyone wants the same thing in their career: mission, autonomy, impact, and creativity.<p>These traits ^ are mostly independent of a specific job &#x2F; field&#x27;<p>I think this is untrue. It depends on how one understands mission, autonomy, impact and creativity whether they can be achieved independent what specific job one works. If by creativity you mean self-expression, few jobs give you the space for true self-expression, rather than expression within the confines of instrumental problem-solving. If by autonomy you mean the ability to choose one&#x27;s own tasks then, again, few jobs allow that. If by impact you mean the probable consequences one&#x27;s work will have for the good of humankind, then clearly one can - and people do - try and rank more and less impactful work, among which there is wide variance. There are a small number of jobs which are extremely high-impact, e.g., working on nuclear proliferation, public health in the global south, climate change. Most jobs have a real but comparatively mundane impact. &#x27;Mission&#x27; is entirely relative to the person, not the job.')
