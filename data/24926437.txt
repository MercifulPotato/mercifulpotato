If you are 20 years old and learn something new, you benefit from it for 60 years or so. But if you&#x27;re 75 and considering learning that same new thing, you would benefit from that knowledge for a much shorter period of time.<p>I wonder how much of the decline in motivation is tied to this commonsensical explanation, and how much is related to the scientific process that the researchers observed in mice.')
