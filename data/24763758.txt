Industry experts with a financial incentive to promote serverless went on stage and told me they can&#x27;t debug their code, or run it on their machine. They showed me comically large system diagrams for very simple use cases, then spent an hour explaining how to do not-quite-ACID transactions. Oh yeah and you can only use 3-5 languages, and each import statement has a dollar amount tied to it.<p>More importantly, all those skills you develop are tied to Amazon, or some other giant. All the code you write is at their mercy. Any problem you have depends on their support.<p>Am I supposed to bet hundreds or thousands of man hours on that?')
