It&#x27;s a lot of effort!<p>Let&#x27;s say that you want to find vulns in PDF parsers&#x2F;renderers by checking their code source code - I think it&#x27;d take a lot of effort to check and understand (let alone exploit) those implementations in two major browsers (I suppose they&#x27;re different, but I&#x27;ve never checked that)<p>&gt;I also don&#x27;t think ctf&#x27;s are a good model for security questions during interviews<p>I didn&#x27;t meant that, sorry if I made it sound as if I expected people to solve CTF tasks during SE interviews<p>Just wanted to encourage people to do cool stuff :)')
