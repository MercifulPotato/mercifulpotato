The latter is more a way to game utility billing systems, and is inherently unfair to those left paying for grid power and subsidizing the grid for the solar powered free riders (who get the reliability benefit of the grid at low cost.)   Rationalizing the design of grid billing to make everyone pay their share of this reliability service makes rooftop solar much less attractive.')
