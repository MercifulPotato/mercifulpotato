Nothing was proven because my points weren&#x27;t addressed.<p>You&#x27;re not respecting my time with your grammatically correct comment above. You can shorten your comment by mangling the grammar and preserving the meaning.<p>&gt;We have better things to do in life. Respect the person who will read the code. Be concise<p>See that sentence it&#x27;s wasting my precious time you can get rid of a lot of unnecessary info and preserve meaning.<p>&gt;We have better thing do. Respect reader. Be concise.<p>There. same point but more concise but now you sound as if you have brain damage. My point is we use programming languages and english to communicate a point, but clearly in english nobody takes any effort to respect anyone&#x27;s time. It&#x27;s full of wordy unnecessary stuff and the entire population of english speakers actually prefers reading this very verbose english then reading obscure code.<p>I am saying because of this contradiction all your logic flies out the door.<p>Bring the level of verbosity of code to the level of verbosity in english. We don&#x27;t complain about english, we actually prefer it over code. So clearly nobody is actually caring about &#x27;saving&#x27; those precious seconds of reading long grammatically correct sentences. Who cares if someone uses it as a function name.')
