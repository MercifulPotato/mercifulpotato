Ironically, Steve Jobs wanted all iphone &quot;apps&quot; to just be websites, well before PWAs were a thing[1].<p>I urge every company starting out to consider a PWA before you go straight towards the native app route.  You&#x27;ll iterate&#x2F;validate faster, and still be able to publish to Android.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;9to5mac.com&#x2F;2011&#x2F;10&#x2F;21&#x2F;jobs-original-vision-for-the-iphone-no-third-party-native-apps&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;9to5mac.com&#x2F;2011&#x2F;10&#x2F;21&#x2F;jobs-original-vision-for-the-...</a>')
