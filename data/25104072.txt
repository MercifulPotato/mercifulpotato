The idea is to have a tower made out of metal and use a laser attached, inside or nearby to create a heated, ionized path of particles from the cloud to the tower. This path offers a lower resistance to the ground for the electric voltage difference which means that the lightning strike will prefer to safely follow the already ionized channel and hit the tower than to hit some random tree that ends up ablaze and igniting other trees nearby.<p>It&#x27;s like taking a helium balloon, attach a grounded metal wire and letting it rise into the midst of the cloud - just with the laser replacing the wire.')
