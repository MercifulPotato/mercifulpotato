At least here - WA State, USA.<p>I literally got a, &quot;This isn&#x27;t the right form. <i>Next</i>&quot; type response...<p>Unfortunately, glaring angrily in annoyance at the staff and not saying a word until they extended even an ounce of courtesy by <i>getting</i> the right form for me, was the only way to get through the bureaucratic BS in this situation.<p>A lot of DMV workers, for reasons beyond me, have a sort of &quot;Oh, you forgot to dot one &#x27;i&#x27; on this 300 page form. Go back to the drawing board, get in line again, and see me when you are done&quot; type of attitude. Sure, they don&#x27;t have the time to walk every single person through filling out forms, but a lot of times this lack of enthusiasm to help at all is pushed to an extreme.<p>The DMV here has a <i>very</i> strong &quot;You need US more than we need you&quot; attitude to it.<p>It&#x27;s one of the reasons I&#x27;ve spent more time driving on expired licenses or with expired car registration than I would care to admit. &quot;Oh, $50 fine? Eh.. Beats waiting in line for the DMV and hating my life for a couple days afterwards.&quot;')
