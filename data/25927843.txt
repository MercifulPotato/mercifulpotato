I&#x27;ve always been a lazy motherfucker. I didn&#x27;t get into automating things with technology because I liked to work, after all. Over the past 10 years I&#x27;d say I did honestly work a full work day when I was my most productive, but my median work day was probably around 3 hours&#x2F;day. As in, I spent the rest of it reading books in a terminal so it looked like I was doing work, or something similarly useless to my employer.<p>My employer never complained, and in fact I earned a reputation for being the guy who can get to the bottom of hard problems, deliver the simplest and quickest solution to an immediate need, or reason out and mitigate for all the ways something could go wrong. I would say I was actually good at my job despite not actually working that much. Thus, I am constantly annoyed that my employer is so insistent on butts-in-seats, to the extent that during a global pandemic I&#x27;ve only been working from home during the time I was contagious with the goddamned plague (all of my department caught it thanks to this policy).<p>Due to my rapidly failing mental health, I&#x27;d say I put in a median 3 hours&#x2F;week of work right now. Still, very few people seem to have noticed and no one has said anything.')
