App is sandboxed, and has to ask for access to every bit of your information (photos, contacts, etc)<p>2. App asks at a time when it seems reasonable (I’m taking a photo and need to save it)<p>3. Now app has the ability to exfiltrate everything you just gave it access to (like all photos), and it now has that ability (in the majority of cases) without on-device oversight')
