Item(by='Udik', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603873930, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24916111, text='I don&#x27;t see anything stunning in the NYT article- it is a very early view on an emerging political phenomenon on the other side of the ocean- certainly in a world pretty different from our own, one where open display of racism and political violence were just a cause for concern rather than absolutely unacceptable. On the other hand the world was just emerging from a war that had killed about 20 million people, while Russia had just gone through a bloody revolution that produced the first communist state- with all the hope and terror that that entailed- all followed by the Spanish flu just to to top it off (another 50 million deaths).<p>In the context, the NYT article sounds actually pretty insightful; I find the expectation that a 1922 article would describe Hitler in the exact same terms of a 2016 one to be just deeply ignorant.')
