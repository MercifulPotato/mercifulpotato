It also makes sense in context with the other basic UNIX commands: they&#x27;re almost all actions or active verb phrases in some form. &quot;Change directory&quot;, &quot;list files, &quot;touch&quot;, &quot;concatenate&quot;, etc. It makes sense, because they&#x27;re all programs you run that does stuff, they&#x27;re not variables you read. So &quot;pwd&quot; as the active &quot;print working directory&quot; makes a lot more sense than the noun phrase &quot;pathname of working directory&quot;, which sounds much more like a variable name, not a command name.')
