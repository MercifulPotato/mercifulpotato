Would be interesting to see how you ran your tests, and the results.<p>In my testing, Gatling isn&#x27;t catastrophically slow by any means. Wrk, which is faster than any other tool I&#x27;ve seen, is about <i>one</i> order of magnitude faster than Gatling, in terms of raw RPS generation. I find it very hard to believe a NodeJS-based tool executing JS would be faster than the fastest tool written in C that just hammers static URLs.')
