There&#x27;s not been any CDC recommendations about it, but here&#x27;s what they do say.<p>&gt; There is not enough information currently available to say if or for how long after infection someone is protected from getting COVID-19 again; this is called natural immunity. Early evidence suggests natural immunity from COVID-19 may not last very long, but more studies are needed to better understand this. Until we have a vaccine available and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices makes recommendations to CDC on how to best use COVID-19 vaccines, CDC cannot comment on whether people who had COVID-19 should get a COVID-19 vaccine. [1]<p>Suffice it to say, I&#x27;ll do whatever the CDC recommends.  I&#x27;ve already had COVID, so I&#x27;m guessing I&#x27;ll go last.  But at the same time, I&#x27;ll get the vaccine if it is recommended.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;coronavirus&#x2F;2019-ncov&#x2F;vaccines&#x2F;faq.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;coronavirus&#x2F;2019-ncov&#x2F;vaccines&#x2F;faq.html</a>')
