Rainbow color maps aren&#x27;t ideal for showing relative difference in values.  But they are great if you want to be able to tell what the value (range) in a given location is.  This is almost impossible with a 10-shade grey-scale legend or a height map.<p>Disclaimer: I use rainbow color maps all the time because I&#x27;m often interested in critical value areas of my plots.')
