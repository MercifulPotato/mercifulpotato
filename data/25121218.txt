(This comment is unrelated to the video)<p>I usually use 2-4 lactaid capsules when eating dairy and sometimes 8 when it’s some super cheesy pizza or something. I live in the United States. I visited Italy last year, and I ate a lot of ice cream, cheesy pastas, and pizzas without any problems. Same with my father and uncle who are lactose intolerant.

I recognize my experience is super anecdotal, but it’s quite funny as my uncle, my father, and I got cocky about our ability to eat US dairy after coming home from Italy and immediately regretted it! So yeah, we’re definitely lactose intolerant<p>Here’s also this silly link I just got off of google: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wantedinrome.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;living-with-lactose-intolerance-in-italy-vs-the-united-states.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wantedinrome.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;living-with-lactose-intole...</a>')
