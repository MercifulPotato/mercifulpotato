Item(by='tylerhou', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609973647, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25662742, text='&gt; It frustrates me to no end that a group of people say, &quot;The election had no issues&quot; just as it frustrates me when someone says, &quot;The election was stolen.&quot;<p>I think this is a strawman. Can you find me a source of a prominent* Democrat that said that this election had no issues? Most of the time, people who support the election&#x27;s outcome mean that there was no fraud significant enough to change the outcome, or that this election had less fraud&#x2F;was more secure than a previous election.<p>On the other hand, when Trump says the election was stolen [1] (along with some Congressional Republicans), he means that the outcome should have been him winning.<p>*Prominent being: US Senator, US Representative, Secretary of State, state election official, state governor, DNC leadership.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;realDonaldTrump&#x2F;status&#x2F;1346928882595885058" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;realDonaldTrump&#x2F;status&#x2F;13469288825958850...</a>')
