I am about to start funding phase from next month for seed round!<p>1. Great starting point for me.\n2. It currently only supports &quot;what to do ?&quot;, would love to \n   see &quot;how to ?&quot;\n3. Since, the product deals only with fundings there are few \n   principles&#x2F;templates for every funding stage and would love \n   to see any documentations for the same atleast from YC \n   alumni\n4. I wish if there were any mandatory templates&#x2F;steps to cover \n   in intro till closure.\n5. Either way, a great resource for me to keep a tab!\n   Thanks guys, All the best! :)\n   first meeting')
