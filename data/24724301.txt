I would bet that at least some of the members of the Supreme Court do not even know how to check and send email.  In the same way they depend on others to perform basic and advanced computer tasks, they should depend on a &quot;jury&quot; of tech experts to filter the cases and provide suggestions or hopefully reasonable analogies to concepts the judges can comprehend.<p>But now, on the topic of copyrighting APIs... it&#x27;s stupid, and it&#x27;s protectionist, and it&#x27;s the kind of thing a company does when they can&#x27;t compete or want to try to block competition.  Most types of copyright are bogus for the same reasons.  Not only is there the strong possibility of more than one person coming up with the same idea at approximately the same time, in different places, but very few ideas are truly unique or revolutionary.  Instead, it becomes a race to see who can copyright (or patent) something first - either defensively or with future hopes of preventing competition or extracting payment from a competitor.<p>If modern copyright and patent law had always existed, humanity would be decades or perhaps centuries behind where it is now.')
