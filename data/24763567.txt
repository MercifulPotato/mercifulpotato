I think this is much easier to grasp than the tables in the linked paper.<p>The very first graph shows that it&#x27;s not &quot;just another flu&quot;. Abnormally many deaths, even with the strict measures. Mainly for those aged 45 and older (but also not just &quot;old people&quot; dying, lots in the group 45-64).<p>Further down &quot;Z-scores by country&quot; also shows a pretty normal curve for Norway and Denmark but many excessive deaths for Sweden, meaning the notion of &quot;sweden just reports covid deaths differently&quot; that was common a few months back isn&#x27;t an explanation.')
