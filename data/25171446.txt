So you have ‘docker build’ happening toward the end of a set of other tasks. Which I’d really like to have running on a fresh VM or container.<p>You could separate those into two builds, but the reason they are together is so people think about deployment, and in case any structural changes to the code need to coincide with deployment changes. For instance, breaking changes in APIs. I need a new version of tool&#x2F;library and I need to change how I call it.')
