This story does not fit the character I met.<p>* There is a campaign of disinformation, character assassination and harrassment going on against the Debian project, the FSFE, and their members (maybe other projects as well). This has been going on for multiple years now, presumably all orchestrated by the same individual, impersonating a multitude of different persons.<p>Edit:<p>I also met Malina Galina in person, she made a positive impression on me. I just found out the linked text also shows up on her twitter account.')
