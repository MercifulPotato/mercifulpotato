What I&#x27;ve seen is that having fewer, fatter compilation units speeds up compilation the same way &#x27;unity builds&#x27; do.   Instead of having a single monolithic compilation unit, a balance can be used to iterate faster and use multiple cores.  Compilation units can be groups of things that are changed more or less frequently.<p>&gt; But I do dispute that the &quot;vast majority&quot; allow or require separate compilation<p>It isn&#x27;t about the library always being made for separate compilation.  The reality is that unless you are using something fairly fundamental it will probably only need to be in one compilation unit in the first place.<p>What does need to be shared are data structures and those ideally have as little logic and dependencies as possible.')
