I&#x27;ve had bloody stools before, (I&#x27;m 32), but when the doctor checked, they found a fissure, which I guess was good enough for them to explain the bleeding... Well, now the symptoms are back, and no fissure to be found, so I&#x27;m seeing a gastroenterologist tomorrow. Fingers crossed, but I&#x27;m thinking I&#x27;ll get to find out how painless a colonoscopy really is.')
