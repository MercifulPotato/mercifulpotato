In that sense, this is a great timing for their IPO. However I wouldn&#x27;t buy. I am happy to lose any potential gains if I am wrong but I am way too skeptical to jump in. I really think the market for delivery is not there to the extent we see now. In fact they will have a severely depressed couple of quarters once people get the vaccine. It will take some time for it to pickup and even then I would expect the traffic to be around 50% of what it is now.')
