(My probability that I had learned started rising fast 2 or 3 levels earlier, but it took a few levels to reach .95 confidence.)<p>I.e., my curiosity over whether I had learned a <i>general</i> solution to that class of puzzle kept my interest.<p>But more importantly, I enjoy purely perceptual tasks. There is almost no cognitive skill involved for example in piecing together a jigsaw puzzle or playing a game of billards. (At very high levels of skill, maybe billards demands significant cognitive work, e.g., leaving the table in a state designed to exploit weakness in one&#x27;s opponent&#x27;s skills, but that does not apply to the game under discussion.) Maybe the difference between you and I is that I enjoy purely perceptual tasks whereas you do not.')
