Because getting lower with higher temperatures dramatically increases the energy generation.  As opposed to sort of current minimal viable depth&#x2F;temperatures.<p>So is it possible that with some significant engineering advances the costs would go down and generation would go up quite a bit?  To me the article is suggesting research investment to improve the materials and technology to go deeper less expensively.<p>Can you provide any insight into the feasibility of that type of research paying off?  Do you know of any promising techniques, materials, designs?  Or maybe you feel like they are insurmountable challenges?  Thanks for any details.')
