Cogging is either a complete stall, or really jerky behavior that feels pretty close to what an ICE is like at very low RPMs. *<p>There are different motor designs out there that alter power delivery for situations where very low-RPM torque is required.  As with most design decisions, there are trade-offs involved.<p>And yeah, I&#x27;m sure a torque converter would be helpful in that situation.  But I think that generally, passenger cars don&#x27;t need to go very fast, so most EVs can get away with short enough gearing that cogging isn&#x27;t an issue, at the expense of top seed.<p>* hold some low-power electric motor in your hands, turn it on then gradually clap the output with your fingers.  You&#x27;ll eventually feel the power output go to nothing and the motor will wind.  That&#x27;s cogging.<p>Also, the whole &quot;peak torque at 0 RPMs&quot; thing is really a side effect of the fact that electric motors produce consistent power across the rev band (except at really low, and really high RPMs).  And the formula for power is power = torque * RPM.  Since power is essentially fixed with an electric motor, you rearrange that equation to be torque = power &#x2F; RPM, and peak torque is at the limit as RPM goes to 0.<p>In real world applications, torque output is limited by physics and current delivery, so peak torque is truncated at low RPMs.')
