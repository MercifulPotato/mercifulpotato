Because it helps keep the valve seats from degrading. We have other anti-knock additives, but nobody has figured out a replacement for the other properties that lead has.<p>And since aircraft are usually extremely long-lived, we&#x27;ll be stuck with this problem until a substitute is found. Merely certifying new engines that don&#x27;t require lead won&#x27;t solve the problem because of the remainder of the fleet that does require leaded gas.')
