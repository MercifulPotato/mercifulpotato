If you don&#x27;t believe in them you just don&#x27;t invest in them. It&#x27;s that simple.<p>I&#x27;m not sure the world would have been a worse place for  it to have been profitable to point out the failings of say, Theranos.<p>And the unlimited downside means that shorting startups that are merely <i>unlikely to succeed</i> wouldn&#x27;t be worth the effort.<p>Shorting public companies that can survive COVID perfectly well by raising additional funds would be a terrible strategy too: their ability to raise funds won&#x27;t really be dependent on their share price (they&#x27;ll be raising debt funding instead) but every time they find a lender the share price will rebound.')
