I&#x27;ve also broken bones, some of which will hurt until the end of my life.<p>I agree with your point of view on hikes. It&#x27;s a mind game.<p>But that&#x27;s not the whole story. For some people, pain doesn&#x27;t end. Pain is every day, and you get nothing in exchange. No trees, no fresh air, just pain.<p>I could go on, lay out the difference between pain and the resulting mental suffering. While you can&#x27;t always avoid the former, the latter is up to you. But that&#x27;s a whole other story.<p>Congrats on your achievements. Man, I wish I could go back hiking. You learned how to conquer your pain, may it be inconsequential and temporary. Bear in mind that, sometimes, it has long term (everlasting?) consequences. And that makes it completely different.<p>Avoid consequences. Really, do.')
