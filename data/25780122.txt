Those in the power seats and politicians have a vested interest in taking an active part in the management of agricultural production.<p>I grew up on a small citrus farm, I saw NAFTA and the migrant worker bills ravage the small farmers first hand. The way it was done was unfair and amounted to a transfer of wealth to these entities but with that being said, I know why they did it. They need economies of scale, as well as the ability to offset risk, the easiest way to do that is to conglomerate the land together so that if there is a loss of production in one area output can be raised in another. This is hard to do with a co-op of independent farmers.<p>Starving people are dangerous to stability it really is as simple as that, and that is why you see these entities involved in farmlands.')
