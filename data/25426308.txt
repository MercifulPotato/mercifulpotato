Hedge Funds, VC Funds, PE Funds, Ect) that are generating very strong and consistent returns, often 25% IRR or more.<p>However, the average investor will never have the ability to invest due to the lack of connections and fact that most have a min. check size - typically $1 M or more.<p>I have built an application that pools together smaller check sizes with a much smaller minimum and diversifies your investment across VC&#x2F;Hedge&#x2F;PE Funds in the top quartile of performance.<p>Look forward to your comments.')
