Even if the information is outside of your control, you now know what to expect. Knowing gives us a feeling of control over a situation, even if we don’t.<p>1a) Things change in the time you’re in the air. You also have to be proactive to get that information ahead of time, as opposed to passive to hear it from the captain.<p>2) Little inconveniences add up. Sure, an armrest being down is probably not a thing at all. But it’s annoying when I’m trying to get past it, and I always have to put it up. It’s another straw on the camel’s back.<p>3) Not having to put the armrests down probably helps with their cleaning times. Again, not a huge amount, but a few minutes for each cleaning job.')
