We&#x27;re only a couple steps away from tech&#x2F;media being able to dictate that we&#x27;ve always been at war with Eastasia, with a horde of willing partisans being eager to punish any sort of dissent on the matter. Being hypocritical is unimportant if you have the ability to mess with the lives of those who are too vocal in pointing out whatever hypocrisy. Most people are perfectly rational in not being willing to risk cancellation by speaking up.')
