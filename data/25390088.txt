One study from 2015 (1) showed that even testing the corrosion resistance of metals was difficult because the type of crucible used had a large effect on the results.<p>These systems need pumps at a minimum.  Sensors (temp, ph, flow rate, chemical composition, etc.) are also very important for prolonged, low maintenance use.  These cannot be made of ceramics (that I know of)<p>The container will also need to safely hold a dense pool of molten salt.  The linked $88k test reactor has a capacity of 350 liters, which at 1.94 g&#x2F;cc is ~680kg&#x2F;1500lbs of Li2BeF4.<p>Another important reason is that heat transfer is the whole point of the reactor, and most metal alternatives have poor thermal properties.<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.researchgate.net&#x2F;publication&#x2F;282433901_Impact_of_Corrosion_Test_Container_Material_in_Molten_Fluorides" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.researchgate.net&#x2F;publication&#x2F;282433901_Impact_of...</a>')
