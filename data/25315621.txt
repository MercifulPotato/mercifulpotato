Maybe you are from a country where porn is illegal? In America, the legal definition of porn is pretty much anything designed to cause sexual excitement. I could make a video of myself walking around in my high heels, and that would count as porn. Getting the government involved before I shared my sexy engineer legs to PornHub&#x2F;YouTube&#x2F;Telegram would kill that, and probably also kill the platforms that were made great by enabling that.')
