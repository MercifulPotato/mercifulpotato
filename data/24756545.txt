Along with that though, I&#x27;m curious if you&#x27;ve done any performance testing comparisons? This could very well be out of date now but at some point I read that accessing properties on a proxied object are like 600 times slower than a regular JS object. I wonder if that could be a bottleneck if you&#x27;re doing state updates on, say, scroll events or something.<p>I&#x27;ve been able to notice performance hiccups in these cases even just using React state. Of course debouncing usually helps.')
