I was not able to beat it with anything on ARM, including hand-coded assembly, at least for sgemm and simple dot products, which are bread and butter of deep learning. It actually baffles me that Microsoft is not offering linear algebra and DSP acceleration in Windows out of the box. This creates friction, and most devs don&#x27;t give a shit, so Windows users end up with worse perf on essentially the same hardware.')
