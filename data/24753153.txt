I didn&#x27;t handle the diagonal case (which I was explicitly aware of) nor did it have unit tests.<p>Did I mention I had to do it from scratch live with the interviewer within <i>1 hour</i>. Thats 1 hour to plan and implement from a blank slate from &quot;hey write me tic tac toe with react&quot;?<p>Never mind that It was functional, had a hook for me to handle the diagonal case if I had time and aside from that, worked!<p>Nevermind that I had completed a few projects on their platform already and have a great rating. That I have experience working in a few startups in Silicon valley under my belt. Nevermind that I have open source contributions and was a key speaker in a js conference.<p>I can&#x27;t write a complete tic tac toe from scratch WITH unit tests from a cold start and a blank slate in less than an hour.<p>Sometimes I feel like its becoming a race to the bottom. As CTO of a startup right now, I spent days deliberating and planning out the db schema we use to optimize for our main use cases while allowing some deeper queries for analytics. I write stored procedures and convert business rules into working software that scales. Under our last load test, 90% of the reqs were served in less that 250 ms. I do code reviews in js, elxir and sql on the regular have trained other engineers on obscure sql like nested joing an unnest() ing json arrays for analytics.<p>Yet somehow my value can be arbitrarily broken down to &quot;he&#x27;s not good enough because he can&#x27;t scope, plan and impliment a full app with unit tests within an hour&quot;<p>&#x2F;endrant')
