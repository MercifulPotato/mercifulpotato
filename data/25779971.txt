How does that help the business?.<p>Regarding to libraries, there&#x27;s not much to discuss.<p>Just look at the number of available packages as right now:<p>rubygems: 164,235 (source: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rubygems.org&#x2F;stats" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rubygems.org&#x2F;stats</a>)\nNPM: millions (source: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Npm_(software)" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Npm_(software)</a>)\nPyPI: 283,519 (source: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pypi.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pypi.org&#x2F;</a>)\nHEX:: 12 252<p>I&#x27;m pretty sure I can find more than one package I&#x27;ll miss.<p>&gt; My company has built a scalable platform with 3 engineers. I don&#x27;t even think about maintenance, I just think about delivering new features. So business wins are higher velocity + lower hosting costs + less downtime + senior team. You don&#x27;t need to be WhatsApp to appreciate those benefits.<p>Hosting costs are a lot cheaper for us than developer&#x27;s time. Downtime has never been an issue given &quot;cloud&quot; (docker based) infrastructure. The productivity part is something we&#x27;re not seeing to be any better than with more traditional technology, and the reason we&#x27;re moving away.<p>I wonder if what your team of 3 people is building couldn&#x27;t have been built with just one engineer and ruby on rails at the expense of paying for two more servers.')
