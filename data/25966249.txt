One would expect to see these in EU, but I see only these from US companies around here.<p>I never said a thing against public funding. That is not the same thing as developed publicly.<p>Thinking you can just go and develop a mRNA vaccine sounds like Dunning-Kruger to me. It took decades of research done by highly paid, highly specialized people highly driven towards a business goal and thus profit. I am not aware of any public entity doing that kind of research and actually successfully applying it too. (Yes, the development stands on the shoulders of public basic research. Not the same thing.)')
