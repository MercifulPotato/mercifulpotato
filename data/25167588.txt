This is true of some of their other sectors.  Yes, they can do some things incredibly quickly by more or less ramming them through at top speed using a combination of government and state-affiliated corporations.  But the ways they achieve those results at speed are not necessarily transferable to other countries.<p>I also get a bit nervous about how fast they&#x27;ve scaled their nuclear sector and pumped out plants.  It reminds me a bit of the big historical push the USSR did into nuclear tech -- which culminated in the Chernobyl incident because they overlooked issues they should not have in order to keep things moving fast.<p>A lot of technology and engineering lessons have been learned since those days... and so far I haven&#x27;t heard anything specifically concerning about China&#x27;s nuclear reactor fleet. But there&#x27;s always going to be a little doubt in the back of my mind.')
