State channels (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;statechannels.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;statechannels.org&#x2F;</a>) are a L2 blockchain scaling tool that enables peers to execute many blockchain transactions involving a fixed set of peers, at a fixed cost -- after some initial setup, transactions only involve network messaging. We previously released Web3torrent as a proof of concept (previous discussion: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23602008" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23602008</a>) and are currently collaborating with The Graph to implement state channels on a large scale on mainnet (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thegraph.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;the-graph-brings-state-channels-to-ethereum" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thegraph.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;the-graph-brings-state-channels-to...</a>).<p>We&#x27;re currently hiring a full stack developer, though we will happily consider any candidate with an appropriate background and a keen interest in our project. Our stack includes Typescript, PostgreSQL, Solidity, Rust, and React. We&#x27;ve also used TLA+ for some formal verification (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.statechannels.org&#x2F;breaking-state-channels&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.statechannels.org&#x2F;breaking-state-channels&#x2F;</a>), and aim to use more tools to verify our protocols and implementations.<p>Full time employment is preferred, though many of our team work part-time, and we are open to flexible working arrangements.<p>See our job posting at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;consensys.net&#x2F;open-roles&#x2F;2510553&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;consensys.net&#x2F;open-roles&#x2F;2510553&#x2F;</a>, or email me directly (andrew DOT stewart [at] mesh DOT xyz) if you have any questions.')
