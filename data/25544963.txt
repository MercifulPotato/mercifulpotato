It&#x27;d be amazing to be able to have some onsite high pressure or even cryogenic storage of hydrogen to be able to store a summer solar surplus for use in the winter.<p>Hydrogen really doesn&#x27;t like to be stored though. It also ruins any storage vessel it is kept in long term.<p>You see Hydrogen is the smallest atom, small enough to fit between atoms of other materiel. and it will work its way through materials and sometimes bonding with the material sometimes just escaping, this creates a spoilage of the materiel the holding vessel is made of resulting in hydrogen embrittlement, creation of cracks and voids inside the metal,<p>About the only materiel we believe to be immune are carbon fullerenes and graphene. Which we have had problems producing at scale.<p>as for cryonic storing it you are just adding another energy cost to they system because you are spending more energy still to chill the hydrogen<p>&gt;It looks like you can blend it at some modest proportion into existing natural gas infrastructure to lighten its environmental burden somewhat.<p>and this makes less since.<p>You have to spend more energy to make the H_2 by splitting the H2O than you get out of burning the H_2, so adding it to natural gas to make it more environmentally efficient doesn&#x27;t make since as you are increasing the net energy cost of the system than just burning the natural gas.')
