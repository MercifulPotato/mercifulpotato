You can rationalize it any way you want if it makes you feel better, you can pretend it&#x27;s a fight for freedom on one side, and a fight for oppression on the other, you can say those school children were just combatants. But in the end it&#x27;s the same on either side: those with power kill to maintain it. Some kill locally, some kill globally.<p>On the other hand the examples you gave are absolutely minor and barely noteworthy. I referred decisions with global impact, not inconsequential things like Google News being affected in Spain. Intel never payed the fine the EU imposed for unfair practices close to a decade ago. Facebook and Google barely saw a blip due to GDPR since it was basically (an legally it seems) rolled into their ToS.<p>The real consequential things are the public support the US demands from the EU for sanctions or wars. For economical issues that involve far more than you mentioned as a counterpoint.')
