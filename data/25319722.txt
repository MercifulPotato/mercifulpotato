It&#x27;s usually frowned upon and recommended to avoid for Philosophy students exactly for the same reasons I think it&#x27;s one of the best books ever written:<p>It doesn&#x27;t shy away of critique and dispute, as it was written by a practicing philosopher (who still values objectivity and holds to high standards of reasoning). The language is wonderful and historical bits to set the context are great.<p>I also recommend Anthony Gottlieb&#x27;s &quot;The Dream Of Reason&quot; and &quot;The Dream of Enlightenment&quot;, as the second and third book (if you liked the first one). They are more recent and sometimes expand on some things Russel deemed of lesser importance. Again, exceptionally well written.')
