Item(by='CaptArmchair', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605776414, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25135102, text='&gt; they were too poor<p>Beware of value attribution and hindsight bias.<p>First, historic cuisines and diets evolved throughout history, and differed greatly depending by geographic location. Beware of generalizing particular historic contexts. You can&#x27;t reliably extrapolate the dietary patterns of European serfs - as explained by their particular socio-economic context - and apply that the Mayan culture during the Classic period (same time frame 200-900 AD).<p>Second, the &quot;they were too poor&quot; argument only carries meaning in concrete socio-economic contexts. Even then, do note that the modern liberal conceptual framework of poor and rich didn&#x27;t exist in earlier times. This even holds up today. It&#x27;s tenuous claim to assume that, for instance, native cultures perceive themselves as &quot;poor&quot;. If they do see themselves as &quot;poor&quot; today, that&#x27;s always in reference to the dominant modern economic model based on western liberal enlightenment values and principles which has impacted their culture as an external factor.<p>&gt; People used to walk. Not because it was nice and healthy but because they had no choice.<p>They didn&#x27;t have a choice, but that doesn&#x27;t say anything about how people perceived  relying on muscle power across history, culture and geographical location.<p>Just 20 years ago, nobody considered the absence of social media and smartphones as a fundamental lacking in life. That&#x27;s totally different today. For a short while, it was a choice, today, access to digital technology is a hard requirement in order to be able to participate in modern industrialized society. This is an example of how a feedback loop was created between availability and demand creating an artificial need. The same is true for most modern conveniences.<p>I&#x27;m deeply happy that I don&#x27;t have to live a relatively short life working land, foraging or hunting game. But at the same time, I&#x27;m very much aware that&#x27;s a hindsight bias and I&#x27;m very much aware that most modern conveniences aren&#x27;t a prerequisite for the survival of humanity. As it stands, many of those modern conveniences have contributed to the existential threat which is Climate Change.')
