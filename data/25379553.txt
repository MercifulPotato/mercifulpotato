Some big companies get sued under GDPR.  This sets precedents and makes complying with GDPR more expensive.  Because it is now harder to comply with GDPR, that becomes a barrier to entry for new companies.  The fact that the barrier to entry exists makes the big companies more profitable.  And the fact that the regulatory scheme improves their profit margins will incentivize the internet giants to engage in regulatory capture and improve their profit margins even more.<p>The result?  The big internet companies wind up like Brer Rabbit.  They say, &quot;Donâ€™t throw me into the briar patch.&quot;')
