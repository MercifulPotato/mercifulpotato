Item(by='toyg', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604668277, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25007146, text='The OpenSSH sshd executable, in absence of a sshd_config, disables it - and rightly so, because you have to specify a server executable to manage it, which may or may not be available. It just so happens most distributions enable it by default. However, a hardened configuration could legitimately disable, to reduce attack space - it&#x27;s an extra executable where things can go wrong and be exploited. There is also no requirement for non-OpenSSH implementations to have it.<p>To be clear, the problem is not that sftp is unlikely to be available, but that it&#x27;s <i>possible</i> that it will be the case; hence it does not replace scp in that scenario without complete loss of functionality. It is an objectively inferior option.')
