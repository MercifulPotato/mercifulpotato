They really didn&#x27;t like me Googling some basic stuff.<p>The second time I still used Python, but had 5 years experience using it behind. Can&#x27;t be objective but it was probably the best interview I&#x27;ve ever done. Reviewed my code afterwards, and could only come up with minor improvements. Got refused, I asked what could I improve and I got a very generic &quot;not a good match for the team&quot; which, in retrospect, reading your comment, could have been very accurate.')
