The community here is really playing up the drama in a childish way. Many games have had far worse launches, and got panned in reviews (both critic and user), and haven&#x27;t seen this kind of outrage.<p>The gaming community sucks, full stop. I&#x27;m part of several reddit communities for various games and in a majority of the cases those subreddits are a swamp, full of anger and bitterness. The more competitive a game is, or the more the game tries to monetize itself, the uglier the scene. It really is bad.<p>Years ago I worked close to one of Rockstar&#x27;s studios.
