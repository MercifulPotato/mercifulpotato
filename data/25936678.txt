That is actually in our charter documents and is a legal requirement.<p>On a practical level, Mark Cuban is our lead investor and his interest is very much focused on helping people and fixing system issues in healthcare. We also did some screening to ensure our other investors are socially minded and prioritize social benefit as well as profits.<p>My mindset is that we need to be profitable to be sustainable and grow enough to help the overall system, but we won&#x27;t be extortionate.')
