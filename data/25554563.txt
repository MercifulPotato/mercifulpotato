It&#x27;s important to remember that ARMv7 is still a product. The Innovator&#x27;s Dilemma may blindly say to cannibalize, but instead, ARM probably thinks that these are two different sectors. The 64b sector doesn&#x27;t need Thumb (which comes at an opcode space + decoder cost). The chips that ARMv8 are going into have massive DRAMs and while Thumb saves some, it wasn&#x27;t enough. RISC-V on the other hand is all things to all people. So an embedded chip needs the possibility of Cray style vectors because reasons.<p>I do think that if someone wants an 8-wide RISC-V decoder all they have to do is throw the transistors at it. That&#x27;s a consequence of fixed width. Yeah, RVC will require more transistors, but not n^2 (?) like X86 does.<p>RISC-V is pretty elegant, well except for the bit manipulation nonsense. They really should have plagiarized ARM instead of Intel there.')
