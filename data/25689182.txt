(I posted another comment a bit further up on how to pipe your audio through OBS to implement this. There are undoubtedly simpler options.)<p>In my experience, it does a great job cancelling out keyboard clicks and clacks. Even if I sit here and slam on my spacebar harder than I&#x27;d ever hit it even writing an angry email, it&#x27;s cancelling it all. And I&#x27;ve never had an issue with it _not_ picking up my voice.<p>If you&#x27;re just looking for _a_ solution to the problem, I&#x27;d give something with RNNoise a try.')
