I doubt this time will be different.  Tesla made the touchscreen dominant, but Apple won&#x27;t copy it.  Touch screens in cars leave a lot to be desired -- they aren&#x27;t particularly ergonomic and they lead to screen fatigue.  They also don&#x27;t make much sense in a fully autonomous era.<p>Apple will likely build an AR-centric user experience using the windshield and new control paradigms.  There&#x27;s a huge area for creativity here and I don&#x27;t doubt Apple can come up with something that will make a big touch screen seem archaic.  If they can make the driver optional, there&#x27;s even more room to think different.')
