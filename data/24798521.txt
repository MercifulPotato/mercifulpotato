Item(by='Karrot_Kream', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602833857, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24798297, text='&gt; I gave an example of the &quot;good things&quot; I was talking about:<p>&gt;&gt; Reading a dry article on police brutality (which letâ€™s face it, people just skipped over in the past) is a lot less impactful than seeing something shared by a friend.<p>&gt; Attitudes towards for example LGBT people and on racial issues are have advanced significantly since 2000, and I think social media has a lot to do with that. (One of the major issues cited by people for why they switched their opinion on same-sex marriage was knowing people in committed same-sex relationships. Social media makes those things more visible.)<p>Fair enough. I disagree. I think social media has also helped radicalize folks, though I feel that nothing has really changed (not a positive change either). The press was, after all, hopelessly partisan and sensational for most of the West&#x27;s history. We just had a brief respite. But fair enough and thanks for clarifying.<p>&gt; As to right-wing populism: it is not fascism, any more than left-wing populism is Jacobinism or anarchy.<p>What&#x27;s the difference really? I&#x27;m not talking about the boogeyman &quot;literally fascist&quot; thing. Fascist regimes themselves frequently started out as right wing populist representative regimes. Hitler is a fantastic example of that transformation ad absurdum, but there are several other simpler ones, like Franco. And these fascist regimes often started out quite popular.<p>And likewise with left populism. Stalin and Napoleon are left populism ad absurdum, but we have several more &quot;mundane&quot; examples, such as Tito or Hoxa. I think extremism is bad because of its tendency to flout the rule of law. I see that happening around the world all over again.')
