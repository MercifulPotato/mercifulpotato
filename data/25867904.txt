It&#x27;s a just-world fallacy: because free speech is a good and just thing, a business model predicated on free speech will be successful.<p>The first trouble is that you are opening the doors to all sorts of extremists. Whether they&#x27;re far left, far right or simply personally unhinged, they are as predatory as spammers. They have no qualms about abusing your good will and s**ing in the punch bowl.<p>Same thing happened with Gab and Minds, but also smaller bulletin boards I&#x27;ve seen over the years. You set up a free speech site, and next thing you have a bunch of Nazis festooning it with swastikas. They&#x27;re just like spammers, except they&#x27;re spamming ideology instead of work from home scams.<p>The second trouble is that Parler is a competitor to established media corporations, who have a strong incentive to shut them down. That&#x27;s a reality that every new business needs to face: established firms do not want competition.<p>All the people running amok provide the established firms with plenty of ammo to tar the upstart&#x27;s reputation. And while they are biased by their incentives, they feel they are acting justly because they see all the extremist lunatics there. AWS didn&#x27;t fabricate those incidents on Parler, all those were real posts.')
