Other than these two, there&#x27;s the less specific discussion of disease during the New World colonization epoch.<p>I suspect that COVID-19 will replace the Spanish Flu as the &quot;pandemic everyone talks about when there&#x27;s a pandemic concern,&quot; but this is the sort of mention that requires explanation because it&#x27;s not really part of the expected repertoire of history the same way the Black Death is.')
