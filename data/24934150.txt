If a developer goes off incorrect information on MDN it can waste days-to-weeks of development effort and potentially lead to defective software in end-users&#x27; hands.<p>To be fair, maybe people should view MDN skeptically just like they do Wikipedia. But I think it&#x27;s valuable for it to be a reliable source and review-first is a good way to maintain that.')
