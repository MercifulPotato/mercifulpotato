You need to think 4-dimensionally: everyone was a &quot;theoretical&quot; person if you go back far enough and making rules that harm people in the future but not in the present leads to wild temporal inconsistencies.<p>Perhaps it&#x27;s clearer to think about a person-slot of a particular type in a particular time.
