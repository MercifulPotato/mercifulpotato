Is this correct?<p>I would set my hyper params in a spreadsheet, which would kick off training runs on a cluster, and report the results back in the spreadsheet hours&#x2F;days later(really TSVs, but my UI was a spreadsheet). And repeat.<p>This was primitive stuff, and haven&#x27;t done DL in a while, so not even sure if hyperparam tuning is still a thing or if that is all automated now.')
