It was pretty fantastic to see it big screen a 70mm print (not that I can really tell, heh), especially with a packed theater full of longtime fans and fellow latecomers. But I honestly don&#x27;t know if I could&#x27;ve sat through its long stretches of weirdness if I had Netflixed it in my living room; I was not at all prepared for how long the opening apes scene would go on for, having only previously experienced it as parody in The Simpsons.')
