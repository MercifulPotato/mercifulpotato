If it&#x27;s never rained on 2% of Monday&#x27;s in NYC then a 2% prediction would make sense.<p>From the article:\n&gt; Premise 1: If you give a probability, you must be willing to wager on it<p>The best way to settle this is have Talib bet on Trump to win at 50% odds (or whatever he thinks is appropriate) every day up until the election and Silver to bet using his odds (currently around 10%). May the more accurate prediction prevail. Too late for this election, but there will be plenty more elections in the future.')
