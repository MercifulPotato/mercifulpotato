The desire to use it while avoiding integration with a &quot;base system&quot; seems mutually exclusive to me.  I think one of us is failing to model the other properly.<p>Can you elaborate on:<p>- Why your existing bubblewrap&#x2F;flatpak-spawn&#x2F;bash-wrapper works only okay, and why Bedrock might be a possible improvement?  From where I&#x27;m sitting the limitation with the system you&#x27;ve described is that it does not integrate well with the rest of the system; however, you explicitly don&#x27;t want it to.<p>- Why you don&#x27;t want to use Bedrock Linux as your distro?  On the one hand, this might just be a matter of definition; if you define Bedrock as something other than a distro, would it then meet your needs?  It certainly isn&#x27;t a distro in the traditional sense; Bedrock&#x27;s documentation refers to it as a &quot;meta distribution&quot; for this reason [0].  On the other hand, if it&#x27;s due to some concrete failing on Bedrock&#x27;s part - it certainly isn&#x27;t perfect - it&#x27;s not clear to me how using as an alternative packaging system independent of your distro would alleviate that failing.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bedrocklinux.org&#x2F;faq.html#what-is-meta" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bedrocklinux.org&#x2F;faq.html#what-is-meta</a>')
