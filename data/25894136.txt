What seems interesting here is the fact that France uses Malinois dogs, which seems a bit odd. They are insanely trainable and smart(I am saying that as someone who owns a working line Malinois) but their noses are nowhere nearly as effective or sensitive as say terriers(which is what they have gone for in Czechia).
