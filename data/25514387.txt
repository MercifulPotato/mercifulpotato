The tough part is the Cat6a or higher cabling. If I understand correctly, properly terminating Cat6a to a spec-conforming level is <i>hard</i>, even professional cable puller don&#x27;t always get it right. Besides all the tools and testers (which cost more money), you also need skill to ensure your cables are actually performing up to spec. And skill isn&#x27;t something that you can necessarily buy with money.')
