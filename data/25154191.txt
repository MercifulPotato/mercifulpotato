By the time you&#x27;ve scrolled to the bottom of the homepage it&#x27;s loaded &gt;2MB. The convert pretty well, and my experience is that Stripe knows what they are doing better than most. So what should we be optimising for? Total page size? or a lightning fast experience with non-blocking content which can be as big as we require?<p>IMO developers need to optimise for building <i>fast</i> sites, not <i>light</i> ones for the sake of being light.')
