The political leadership and the bureaucracy are &#x27;government&#x27; - if they are failing even primarily due to arbitrary change in direction ... then we can at least narrow the scope of where we point our fingers, but it doesn&#x27;t mean that &#x27;building a subway should be impossible&#x27; in 2020.<p>The US engaged and defeated the Nazis, and the Japanese, and built the first Nuclear Weapon, along with designing several new weapons and building them at large ... in the term of a single presidential cycle.<p>Without being overly cynical, I do believe that incentives matter, and if the bureaucracy doesn&#x27;t have to produce much of real value then it just won&#x27;t.')
