By modern software engineering standards, the original Tex implementation is a <i>nightmare</i>. It&#x27;s enormously difficult to extend or add new features, and this has resulted in (1) comparatively few extensions being made and (2) when such extensions have been made (e.g. Xetex), they are very difficult technically.')
