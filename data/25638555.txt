Unfortunately I&#x27;d have to pay back the $10k relocation package if I left, so I decided to stick it out.<p>Last year I interviewed with a company and was ready to take the job but I had drinks with the manager and decided it was too much of a brogrammer shop for me.  Looking back, if I had taken the job, I would have worked with friends, the brogrammer aspect wasn&#x27;t as bad as I thought, and I&#x27;d be planning my retirement after 3 years of work.<p>Sometimes you just never know.
