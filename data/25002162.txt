I just finished the MVP of my quarantine project, a web app to take notes with timestamps on YouTube videos, now online at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sidenote.me" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sidenote.me</a><p>This is something I use for myself to create my own summaries of conference talks and content-rich videos, also so that I can easily jump back to the moment of the video that’s referred in my notes. Here is an example: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sidenote.me&#x2F;note&#x2F;kFedP0DrC6la&#x2F;how-i-study-languages-my-current-self-study-approach" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sidenote.me&#x2F;note&#x2F;kFedP0DrC6la&#x2F;how-i-study-languages-...</a><p>For now it’s just a little tool I built for myself, and I decided to open it up for others to create and share their notes as well if they find it useful.<p>Given that I&#x27;m not selling anything, I haven’t figure out yet how to grow a user base and even less how to monetize it. If anyone has ideas about that, please share.<p>Thanks for reading up until now, all feedback is welcome!')
