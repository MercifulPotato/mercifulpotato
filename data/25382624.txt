As soon as you booted anything of note it was pretty obvious that you&#x27;d have to offload to the SPUs. I&#x27;m not saying that it wasn&#x27;t more work, but most of the other teams we talked with who had done PS3 as a baseline first had a much, much easier time of it.<p>I would say that any console&#x2F;handheld developer the approach wasn&#x27;t unfamiliar, but there were certainly a fair number of engines with roots in the PC space that had a rough time of it. That said it was more down to the SPUs than anything related a unified memory architecture(although we did do some fun shenanigans around streaming music back from VRAM to the CPU to give us more system memory headroom).')
