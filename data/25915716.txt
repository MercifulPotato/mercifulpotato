The important difference being that CentOS is&#x2F;was downstream of RHEL. So, repacked RHEL to remove the branding, but otherwise exactly the same. This obviously competes with RHEL directly if you feel like you&#x27;re able and willing to support the system on your own.<p>On the other hand, Fedora is upstream of RHEL. So, it serves an important role as a testing ground for stuff that may or may not end up in RHEL later down the line. I&#x27;m pretty sure you&#x27;re safe, as it actually fills an essential role that is useful to Red Hat and that is very unlikely to eat into their main business.')
