A <i>Windows Service</i> is a lot like a `systemd` service.<p>In the scenario he envisions where you could see windows processes within WSL[0], it&#x27;d be possible to write a script that could invoke the windows-equivalent command to stop&#x2F;start services and print `systemd`[1]&#x2F;Windows services side-by-side, but you couldn&#x27;t make Windows services &quot;work&quot; with `systemd` tools.  Somewhat obvious, probably, but it caused me to raise an eyebrow for a second so I thought I&#x27;d mention it.<p>[0] Was it this way in WSL1? I don&#x27;t remember, it&#x27;s been too long.<p>[1] Last time I used WSL2, I ran openSuSE Leap; not sure what the default ships with.')
