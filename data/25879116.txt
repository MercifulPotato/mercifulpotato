This is evident in things such as the enormous salaries of software engineers, social media&#x27;s influence on public opinion, and Trump being able to stir his devotees to attack the US Capitol. I like the optimism of this piece - decentralized tech can revolutionize the Internet&#x27;s cloud-based economy - but I would caution falling into the same hubris that technologists felt in the early 2000s about Big Tech. FAANG does not want to give up its immense power on the Internet, and there will always be somebody looking for ways to co-opt it if we move into a decentralized Internet economy.')
