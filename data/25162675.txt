I have aphantasia[0] which might relate to my difficulty with names.<p>Now, with Anki, (if I&#x27;m using it regularly) I have a freakishly good memory for names. :)<p>Goes a long way to helping others feel welcome and appreciated, which in turn means _I_ end up feeling welcome and appreciated. A very virtuous cycle.<p>Edit: I&#x27;m a software engineer, but most of my Anki usage is not focused on software engineering directly. To create new Anki cards, I follow the &quot;20 rules for formulating knowledge&quot;[1], so it takes a bit of work before I can take some new bit of information and &quot;process&quot; it to something ready for Anki.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.facebook.com&#x2F;notes&#x2F;blake-ross&#x2F;aphantasia-how-it-feels-to-be-blind-in-your-mind&#x2F;10156834777480504&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.facebook.com&#x2F;notes&#x2F;blake-ross&#x2F;aphantasia-how-it-...</a><p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.supermemo.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;archives1990-2015&#x2F;articles&#x2F;20rules" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.supermemo.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;archives1990-2015&#x2F;articles&#x2F;20ru...</a>')
