Brexit has no benefits to us, we were doing perfectly well working with customers in Europe as well as in other countries.<p>If you were starting a tech company why would you choose to start a company in a country which appears to be decidedly against the idea of economic cooperation and free trade. A country that is deluded enough to remove itself from one trading block because, apparently, its much stronger on its own.<p>If your comment refers to some sort of utopia where trade and business is deregulated and capitalists can happily roam in the wild I&#x27;m afraid you might be disappointed. The average Brexit voter has significantly more to gain from the welfare state and big government than the current crop of politicians. Regulation isn&#x27;t going anywhere and is probably going to increase as the government seeks to prop up its finances without the aid of the EU.<p>I find Brexit an emotive topic, if only because &quot;Project Fear&quot; is and was always going to be &quot;Project Reality&quot;.')
