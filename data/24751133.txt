Just because some don&#x27;t doesn&#x27;t mean that they are letting their life outside of work go idle.  People are allowed to have other interests (e.g. hobbies) and other responsibilities (e.g family).  That doesn&#x27;t mean that they are suspect or not good.  It may mean other things, like they are a better rounded individual.')
