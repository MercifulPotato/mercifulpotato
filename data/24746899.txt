My sweet spot wast at 80-85HZ.  I tried until 90HZ, but you had to sacrifice resolution and  past 90HZ, I didn&#x27;t notice much difference.<p>I think for today&#x27;s LCD&#x2F;OLEDs 90-120hz should be the sweet spot, especially for gaming and motion.  More than that is a waste of computing.  (there are monitors that offer 144-200Hz refresh rates, but that is mostly a waste).')
