Right now I&#x27;m going through that with RTSP. I did my best to try to avoid writing my own client&#x2F;server implementation because I <i>knew</i> that I would be taking on the responsibility to run down the quirks, but after some major vendor problems here we are =(<p>Just throwing this out there for folks new in their career: if it&#x27;s been &quot;a thing&quot; for awhile you can almost guarantee that doing a full implementation against it is going to be time-consuming because of the quirks&#x2F;edge-cases. If it&#x27;s something common like handling bitmaps you <i>can</i> get ahead of your problem by reading open-source image libraries to get an idea of how much &quot;edge-case support&quot; you&#x27;re going to have to dig through.<p>I just don&#x27;t like forcing myself through &quot;clean-room&quot;&#x2F;from-RFC&#x2F;from-spec implementations unless I professionally have to - they&#x27;re almost always painful and impossible to time-manage.')
