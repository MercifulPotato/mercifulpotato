For me on Linux with Firefox as my main driver:<p>Chromium startup to empty page: 7 seconds.\nFirefox startup to page populated with tabs: 3 seconds.<p>It&#x27;s worse though - since I don&#x27;t often reboot and I have Firefox running almost all the time the <i>effective</i> start up time for Firefox for me might as well be zero.<p>Perhaps oddly, I&#x27;ve never perceived Firefox as slow - but I&#x27;d be the first to admit that I use it only for rather mundane purposes, so maybe there are use cases where it would be deficient.')
