My reference parser (Go’s net.ParseIP) understands it, but it’s not really that useful any more in the real world. At the dawn of IPv6, the idea was that you could upgrade an address to IPv6 by prepending a pair of colons, as in ::1.2.3.4, but modern transition mechanisms no longer offer anything as clear-cut as this, so the notation doesn’t really show up in the wild.<p>I have to disagree with this conclusion. I see it very frequently on Linux. It turns out that programs can bind their listen address to just ::, and the kernel will still allow connections from IPv4, with the address mapped to ::ffff:0.0.0.0&#x2F;32 -- outbound connections use the same notation.')
