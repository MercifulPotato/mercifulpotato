They might not know some formal definitions or some algos off the top of their heads, but we&#x27;ve found they&#x27;re generally more resourceful, better at thinking outside the box, and better at solving complex problems without being handheld. Not to mention that what someone learned in uni a decade ago is probably not applicable anymore whatsoever (in tech). Experience&#x2F;projects are a way, way better indicator of a potential hire&#x27;s quality than their formal education.')
