Proctortrack is an online proctoring software which school force the students to download and use. It collects, from their own privacy policy:<p>* Name and Address<p>* Zip Code<p>* Photograph of identity document, such as a driverâ€™s license<p>* Photograph of you<p>(Note: it needs a scan of your face from three angles.)<p>* Telephone Number<p>* Usernames and Passwords<p>* Name of the Test Sponsor(s)<p>* Employment information<p>* E-mail address<p>* Test submissions<p>* Screen-captures<p>* Audio and video recordings of you taking tests and the test-room environment<p>* Biometric data, including biometric identifiers (such as scans of hand or knuckles) and biometric information (such as knuckle, face, or keystroke patterns)<p>* Government-issued identification number (if required, or as included in the identity document you provide)<p>Why does it need all this information? This is yet another example of a shitty company &quot;forgetting&quot; to pay for security and the consumers (who don&#x27;t even have a choice to not use the software) have to pay.')
