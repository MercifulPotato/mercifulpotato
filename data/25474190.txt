The time delay in getting sensor data back to earth, coming up with a motion plan, then sending the plan back to be executed imposes tight limits on how fast the rover can drive, what kinds of terrain it can cover, and ultimately how much science can be done. Local autonomy for basic &quot;go over to than weird-looking rock&quot; tasks is a major improvement.')
