Good on the developer(s) for not just laying down and taking it.<p>I&#x27;m disheartened the top comment in the HN topic[0] -- while made with good intention -- suggested to capitulate to Apple&#x27;s poor argument to remove the app. The poster made some good points with respect to taking on a fight against a vastly larger entity, but falls short in their argument in support of <i>why</i> Apple decided to take their action. Apple is clearly in the wrong here and if we just lie down every time the fight <i>seems</i> insurmountable we&#x27;ll all be worse off.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25606123" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25606123</a>')
