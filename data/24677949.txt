I&#x27;ve seen this often in combinatorial expansions of data stored in hierarchal structure to a 2d table.<p>Sometimes all, or a majority, of the data is going to be touched anyway so it&#x27;s more costly to avoid a full read and instead more optimal to make the results of that read parallel; either by sorting to a more suitable structure or by working on streams &#x2F; permutations &#x2F; parallel processes from a dispatch design.')
