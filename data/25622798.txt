And though ECC is not disabled in Ryzen CPUs, AFAIK it&#x27;s not tested in (or advertised for) those, so one won&#x27;t be able to return&#x2F;replace a CPU if it doesn&#x27;t work with ECC memory, AIUI, making it risky. Though I don&#x27;t know how common it is for ECC to not be handled properly in an otherwise functioning CPU; are there any statistics or estimates around?')
