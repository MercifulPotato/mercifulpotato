To me it sounds like addiction. What has changed is not our capacity to become addicted but the willingness of some to exploit this weakness for money and&#x2F;or power. From the internet outrage generators to the social media outrage amplifiers. The addictiveness of outrage is now fully weaponised by those who have fully succumbed to the addictiveness of power and money. No handbrakes. No filters. No conscience. Lots of self denial, self delusion, self-justification.<p>The collision of these two addictions will destroy us if not unwound.<p>EDIT: auto-correct correction.')
