The hospitalization rate is not at 5% in my state, so on the face of it that number is bunk. And I doubt anyone would seriously contend that every hospitalization would be death but for hospitalization.<p>But lets take your numbers as they are. It wouldn&#x27;t be 5% of all infections, or 5% of all severe infections. It would be 5% of all infections _above hospital capacity_. Health systems wouldn&#x27;t disappear, they would just not take in more folks, or triage more aggressively. I know you address this in your comment, but it is important to note. Because it greatly changes the emotional appeal for your emotional argument to spell it out.<p>Don&#x27;t bring long-covid in to this discussion, there is no real hard evidence that it even exists AND is an artifact of covid.')
