Item(by='tialaramex', descendants=None, kids=[25962295], score=None, time=1611942897, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25957219, text='It&#x27;s tough to get the curve right.<p>I actually haven&#x27;t <i>completed</i> all that many of the packs I play, e.g. I finished Age of Engineering (even meticulously upgrading all my storage to infinity though I knew I&#x27;d probably never use it) but I didn&#x27;t technically finish Agrarian Skies (I had a few of those stretch goal quests left) or Project Ozone 2 (got bored during the last of my singularities) or even Compact Claustrophobia (I&#x27;ve run it twice, I escape, and then I tend to lose interest before getting to the Moon)<p>I recently finished Star Factory and I realised that on the one hand it was nice to be able to look at it and say yup, I have ticked every box, almost anything you could want my setup now produces in unlimited quantities -- but on the other hand of course because it&#x27;s so small it also felt cramped. I had to use very obviously bad solutions because the better options just weren&#x27;t available in the pack.<p>One problem I had in Factorio was that it seemed like it was just doing one thing over and over, with different dress up - whereas I like how Minecraft packs teach me both new things I need to do, and entirely new ways to solve problems. Writing a Predicate that automatically processes my Astral Sorcery crystals goes from an idea that I&#x27;m obviously not the first to have, to something I can do almost by reflex... and then a pack says too bad, no Integrated Dynamics so figure out a different way.<p>The other problem I had is that I like to ignore our universe&#x27;s rules, I like infinitely renewable everything, sure that&#x27;s unrealistic but it&#x27;s a video game. My Minecraft wins are generally powered by something ludicrous, like a single inexplicably efficient solar panel beaming energy from a world of eternal daylight, or a closed box which is somehow producing and burning unlimited amounts of Ethylene made from nothing. Factorio clearly doesn&#x27;t want such shenanigans.')
