Pretty much any human endeavor (philosophy, startups, physics, mathematics, literature, music, art, physical training, etc) can be much more fruitful when done in collaboration with others who are also trying hard. This is why cutting edge research continues to be done in universities, and why YC is so successful.<p>As a fan of both analytic and continental philosophy, I can also confirm that professionally trained analytic philosophers tend to be biased and limited in their arguments. But aren&#x27;t we all.<p>I agree: it&#x27;s essential to expose yourself to broader works of philosophy. I would extend this beyond Europe to Asian works of philosophy, and aboriginal and indigenous stories across the world. Outside the Eurocentric philosophy bubble, it can be harder to disentangle philosophy from religion, culture, and myth, but that&#x27;s part of the fun.<p>How idiotic would it be if there was a book called &quot;A Perfectly Complete and Eternally Correct Encyclopedia of Philosophy&quot;, and we all read it and called ourselves &#x27;philosophers&#x27;.')
