I liked the models they built around, they seemed like a good structure. Everything built very &quot;cloud-native&quot; (system state stored as Kubernetes objects).<p>But the project did explicitly pivot, sometime in the last 12 months, to explicitly declare themselves&#x2F;think of themselves as a CI&#x2F;CD system. They&#x27;re also under the Continuous Delivery Foundation now. I spent 5 minutes looking for the specific event, where this was determined&#x2F;declared, &amp; will try to follow up; hope I find it.<p>I don&#x27;t think it precludes Tekton from still being used more generally, thought of more generally. But now, doing so puts one out of alignment with the stated goals, with the project itself. I&#x27;m quite sad about this development: I think it radically undershoots the relevance of Tekton &amp; what role it ought to fill. We have all this wonderful new cloud based pieces of state, but in terms of how one piece actuates another, how we can make systems that behave autonomically: we direly need some core Event Driven Architecture logic, and Tekton definitely has some really good tools for doing that. I want very much for Tekton to meet it&#x27;s potential head on.')
