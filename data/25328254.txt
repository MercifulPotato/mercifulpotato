Once with a 6 months crunch, second time closer to 10 months of 14 hour days. That was enough for me to swear off the entire industry despite working towards it for most of my younger life.<p>Saw it what it did to our team, destroyed multiple relationships, the product suffered for it and overall both titles we&#x27;re a disaster.<p>It cuts in more than one way, aside from some really rare cases the industry compensation is abysmal compared to traditional software engineering. I basically doubled my take home salary leaving the industry while also having a sane work life balance.<p>Rami Ismail of Nuclear Throne sums is up well[1]:<p>&gt; In these situations we don&#x27;t even expect everyone to get through unscathed.
