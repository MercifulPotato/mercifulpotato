We used it for the better part of a year before moving to Slack (corporation wide mandate). So far my opinion of Slack is that it is rubbish. I never had any issues with Teams, but Slack has been a nightmare for me. I don’t get updates and notifications about channels I’m following like I should. It doesn’t work anywhere near as well on my phone as Teams did. I’m not a MS lover (I was a web developer during the first two browser wars and the standards war and still have bad feelings towards MS), but Teams seems to be really well put together. I’m interested to hear why you disagree.')
