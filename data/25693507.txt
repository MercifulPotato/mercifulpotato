The government shouldn&#x27;t be able to restrict the flow of ideas or persecute people for them.<p>I also believe that same meaning of &quot;free speech&quot;, that binding of the government, can&#x27;t also be applied to private citizens and entities. That&#x27;s a paradox; you inhibit their free speech by trying to force them to be a party to others speech.<p>I believe in very, very narrow exceptions to the above in the vein of what we currently have.<p>I also believe private citizens and entities being able to decide collectively on what is and isn&#x27;t acceptable and not giving quarter to what they deem as bad actors is.. Both good and a type of free speech. It&#x27;s not perfect, and we don&#x27;t always agree with it, but it seems that over time we&#x27;ve been living in more and more liberal, socially, times while government has become EVEN MORE tied on the subject of free speech(Larry Flint? etc).<p>I believe it&#x27;s also okay, even though I don&#x27;t necessarily agree, to think we should do nothing within the public to restrict or discount others speech and opinions. But then, I&#x27;m also betting on society working that out on its own based on the above :)')
