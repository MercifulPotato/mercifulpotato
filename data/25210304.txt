Normally, the craft is designed with a body shape roughly matching the Mach angle, but that would make it look like a long needle and you’d never be able to spin that up.<p>So instead, you can use a hypersonic projectile to open up the pressure envelope in front of the payload. This would be a big chunk of tungsten in a tear-drop shape. In this case, the shape is not for laminar aerodynamics; it’s for keeping mass in front for positive ballistic coefficient, and maintaining the same shape as it erodes. This is required because it has to stay ahead of the payload. Of course you can also make a train of these increasing in width and spaced to match the pressure cone.<p>The calculation for how much energy this takes is the sum of: 1. Mass to orbit. 2. The atmospheric pressure times the atmospheric height times the area of the Mach cone. 3. Heat losses. We can compute minimum values for the first two to get an idea of how much energy is required. I’m not sure about heat losses, but I think it’s roughly half the energy budget.<p>Overall I’d naively expect this to end up being more efficient than carrying fuel to orbit.')
