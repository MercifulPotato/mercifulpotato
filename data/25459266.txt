Easy to maintain a stack of commits on Linus&#x27;s kernel and patch them into the various distro kernels.  Well, for some value of &quot;easy&quot;.  But it would be a hell of a lot harder if you didn&#x27;t have access to diffs and what I think of as &quot;patch arithmetic.&quot; (i.e.  source - patch3 + patch1 + patch2 == source + patch2 + patch1 - patch3).  Patches are commutative (barring conflicts).')
