Hooking participants on nicotine for research seems like an extreme measure to research this. I know that nicotine-patches cannot be compared to cigarette-hits in addictiveness. But still, I take it as given that a few participants will start to smoke tobacco after this.<p>Since the effect promises to be really big though, I&#x27;ll accept the argument that it&#x27;s worth to study it. I just wonder how we&#x27;ll deal with a positive result. Will the at-risk population actually be advised to take nicotine preventatively?')
