On our platform you can recreate virtual spaces for networking events, poster sessions, conferences, training sessions and offices. Attendees are represented by circles which you can move on a 2D map and see&#x2F;hear other people nearby you.<p>We initially created the product in late December 2018, after exploring ways to solve our internal communication problem: life spread our team across the globe several years ago. We explored different ideas, including remote team  walkie-talkie. When COVID hit, we redeployed SpatialChat in March 2020, saw huge usage of SpatialChat across the companies we gave the product to and launched on ProductHunt, getting huge initial traction, especially in Japan (we are called &quot;Specha&quot; by our dear users there).<p>7 months after we have 1000+ paid customers that use SpatialChat for remote team TownHall meetings, networking events, poster sessions. We are even used by staff if 108 US universities including almost entire Ivy League - for online classes and poster sessions.<p>SpatialChat recreates real-life interactions: large groups split up into different clusters by topic to talk. You can walk to a colleagues table to quickly ask a work-related question, or hang-out in a virtual watercooler &#x2F; office kitchen room. You can make virtual booths for a virtual conference: our customer already earned 6-digit $ value on sponsorship of such booths in a SpatialChat-only event.<p>Our own team (now 12) works and communicates directly in SpatialChat with daily meetings and we even do customer calls right in our product.<p>Right now we activated extended Free plan to let everyone enjoy SpatialChat: free for up to 25 online participants with some daily participant minutes quota. Everyone can create their space, customise it to their office layout, or a community gathering bar.<p>Inviting everyone to check it out: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;spatial.chat&#x2F;s&#x2F;hackernews?sp=helloHN" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;spatial.chat&#x2F;s&#x2F;hackernews?sp=helloHN</a>')
