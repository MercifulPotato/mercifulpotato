Which is why I&#x27;m so interested in the evidence behind these claims that I keep hearing that there was no vote fraud, or at least not enough to change the election. Sadly, when asked for proof, these people who believe there was no vote fraud always walk it back: &quot;I haven&#x27;t seen any evidence.&quot; Well great, then maybe you&#x27;re not in a position to make positive claims on the basis of a lack of evidence.<p>&gt; Thereâ€™s a reason US courts of law keep throwing out these claims of widespread fraud: because the claimants consistently fail to provide the widespread evidence to back their claims up.<p>Are you so sure you can read the mind of a judge? This whole discussion is about motivated reasoning and cognitive biases. When did we start assuming that judges were immune to political bias?<p>&gt; What there is widespread evidence of, however, is bad-faith actors that are both highly active and plentiful.<p>I agree with that. Where is your evidence that none of them are judges or Google&#x2F;YouTube employees?<p>&gt; Therefore I would suggest the few good-faith actors who find themselves unfairly suppressed first take it up with those dirty lying bastards for sullying ALL their reputations<p>That would be like telling BLM activists to go tell the black criminals in their community to stop doing crimes that piss off the police. You&#x27;re implying value judgments that aren&#x27;t in evidence and lumping people together on the basis of your perceptions when those people may not even really have anything in common except being seen as enemies by the same group of people. People want to be heard. Its wrong to shut them down because some other people said some other ridiculous stuff that you think is basically the same thing because you&#x27;re done listening.<p>&gt;  secondly ask themselves what they must do to fully disassociate themselves from the scum and rebuild their negative credibility to a level where people are willing to listen again.<p>People are willing to listen, that&#x27;s why its so important not to give them a platform. Surely you don&#x27;t think that YouTube is suppressing videos because they don&#x27;t like them when those videos aren&#x27;t going to be watched by anyone?<p>&gt; Qui cum canibus concumbunt cum pulicibus surgent. They can fix it or they can whine. And which they choose speaks volumes too.<p>Part of fixing the alleged election fraud would be to present evidence to the public, including videos of that alleged fraud. And if those videos are being suppressed then part of fixing that would be to debate the propriety of suppressing viewpoints that you don&#x27;t like.')
