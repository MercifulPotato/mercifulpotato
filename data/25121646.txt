There have been people here arguing that svn and mercurial were both easier to use than git.<p>But the moment I could import SVN to git I immediately switched to Git for everything. And Mercurial... I guess it&#x27;s a matter of preference, but I personally never got the hang of it. And the fact that they had both SVN style continuous IDs AND hashes was deeply confusing to me.<p>The only thing I did find confusing in the beginning was a) the distinction between pull and fetch. b) getting used to the fact that I don&#x27;t really care about continuous IDs (or hashes for the most part ) and think more about commits relative to where I currently am.<p>In addition to that things such as `git add -p` or `tig` are so much more convenient compared to other VCS CLIs. But even if CLI isn&#x27;t what you want we&#x27;re now a couple years beyond having beautiful third party Git GUIs')
