But you could equally well insist that the outcomes of quantum experiments are determined by an invisible pink unicorn.  Both hypotheses are equally unfalsifiable (if QM is correct).<p>I have actually coined the term IPU (Invisible Pink Unicorn) as an intentionally derisive description of hypothetical constructs that cannot be measured even in principle.  Many QM interpretations contain IPUs.  Bohmiam particle positions, for example, are an IPU.')
