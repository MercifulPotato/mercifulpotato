I think vaccines are generally a good idea, but that there are risks involved in beta testing them.<p>Also, there are some interesting treatments targeting the ACE2 receptors that SARS-CoV-2 binds to which looks like they are reducing mortality rates, and perhaps long-term scarring in the lungs. Among these are Vitamin-D (which people are probably nutritionally-deficient anyways), and human recombinant soluable ACE2 (basically, injecting a form of ACE2 into the body so that the virus binds to that, instead of to cells with a lot of ACE2 receptors, thus short-circuiting the replication pathway). I would be interested to see if nutritionally-sufficient vitamin-d is better at preventing severe cases of covid-19 than masking or social distancing.<p>My own opinion is that it is foolish to pin all the hopes on a single strategy (prevention, via vaccination), which is not guaranteed to work or guaranteed to be safe. To add forced vaccination is folly. I think it is better to see a depth of prevention and treatment options (including vaccination).')
