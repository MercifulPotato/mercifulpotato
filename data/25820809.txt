The current (admittedly early and noisy) data we have about AI models looks very similar IMO.<p>The other parallel is that the initial computing revolution allowed a large scale shift of business activities from requiring teams of people doing manual activities, coordinated by a supervisor towards having those functions live inside a spreadsheet, word processor, or email.<p>This replaces a team of people with (outdated) specializations with fewer people accomplishing the same admin&#x2F;clerical work by letting the computer do what it&#x27;s good at doing.<p>I think a similar shift will happen with AI (and other technologies) where work done by humans in cost centers is retooled to allow fewer people to do a better job at less cost. Think compliance, customer support, business intelligence, HR, etc.<p>If that ends up being the case, donating a few million dollars worth of GPU time doesn&#x27;t change the larger trends, and likely ends up being useful cover as to why we shouldn&#x27;t be worried about what the large companies are up to in AI because we have access to crowdsourced and donated models.')
