When we need to clean our database, we simply put down the docker container. Ie. we do not need to implement destructive database cleanup eliminating structure that could potentially fail.<p>Having policies about not accessing production database directly (and allow the extra time for building tooling around that policy), good preview &#x2F; staging environments, etc. All fail eliminating structure.')
