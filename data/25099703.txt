Their attempt at regulating speech on their platforms (entirely their own right to do however they want) has resulted in <i>both sides being pissed</i>.  I had commented on this a while ago that it was like War Games - the only way to win this game was not to play at all.  The second they started being the arbitrator of speech they were guaranteed to piss people off.  Then they tried to adjust and pissed another group off.<p>And even before all that crap below up, they had the gov&#x27;t taking a long and hard look at the anti-trust problem.  The platform censorship just threw gasoline on that smoldering fire.<p>The smartest move now is to fire all their public relations and government affairs folks.  They handled this about as poorly as they could.')
