The principle of &quot;data minimisation&quot; (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ico.org.uk&#x2F;for-organisations&#x2F;guide-to-data-protection&#x2F;guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr&#x2F;principles&#x2F;data-minimisation&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ico.org.uk&#x2F;for-organisations&#x2F;guide-to-data-protectio...</a>) means you should only collect the minimum amount of data required for a particular purpose, so <i>in theory</i> an app shouldn&#x27;t be able to spy on you and call home all the time for the purposes of software licensing when something much less intrusive can suffice. Similarly, there is no valid reason why you should be forced to sign into an account to <i>uninstall</i> a piece of software.<p>In reality though, the GDPR is not being enforced seriously and the same organization linked above who is writing those guidelines is completely incompetent at actually enforcing them.')
