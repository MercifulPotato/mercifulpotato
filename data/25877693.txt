That is to say &quot;why not both?&quot; I remember using NT on a domain with active directory profiles in the 90s, and while my memory is quite foggy, I believe some settings were carried between computers on my profile.<p>In the world of today, I can lock my taskbar on the side instead of the bottom and set my wallpaper, and the customization is saved to my Microsoft account, and loaded on other computers when I login (unless there&#x27;s a local override, like Bing Wallpaper.)<p>But I believe colors (like your Accent Color) is still specific to each device. And I have no idea why - though I don&#x27;t mind since I like using a different color on my laptop and desktop.<p>I&#x27;m rambling, but I think they could still allow all the customization, but also store parts of it on the cloud and carry it with you.')
