I think it&#x27;s first important to remember that the concept of freedom of speech is not an end goal by itself. It was always just a tool for people to be able to point out unfairness&#x2F;wrong things in society. It was deemed necessary for criticism to be able to done freely for improvements to society to be possible.<p>Now what we are seeing with social media platforms (and I ould argue it started already earlier with the raise of fox news) at the moment is that we see that there are elements of society who found that facts and truth don&#x27;t matter and freedom of speech doesn&#x27;t matter if you have big enough pockets and use the right psychological strategies. Essentially the way society and particulary social media is set up is, that the richest voice gets heard (at least by some people) and the truth of what is being said is not important anymore. In other words the platform are used for controlling us (not by the government, but vested interests) and destroying society, freedom of speech is not helping against this if anything it&#x27;s a hindrance because it assumes all speech is equal, which it isn&#x27;t.<p>I don&#x27;t have a solution and I would like a way to defend us without destroying freedom of speech, but I don&#x27;t have a good solution.<p>Also these platforms have been &quot;censoring&quot; for a long time, nobody was batting an eyelid when Isis accounts and videos were removed. In fact many of the outlets who are now screaming about censorship were shouting that twitter et al. were not doing enough. That tells you a lot about howmuch they care about freedom of speech.')
