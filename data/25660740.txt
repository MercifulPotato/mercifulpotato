When I log on to Facebook I see some old friends having pretty banal conversations. It&#x27;s not very compelling and it&#x27;s definitely not threatening.<p>Twitter, on the other hand, is both compelling and threatening. It draws me in and sucks up far too much of my time. And when I&#x27;ve waded into controversial waters I&#x27;ve been met with hordes of strangers calling me names, making fun of my appearance, and even in one case <i>emailing my employer</i> in an effort to materially harm me for <i>disagreeing on the internet</i>.<p>Nothing like that has ever happened to me on Facebook.<p>Between Facebook and Twitter I find the latter both far more threatening and, because it&#x27;s also actually compelling, far more difficult to leave.<p>Facebook is a zero by comparison.')
