The cost makes it sound like a full on win for serverless.<p>Anything interesting about the deployment method, choice of language, containerization&#x2F;etc that made it particularly easy? There are tools in this domain (vercel springs to mind) that have adopted the static-site-over-serverless-something) model, but it sounds like you all had an easy time with just loading some workers up, did you do anything fancy to facilitate the frontend serving? I assume with the stripe proxy bit was just using Stripe&#x27;s various (great) APIs for customer creation, one time charges (I guess?).<p>Curious about the technicals of the setup, you&#x27;ve baited us (HN) in at this point, give out those gory details!')
