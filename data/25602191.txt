Nice print, and the stylus holder is a nice &#x27;touch&#x27; :-)  What did you print on&#x2F;with and how long did it take ?<p>I find smaller keyboards (tkls, 65%, etc) pull my arms in too much for comfort.  I&#x27;m looking towards a Dactyl Manuform (split keyboard) &#x2F; Trackball hybrid.  Unfortunately, test prints take about 10+ hours for PLA on my Artillery Sidewinder.  Makes for slow going :-P<p>Grats on a really nice looking project!')
