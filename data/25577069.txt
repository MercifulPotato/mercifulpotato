For example I&#x27;ve been taken to the following:<p>AUSTRALIA - definitely not a &quot;road&quot; more like an unused hiking &#x2F; herding path with nothing but lazy kangaroos in sight.<p>CHILE - down an unpaved half-lane road making its way down the side of a cliff, marked &quot;mucho peligroso&quot;<p>ITALY - completely off road over giant potholes and big rocks. Middle of the night.<p>ABU DHABI - across a clearly pedestrian plaza.<p>In all cases it worked out - as it happened to be traversable in my tiny rental car and indeed the way to get where I am going. But that&#x27;s in retrospect, could have easily been &quot;death by GPS&quot; types of scenarios.<p>A few things I recommend when driving in places like this:\n- refuel religiously. Don&#x27;t let your tank get below half, as theoretically that should give you enough to backtrack to where you got gas last time. Not always possible of course.\n- try to ask yourself - if I had to back out &#x2F; turn around, could I? And be very leary of locking yourself out of that option (although easier said than done.)\n- be mentally prepared to sleep in the car. At some point it is safer to do that and figure things out in the morning, even of there&#x27;s a chance that your amazing tuscan villa airbnb is just another mile down the washed out road (cuz it may also not be)\n- think of it as a fun adventure and don&#x27;t freak out.')
