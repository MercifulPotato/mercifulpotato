Your contribution is to propose that people might claim things are apolitical to prevent people from realizing the truth about how political they actually are.<p>Your appeal to newspeak is pretty pointless, as it applies only inasmuch as it does to anyone who might claim that something is its opposite, for example the slogans &quot;the personal is political&quot; and &quot;silence is violence&quot;.<p>Sure, if you accept lies like that, you may lose the ability to think about the true nature of those things.<p>But you haven&#x27;t really contributed anything to the conversation.  You&#x27;re just saying &quot;ah, but what if they&#x27;re &#x2F;lying&#x2F;!  To &#x2F;trick us&#x2F;!&quot;')
