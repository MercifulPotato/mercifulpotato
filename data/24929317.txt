At least while I used it, GPM wasn&#x27;t positioned as a store where you buy music and take it home, it&#x27;s an app&#x2F;ecosystem where you listen to music.<p>So I&#x27;d argue a more apt comparison is it&#x27;s like buying a movie at a store with sofas and televisions for watching the movies, where you can purchase content and ask for it to be displayed, and can optionally take the disk home.<p>Stretching the analogy too far probably, but GPM didn&#x27;t exactly encourage downloading FWIW -- can only download a song twice ever through the web interface, or all at once through takeout, or through a chrome extension&#x2F;app, otherwise it&#x27;s all on the GPM app, where you&#x27;re &quot;supposed&quot; to listen to it.<p>You do have the right to download DRM-free music though, so at least GPM had that.<p>... youtube music on the other hand ...')
