I&#x27;m a year round commuting cyclist in the upper Midwest, so I see bike traffic go up and down with the seasons and the weather. In addition to the cold, there&#x27;s also the darkness.<p>The coldest month is January, and by that point, you only see the die-hards. It&#x27;s not just psychological, but also requires being prepared to deal with the cold, ice, and road salt. For instance I have a dedicated winter bike with studded tires, and a pre-rusted chain. ;-) Oddly enough, the people who are out in the worst weather always seem to have the biggest grins on their faces.<p>So while I feel smug about being one of the die-hards, I also don&#x27;t even try to encourage people to ride through the winter until they&#x27;ve at least acclimatized themselves to riding regularly in normal weather.')
