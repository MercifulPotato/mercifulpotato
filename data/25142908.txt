Item(by='throwaway894345', descendants=None, kids=[25143058, 25143020], score=None, time=1605736316, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25142739, text='I don&#x27;t know about the current state of voting software, but space shuttle software has a pretty good track record. We know how to produce good software just like we know how to build good elevators and so on. The perceived problem that Randall is observing is that there&#x27;s a lot of software out there for social media networks or news sites or games and all manner of other software which <i>isn&#x27;t</i> life or death and for which faults are perfectly acceptable (at least to the extent that we don&#x27;t bother to regulate those faults more aggressively). So what Randall (and many others) perceives as &quot;we&#x27;re bad at software&quot; is actually &quot;we&#x27;re pretty good at software, it&#x27;s just that most software doesn&#x27;t need to be space-shuttle&#x2F;voting-systems grade, and we don&#x27;t waste money making it to that caliber&quot;.<p>The most valid reason to be opposed to voting software (and it&#x27;s my personal reason) is that it&#x27;s almost certainly easier to compromise an electronic voting system--even a very high quality system--than it is to compromise a paper ballot election. With a paper ballot election, it&#x27;s probably easier to just rig public opinion by compromising social media companies.<p>I would also suspect that we could make it <i>even harder</i> to rig a paper ballot election if we elected by popular vote such that (for tight elections) the malicious actor would have to compromise a lot more than just a few key counties in a few swing states.')
