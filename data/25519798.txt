The recommendations change every time the home screen comes up, and there&#x27;s no easy way to flag things. So if I see 3 recommendations I need to watch, I have to try to remember what they were before I watch one, because when I finish with the first video, the others will be gone.<p>Netflix is even worse (and they all seem to suffer from this to some degree). When I start it, it&#x27;s an ad for some random thing. To find what I was watching <i>last</i> I have to either remember whether that miniseries is considered a movie or a TV show or what.. or, I can scroll down to Home, and &quot;continue watching..&quot; will be buried 3 rows deep and 2 columns over. So incredibly strange and unintuitive.<p>I guess they want their algos to be drive more engagement rather than just take you back to what you almost certainly opened the app to watch?')
