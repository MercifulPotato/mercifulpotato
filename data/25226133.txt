This community is really my goto place in the morning when I wake up, in my lunch time and once before I doze off.<p>What I most like about this group is that I can relate to a lot of the members who have similar experiences, stories and interests. This is the first online community that I feel I really belong.<p>Thanks HN for &quot;making everyday a little bit better!&quot; :-)')
