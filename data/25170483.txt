Software Engineering is using engineering engineering principles to build software.<p>Project management methodologies like scrum are implementation level details, together with platform (user interface, programming language, database e.t.c). Software Engineering starts at the feasibility study, followed by detailed design, then comes the implementation phase. Most Software Engineering job posts only list implementation phase requirements, which I reckon has led to SE being misunderstood.')
