It is called &quot;KYC&quot; Know Your Customer. That includes all your data (the ones they have, the ones you provide - e.g. address, tax&#x2F;payroll records if you want to apply for a loan and they ask source of income, etc.) When you talk to a &quot;relationship manager&quot; be certain that (if they are any good at their job) what you tell them is recorded and stays in your file.<p>This has also a positive side. E.g. I never shop shoes online. So my bank called me one fine afternoon because someone used my card number to buy shoes. That store only sells women&#x27;s shoes (I am a man). This was not consistent with my &quot;profile&quot; (of course I have one) and they cancelled the transactions, refunded the money, notified VISA and merchant, and called me to tell me that they will see the transactions on my logs (-50, -100, -150 and then +50, +100, +150).<p>I expect and demand that from my bank, but not from Facebook: &quot;hey why aren&#x27;t you in your typical pizza resto and you went across the street?&quot;')
