Designing and promulgating an actual open federated protocol is way harder&#x2F;time-consuming than doing the same for a closed proprietary one.  So taking this approach has only hurt their flexibility and speed-to-market for features.<p>However, if done right, an open protocol can be way more advantageous to the global community as a whole!  IMHO Matrix started out as just another crazy moonshot. &quot;Let&#x27;s make something like email and xmpp only better.&quot;  But, fast-forward to now and they have built a very usable chat ecosystem with multiple server implementations and many clients.<p>My hope is that things like this Slack acquisition (and the inevitable cooperate shenanigan that will follow) will continue to push individuals and companies to invest in open federate-able alternatives.')
