Is that &quot;pretty anti censorship&quot;, as this question of negative externalities is always the point of contention for censoring anything is it not?<p>I&#x27;m not falling hard on this. I&#x27;m presently living in the tension between free speech ideals and collective political health, and I don&#x27;t purport to have any great answers.<p>&gt; I&#x27;d agree with this framing, though if one goes down this route, all sorts of instances of &quot;freedom&quot; and individual choice would be called into question on grounds of it&#x27;s effect on overall societal health.<p>Agree, I think this is completely valid and I think we see a lot of this already in the cancel culture movement--lots of perfectly reasonable, healthy debate is suppressed as &quot;possibly harmful&quot;. It&#x27;s a real concern.<p>&gt; And this calls into question the efficacy of &quot;truth&quot; and objective facts. At some point people simply have different value judgments about what is true, or for which other things to carve out exceptions which take precedence.<p>I don&#x27;t buy this. I think even conspiratorialists are perfectly capable of reasoning (reasonably) well when it doesn&#x27;t conflict with their political allegiance. In my opinion, the issue is that some people know full well that they&#x27;re being dishonest, but they simply don&#x27;t care--they value the truth less than they value their political tribe. And please note that I think there are plenty of people on both sides of the aisle who put party above truth--this isn&#x27;t me punching at Republicans or conservatives or whomever while pretending that my ideological compatriots are perfectly behaved (that would make me quite the hypocrite!)--although it wouldn&#x27;t be appropriate to litigate that here.')
