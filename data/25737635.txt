It&#x27;s already a touch above the usual Witcher release.<p>It&#x27;s also worth noting that, at least from my perspective, there was a vocal crowd begging for the game on account of &quot;something to do during the pandemic, assuming bugs warts and all&quot;. I&#x27;m not sure if this is why they released an objectively non-functional game to previous-gen consoles, but I would be inclined to believe the excuse.')
