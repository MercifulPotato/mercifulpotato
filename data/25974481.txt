ESE (as part of being &quot;embeddable&quot;) has a couple of logging level controls (JET_paramEventLoggingLevel, and JET_paramNoInformationEvent).  Each component is responsible for setting it&#x27;s event logging level, the ESE default is ... let me call it, &quot;fully diagnosable mode&quot; (for us, not you ;).<p>Anyways, all events start like this:\n     &quot;svchost (48984,R,98) TILEREPOSITORYS-1-5-18 ..&quot;\n... the service exe name at beginning, and the &quot;instance&quot; name there at the end.  If you get me a few of the noisier components, I will try to find the Windows component owners and suggest to them that they set the logging level higher.<p>Thank You,\nBrett Shirley [MSFT]')
