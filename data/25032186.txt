Item(by='mavelikara', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604906886, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25029605, text='&gt; When a FANG like google hires an H1-B employee, their average salary is $143,373. When Tata or Cognizant hires an H1-B employee, their average salary is $86,453. If we take the number of H-1B visas sponsored per year at Tata and Cognizant and compare their average salaries to their FANG counterparts it suggests a short changing of $2 billion per year.<p>$2B is nothing to sneeze. But Cognizant made $16.7B last year; TCS made over $22B. My claim is that these companies make their revenues by selling the services of their outsourced teams located at low-cost locations. They hire H-1Bs to serve that business model.<p>There are H-1B wage abusers, but those are smaller staffing companies who individually have a small number of H-1Bs, but collectively own a big chunk of it.<p>(For this analysis, I am ignoring the fact that American citizens employed at companies that outsource to Cognizant or TCS pay significantly lower than FANG companies)')
