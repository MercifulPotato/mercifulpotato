Some versions of afterburner climax have a servo equipped chair which can tilt on multiple axes as well as vibrate, police 911 has body position sensors, and many of the music games have hardware that&#x27;s completely impractical for home.<p>From that perspective, the games as a service makes more sense. Stadia doesn&#x27;t really offer any of that, the games are the same as any other platform.')
