I don’t know if that’s “liberal politics” but if San Francisco adopted the housing and zoning of Houston it would be <i>way</i> cheaper.<p>If anything you could argue that&#x27;s an anti-liberal attitude. It&#x27;s great the Bay Area is so tolerant of different folks. Except that doesn&#x27;t help out the black transgender teenager from Mississippi who can&#x27;t move there, because he&#x27;s priced out of even the lowest-end apartment. All because some millionaire home owners don&#x27;t want to see their property values appreciate at a slightly lower rate.')
