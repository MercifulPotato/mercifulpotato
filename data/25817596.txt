But even still, we haven&#x27;t prioritized releasing an extension for Safari. We&#x27;ll probably do it eventually, but over the last 6 years we just haven&#x27;t received that many requests for Safari (desktop) support. It literally might be 3 requests per year.<p>I think this is because people who use extensions just don&#x27;t use Safari, and therefore anyone who is savvy enough to want a tool like ours is already on Chrome or Firefox. There are a few people who use Safari for the battery life and are willing to live with the very few extensions that it offers, but I don&#x27;t know many people like this.<p>We&#x27;ll probably release a Safari extension eventually, but for now it is not a priority. We are actually going to be launching with a new iOS web browser that includes extension support, and given the trend toward mobile that&#x27;s more of a focus for us right now.')
