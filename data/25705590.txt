Who do you trust?  Fox news or CNN.<p>The answer for me is I trust no one.  They are all liars.  I verify for myself.  All governance (government, legal, media, military, education, etc) is there to foster a divisive situation as that makes us easier to rule.  When people are divided they will not see the plans that are being executed and how they are pawns in a larger game.<p>You can call it delusional or conspiracy, but there are plans - you can very easily see these on the WEF&#x27;s website, or read about them in Klaus Schwabb&#x27;s book.  If you don&#x27;t want to see what is in store for you, what can I say?  Switch the news back on, and have a good life.<p>The truth is that there are a controlling group of people that are entirely unaccountable - governments and voting provide them with a buffer from people - they enact their plans regardless of all that.  And further to that, most of us are in an impossible situation that we can do very little about.  BLM or MAGA protests - its all the same.<p>If you want to talk about solutions, the only answers are disengagement from the system.  And if you go deep into that, the only answer is disengagement from the legal system.  If there is one thing that causes the issues we have, its that we believe we are the legal name that we have a birth certificate of.  And on it, it says &#x27;this certificate cannot be used as proof of ID&#x27;.<p>The only law &#x27;they&#x27; are happy for us to break, is the one where we use the legal name.  You are not the legal name.  You may not know who you are, but you are not that..<p>It is illegal to use the legal name.  When we do so, we are acting with dishonour.  And that is where our problems begin.  And also where they can end.')
