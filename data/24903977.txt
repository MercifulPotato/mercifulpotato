Item(by='DharmaPolice', descendants=None, kids=[24904409], score=None, time=1603765795, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24902832, text='&gt;I&#x27;m guessing intimidating police by reminding them of the laws they&#x27;re supposed to uphold works a lot less well for young black kids.<p>Undoubtedly, but there is a power in knowing what and how to say something. I&#x27;ve been arrested and had to sit with three other unrelated individuals for a while, as we waited to be processed. We were all white but I really felt the treatment I received was significantly better than my two fellow arrestees and that was entirely down to not sounding...well, like an idiot. Even asking to read the Police &quot;Codes of Practice&quot; - which is offered automatically - was met with unease (and slight embarrassment) because it&#x27;s apparently rare for people to say yes to that and they didn&#x27;t have it to hand immediately.<p>You can call this a class benefit but I certainly wasn&#x27;t dressed in a middle class manner (which is possibly why I was stopped initially) and my accent is fairly typical for South East London.')
