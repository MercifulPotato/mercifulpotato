To do so would require overhauling the landline networks to support this.  No such technical capabilities exist today.  The business decision you are suggesting could not be implemented even if they wanted to.  Mobile networks are another implementation of SS7 and the only thing common between them and landline networks is the routing.  I am not deciding anything and I am just basing my opinions on my long past experience.')
