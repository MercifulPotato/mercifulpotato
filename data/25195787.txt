Is it to give some kind of tactical advantage to the weapon carrier? Is it about some kind of general fear people have seeing a gun (and if so, why not police?)?<p>Is CCW considered to be protected by the second amendment? It says &quot;keep and bear&quot; which seems more related to a visible weapon to me, but I&#x27;m not sure of the history.')
