Item(by='lotsofpulp', descendants=None, kids=[24664722], score=None, time=1601652057, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24663071, text='&gt; Good work is still highly valued, it&#x27;s just that the value is not paid to the worker, but to the company owning the work. If you increase a company&#x27;s profit by $500k annually through setting up a new automation system, you&#x27;ll still only get your $40k internship salary. And the company will pocket the remaining $460k, to be paid out to the owners as profits.<p>People are paid what it costs to replace them, not the profit they generate.  The less replaceable you are, the more of the profit you get.<p>Price (pay) is the intersection of supply and demand, and nothing else.<p>That is why factory workers in the US got outsourced.  That is why when deciding what you are going to sell for the rest of your life, you should go for something that few others are able to sell.<p>And everyone does this, it’s not some evil business plan.  No one pays $5 more for the same loaf of bread.  Everyone I know pays the least amount they have to.  Creating a floor for that is the government’s job, not an individual business (and it can’t anyway, since it has to compete).')
