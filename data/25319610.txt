It increases both the size of what you have to distribute, and the memory profile. And it means that when a security update is necessary, each library consumer has to be responsible &amp; on-time with delivering updates rapidly.<p>It feels like it was created out of such petty, small needs &amp; wants. It&#x27;s convenient to be able to copy a binary around anywhere, &amp; have it just work. It&#x27;s convenient to stand off, on your own, ignorant of the world you exist in. But it&#x27;s so contrary to me to good healthy engineering practices, enables such radical irresponsibility &amp; divergence. I don&#x27;t see a lot of push back to static linking, but it feels like a modern &amp; popular plague to me. Go, rust, the whole world software development world seems to be increasingly less interested in systems, &amp; more interested in itself.')
