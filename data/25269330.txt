And depending on your workload you can certainly save a fair wedge of cash by colo-ing things.<p>For wordpress, (the site that is running serverthehome) its perfectly possible to run it in a lambda, with aggressive caching and save a whole bunch of cash. depending on plugins, load and a number of other things, it could be a potential saving of 90%. (plus a massive reduction in attack surface)<p>Before you ask, yes I do know from bitter experience, parts of the financial times had WP wedged into them. making them fast and secure was an interesting experience.<p>AWS is only cost effective when you are using ec2 with a duty cycle of less than 50%. This means that you are not using AWS for hosting 24&#x2F;7 compute.<p>In terms of storage, There are two compelling offerings, S3 and EFS&#x2F;lustre. however if you&#x27;re a large scale EFS user, its better to run your own GPFS system.<p>The hardest part of &quot;scaling&quot; is orchestration. If you&#x27;re using K8s, there really isn&#x27;t much difference between running it on virtual vs real steel, barring bringup scripts(don&#x27;t get me started on networking in K8s, its totally warped.)<p>TLDR:<p>IF you need 100+ machines on 24&#x2F;7, AWS is going to be more expensive.<p>If you have transient loads, and the average time on for a machine is 4 hours or less, then AWS is for you. However, you&#x27;d better use all the other bits that come with AWS to make it cheaper, like fronting it with fastly&#x2F;otherCDN')
