Once you gain &quot;enough&quot; information (&quot;enough&quot; being statistically defined) that the drug helps, each additional person you let languish in the control group (who is denied access to the drug) is a cost that must be weighed against the benefit of getting additional information. When the data is clear enough, the cost can exceed the benefit, and you stop early.<p>Typically you&#x27;d register a &quot;stopping rule&quot; before you start your trial: a good drug often will trigger the stopping rule, as it helped so much that we learned about its efficacy on a smaller N than originally planned.<p>There are many different stopping criteria, depending on the trial (in safety trials you&#x27;d typically stop because you&#x27;ve found evidence that the drug is <i>unsafe</i> and continuing would be unfair to the folks in the <i>treatment</i> group, whereas in efficacy trials after safety has been established, you&#x27;d stop because you&#x27;ve found evidence that the drug is <i>effective</i> and continuing would be unfair to the folks in the <i>control</i> group).')
