I think you&#x27;re purposefully being a bit ignorant here; no one (viz: &#x27;they&#x27;) wants to cancel opinions they disagree with. However to think that false information has the same platform today that it had 50 years ago is also just plain wrong-- and whether you agree with it or not, it does shape the public discourse these days. Unless you want to erode discussions to a point where its a battle of who can fabricate the biggest claim (true or not), you&#x27;re going to have to accept that in a modern information society we will eventually need some form of controls.<p>Case in point: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;0x445442" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;0x445442</a> (Seems you have a problem with &quot;Leftists&quot; and like to retweet right wing tweets)')
