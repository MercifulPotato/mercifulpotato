This should be a happy ending. But there’s a catch. The asthma drug is currently being used “off-label”; that is, the effectiveness of the drug against urticaria hasn’t yet been demonstrated in a large-scale clinical trial. And most healthcare providers, from insurance companies to the UK’s NHS, simply won’t pay for drugs without one.<p>This is the problem Rachel encountered back in 2014, when the specialist in Berlin recommended omalizumab. At the moment, the drug would set her back around a thousand euros per month.<p>But finding enough patients for a trial could be problematic. Aquagenic urticaria affects around one in every 230 million people. By that estimate, there are only 32 people with the condition on the entire planet. “We are a big team here, we see more than 2,000 new urticaria patients every year. And we have three with aquagenic urticaria,” says Maurer.<p>To complicate matters further, the drug is coming to the end of its patent. With so little time left to make any money out of it – and a handful of potential customers – convincing the company to invest in a trial would be extremely difficult. “I’m not sure that we will see such a trial,” he says. Novartis, who market the drug as Xolair for asthma and other conditions, confirm they have no plans to develop the treatment for aquagenic urticaria. &quot;We believe that the unlicensed use of drugs should be limited to cases where there is an unmet medical need that cannot be fulfilled by licensed medications or as permitted by the regulatory framework designed to protect patient safety,&quot; their spokesperson adds. After decades of research to solve the mystery disease, the final hurdle isn’t science, but economics.&quot;')
