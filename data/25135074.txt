Item(by='fuoqi', descendants=None, kids=[25135257], score=None, time=1605694262, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25134884, text='&gt;Most countries don&#x27;t support terrorist (sorry, &#x27;resistance&#x27;) organizations and don&#x27;t officially announce it on every corner.<p>Yeap, and the US is not included into this list of the &quot;most countries&quot; as well. Simply instead of &quot;resistance&quot; they call them &quot;pro-democratic rebels&quot; and they have a long tradition in this area (e.g. search for a humble &quot;freedom-fighter&quot; Osama). So we got back to the starting point.<p>&gt;You&#x27;re mixing JCPOA and several different types of sanctions.<p>Again, I&#x27;ve linked the document, which clearly lists the 1747 resolution as to be terminated. AFAIK it is the only UN resolution affecting Soleimeini. So do please clarify what exactly I am &quot;mixing&quot;?<p>&gt;ISIS started from Al-Qaeda in Iraq, a Sunni group that Iran and Syria were happy to support so long as they bothered Americans more.<p>LOL what? When ISIS has started making territorial claims Syria was already for two years in the midst of the hot civil war, Asad was losing territories to the Sunni rebels supported by the US, Iran at the time tried to help Assad by supporting Shia militia, but its supply lines got disrupted by ISIS, which motivated them to persuade Russians to help Assad.<p>If anything, it&#x27;s American support of Sunni rebels in the hope that they will overthrow the Assad government resulted in the creation of ISIS as a quasi-state. One of the big American goals in Iraq is to prevent creation of so-called Shia Crescent and the Suni rebellion was a great way to achieve it. This is why you haven&#x27;t seen much US action against it until they started to threaten Bagdad, and even after ISIS lost all its territories the US supported &quot;moderates&quot; which are close to the Syrian Al-Qaeda branch. Though in the end it spiraled out of control. As usual... Controlled chaos rarely stays controlled for long.<p>If your next message will be as ignorant as the last two, I no longer see the need to continue this discussion.')
