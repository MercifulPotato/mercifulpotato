Item(by='EpicEng', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609959397, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25640599, text='&gt;This chart covers January - November and includes an almost 50% drop in march. And it is still not as volatile as e.g. TSLA.<p>...and if you don&#x27;t cherry pick one of the most volatile, well known stocks in the market? We can keep doing this, but TSLA is not &quot;the market&quot;, it&#x27;s a single company and trades completely on hopes and dreams. It&#x27;s not a good surrogate for every other company.<p>&gt;There is no such thing as &quot;real cash&quot; - you can exchange Bitcoin for dollars like you would with stocks<p>Yes, you can trade fake currency for real currency so that you can actually use it. And companies represent real assets; BTC is thin air. This is not a difficult concept to understand. BTC has _zero_ intrinsic value as an asset.<p>&gt;The reason Bitcoin is worth as much as it is, is precisely that many Bitcoin &quot;hodlers&quot; are not selling, because they understand that Bitcoin has a fixed supply while the USD continues to inflate, which increases wealth inequalities and enables government to spend money with less democratic oversight.<p>Stocks hedge against inflation as well, so do many other asset classes. BTC trades like it does because a whole lot of people want to get rich quick. Of course some people share your opinion, but we&#x27;re talking about something that provides no actual value.<p>If you have to trade it in for a currency you can actually use and it goes up with inflation then... it&#x27;s no different than stock in a good company from that perspective. It goes up more because it trades 100% on speculation and the greater fool theory.')
