This is kind of known, as far as I can tell, looking at forums, and Google notably was willing to let me RMA over it. Not a damage warranty, straight exchange.   There being camera issues sounds entirely in line with that.<p>I really, really miss my Pixel 3. It was easily my favorite phone. The 4a is simply not a match.')
