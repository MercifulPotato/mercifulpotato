Two otherwise identical machines, one all-in on usb-c, the other with a mix of ports.</i><p>No technical reason, that&#x27;s just not how Apple rolls.<p>If they do that, they do it with 2 different models (where the lack&#x2F;presense of some feature makes sense based on the target market, e.g. college students), not with two otherwise identical models.')
