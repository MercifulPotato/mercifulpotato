New Zealand did so by virtue of being an island and thus having tight border control. South Korea and Vietnam are interesting cases, we should learn more from them. In the case of Vietnam, I do wonder how many cases are undetected.<p>Also, in the case of Vietnam, only 14% of their population is over 55 years old, whereas 29% of the USA is over 55 (and 31% of Belgium, another hard hit country). Seeing as this disease hits people over 55 the hardest (and is barely noticed in those under 30), it is no wonder Vietnam is seeing less of an issue here.<p>It seems age demographics _could_ have more correlation with outcomes than any government intervention. That of course doesn&#x27;t explain Vietnam entirely. Also keep in mind, Vietnam has only administered 12,000 test per 1 million people, whereas the USA has administered 492,000 per 1 million.')
