A good example to me is the difference between wind waker and Breath of the wild. Wind waker is a beautiful game, and shows that there is absolutely enough power in the gamecube to make cell shaded art games. But when you pull the bow back for the first time in breath of the wild, and the corners of the screen go out of focus, and you peer between the cell shaded blades of grass at the beautifully animated boar you are trying to hit, it is a much different subjective experience.')
