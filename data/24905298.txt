The world is not static. As the other commenter said, you can gently start working out. It&#x27;s a thing, and it has intrinsic value.<p>Also, you often can&#x27;t see yourself attaching to a person long term, <i>because</i> you don&#x27;t know yourself as well as you think you do. (One should stay away from toxic people though.)<p>Another thing is that you can start hanging out with people of the opposite sex without trying to get into a relationship. The &quot;friend zone&quot; is largely a myth, not trying to score is incredibly sexy. And <i>lots</i> of friends have hooked up after years as friends only.<p>Many churches are welcoming of atheists by the way, but you have to stand it yourself, of course. One way could be to not attend service as much as volunteering for their support groups. Volunteers helping out in the community is always in short supply. This goes for non-denominational groups too, of course.')
