The shortest way to write a program is sometimes an unreadable mess, mainly when it&#x27;s been code golfed. The longest ways to write a program are <i>always</i> unreadable. Proofs work the same way - and if Alpha Go selects randomly from all of the ways to write a reasonable-length proof, it is virtually guaranteed to pick an unreadable one.')
