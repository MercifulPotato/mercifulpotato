There was not just one but several forms of telegraphese developed. A conversation held entirely in brief dots and dashes has a substantially different flow to it than say typing out a message on an internet forum, which in turn is nothing like how one would communicate with a 5 second fleeting video recording. A telegraph is a very simple machine to operate, I&#x27;m sure you could learn quickly, but you would certainly still lack the social skills necessary to keep up with a professional telegraph operator from a century ago.<p>Likewise, your parents certainly don&#x27;t have any problem conceptually understanding keyboards, letters, or addresses - they were perfectly comfortable with typewriters, letterheads, and postal codes. Dealing with nigerian princes and chain mail might involve the use of technology, but these are very much social skills.<p>As someone who only uses social media platforms that are mildly reskinned versions of 80s&#x2F;90s message forums, I don&#x27;t really know what the &quot;BCC vs CC&quot; of tiktok is, nor do I care. I have an excellent understanding of how tiktok works technologically, but I lack the particular social skills tiktok requires. Since my peers do not get it either, this has never been a problem for me, but I&#x27;m sure in a few years when my kids expect me to just know how to snapple into the televoid with them that I&#x27;ll look like an idiot as I search for a reply button somehwere.')
