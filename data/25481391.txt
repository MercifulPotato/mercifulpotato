In recent years this vision has evolved into an integrated ecosystem management approach, striving for a mosaic of different land use and production systems, including sustainable dryland management and restoration, the regeneration of natural vegetation as well as water retention and conservation measures”</i><p>I think that makes it hard to report % completed. Also, 4% is a lot of land (that same PDF says they currently target about 1½ million km² of land. That’s a lot more than that 7,000 by 15 km band originally envisioned (For comparison, the USA and Canada each are about 10 million km², so that would be about 7½% of North America), in the poorest part of the world.<p>As <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pri.org&#x2F;stories&#x2F;2016-05-02&#x2F;africas-great-green-wall-making-progress-two-fronts" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pri.org&#x2F;stories&#x2F;2016-05-02&#x2F;africas-great-green-w...</a> says <i>“it will take at least a generation to make it a reality”</i>')
