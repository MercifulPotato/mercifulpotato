Or if that&#x27;s not what you mean by &quot;these people&quot;, how about even a single one?<p>&gt; these people need to be held accountable for studies that they did in the past that didnâ€™t work.<p>If there are such papers, did anyone ever show that a single one of these did not the best they could with the information available at the time? Again, any sort of analysis (of your own or by anyone else) that shows negligence or anything of the sort would give your ideas some sort of credibility.')
