God, I don&#x27;t understand why people keep falling into this mindset.  Do not hide&#x2F;remove&#x2F;censor&#x2F;block&#x2F;stop speech because of its content, ever, for any reason!  Let all speak their piece, and let all hear what they choose to hear.  There are a zillion and one reasons this is <i>the right way to do things</i> that people in first-world countries are forgetting.<p>Here&#x27;s the easiest one to grasp: if you create the tools to suppress an idea and willingly let some party make use of them, then you have fulfilled all the preconditions for suppressing good ideas and true ideas except for &quot;who holds the button&quot; - but guess what?  You can never guarantee button-holding status in the future!  It is <i>dangerous</i> to enable, allow, or normalize speech suppression because you are doing the future bad guys&#x27; job for them in the process and making it easier to enact horrifying human rights abuses in the future.')
