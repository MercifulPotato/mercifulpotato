On that server I run mpd which is controlled through either ncmpc in a terminal session, MALP on mobile. The server also runs Airsonic since that is more efficient for remote streaming than mpd+icecast. No bleeps or bloops since the USB DACs are only used for audio streaming and also because they&#x27;re on a server which doesn&#x27;t produce any bleeps or bloops to begin with.')
