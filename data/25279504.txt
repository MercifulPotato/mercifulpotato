With remote normalizing, as long as you stay off corp gear (stay off corp gear for any activities not directly related to your employment!), your employer isn&#x27;t going to know you&#x27;re working towards organizing, preventing them from interfering with your organizing activities (which does them a favor, considering that&#x27;s illegal under US labor law).')
