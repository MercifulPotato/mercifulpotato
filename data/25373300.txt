If I&#x27;m going to install such software on my Raspberry I would like to connect 2.5&quot; USB drive and finish the installation and start to use it. But because of unknown to me decisions developers took it is impossible. Secondly putting another RPI unit just to serve content is non effective and increases pollution (one needs to setup another unit, it needs to be bought and powered).\nSame happens with Volumnio and MoodeAudio (the latter supports USB drives but with strange behaviour mounting it as a root, it&#x27;s impossible to mount it manually in fstab, which makes it hard to fill its content via smb&#x2F;cifs)')
