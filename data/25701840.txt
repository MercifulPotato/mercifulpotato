Are you experienced with these instruments but looking to discover new chord shapes that you&#x27;ve never seen before?<p>I wrote <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cortab.fun" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cortab.fun</a> exactly for these purposes.<p>It works with any custom tuning of a fretted string instrument. It also tells you what chord you&#x27;re playing if you select your finger placement.<p>I built it entirely in Rust WASM using the Yew web framework as a way to see what it was like to do front-end web dev in Rust. I&#x27;ve enjoyed the experience much more than I ever have using js.<p>It&#x27;s a little past half-baked at this point but it&#x27;s fairly minimal and I wouldn&#x27;t consider it done yet.')
