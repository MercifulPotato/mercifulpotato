Elisp is vastly better than vimscript, the macro system of Vim in nice for one-off macros but quickly reaches its limit and becomes hard to manage if you try to use it to implement advanced functions etc... It&#x27;s improved quite a lot these past few years (notably because of neovim and other forks) but Emacs has been dealing with that stuff since basically forever.<p>Basically I want Vim with an Emacs backend. I don&#x27;t need a bajillion plugins, but I want the things that I use to be easily tweakable and customizable, something that Vim struggles with and Emacs excels at in my experience.')
