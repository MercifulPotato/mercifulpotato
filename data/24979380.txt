This is a pretty Fâ€™ed up way to do business.<p>Open source doesn&#x27;t care about the way you (&#x2F;we) do business.<p>I know its easy to get this defeatist view about OSS, like, &quot;the linux desktop is losing the war&quot; or &quot;iOS is killing open computing&quot; or whatever, but even if that were what was happening here (its not), open source persists. There is no war. Its just people writing code to help other people. In fifty years AWS, Apple, Google, whoever, might be dead, but code will still be here.<p>In this specific case, here&#x27;s how I view this situation. Docker provides an indispensable public service via Docker Hub. They have had six plus years to monetize it, but it turns out, monetizing public services is nearly impossible. AWS has the scale to step in and take over some of the load, and they already have a monetization strategy. Good on AWS for this; Docker couldn&#x27;t handle it, so AWS will.')
