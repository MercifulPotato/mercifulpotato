Public authorities have failed to really drive home the reality of the virus, and instead we get sanitation theatre, a pantomime of virus control, and parents clambering to get schools reopened (while the numbers plummet since they&#x27;ve been closed after Christmas)<p>Example, a local wine shop in my small town where you are not allowed to touch the bottles, but I see the staff inside with their masks off when there&#x27;s no customers in the store.<p>Frankly, I think people really just don&#x27;t _want_ to believe it&#x27;s aerosol transmitted. Because the consequences for public policy would be so drastic; no malls, no factories, no schools, etc. should really be open if you admit it.')
