Your employer can just schedule you to work on election day, forcing you to choose between participating in democracy and not starving. Heck, I would go so far as to say that Covid elected Joseph Biden. If mail voting wasn&#x27;t made so widespread, it&#x27;s entirely possible that not enough people would have gone to the polls and we would be stuck with the fucking angry orange for another 4 years.')
