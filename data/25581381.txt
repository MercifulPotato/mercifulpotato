The implication by the author is that non-essential purchases are a complete waste of money.<p>Going out for a nice meal with friends is an experience. Experiences are valuable. Saving a giant pile of money for your 70s and beyond accomplishes very little.<p>Sure, we don&#x27;t want to ever run out of money. But we also don&#x27;t want to avoid experiences in our lives to build up a pile of money in old age.<p>Enjoying experiences while you are young and healthy is important for a fulfilling life. You&#x27;re going to have more fun with $100 at 25 years old than $100 at 65 years old, inflation adjusted.<p>Enjoy your youth and find a balance between spending and saving. Lifestyle creep absolutely can be a problem, but so can living so frugally that you avoid valuable and unique experiences.')
