It does the things that poor C64 never dreamed of, and if you want constraints, there are always things like &quot;1k demos&quot; which let one express their creativity while keeping the minimal amount of code around.<p>if you want to understand stuff down to the metal, there is a whole embedded world out there. From the simple 8051 with a half-dozen registers to 32 bit ARMs where you can learn how to set up DMA transfers. (My favorite one is 8-bit AVR: the datasheet is small enough you can read it end to end, there are plenty of  peripherals, but at the same time it is slow enough you have to occasionally solve &quot;how to code this quickly&quot; puzzle)<p>I see no reason to mix those two, except because of nostalgia. Yes, in the past you had to be blacksmith and woodworker -- but those are gone. You can still mix those two, and the very first rasp you made still feels very special, but let&#x27;s not pretend it was somehow better than the modern store-bought one.')
