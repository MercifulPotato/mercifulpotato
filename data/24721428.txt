Even at the product launch like new iPhones, the demand is difficult to estimate, so IMO it seems more responsible to give a reasonable expectation to the public like this, than just saying bravely &quot;the service is fully public from today&quot;.<p>I think the take-away from this announcement is their commitment for wider rollout over time from this point on.')
