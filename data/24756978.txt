This is something the US has gone back and forth on for a long time; why do you assume it&#x27;s fixed (i.e. &quot;cemented&quot;) now? And if it&#x27;s not cemented, why would you want to lean into that precedent?<p>&gt; but is somewhat orthogonal to the question of calling out people for bad behavior.<p>How can you make the argument that it&#x27;s &quot;just employers&#x27; exercising their freedom-of-association rights&quot; and then argue that freedom of association is orthogonal? Anyway, we&#x27;re not talking about them exercising their freedom of association rights, we&#x27;re talking about coercing employers into terminating employees who fail to toe the party line.<p>&gt; That happens all the time. So does employers supporting employees&#x27; support of a political candidate.<p>Right, but I&#x27;m guessing you would argue that this is immoral and harmful behavior--if so, why would you advocate for those who would emulate it (note that canceling is <i>even worse</i>, because it&#x27;s not just an employer parting ways with a heretical employee, but a mob <i>pressuring</i> an employer to part ways with said heretical employee)?<p>&gt; Politicization of labor isn&#x27;t new. My relatives who are union are required to spend off-job time working a phone bank for a few hours every election cycle in support of the candidate the union is backing; it&#x27;s part of their union agreement.<p>Why would they do this if the status quo was already &quot;extremely firmly cemented&quot;?')
