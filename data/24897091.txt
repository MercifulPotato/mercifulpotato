Even if the vaccine was only 80% effective, that&#x27;s still 65% reduction.<p>Add in people with dangerous conditions, heart conditions, cancer, morbidly obese, etc., and you could probably knock it down further.<p>And as the percent of the population with immunity rises, the spread will slow quite a bit.<p>We don&#x27;t need heard immunity to open back up.')
