(And I mean the game in general, not just the sale of this franchise.) It&#x27;s like blockchain play-acting.<p>Using a blockchain to track the status of objects which only exist within an online game, and which are only accessible within that game, makes no sense to me. Ultimately, the status of those objects is subject to the whims of the game and its operator, not the blockchain -- since they control the rules of the game. If they want to make the game stop recognizing your &quot;property&quot;, or change what it represents in game, that&#x27;s always something they can do; throwing a blockchain at it doesn&#x27;t change that.<p>Also: I can&#x27;t help but feel really suspicious about a game whose primary feature appears to be its monetization strategy, rather than its gameplay. (Read the rest of the blog -- there&#x27;s virtually nothing in there about what the game actually is!) Does anyone actually play these games to have fun, or is it just a way for cryptocurrency fans to find even more esoteric things to invest in?')
