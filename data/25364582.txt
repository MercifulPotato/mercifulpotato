Even relative newcomers like SaltStack and Ansible are a horrible mess of inconsistent behavior and spaghetti code.<p>There&#x27;s nothing special indicating that mgmt will be any different, and it seems to me like the project isn&#x27;t very active, and I would say the era of complex configuration management is over (moving more towards immutable infra, containers and k8s) so it&#x27;s not worth the effort.<p>If I were to try and give an answer to your question though: mgmt has a dedicated DSL (like Puppet, but unlike Salt and Ansible which is a mess of YAML + Jinja) but without the legacy code and the ability to parallelize execution of states.')
