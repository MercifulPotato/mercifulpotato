Racing at high speeds though public spaces is incredibly irresponsible and highly dangerous to both you and, more importantly, the people around you.<p>You don’t own the road, you share it. You don’t get to put others lives at risk because you feel like it. If you decide it’s a risk worth taking, do it in a safe place, like a race track, so you don’t kill anyone else when you make a mistake.')
