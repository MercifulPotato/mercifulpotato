We have a lot of males in my family and a lot of mechanics, engineers, handy people. Out of 4 siblings they&#x27;ve had a combined number of 5 boys and no girls. Only in the 2nd line do the girls start appearing. Just an observation. The line before that on my fathers side was 3 boys and 1 girl. All boys became some type of engineering profession later, before computers took over.<p>We were poor though, all it took was my mom working as a nurse at the hospital and the hospital had a subsidizied computer leasing program for all their workers. It was a contract thing that renewed after 2-3 years so for 3 periods their leasing computer was my only computer.<p>Before that my older brother had left his c64 with me but I only knew how to play some games on it.<p>First leasing computer I gamed on and let my older brother overclock for me. 2nd one is when I discovered script kiddie stuff, cracking programs, pirating. 3rd one is when I first installed Linux and got hooked. That was around 2000, i was 15.<p>Later in life I&#x27;ve described myself as a control freak and Linux gave me control and insight into things I was fascinated by.<p>By chance it also gave me a wonderful career where my knowledge is so valued that I can work where I want, when I want and can say no to anything without feeling fear for my job.')
