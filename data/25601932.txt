Item(by='lucb1e', descendants=None, kids=[25602235], score=None, time=1609492698, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25601899, text='Not sure a whole book is needed, it seems fairly straightforward to show that society is based on threats of violence.<p>If you don&#x27;t pay someone, that someone can go to a judge. If you indeed did something illegal (e.g. if you did a double spend, money forgery, whatever) you should be declared guilty and ordered to pay the damages plus perhaps a fine. If you don&#x27;t do that, the amount due will increase and eventually you get ordered to jail. If you don&#x27;t go voluntarily, they will make you. Of course everything comes down to force and eventually violence in the end. Why else would you comply with things that don&#x27;t please you? (Because you&#x27;re an honest party, okay, and the vast majority of people are, but not everyone is in the privileged position where they have what they want without applying dishonesty.)<p>Even if you think to solve it with technology, preventing a crime is indeed better than detecting and punishing one, but let&#x27;s say it&#x27;s impossible to detect the double spend ahead of time and your technological solution only finds out that there was a double spend after the fact. What&#x27;s it going to do, block your card from now on? In the end, it will still have real world consequences for you. Taking away someone&#x27;s card, through physical or technological means, it&#x27;s all more or less the same thing.')
