We placed the value of that higher than &quot;but you&#x27;ll make more money by renting&quot;, etc.<p>When we decided we hated the look of the kitchen, we tore it out and replaced it. We&#x27;ll get to keep any increased equity (questionable, sure) that we made for doing so. My wife is giving the bathrooms a similar look lately, so I suspect she has plans to gut them as well.<p>Nobody can tell us &quot;no&quot; (to an extent). That&#x27;s a kind of freedom I&#x27;m willing to pay for.')
