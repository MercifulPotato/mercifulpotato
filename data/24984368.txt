(I say mainly because the front pull down paper feed isn&#x27;t fully working, but that is my fault I damaged it, not the printers fault)<p>I&#x27;ve put another ~15k prints on it in the time I&#x27;ve had it, Its still going, Sure its big and bulky but its a work horse thats just keeps going and going.')
