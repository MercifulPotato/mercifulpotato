Over the past 3 years, I&#x27;ve had two periods of a couple of work-free months where my output went sky-high, and I miss that.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong: I love my job, the people, the industry, etc. In fact I was hired there because they built a major pillar of the company on one of my open source projects. But at the same time, 8h a day uses up a significant chunk of my creative juices that would otherwise turbo-charge my open source initiatives.<p>I see all of these people who have enough money that it generates a comfortable income for them with minimal effort on their part, and it tears me up to see them wasting all that luxurious time on frivolous pursuits rather than contributing to humanity. I won&#x27;t complete most of my works because there&#x27;s not enough time in a human lifespan (and I&#x27;m at peace with that - it just means I have to prioritize), but there&#x27;s so much more I could accomplish without these other claims on my time...')
