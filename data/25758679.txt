You&#x27;ve either got the right mentality, or you don&#x27;t. This comment [0] from an earlier discussion always sticks in my head during these conversations, though its context is somewhat different.<p>I also believe that self-improvement should focus on being the best possible version of yourself, not striving to be something you are not and cannot be. We are not angels (okay, I&#x27;m not -- I&#x27;ll let you speak for yourself) and so we cannot expect to hold ourselves to the ideals of angels and get a worthwhile result.<p>And, even further, I believe that the worst sin in hiring is to hire someone toxic. Almost any other deficiency can be tolerated. Toxic people drag down everyone around them, and that&#x27;s not acceptable. There are surprisingly many toxic people out there, they interview surprisingly well, and they&#x27;re <i>always</i> in the interview pool, because they keep losing their jobs. Don&#x27;t be toxic and don&#x27;t hire toxic... or  the team&#x2F;company is completely doomed. Compared to that, choosing between &quot;very good&quot; and &quot;outstandingly excellent&quot; starts to look a bit less critical!<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=19579047" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=19579047</a>')
