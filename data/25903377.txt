Item(by='adventured', descendants=None, kids=[25903490], score=None, time=1611584619, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25902490, text='&gt; Taiwan being invaded by China is a signal of the end of US hegemony around the world.<p>It&#x27;ll only loudly signal an end to US hegemony in Asia (which has already happened de facto). That is inevitable regardless of a Taiwan invasion and everyone knows it at this point. China has gained immense positioning during the pandemic while all other major nations have lost. There was never a scenario where the US could retain its former dominance in Asia as China arrived at being a full-fledged superpower (they&#x27;ll be there militarily this decade). US hegemony, to the extent it exists, will remain intact elsewhere for decades after it lost that status in Asia. US hegemony isn&#x27;t based on signals and perception, it&#x27;s based on military force projection and whether there are equal counters to that in a given region. China is very close to powerful enough to counter the US military in the Asia region (not just near its borders) and that determines the hegemony regardless of whether China goes into Taiwan anytime soon. Anyone thinking the US still retains hegemony in Asia is most likely fooling themselves at this point.')
