The Mach ones expose the classic Mach &quot;microkernely&quot; API, and the BSD ones provide the traditional POSIX API<p>The term &quot;syscall&quot; is a bit ambiguous – sometimes it is said that the BSD side has syscalls but the Mach side has traps, other times it is said that BSD syscalls and Mach traps are the two different types of XNU syscalls.<p>Definitely the BSD syscalls include a bunch invented by Apple themselves (not inherited from *BSD), and I think the same is the case for the Mach traps as well')
