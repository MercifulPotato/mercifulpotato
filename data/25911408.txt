You had months.  Don&#x27;t sue <i>after</i> the election.<p>And don&#x27;t ask for state legislators to pick the winner, either.  Voters weren&#x27;t voting for presidential electors when they voted for state legislators.<p>And don&#x27;t say &quot;you don&#x27;t actually know who won&quot;.  Yes, we do in fact know perfectly well who won.  What you perhaps mean is &quot;we don&#x27;t know who would have won under what the rules should have been.&quot;  Well, perhaps, but we know who won under what the rules <i>were</i>.  You don&#x27;t want that set of rules?  <i>Sue before the election</i>.  You had months.')
