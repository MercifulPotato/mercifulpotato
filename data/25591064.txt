Or anyone in particular. They&#x27;re building to check off boxes in order to sell top down to C-level execs that never touch the stuff.<p>Atlassian products are all like this, and each one is a horrible trash fire.<p>Confluence is the worst wiki product I&#x27;ve ever used. Gross syntax, slow, clunky plugin system, awkward permissions. Install MediaWiki and be done with it.<p>Bitbucket is slow and feels like it&#x27;s from the 90s. It doesn&#x27;t seem to do multithreading well - sometimes force pushed branch rebases pick up a new, unrelated author. A bug that hasn&#x27;t been fixed in years, and only one of many. How many times will merging not actually work?<p>Jira is a special kind of hell. It&#x27;s like every team needs their own embedded Atlassian solutions engineer to get it into a usable state. Not an EM or PM, but a specially dedicated role just to deal with Jira nonsense. Why even bother?<p>Atlassian is like Salesforce for business process, but if it were written by all-remote temp contractors churning through Jira tickets themselves.')
