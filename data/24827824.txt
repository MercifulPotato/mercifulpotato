They all seem hyper-focused on exposing raw building materials when that totally misses brutalism&#x27;s goals. A simple, small, unpainted cinder block shack doesn&#x27;t hide its materials, is made of raw concrete, but probably isn&#x27;t brutalist. Neither is a brick victorian.<p>The idea that beautiful forms can come from purely functional design without needing to cover things up with baroque decoration is really a central theme. As is making these huge structures with small, modular elements designed at human scale to get something that&#x27;s truly people-focused. All of this stems from a utopian idea that scaling production can provide functional, beautifully designed buildings for use by all people, rather than just the privileged few. While the style is polarizing, I&#x27;d say it often accomplished its goals. In my experience, well-designed brutalist buildings are easy to navigate, have large open spaces, have lots of little nooks and crannies to foster human interaction, and have really beautiful forms.<p>While the page has nice enough lines and makes good use of color, the html tags have quite the opposite effect that a brutalist-era designer would hope to bestow upon the user. In this way, I&#x27;d say that this website is a far better example of brutalism than that website.')
