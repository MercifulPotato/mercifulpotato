The argument is that we have known for literally thousands of years that charging interest on loans is a destructive practice. It&#x27;s banned in Islam, Judaism, and Christianity for a reason. Yet we cry today at the mess we&#x27;re in, as if we didn&#x27;t know any better.<p>&gt; They are contractually owed a payment. Its not profit until expenses are subtracted. And there is always the risk that the other party does not return the money.<p>They&#x27;re owed more money than the capital. That&#x27;s what is prohibited. It doesn&#x27;t matter if it&#x27;s profit or revenue.
