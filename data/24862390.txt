Someone making $25,000 per year might have a disposable income of $0. Asking this person to kick in $5000 seems ludicrous.<p>I honestly don&#x27;t know how you could assess fairness without looking at ability-to-pay:<p>(income) - (basic survival needs) = (money leftover you can potentially contribute to the government)<p>This is obvious, fair, and is why most nations have progressive taxation structures.')
