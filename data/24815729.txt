We have the highest disposable income in the OECD: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cdn.statcdn.com&#x2F;Infographic&#x2F;images&#x2F;teaser&#x2F;14773.jpeg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cdn.statcdn.com&#x2F;Infographic&#x2F;images&#x2F;teaser&#x2F;14773.jpeg</a>. The median household income of a married couple with kids is $95,000. And the taxes are extremely low in that bracket. Our unemployment rate in the midst of Trump’s botched handling of COVID is less than what France’s unemployment rate is in a normal year.<p>Even when you hear complaints about things like healthcare, the debates are more about universal coverage than the quality or affordability of care itself. Americans are overwhelmingly satisfied with their own healthcare: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.gallup.com&#x2F;poll&#x2F;245195&#x2F;americans-rate-healthcare-quite-positively.aspx" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.gallup.com&#x2F;poll&#x2F;245195&#x2F;americans-rate-healthcar...</a>.

We have more TVs, more cars, etc.<p>It’s easy to assume that Americans are just ignorant and irrational. But Americans know that Europe has a bunch of services we don’t, and they pay much higher taxes in return. Democrats make that comparison all the time. People are aware of it. But the fact is that the current system works pretty well for your typical voter. A flatter society with more social services would be better for a lot of people. However, your average suburban married couple would take a significant hit to their standard of living if they lived in France instead.')
