The intelligence needed to carry out your described outcomes is more or less AGI already, and that is advanced enough that describing it as a dumb optimization machine is likely naive.<p>Further, if you want to optimize stamp collection, you don&#x27;t tell a model what it can&#x27;t do, you tell it what it can do. It can make trades on stampcollectors.com, for +&#x2F;- 20% of asking price, max 30 trades per day. Yes, there are some funny examples of RL algos finding weird hacks to beat their simulation, but let&#x27;s not get ahead of ourselves. We will not see an AI that, from scratch, can learn how to hack bank accounts to buy stamps. The number of nth order observations you need before one can even consider trying to hack a bank account to purchase stamps is ludicrous. If it is even possible, it pales in comparison to the likelihood of someone just making a bot to hack banks to begin with.')
