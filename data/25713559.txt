We&#x27;ve been living charmed lives up until now because the ability to broadcast to large audiences has only been within the capabilities of a select few media outlets that were vetted and controlled to varying degrees by the government to make sure they didn&#x27;t sow too much discord. And this is healthy, because a divided nation loses its international competitiveness and in the worst case risks collapse.<p>We&#x27;re now in the unprecedented situation where individual people can out-broadcast even nation states with the help of social media companies, most of which have their head offices in the USA, limiting their dependency upon and reachability from other governments of the world. It&#x27;s a decent situation all around because having such companies headquartered in a repressive regime would have damaging effects worldwide. But we still run into some problems:<p>1. Their morals are local, but their reach is international. This has caused a lot of friction in the past, and that friction will only increase going forward.<p>2. They&#x27;re being pressured to bow to local &quot;truths&quot; or risk being banned in a number of nations. These &quot;truths&quot; generally come to light from local issues, and while they can be easy to decypher in autocratic regimes, they absolutely will NOT be so easy to arbitrate in functioning democracies. We&#x27;ll eventually reach the point where every social media company will need a team of sociologists and political strategists in order to figure out what&#x27;s behind every government&#x27;s complaints over what&#x27;s being broadcast by their citizens, and how best to respond (making them higher arbiters of truth than even the government). The national self-determination issues alone are staggering.<p>The endgame of this is increased government regulation and increased pressure for a single national &quot;truth&quot;, which must be defended vigorously in order to keep the government functional. The increased conflict between these American companies and local governments will increase to the point where eventually the companies will win and essentially set the policy of truth worldwide, which leaves us in a very centralized and fragile state when it comes to corruption, especially since companies - unlike governments - have only profit as a motive, and do not answer to the people.')
