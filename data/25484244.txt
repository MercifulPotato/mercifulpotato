This seems (to me) to me clearly established, and essentially irrefutable.\n\n  2. do mask mandates reduce the spread of COVID19? this is an entirely different question, and has almost nothing whatsoever to do with the abilities of masks referenced in (1) above.\n</code></pre>\nI would suggest that we know that the answer to (1) is yes, without doubt, but we have only hand-wavy answers to (2).
