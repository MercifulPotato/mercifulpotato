Gut reaction on the UI is that it feels very cramped -- the fonts are kind of biggish for the spaces they go, and there isn&#x27;t enough breathing room between things and somehow it manages to take my whole screen but still give me the feeling I&#x27;d like to make the window a lot bigger. (note: viewing on an MBP)<p>Also, no comment threads?  I&#x27;d much rather have commenting (hierarchical threads) on a reddit replacement than live chat.  Maybe that&#x27;s just me and maybe that&#x27;s your entire point.  I was just surprised by it and have very little interest in watching a chat stream fly by.')
