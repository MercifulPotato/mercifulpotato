Item(by='pdonis', descendants=None, kids=[24822593], score=None, time=1603069032, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24821699, text='<i>&gt; It&#x27;s a parabola in a uniform gravity field</i><p>In relativity, there is no such thing as a &quot;uniform gravity field&quot;, if by that you mean a field where the &quot;acceleration due to gravity&quot; is the same everywhere. The closest you can come is the &quot;gravity field&quot; inside a rocket accelerating in a straight line in empty space, where the acceleration felt by the crew is constant. That kind of &quot;gravity field&quot; has an &quot;acceleration due to gravity&quot; that decreases linearly with height.')
