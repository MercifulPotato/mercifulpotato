I don&#x27;t know why this non-falsifiability argument keeps getting repeated! It would be nice for string theory to make more claims than just that, but they&#x27;re still working on it. LQG is an example of a framework that truly makes no claims, because there isn&#x27;t even a LQG setup for three dimensions of space. To my knowledge it hasn&#x27;t even been proven that there <i>is</i> an LQG setup for three dimensions of space.')
