And at least one officer died.<p>If they had advanced just a few minutes earlier, according to the timelines that have been put out, they would have gotten to members of Congress. A Republican member of Congress said that one of his fellow freshmen members voted against accepting election results because he was afraid people would kill his family. A Democratic member of Congress said that some GOP members have broken down in tears and are afraid for their lives if they vote for this impeachment.<p>If you want to argue about slippery slope, fine. But to characterize this attack on our nation as simply people being &quot;uncouth&quot; is absurd.')
