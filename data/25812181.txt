This means zero trust. We, Krypt.co, cannot access your keys or see where you&#x27;re authenticating. The keys only live in the Krypton app on your phone.<p>Sounds great, except one of the &quot;ends&quot; is likely the Secure Enclave (iOS) or Keystore (Android), over which the user has basically no control.  So while the architecture might require &quot;zero trust&quot; of Krypt.co, it still requires complete trust of Apple or Google.<p>Perhaps completely trusting one of those companies is already the reality for nearly everyone, in terms of using a mobile device to access online data, but hopefully WebAuthn-supporting sites don&#x27;t put extra restrictions on the devices you can use, via the &quot;feature&quot; of attestation:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.imperialviolet.org&#x2F;2019&#x2F;01&#x2F;01&#x2F;zkattestation.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.imperialviolet.org&#x2F;2019&#x2F;01&#x2F;01&#x2F;zkattestation.html</a>')
