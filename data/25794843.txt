I&#x27;m 37.<p>99.9% of messaging (for me) occurs via iMessages or SMS. FB Messenger is occasionally used for people who are more acquaintances (don&#x27;t have their phone number).<p>I don&#x27;t really have a good reason to <i>not</i> use iMessages (blue bubbles). Reasonably secure and Just Works. SMS on the other hand.... my least favorite part of SMS (besides the complete lack of security) is that media messages are crippled in quality.
