Collectively, that’s over 100 times more radiation dumped into the environment than that released by nuclear power stations.»<p>About 1% of it is leaked into air, so about 500 tonnes of uranium and 1500 tonnes of thorium are leaked into air every year.<p>However, uranium and thorium are much less dangerous than radioactive iodine, strontium, and cesium.')
