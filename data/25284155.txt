A $6&#x2F;mo electricity bill is pretty much unheard of around here. My electricity bill is around $50&#x2F;mo and we only have 2 people living in the house. It would still take me ~25 years at my current rates and usages to break even, but the economics might work out better if you have a higher occupancy residence.')
