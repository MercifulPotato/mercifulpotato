I was a &quot;victim&quot; of that scandal, but if I ever decided to change employers I knew where the door was and I knew my résumé would get me considered at the other players. The agreement was mostly to keep their phone bank of recruiters from polling me continuously and the managers like four levels above me from playing pachinko with the pay and benefits packages (to the detriment of the folks at my level).<p>Regardless, the agreement was illegal and existing law broke it up without breaking up any of the companies. I don&#x27;t see how the existence of that scandal supports the hypothesis that larger corporate breakups are either needed or beneficial.<p>Microsoft of today is an OS company, browser company, videogame development company, and cloud computing company, and they seem to be doing pretty well overall at it; happy users, good products, decent inter-operation.')
