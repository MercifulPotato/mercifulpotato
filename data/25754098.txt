According to BBC the most popular accounts on Parler were people like Sean Hannity and Ted Cruz, who each had followers in the millions.<p>Of course Parler had a problem with some - maybe even many - violent people, like the Washington rioters, but it seems to me that the vast majority of Parler users were not violent people, but fairly normal republicans of the kind that are still not banned on Twitter and Facebook (like the two persons I mentioned).<p>Removing the hyperbole on each side, I think it&#x27;d be interesting if the EU looked into this to conclude if the shutdown of Parler was ok or not.')
