There is no other way to learn. Write them off as animals used for training if we want full accounting, but researchers&#x27; time is scarce enough as it is so asking them to publish uninterpretable results is a non-starter.&quot;<p>&gt; I&#x27;m sorry but this simply isn&#x27;t true. During my masters i did in vivo surgery on 30 rodents and tested how many the procedure was succesful in (10). I had to record how many the procedure was sucessful in and write this up in my methods. I&#x27;m not sure how you see keeping a record of this as something that takes a significant length of time that you wouldn&#x27;t bother to record it.<p>In fact i&#x27;m pretty sure (at least for the UK) that keeping records like this is essential under the home office rules for animal safety in scientific procedures. These rules are there to help with the 3 R&#x27;s (reduce, replace, refinement). This guidance aims to cut down on the use of animals in research or at least ensure quality experiments are being ran. If you don&#x27;t measure - how can you improve?<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nc3rs.org.uk&#x2F;the-3rs" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nc3rs.org.uk&#x2F;the-3rs</a>')
