The 9100A was a descendant of a prototype developed by Tom Osborne in 1964. There was a later lawsuit from Olivetti that certain features (especially the mag card) overlapped their 1965 P101 patents, which was settled for ~$900K. No insult to Olivetti’s great achievements but this was hardly cause and effect.')
