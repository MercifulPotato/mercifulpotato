My impression is that Embarcadero (who bought and own the rights to Delphi) still have customers with legacy Delphi applications who pay them for their newer backward-compatible Delphi product, so they&#x27;re unlikely to release the older versions for free. It&#x27;s also a bit of a hassle to run on modern PCs. With Turbo Pascal you can just use DOSBox but you need to run Delphi on an old Windows version. If it runs in Wine, that might be the easiest option.')
