Item(by='goostavos', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605291078, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25084820, text='&gt;This is the first time in my life that we&#x27;ve tried to apply transitive risk logic to justify curtailing of individual freedoms.<p>Seems wrong to me, too. There exists no society (that I&#x27;m aware of) where the decisions of an individual don&#x27;t have second or third order effects on other members of the society. We manage and deal with this risk every day of our lives. Sometimes it flat out sucks. However, you can&#x27;t control for it without raising a lot of very, very uncomfortable questions about what personal choices get to be made, by whom, and under which conditions.<p>This boils down to how you see the world, I guess. Much like any of the usual contentious political topics, both &#x27;camps&#x27; view the other side as morally reprehensible.')
