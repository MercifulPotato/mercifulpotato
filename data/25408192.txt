Data that wasn&#x27;t <i>created</i> by the companies; they just happen to have control of it. Another example is the recent FB lawsuit threat against researchers. [1] Facebook will squawk about user privacy to justify this, but I have a hard time thinking Mark &quot;privacy is dead&quot; Zuckerberg is particularly worried about that.<p>What I think all off these large companies are doing is pulling up the open-web ladder after they&#x27;ve climbed it to dominant positions. The problem with anti-trust action is that it&#x27;s reactive; we wait until a company has gotten too big, and then hope we can cut it down to size. I&#x27;d love to see moves toward proactive open-data and open-algorithm requirements, so that we guarantee a level playing field. That won&#x27;t be easy, but neither is trying to rein in companies with annual profits in the tens of billions.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnn.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;24&#x2F;tech&#x2F;facebook-nyu-political-ad-data&#x2F;index.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnn.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;24&#x2F;tech&#x2F;facebook-nyu-political-a...</a>')
