There are more trains. You get to walk more.<p>This is false. About half of the population lives outside big cities, where you&#x27;ll need a car to survive. I don&#x27;t see people&#x27;s shape changes in the rural areas.<p>&gt; 2) Food portions are smaller, making it harder to overeat.<p>I think you got this backward. Food portions are smaller in Japan because people&#x27;s stomach is smaller. Junk foods are cheap, so it&#x27;s still easy to overeat.')
