I got to the point of a custom Tex template that used listings, only to find out Manim strips any color, so I attempted to parse the SVG and reinsert color using Manim APIs... only to find out Code did everything I wanted and more :)<p>Once I found out about Code, I&#x27;d say probably 15 minutes to land on the opacity strategy and a few minutes to learn how to control the camera, so in the end, not bad.
