Item(by='fermienrico', descendants=None, kids=[25874910, 25869009, 25869105, 25869512, 25869222], score=None, time=1611295630, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25868713, text='I am currently reading &quot;The Idea Factory&quot; [1], the story of Bell Labs and its innovation streak for many decades. There were so many amazing things Bell Labs worked on - all directly related to solving business problems. At one point, they were given a task of developing the most perfect lubrication oil dispenser with a requirement that it dispenses exactly 15 drops of oil per squeeze of the trigger. They worked on Tractors that dug channels for laying telephone lines to materials that lead to the invention of the transistor to solve the problem of unreliability of vacuum tube based switch boards. Some worked on improving manufacturing and invented what we call Quality Control. Everything was deep and wide, but still tied to the Bell&#x27;s business.<p>When I look at Google X and bunch of modern corporate labs (Lab 126, Facebook probably has something, Intel Labs (drones!), Microsoft Labs), I see a whole lotta hoo haa about tech innovation, but nothing with a long term vision of integration, capitalization and sustenance. No sense of practicality and pragmatism. May be Loon is a way to make Google an internet company (ISP), I could be wrong but as an outsider, it feels like a PR stunt than anything else.<p>Highly recommend this book.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Idea-Factory-Great-American-Innovation&#x2F;dp&#x2F;0143122797" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Idea-Factory-Great-American-Innovatio...</a>')
