Now, I&#x27;ve visited enough places to know that they change a lot, and that usually when you&#x27;re there with context you can spot them. But from a weirdly angled photo I can&#x27;t tell if that sequence of short white stripes is a crossing or some type of intersection marker like it could be in some places.<p>When I decided it looked too narrow to be a crossing, the captcha wouldn&#x27;t let me through until I agreed that it in fact was a crossing.')
