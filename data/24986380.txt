The divorce in in the case was dramatic, repercussions are still around, 27 years later. My father messed up in multiple ways, heavy ones too, but the unilateral vision of the system also forced my easily influenced vision of kid in a certain way for a long time, until I was way older (about 20 years old, my parents divorced when I was 3 and a half).<p>Up to this day, I&#x27;m really conflicted about everything surrounding it. This article says the truth, but it does overlook how painful it is for a 3 years old to have 2 bedrooms and 2 different places to stay. I can confirm that, it&#x27;s one of the things I suffered the most for. And it goes on until you are much older (14-16-18) when it becomes alienating.<p>My uncle went through a divorce and things went exactly how described on the article. The mother had no job, she was renting an owned place as income, so she took over their family house and the kids and she got also paid. My uncle was able to fix some of the situation, not sure how, it seems like he got in a better relationship with the ex wife.<p>It&#x27;s a nightmare I&#x27;d never recommend to anyone and the psychological support I received as a child was not closely enough. I repeatedly had to &quot;choose&quot; between my parents throughout my life, even though it was clearly stated to me by the child support that it should never have happened. That money should have never been between me, my father and my mother, while it was repeatedly and continuously one of the key points. I blame both parents for that, but today I ask myself if the government shouldn&#x27;t provide a lot more support to me, the kid (and my sister).<p>Anyway, it&#x27;s a big mess, I can&#x27;t help but seeing a lot of truth in what&#x27;s written.')
