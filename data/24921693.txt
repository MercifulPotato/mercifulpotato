Some are consequential - changing the virus&#x27; behaviour - others are not. What constitutes a &quot;strain&quot; is fuzzy, since viruses are constantly evolving and it&#x27;s an artificial category or human construct. To get away from that, it&#x27;s often helpful to think in terms of phylogeny or genetic relationships.<p>You can see a phylogenetic tree of the clades (essentially a &quot;family tree&quot; determined through mutations of the virus) &amp; a map showing the distribution of the different clades of the virus worldwide on GSAID platform:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gisaid.org&#x2F;epiflu-applications&#x2F;phylodynamics&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gisaid.org&#x2F;epiflu-applications&#x2F;phylodynamics&#x2F;</a>')
