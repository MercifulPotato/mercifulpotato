Seems like the competition already caught up to them, despite the fanboys claiming it&#x27;ll never happen.<p>For 2021, Tesla has <i>nothing new in the pipeline</i> for the European market, while its competitors have quite a lot of models lined up, so I&#x27;m pretty sure Teslas marketshare will continue dropping. They&#x27;ll sell more vehicles than 2020, sure, but only because the EV market as a whole is growing.')
