The one thing Apple will try to defend is the concept of an app&#x2F;container. I wrote a similar comment supporting their actions with video game streaming platforms the other day[1]. Any app that creates some kind of a wedge into another kind of app&#x2F;container ecosystem is not going to fly. I do believe this will get solved by having a store within a store model. It just means all the packages&#x2F;apps that are run from within the other platform will need to have some kind of listing&#x2F;metadata shared and controllable in some fashion by Apple. The interesting thing will be the relationship with devs. Does Apple need to have a direct one or not?<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25022746" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25022746</a>')
