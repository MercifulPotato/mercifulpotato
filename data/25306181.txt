That&#x27;s what the Dothraki, a fictional nation, represent to the narrative of the story: the instability and existential threat this represents. The essayist can quibble that the actual raiders wore colorful comfortable clothes, but to argue that <i>therefore</i> the Dothraki is a demeaning stereotype is <i>not</i> reasonably defensible, and so he leans very heavily on an offhand quote and the observation that Dothraki armor look <i>nothing like</i> Sioux buckskin. It&#x27;s absurd.')
