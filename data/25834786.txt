There&#x27;s nothing more damaging than having such beliefs (religion maybe, but I think I&#x27;ll fold religion and nationalism into one since nationalists are often the ones to  insist that a true scotsman has some specific religion).<p>Sure, there are differences, but they are differences that are taught and indoctrinated, not something we&#x27;re born with, and we can &quot;simply&quot; stop doing that.')
