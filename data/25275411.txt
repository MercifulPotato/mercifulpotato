Sweden has GDP which is measured in <i>dollars per year</i>. The units are different, so the numbers aren&#x27;t comparable.<p>I guess one can say &quot;Sweden produces about one Apple&#x27;s worth in a year&quot;, or &quot;Saudi Arabia produces about one Apple&#x27;s worth in a year and a bit&quot;. This however makes owning Sweden&#x2F;Saudi Arabia look better than owning Apple by a shot.')
