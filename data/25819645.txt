Should we use typescript? etc,etc vs just using Ruby On Rails &#x2F; Symfony &#x2F; etc.<p>&gt; Let&#x27;s just continue to build better SSR tools so we can have the best of both worlds<p>Yes, just adding more and more complexity to compensate what you get by default with traditional MVC seems to be the right approach (irony).<p>Almost none of the SPAs I&#x27;ve been involved in in the last 5 years, required &quot;desktop like&quot; interativity. All of those would have been served a lot better by more traditional approaches.<p>I think SPAs and in general frontend-heavy frameworks are an amazing technology, but certainly overused. Bussiness wise, it makes no sense. Most of us, building SPAs, shouldn&#x27;t. Problem is, it is not trendy or hip to use RoR, and everyone wants to have fun too.')
