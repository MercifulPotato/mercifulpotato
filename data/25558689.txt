I&#x27;ve been using it instead of my editor&#x27;s search-and-replace for a while now and am pretty happy with how it behaves (with some flaws noted in gh issues).<p>Let me know if you find this useful. If you&#x27;re looking for other CLI refactoring tools there&#x27;s a link list at the bottom of the README.')
