Judges are people too, and respond to incentives. And yeah <i>some</i> individual judges suck, and are bad at their jobs. Like <i>some</i> doctors, and <i>some</i> lawyers, and <i>some</i> engineers.<p>A system that reduces their impact and influence, like randomization does, minimizes the harm of a bad apple, and also reduces their blast radius. They <i>can&#x27;t</i> advertise that they&#x27;ll adjudicate your case.<p>After all, isn&#x27;t this why we have appeals courts? If you could trust your individual judge implicitly, why allow an appeal?<p>Trust, sure, but verify.<p>&gt; Or what happens if I accuse the randomizer of being untrustworthy?<p>Open source the RNG. Let people see for themselves. Publish the stats that show it&#x27;s a uniform random distribution.')
