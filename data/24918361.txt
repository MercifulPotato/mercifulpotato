I went to a science and math boarding school for high school where we had Internet access.  We used Archie to find FTP sites to find stuff.<p>I think it was Christmas break 1993 when a high school friend came to visit (he went to a different college) and started up Mosaic.  I asked him what it was and then he laughed that I was still using Archie and FTP to find stuff.<p>I think it was xmosaic version 0.9 or something like that.')
