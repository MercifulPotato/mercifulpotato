In many countries there is still unvoluntary army draft.<p>&quot;Some idea&quot; of potential consequences - yeah, you can get killed. If I was sure that I could get killed for morally valid reasons (like defending my homeland, your moral validity may differ) and not to defend oil execs exploiting poorer coutries, I would have less objections. I&#x27;m rather convinced that we will have some big war soon and I&#x27;ll try to help defend my country first with my skills and if that&#x27;s not enough, then at least as cannon fodder. BTW, I&#x27;m not from USA, we had forced draft until several years ago.')
