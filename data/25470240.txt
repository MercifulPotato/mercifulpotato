It seems everyone wants either Intel or AMD to pivot to ARM64 (<i>very unlikely</i>) in the server space. But with NVIDIA&#x27;s $40 billion purchase of ARM -- I wonder what they&#x27;re cooking up?<p>I think a high-performance ARM64 CPU from NVIDIA with an on-die GPU would be a great offering. In many benchmarks it&#x27;s actually the on-die GPU that makes the M1 so much faster. A general purpose on-die GPU would help speed up a lot of low and mid-level cloud workloads, especially with native kernel support.<p>Good luck, NVIDIA. And godspeed!')
