As a cyclist and motorcyclist I take distracted driving seriously and don&#x27;t actually watch youtube videos while driving (just listen).<p>My issue with this argument though is that the cat is already out of the bag- by blocking youtube on a larger screen, and similarly not allowing Siri to play youtube via voice commands Apple may claim they are doing it for safety, but in reality all is does is make people manually fiddle with their phone or watch a video on a smaller screen. I just don&#x27;t believe there is any real world safety benefit to the paternalistic blocking.')
