Item(by='thln666', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603834753, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24911012, text='I mean, GM was producing the first &quot;modern&quot; EV 24 years ago (1996) - and are one of the biggest traditional auto manufacturers with both a history of producing EVs&#x2F;hybrids as well as a plan to introduce a large number of EVs across their brands. It&#x27;s definitely not as fast as we&#x27;d all like, but I think the indication that they know ICE is limited lifespan (for a lot of reasons) is definitely built into GM&#x27;s history and future. It&#x27;s no Tesla as far as EV volume, capability, and product line - but they&#x27;re definitely working on it (like the slow multi-million-vehicle-production-per-year company they are). I think it&#x27;s hard to argue that GM has known about this and ignored the problem, though.<p>Anyway, disclaimer: I work for Cruise and so I&#x27;m clearly a shill for GM, so you can just ignore a lot of what I say because I&#x27;m 100% biased.')
