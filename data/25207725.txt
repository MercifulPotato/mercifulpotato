And those politics are not going to change unless serious political action (read: lawmaking) forces it to be so. It&#x27;s in a similar vein as &quot;right to repair&quot; or whatever.<p>At the end of the day, if you don&#x27;t have a datasheet and the vendor gives you the finger, you&#x27;re always going to be running a rat race against them, struggling to support 10 year old hardware with free alternatives, and they&#x27;ll always win because they control the playing field. Further analysis of this phenomena (&quot;what is the root cause of this attitude, and why does our society allow it?&quot;) would require actually criticizing and analyzing software development in the grander context of workforce politics over the past, say, 40 to 50 years. Spoiler alert: doing this will probably make you depressed.')
