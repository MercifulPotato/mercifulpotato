Item(by='webmobdev', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603415289, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24862333, text='&gt; but I have a hard time figuring out why I’m so uncomfortable with Apple’s decision here.<p>You are facing what marketers fear the most - a &quot;cognitive dissonance&quot;. Basically, when words don&#x27;t match deeds, you start questioning and start thinking instead of blindly believing someone. When customers start to do that, it creates a lot of headaches for brand managers and marketers because it implies that you are starting to lose trust in them, and that obviously doesn&#x27;t bode well for a company&#x27;s profit margins.<p>With respect to Apple here, I have been quite vocal on HN for a long time that Apple has been repeatedly LYING to us that they care about our privacy. They absolutely do not. They are using the exact same tactic that Google used in the beginning - pretend to be trustworthy and than slowly change the terms and policy to mine our data for profit. In fact, Apple has been increasingly becoming more and more intrusive in mining our personal data. And their marketing narration has been to try to paint this as a good thing - that they are protecting our privacy by being the sole custodian of it, but you have to &quot;trust&quot; them to do the right thing.')
