A lot of companies are not data-driven enough. But with OKRs and behavioral interviewing, the trend is towards companies and interview processes being more data driven.<p>I&#x27;d suggest that this makes it <i>more</i> important for you to track numbers. You&#x27;re responsible for your own career - your current employer certainly isn&#x27;t concerned about where you will be 10 years from now.<p>My recommendation would be, from now on, to keep an eye on the 3 - 5 metrics you can realistically help in moving in a year. Track the numbers independently if possible. It matters much <i>more</i> to your career than to your company, and helps you share a story about your capabilities to future bosses and employers.')
