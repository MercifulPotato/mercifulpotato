That is a cognitive barrier acting as a breaking force that eliminates any development.  To solve for that frameworks provide an abstraction layer so that developers can envision the DOM more as a graph to be searched.<p>There are all kinds of performance penalties for superficially reinventing a technology like this, but the bigger limitation is lost creative potential.  Instead of operating according to the capabilities of the language or API the developer is operating according to the limitations and most common approaches of the framework.  For example templating is mostly easy.  State management is ridiculously easy.  But, the frameworks would have you think these are massive accomplishments requiring the titanic efforts of a super genius.')
