There is a clear line, which is crossed the moment someone resorts to violence instead of speech, and it has been drawn clearly <i>in law</i>. The bad actors would be those looking to reduce freedoms such as speech, based on nothing more than disagreement, which as it happens is something fascists (among others) have done when they&#x27;ve had the chance.')
