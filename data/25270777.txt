A loved one bought me a genealogy DNA kit - because I do tons of genealogy.<p>But I also do IT security for a living. DNA databases are a magnet for powerful bad actors and submitting my DNA to one would introduce new risk to me and my family members. This loved one lives in a world where this sort of risk is invisible to them. There&#x27;s no simple way for me to explain it to them.<p>Now this DNA kit just sits here, right along with my guilt.')
