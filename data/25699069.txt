Protesting that the other guy won is one thing. Storming the capitol to <i>force</i> your guy in while the votes are counted is a <i>completely</i> different thing.<p>If you are telling yourself otherwise you might wanna do a reality check. E.g. imagine  the whole thing in flipped roles (if you have enough fantasy). Republicans would be <i>completely outraged</i> over all the actions they did in the past 4 years if it was the other team who did them.<p>I am not from the US and think the whole two party thing is silly anyways, but the shere cognitive distortion going on there hurts. Quite frankly it is below any HN user to uncritically wave a team flag that way, especially when it means you become blind to reality by doing so.<p>The US Dems would be a center-right party in most european nations and last time I checked we weren&#x27;t the unfree (&quot;socialist!&quot;) doomscape Republicans like to paint it as. In fact I&#x27;d rather live under the EU&#x2F;German laws than under whatever the US system has become and I am not a nationalist by any stretch (I am not even German). Our system just leads to calmer streets, friendlier faces, less fear and stress overall (except for the tax system, I could really strangle the people who came up with that â€” not for the amount of taxes, but for the complexity of the system).<p>If presented with lies and reality, choose reality and try to correct for your own biases. Thats what good people do.')
