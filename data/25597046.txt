The idea behind these new rules is to create a number of headaches for the Biden administration to deal with before it can get started on its own rulemaking.<p>&quot;The new fee was announced on December 29 without providing any advance notice to the distilleries it impacts.&quot;<p>Federal agencies can&#x27;t do that. New fees and other rules must be announced in advance of when they take effect. If the fee or rule itself is new, it must go through a public commenting period first; otherwise, if the rate is simply being changed, then advance notice is sufficient. A new, retroactive rule&#x2F;fee such as this would have needed to go through both public comment and publication to the FR to be legal.<p>Expect litigation over this, if the distilleries can afford it. (Or possibly from a constitutional rights group, if they can&#x27;t).')
