Apple itself is famous for picking good defaults, I&#x27;m sure they can implement a decent compromise that simply moves the needle a bit more towards consumers. Free browsers and a simple option to allow 3rd party appstores, set to off by default and somewhat bothersome to switch (i.e. buried into iTunes account screens, behind password, possibly with a periodic reminder every few months) would be more than enough. People who want to stay safe in the Appstore garden have nothing to do, and everyone else can go the extra mile if they want to.<p>Anything else, like two iOS versions, is simply a provocation on the level of &quot;we cannot unbundle IE&quot;.')
