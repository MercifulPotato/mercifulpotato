Your stomach will grow, but I would imagine a person would struggle to eat enough carrots to weigh 500 pounds.  Quick napkin math says some obese people eat 6700 calories a day.  50 calories is ~12 baby carrots.  That&#x27;s ~1608 baby carrots per day.  If my math is right, that&#x27;s about 67 one pound bags of baby carrots per day.<p>Carrots are probably an extreme example, but I think the point stands that to get that overweight on healthy food, both the volume of the food and the time required to eat it become astonishing.  I don&#x27;t even know if we can metabolize carrots fast enough to eat that many in a day without rupturing some part of your stomach.<p>&gt; &quot;Normal&quot; cooked meals that were the staple of nutrition before the advent of fast food are almost absent from their diets.<p>I think this is a big part of it.  Calorie dense food has always been around.  The problem was that it was often difficult and&#x2F;or expensive to make.  How long would it take you to replicate a Big Mac combo meal, and how much would it cost?  It takes a while, especially given grocery shopping, and it&#x27;s probably not much cheaper.  Likewise, I can go to the grocery store and buy a whole cheesecake for like $10.<p>Honestly, I think the best way to tackle it is not to outright ban the foods, but just add an excise tax.  If we added a 10% tax to soft drinks, fries and pizza, it probably wouldn&#x27;t make a huge difference to the average citizen&#x27;s spending.   It would be a 10% increase in your food budget if that&#x27;s all you eat though.  If you want to go crazy, add a program that lets you earn that back by doing healthy things, like riding a bike.  We should probably do that anyways.  If we want to reduce the amount of driving people do, paying them walk&#x2F;bike places instead of driving isn&#x27;t a bad system either.')
