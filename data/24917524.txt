Did the workers own the means of production ? Did the NSDAP even remotely move in that direction? No and hell no. The NSDAP worked closely with industrialists ( which helped finance their rise to power), destroyed unions, etc. Having a few national programs ( Volkswahen, the Autobahn, etc.) doesn&#x27;t mean socialism.<p>They were as socialistic as horses are fish. Yeah, they have two eyes, but that&#x27;s about it.')
