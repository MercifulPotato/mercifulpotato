But my comment wasn&#x27;t that pandora had a poor catalog. It was that they wanted to play mainstream songs instead. Perhaps not even mainstream, but just very specific songs. They had a lot of artist&#x27;s whole discographies but only a subset would ever come on. I can still remember a few of them for me:<p>royksopp - this must be it<p>trapt - headstrong<p>ladytron - destroy everything you touch<p>Some sort of remix of the hand that feeds by Nine Inch Nails (I think it was the photek remix or something)<p>I got these songs a lot on many stations, and nothing else by those artists ever, haha.<p>I don&#x27;t hold a grudge from 10 years ago though')
