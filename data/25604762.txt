They also have an existing presence in the US, whereas TSMC is going to be about 5 years out on their US factory. Keeping American workers around to inject ideas into your manufacturing process can be invaluable if you have typically been operating the business like a Borg cube (i.e. relentless standardization throughout, potentially at the cost of more complex value-add proposals).')
