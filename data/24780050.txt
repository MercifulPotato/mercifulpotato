We need to make advances in semi-supervised learning, as well as increasing sample efficiency, and reducing catastrophic forgetting. But my intuition says that the solutions will be pretty simple, and seem obvious in hindsight.<p>But I&#x27;m also guessing we&#x27;ll come up with an endless number of complex tweaks to get the current stuff closer before someone figures out the simple mechanics and sweeps most of that away.')
