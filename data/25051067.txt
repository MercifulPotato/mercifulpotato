It is still interesting that after a year of pandemic, lots of people do not realize this. Second, you are not a medical scientist, are you? 1% of people who got infected suffer from grave consequences. Even if only 1% survivors will have long-term problems with health, this is already burden of 2 000 000 sick people just in United States. Now, SARS-1 (which is closely related to SARS-2) is known to cause serious side effects. This thing is less severe, obviously than SARS-1, but no one really did any large scale follow-up. I get it you hate lockdowns, you want life &quot;as normal&quot;, but at least you need be honest about, not trying to paint everyone as stupid coward simpletons, to justify your inner motivations.')
