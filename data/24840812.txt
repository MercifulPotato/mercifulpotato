We&#x27;ve bought brand new Cisco gear, which for some unholy reason didn&#x27;t support IPv6. We&#x27;ve worked with vendors who told us that they&#x27;ve been supporting IPv6 for years, a decade even, but try to enable it, and you&#x27;ll see that no one actually ever used it, and it doesn&#x27;t work.<p>Amazon could perhaps do with less IPv4 addresses, if people did misuse them. I work with a client who have a public IPv4 address associated with every single EC2 instance they have, despite only 5% of them have public facing services. They just got in the habit of assigning a public IP I guess.')
