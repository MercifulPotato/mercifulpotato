The text is: &quot;When our SEALs took out bin Laden, they brought the terrorists&#x27; families to safety first. That&#x27;s American honor. &quot;   This is false, since several members of the bin Laden family died in the attack, including women and children.  I&#x27;m not saying that killing bin Laden was wrong, just that Twitter policies are wildly inconsistent regarding violence and falsehood.)')
