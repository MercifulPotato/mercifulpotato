For example, Crunchyroll uses ASS format for their own subtitles (things licensed from other studios seems to use a simpler format), and some translators do a really good job very similar to the fansubbers.<p>Case in point, I remember watching &quot;Is the Order a Rabbit S3&quot; in Crunchyroll, the English subtitles are pretty basic but the Portuguese (Brazillian) subtitles are great, including things like Karaoke in opening and ending.')
