You&#x27;re telling the engine to do 2 different things there that just may have the same end-result.<p>The results diverge specifically when your array contains <i>empty</i> items, which will be converted to items <i>containing undefined</i> with the latter expression.<p>The JS engine would need a specific optimization for cases where:<p>- The expression is equivalent to arr.slice(0)<p>- The iterator being de-structured is a vanilla array<p>- The array doesn&#x27;t contain any <i>empty</i> items<p>Of course your code will be faster when all that&#x27;s required is just a shallow copy.')
