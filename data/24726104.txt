Ask them if that would be okay, and if so, can they provide relevant contact info.<p>The reason for asking is that the praise that you want to offer may not be in line with their career goals (e.g. if you&#x27;re praising their management style, decisions, etc but they want to move toward development or support or something). This also gives you an opportunity to communicate the praise directly to them.')
