I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s a bad idea, just that I don&#x27;t want to take responsibility for advising it. I&#x27;m willing to take responsibility for telling 22 year olds to start startups. So what if they fail? They&#x27;ll learn a lot, and that job at Microsoft will still be waiting for them if they need it. But I&#x27;m not prepared to cross moms.<p>&gt; What you can do, if you have a family and want to start a startup, is start a consulting business you can then gradually turn into a product business. Empirically the chances of pulling that off seem very small. You&#x27;re never going to produce Google this way. But at least you&#x27;ll never be without an income.<p>&gt; Another way to decrease the risk is to join an existing startup instead of starting your own. Being one of the first employees of a startup is a lot like being a founder, in both the good ways and the bad. You&#x27;ll be roughly 1&#x2F;n^2 founder, where n is your employee number.<p>&gt; As with the question of cofounders, the real lesson here is to start startups when you&#x27;re young.')
