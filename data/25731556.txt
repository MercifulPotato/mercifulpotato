We used C in 2000 and now we use Go.<p>Less even than that.  C is more used than Go, even today.<p>&gt; We need an actual advance in programming to avoid a future that looks like today except with 10x as much code to understand before you can do anything.<p>The future looks like better, more powerful libraries.  You&#x27;ll have 10x as much code, but you won&#x27;t actually have to <i>know</i> 90% of it.  (Until there&#x27;s a library bug that matters to your program...)')
