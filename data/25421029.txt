I don&#x27;t know why these vocational programs have to be fundamentally different from the vocational programs that exist for other industries. Code schools seem to be extreme, &quot;4-8 hours a day commitment, 5 days a week&quot;, in my experience, which obviously means most students can&#x27;t really have another job.<p>I wish there was a 1-2 hour a night, 2-3 nights a week program that took a year and output a reasonable junior candidate for most software companies. Meaning, not FAANG, not SF, not unicorn startup. A program to take a person with no background and make them capable of being entry level employees for local mid-sized insurance companies or banks.')
