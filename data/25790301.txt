Item(by='tartaglia', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610714819, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25787107, text='&gt; So I can write code inside my spreadsheet, but not inside my browser? WTF.<p>You can, press F12.<p>&gt; Here’s my pitch: build a browser that comes pre-installed with node.js, an IDE and a simple runtime environment.<p>Why? If you’re new to coding then you don’t need an IDE: it adds complexity. You just need a “Run” button like in Excel (right?).<p>Additionally, you probably don’t need Node.js because it is just adding some API to interact with the operating system.<p>If you use said APIs then you need to learn a couple of things about the O.S. - nothing major - like what is a shell, or what mkdir and PATH stands for.<p><i>But, hey, we’re talking about non-coders here right? They don’t need these APIs, they are just getting started. So why should they need Node.js?</i><p>&gt; People hate command lines - not only do they LOOK scary, they give weird unhelpful error messages and… you have to type everything. Ugh. This is why people would rather code inside a spreadsheet application - because it’s an application.<p>I’m all in for the no-code movement, although I’m not the target audience. I agree that you don’t need to know how to code to setup a simple website. You can just use Webflow.<p>I think this article doesn’t make much sense. Every paragraph of the article (especially the outro) suggests that Node.js is not an example, it’s the target of the article. The fact that the OP is proposing to run Node.js on the browser suggests that they doesn’t know what Node is, and why you should use it.<p>Your code will run fine on the browser and on Node as long as you don’t use Node APIs.<p>Once you use such APIs, you’re agreeing to the fact that you know what you’re a doing - you agreed to use Node’s API; if you didn’t want to deal with the OS directly, then should have opted for something like Visual Basic. And if you agree to use such APIs then you know that Node exists so that you can forget about the browser.')
