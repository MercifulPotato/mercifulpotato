First Harry Potter book came out in 1997. Do I think publishers or printing press companies should be allowed to sell Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone without giving Rowling money? No I do not.<p>But I wouldn’t extend that past 50 years. And I might set compulsory licensing of some kind. Particularly for redistribution of existing work. I think some type of gradient between 20 to 50 or 30 to 50 makes sense.<p>I also like the idea of having copyright expire after 10 years but require an increasing annual fee to extend. This would allow abandoned IP to recirculate but still give creators control over their work if it’s worth their time and money. I’d make the fee growth non-linear so that very few things are worth extending beyond 20 or 30 years. It’s a variant of “use it or lose it”.')
