Convenience is king. And stupidity is his queen. When I sell products I want full control of my CX, just as Apple. Creating, maintaining and optimising CX is not for everyone. It requires new mindset, new priorities, new expenses and mind geared towards product for customers, feedback, support etc. If your dream software is egoistic projection with profit only goal you will be better with App Store bonanza. If by any chance you want to Serve people and have valuable product the idea of using App Store is absurd. In App Store you have no control over UX. It is what Apple is decided to be. You have no direct customer feedback or connection. Apple owns this channel. In summary: You are working not for you and your customers. You are working for Apple and paying for the &quot;privilege&quot;.')
