Item(by='y-c-o-m-b', descendants=None, kids=[25585992, 25585916], score=None, time=1609360884, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25585539, text='&gt; Is it too much to ask for a government that both governs and is actually competent?<p>Evidently yes. They can barely govern let alone manage technical infrastructure. Just look at the abysmal vaccine roll-out. 9 months to plan for it; that&#x27;s an eternity in the software development world where we&#x27;re constantly faced with logical and logistical issues on the daily. We can have millions of people streaming gigabytes of data all at once, millions of people submitting their tax returns, millions of packages being delivered every hour and yet we couldn&#x27;t pull this off in 9 freakin months? I don&#x27;t buy any of their excuses. It&#x27;s just sheer incompetence and it makes me so mad.<p>That&#x27;s not to say they don&#x27;t have challenges. Outdated systems, obsolete programs, hell even outdated employees; I know so many rejects that end up managing government systems because they couldn&#x27;t cut it in corporate. One of them is a good friend of mine. He got let go when he tried to replace a modern web-app with a WinForms app. He&#x27;s actually a very good person and intelligent, but a horrible dev and I&#x27;ve no idea how he ever got into software development, but the government gig he has loves him.<p>EDIT: here&#x27;s another user post in this thread that somewhat echoes my last paragraph: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25586066" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25586066</a>')
