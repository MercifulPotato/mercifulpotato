Three phases can easily be connected to create a rotating magnetic field. We don&#x27;t just use one phase at a time on the grid. All three are active. Phases A and B and C are all 120 degrees out of phase with each other. (That has nothing to do with the 120volts you know of in your house- it just happens to be another 120 number)<p>AC has inductive properties. I.e. it can induce electrical currents in wires across a core. (Transformer) DC cannot do this. Before vacuum tubes and other tech AC was one of the few technologies that could be easily stepped up to hundreds of thousands of volts.<p>Voltage and current have an inverse relationship. So we can step up voltage and reduce the size of the conductor $$$$ other feature is reduced line losses (HVDC actually beats us here but this is another discussion)<p>Having AC power allows all kinds of cool things! Did you know that your common household 120v feed is simply a single phase being split into two 120v &#x27;legs&#x27;. Both 120 degrees out of phase. So if you remember elementary school math the abs() of phase A at its peak of +120 and phase B at it&#x27;s valley of -120 = 240.<p>It gets better! We can be cheap on wire with AC systems! I can wire a &#x27;multiwire branch circuit&#x27;. With phases a and b that share a neutral. If the current on phase a is 20 amps and the current on phase B is 20 amps what is the return current on my neutral? ( Google Mike Holt Multiwire Branch, Enjoy )<p>Want more fun. Read about Neutral Earth Voltage and NFPA 70 requirements for agriculture and equipotential planes. :-)<p>AC is freaking magical. The grid is even more awesome!')
