Some of the people &quot;won&quot; in recent decades. They typically live in city, having higher income, enjoying good life and the new technologies. And they have the view points that the others have never had.<p>Let&#x27;s say, people in cities are more willing to use EV car. People in small city &#x2F; rural area are less motivated because of weaker infrastructure. This is unfair to ask the people in small city to make this change if they are not provided enough help :-&#x2F;<p>I am afraid people in two sides are getting more divided and more extreme. Don&#x27;t forget based on the vote count, it is still a 50:50 but not 90:10 fight.')
