If you want to be pedantic and argue they should use &quot;more&quot; suit yourself. But things are not black and white, your comment is in itself &quot;manipulating&quot; the reader trying to convince them that ads are all the same and that they cannot be put on an ehtical spectrum which is not true: tracking ads vs billboard, I&#x27;d much rather a billboard (which I hate in and on itself as they are usually just making the place they are in uglier).')
