I wish Wyze well in its quest to sell a lot of their smart watches, and they probably will.<p>That being said, what I&#x27;d really like (if someone out there is listening) is a smart watch which is not only cheap (&lt;$20), but it would also have microHDMI and microUSB ports, and basically you could take it off your wrist and hook it up to an external monitor, keyboard and mouse, and use it like a very underpowered Raspberry Pi...<p>Yes, it would be slow compared to other computers...<p>Yes, it would be limited in many respects compared to other computers...<p>But dagnabbit if it wouldn&#x27;t be cool to have, if you couldn&#x27;t just take it off and use it like a general-purpose stand-alone computer!<p>To me, that&#x27;s the killer feature that any smart watch must have...<p>Oh yeah, and Open Source everything, too...<p>And yes, I realize that I ask for a lot! &lt;g&gt;')
