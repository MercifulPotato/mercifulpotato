By default macOS was always using this encryption scheme, but there was always possibility to have an optional FDE. Now this is broken and I can&#x27;t even manage to get macOS installed when any encrypted partition is present since it&#x27;s also cause installer to fail.<p>I obviously find it being absolutely terrible &quot;design&quot; decision since there no way on earth anyone can count disk encryption key that is unlockable by user password or faceid secure.<p>PS: If someone have any idea how having separate boot password can be hacked aroud I&#x27;ll really appreciate the advice.')
