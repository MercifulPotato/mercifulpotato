Trying to bend Rails into non-AR database usage is going to lead to tears sooner rather than later IMO. It&#x27;s just so very integrated.<p>Having separate applications with (write) access to the same database is similarly going to end in trouble. Suddenly there are all sorts of problems when the database needs a migration and the applications are expecting different things from the same table. This is not really ORM-related btw.<p>That said, ActiveRecord is not perfect and sometimes a single handcoded SQL query can deliver a ton of value. Profile carefully.')
