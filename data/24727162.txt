I&#x27;m old enough to remember when they had 20 different kinds of desktop computers, updated every year. They now have 1 desktop, updated every few years, one laptop, updated every few years.<p>There is a sense they&#x27;ve given up on everything but the iPhone. Arguably, Apple keeps producing Mac computers only because iPhone devs need to run XCode somewhere.<p>The iPhone was introduced in 2007. It was very innovative at the time, though now it has dozens of Android clones. Total sales of iPhones seems to have peaked -- increases in Apple&#x27;s profits have come from raising prices and managing margins.<p>This last bit would be the heart of the case that Apple is now increasingly financial in nature and therefore parasitic. They don&#x27;t seem to be rolling out much in the way of new products, and certainly nothing as &quot;change the world&quot; as the iPhone was in 2007.<p>I think it is well known that Apple does not have the &quot;division per product group&quot; structure that almost all other large companies have. But Apple has an unusually narrow range of products for such a large company.<p>Even projects that Apple seemed excited about 6 or 7 years ago, such as home entertainment, no longer seems to be priority for them. I can tell you from personal experience, their Apple TV has been absolutely stagnant for years, and many of the problems, which I assumed they would eventually fix, have not been fixed.')
