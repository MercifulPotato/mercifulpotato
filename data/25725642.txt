You guys want to march around and yell in the streets, I actually don&#x27;t have a problem with it. I find it annoying, but as long as you&#x27;re not killing anyone, I don&#x27;t care. However, you want to go into congress and subvert the Constitutional order? Yeah, that&#x27;s a whole different issue.<p>I&#x27;m sorry if the conservatives can&#x27;t understand the difference between BLM people yelling in the streets, and Trump people searching the capitol for senators and representatives to stop a Constitutionally mandated vote count. (Actually that was a lie, I&#x27;m not sorry. I don&#x27;t give a mosquito&#x27;s dick about either of you. I was just trying to be nice.) I&#x27;m done trying to explain the difference to these people, and I think these terrorists have pushed a lot of people off the fence with me. People are fed up. You don&#x27;t understand the difference? You think too much of it&#x27;s unjustified? Too bad. This is the way it&#x27;s gotta be. We&#x27;re not going to live in anarchy because conservatives and liberals want to play out crips and bloods on our republic.<p>End rant.<p>Edit: Man I&#x27;m getting old. That reads like I just told some kids to get off my lawn. But that&#x27;s how I feel.')
