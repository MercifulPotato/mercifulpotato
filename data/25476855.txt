No need for a compilation step or an interpreter. No need to trust the (likely complex) webassembly runtime to be bug free.<p>Edit: most responses are being made under the assumption that seccomp is the same as seccomp-bpf. The two are different and designed for different use cases. For example it is not possible to run a wasm JIT entirely under seccomp but is possible under seccomp-bpf. Seccomp was specifically designed for the use case described in this article by Shopify.
