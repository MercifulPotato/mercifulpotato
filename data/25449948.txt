Then the architecture emulation (translation?) would be done by Rosetta (potentially faster), as opposed to software emulation by qemu.<p>Now, this might not work, as I&#x27;m not sure Rosetta covers all of the x86 instructions&#x2F;settings that qemu would need, so you might be stuck with ARM64 qemu emulating x86 anyway.')
