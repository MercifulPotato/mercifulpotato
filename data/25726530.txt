Second, I may be a minority here, but I actually don&#x27;t mind this feature missing at all. I however do (or did) mind Windows putting its &quot;thumbs.db&quot; files all over the place, so that&#x27;s the first thing I deactivate when installing it (along with enabling &quot;show hidden files&quot; and &quot;show extension for known file types&quot;).')
