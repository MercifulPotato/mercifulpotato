Suffice it to say that the reality was...significantly poorer than advertised. Not only because of the much-discussed reasons which are true, but most importantly for me because they lied about having hiring partners in Europe when they didn&#x27;t, and left the students to fend for themselves after graduating. Most of the students saw this happen with earlier cohorts and there was a steady trickle of dropouts while I was there. To top it off, around October last year, LS suddenly announced that they would be &quot;pausing&quot; the EU programs indefinitely to &quot;focus on improving the student experience&quot; which seriously drained student morale. I&#x27;m pretty sure no more than 35% of students who enrolled to Lambda EU have jobs currently and since they&#x27;re not as loud as the Americans, their plight isn&#x27;t really highlighted. Most of the students who managed to get hired either did it on their own, or were previously experienced and came to Lambda to improve their prospects. I managed to get a job through my own means, but would unequivocally consider enrolling to LS a mistake, and it&#x27;s telling that they&#x27;ve not bothered to follow up with me for ISA payments.<p>Addendum:\nThis was the kind of delusional fever dream perpetuated by Austen that kind of attracted me to LS last year:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.coursereport.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;lambda-schools-europe-income-share-agreement" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.coursereport.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;lambda-schools-europe-inco...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;timesofindia.indiatimes.com&#x2F;people&#x2F;after-us-india-will-be-our-second-largest-market-by-year-end-austen-allred&#x2F;articleshow&#x2F;68974149.cms" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;timesofindia.indiatimes.com&#x2F;people&#x2F;after-us-india-wi...</a>')
