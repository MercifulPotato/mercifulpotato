The huge issue of the next decade. Its the only thing I agree with Trumps manifesto about. But on all these fronts, trump has at best achieved nothing and at worse looked weak, weakened the Web of alliances that made China hesitate and make the US look weak and ineffective.<p>He rolled over on trade, the deficit jobs and ip in his failed little &quot;trade war&quot;. He rolled over when he supported Xi over protestors. He&#x27;s been too busy making hay and fucking up to properly question why zoonotic viruses keep coming out of China so he&#x27;s rolled over on that too.<p>Failing to ban tiktok is yet another example of how poorly he&#x27;s done.<p>Seriously, reasonable people on all sides agree that China is an issue. No one can say trump has made any progress on China.')
