Kind of amazing how the big cloud providers still haven&#x27;t solved this problem.<p>Heroku still has one of the easiest setups of anyone on the market, and they&#x27;ve just been coasting in recent years. Poor container support, auto-scaling is naive, random routing (see rap genius), no health checks, pricey, etc.<p>Previously Deis built a Heroku like service on top of Kubernetes, but they got acquired by Microsoft, and the product has since atrophied.<p>Convox[0] seems similar to Qovery, with the added ability of self-hosting (UI is closed source though).<p>I think Qovery not having a UI is a deal breaking for many. Heroku&#x27;s CLI, UI, and API is a killer combo.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;convox.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;convox.com</a>')
