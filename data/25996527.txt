In other words, the reaction resultants are not just CO2 and H2O, but CH4 as well. Since CH4 is a very potent greenhouse gas (the EPA says it&#x27;s 25 times more potent than CO2), this makes a difference.<p>Anyway, here&#x27;s the numbers: the mass of the propellant is about 500 tons, and the mass of the equivalent CO2 emissions is about 650 tons per flight.<p>For comparison, the humankind puts about 30 billion tons of CO2 in the air every year. A Boeing 777 flight puts about 500 tons on a long haul trip.')
