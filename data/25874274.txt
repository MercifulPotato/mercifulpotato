There&#x27;s 7.2 amp charging at the grocery store that I go to so I can top-up there while shopping. There&#x27;s also charging stations in a bunch of the public parking places around town.  It wouldn&#x27;t be carefree to go all-electric, but it also doesn&#x27;t seem like it would be too much of an imposition on my life.<p>Likewise, high-speed charging from Tesla Superchargers, Electrify America, and certainly others by 2030 can give an 80% charge in around half an hour.  Again, it certainly isn&#x27;t perfect, but it feels like I could work with it.<p>However, the big thing is that we&#x27;re going to need to see a change in our cities that will kinda render a lot of this moot.  Street parking, parking in general, and car ownership&#x2F;use in cities is going to have to decline.  Our cities are drowning under parking infrastructure. Everyone is afraid of new housing because new housing brings competition for parking spaces and increased traffic.  If we&#x27;re going to actually make cities a sustainable place to live, it&#x27;s going to need to mean a lot fewer cars.<p>Housing prices in cities like Seattle, the Bay Area, Los Angeles, NYC, Boston, and DC are already sky-high.  I know that a lot of techies can afford to live there, but raising a family becomes expensive when 1,200 square feet starts above a million.  If we add new housing, we realistically can&#x27;t add a lot of new parking to accommodate an influx of people with cars. Even if we mandate parking minimums for new housing (which is bad), that still means less parking available per car at everywhere you&#x27;re driving to; it still means increased traffic that the roads can&#x27;t accommodate (and there isn&#x27;t space to just expand the roads).<p>Plus, as cities try to reduce traffic deaths and accommodate more road users, even fewer cars can be accommodated.  A lot of cities are reducing the speed limit to 25 MPH, introducing protected bike lanes, adding traffic calming devices, removing parking spaces that would block drivers from seeing pedestrians, etc. Cities are taking back some car infrastructure and returning it to use for people. Likewise, businesses that are now sitting on incredibly valuable land that is being under-used as parking are likely going to pressure local governments to let them turn those parking lots into better uses of that land.<p>I remember the white-flight and the jobs that followed out into the suburbs. For those that remained in a city, they might have to commute out of the city to Redmond for their job and so parking was essential.  Today, Amazon and others are setting up shop in Seattle.<p>For hiking, maybe it&#x27;s reasonable to just rent a car for the day&#x2F;weekend. I know that makes it seems like you&#x27;re having to pay for the trip, but you were always having to pay.  Cars will generally be $500&#x2F;mo all-in on the cheap side of things, never mind an Audi or Volvo.<p>Ultimately, dealing with global warming and other challenges will require a certain amount of change in the way we set things up and live our lives. I think this is the reality that people often don&#x27;t want to acknowledge - that what currently exists can&#x27;t really continue existing for the kind of world we want and need to be.  Electric cars lower emissions a good bit, but there&#x27;s still a lot of emissions in manufacturing, a lot of particulate matter from tires and brakes, a lot of emissions from road-building and repair, a huge amount of emissions from concrete for parking garages, a large death toll from traffic fatalities, emissions from the fact that many trees that won&#x27;t exist to accommodate car infrastructure, emissions from air conditioning as more car infrastructure means making cities greater heat islands...  Plus, how do we accommodate the growth of our cities?<p>I think the answer to your question is that we&#x27;re likely going to have to make changes to our cities and how we live in them rather than figuring out how street-parkers go full EV.')
