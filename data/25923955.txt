Zagg sells a hinged laptop-style keyboard case for 7 inch tablets. I paired mine with an Amazon Fire. It&#x27;s a little on the thick side, but still tiny. The Fire is too slow for daily stuff, but it does ok with Termux. The Brave Android browser has full keyboard shortcuts and works decently too. Since I found both the Fire and the keyboard were on sale at the time, I managed to create this 7 inch laptop for around $50.<p>I&#x27;m not sure how useful this thing is, but it&#x27;s kinda fun and easy way to try out the form factor. Would be better if I could find a Windows &#x2F; Linux tablet in that size, but I haven&#x27;t yet.')
