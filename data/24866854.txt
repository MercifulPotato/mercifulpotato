They sent me to a cemetary next to a busy area once when I was on the hwy going home and then cancelled the ride once I got to the cemetery. Then they messaged me and said as long as I was in a busy area, why didn&#x27;t I wait? The thing that pissed me off was the algorithm actually directed me to drive into a cemetary on a dark night, as if someone was there waiting for me. Of course I didn&#x27;t go in the cemetery. Another time Lyft indicated there was a busy bonus area a couple miles from the airport. I went there and waited and then noticed other drivers waiting. It wasn&#x27;t a busy area. What Lyft was doing was parking us there because the airport waiting lot was full. Lyft also has several times cancelled trips right when I got there so I don&#x27;t get paid. Uber doesn&#x27;t play tricks like this. However, people who take Lyft are usually nicer people. Does it seem like a shill would say stuff like this? If you think so, then I can&#x27;t help you.')
