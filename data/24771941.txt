Vitamin D accumulates over time and the half-life is measured in weeks. You may not be overdosing right away, but you can slowly end up in an overdose condition after months or years. It can take weeks or months to reverse.<p>High dose Vitamin D is only helpful for short-term use to bring levels up into the desired range. After that, you need to switch to a more reasonable maintenance dose like 2000-3000IU.<p>Even the most vocal pro-Vitamin D advocates aren’t taking as much as you are.<p>Your hypothyroidism isn’t an excuse to take more. You need to adjust the thyroid issues through thyroid medication, not attempt to micromanage downstream vitamin issues with overdoses.<p>If you still don’t believe me, please just get a blood test every 6-12 months for Vitamin D and calcium levels. The long-term effects of chronic overdose could be worse than whatever symptoms you were trying to address in the first place.')
