But if that is part of an application, you will not be able to properly test it - so you either have to do time consuming manual tests or time consuming integration tests. Splitting it into different parts allows to write unit tests and smaller integration tests. Then, when you only change the &quot;pure&quot; parts, you only have to verify the unit tests. That gives a HUGE productivity boost in bigger applications.')
