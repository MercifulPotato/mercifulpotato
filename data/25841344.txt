I’m not super knowledgeable but AMD just caught up after years of Intel stumbling to get to 10nm. Intel’s 14nm chips are still very competitive with AMD, so it seems that Intel on 5nm should beat AMD on 5nm, for example.<p>Intel will either solve its process issues in its own factories or, worst case, they outsource production to TSMC - either of which eliminates any process&#x2F;manufacturing advantage held by AMD and Apple.<p>On a 5-10 year timeline, I don’t see a reason for Intel to continue stumbling on 5nm and 3nm processes though.')
