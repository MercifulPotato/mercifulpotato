It has definitely helped, but after a few weeks I now feel habituated (is that the right word?). Unless something is on fire or past deadline I&#x27;m back to getting no work done. I do notice positive effects when combined with (too much) caffeine, but ideally I want to quit soft drinks (and I don&#x27;t like coffee).<p>I think I will ask my gp to switch to extended release. I hope he&#x27;s willing to help me find something that works best for me.<p>As a sidenote, I do with people could be clearer when describing their medication. Just say the active ingredient, dosage, and frequency. Brand names can differ in different countries.<p>For reference:<p>- Ritalin, Concerta = Methylphenidate<p>- Adderall = Amphetamine<p>- Dexedrine = Dextroamphetamine<p>- Vyvanse = Lisdexamfetamine')
