Macro and micro lenses almost disappeared from catalogues about the time when autofocus was introduced. Minolta sold the only 1-3 times magnification autofocus lens and I&#x27;ve never seen one. Only last month, Sony started selling the adapter that can enable Sony Alpha cameras to attach and correctly use old A mount lenses.<p>It&#x27;s not quickly easy to find information about photomicography, but in case it&#x27;s missed the Small World website links to this very good resource:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.microscopyu.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.microscopyu.com&#x2F;</a>')
