But language matters and my suspicion is that referring to “Europe” as something else (meaning continental Europe, the rest of Europe etc) for decades has contributed to the feeling among britons of not actually being fundamentally European in the same way e.g the French or Swedish do. You wouldn’t hear anyone else in the EU “go to Europe” or conflate the EU or Europe. And we make a point of not doing it.')
