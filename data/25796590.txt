Your mix is never going to sound as crisp as it does in the studio (ideal listening conditions). Road noise + reverb off the glass + cheap speakers = not as good a listening environment. It&#x27;s best to build familiarity of other commercial productions on your ideal setup (monitors&#x2F;headphones&#x2F;etc.) for referencing purposes earlier in the process, in my opinion. Good to reference on more &#x27;everyday&#x27; listening systems, too (personal favorite, the iPhone speaker).')
