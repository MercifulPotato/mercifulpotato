Memes had a bigger impact then: there were fewer of them, they were more unexpected (because they were newer), and in fact the word meme either did not exist or, if it did, it was certainly not in widespread use.<p>Anyway:<p>“ On June 1, 2006, YouTube was taken down temporarily for maintenance. The phrase &quot;ALL YOUR VIDEO ARE BELONG TO US&quot; appeared below the YouTube logo as a placeholder while the site was down. Some users believed the site had been hacked, leading YouTube to add the message ‘  &quot;No, we haven&#x27;t be [sic] hacked. Get a sense of humor.”’<p>I can’t imagine YouTube doing anything like that today for a meme?')
