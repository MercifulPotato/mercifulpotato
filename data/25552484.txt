As does the constant push by urban Canadians to disarm rural folks (like me) who legally own firearms.<p>It&#x27;s ultimately your choice, but I&#x27;ve watched a lot of video on documented home invasions, and a few things are clear:\na) Anyone willing to invade your home while armed will have no compunction about seriously injuring or killing any of the occupants;\nb) The defensive use of a firearm, while largely not reported, is an amazing deterrent in probable 95% of attempted home invasions where the homeowner has a firearm. Most intruders will nope out as soon as they see a gun, no shots necessary.\nc) It happens in Canada far more often than you think, including in cities. Here&#x27;s a recent case: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;torontosun.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;crime&#x2F;violent-home-invasion-may-be-connected-to-shooting-in-may-police" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;torontosun.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;crime&#x2F;violent-home-invasion-may-...</a>. Even if this case is gang-related, what are the odds that these people make mistakes and enter the wrong home&#x2F;apartmnet?\nd) In rural areas, police are not getting there in any reasonable timeframe. It would take police probably 30 minutes to get to my house.<p>Ultimately, my view is that the right to self-defence is meaningless unless you have the means with which to actually defend yourself. I have no problem with people who are uncomfortable owning firearms and choose not to, but it&#x27;s very problematic when those people force their views on others.<p>It&#x27;s not legal in Canada to own firearms strictly for the purpose of self-defence (because our gun laws are quite silly once you become familiar with them), but most rural folks hunt or sport shoot so it&#x27;s a moot point.<p>Oh, and by the way - meta-studies on the topic indicate that restricting access to firearms doesn&#x27;t actually prevent suicides, it just causes people to shift methods to hanging, overdose, etc.')
