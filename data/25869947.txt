Then I looked more closely and realized the trees _were_ monarchs. Those weren&#x27;t leaves - every single branch, surface, etc. was absolutely covered with tens, maybe hundreds of thousands of butterflies. They were much bigger than I expected too.<p>It was an awe-inspiring experience and if we ever get our act together and they&#x27;re back, I encourage you to see them.')
