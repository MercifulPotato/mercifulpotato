That&#x27;s exactly what we used to have.  There have been nutjob conspiracy theories throughout history, but what we used to have is <i>expert consensus</i> that told it was wrong.  Somewhere along the line the experts (largely, but not exclusively, picked by the media) got neutered by the social media bubbles.<p>Again, there isn&#x27;t any actual censorship happening.  If you&#x27;re a conservative you can say whatever you want about any conservative policy you want on any platform you want.  The only people having trouble right now are the ones who want to talk about violent overthrow of the government.')
