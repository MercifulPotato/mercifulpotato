Take multiple inputs, do some processing onboard, send it down a single USB cable to the computer. It will take anywhere from 1 to 4&#x2F;8&#x2F;16 XLR&#x2F;line&#x2F;instrument inputs, with headphone out and monitoring of inputs. Here&#x27;s what I use:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;motu.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;products&#x2F;m-series&#x2F;m2&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;motu.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;products&#x2F;m-series&#x2F;m2&#x2F;</a><p>It&#x27;s overkill for online meetings, in that many of its features will go unused. It&#x27;s a well-built box, though, with better build quality than the (cheaper) Presonus it replaced. If there&#x27;s just one mic or input, and some headphone output, then something like this would be less expensive (and less to fiddle with):<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sweetwater.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;detail&#x2F;UM2usb--behringer-u-phoria-um2-usb-audio-interface" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sweetwater.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;detail&#x2F;UM2usb--behringer-u-...</a><p>That&#x27;s the first single input, inexpensive audio interface I found on Sweetwater; just an example, not a recommendation.<p>Add to that a cheeeeaaap dynamic mic:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sweetwater.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;detail&#x2F;XM8500--behringer-xm8500-handheld-dynamic-vocal-microphone" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sweetwater.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;detail&#x2F;XM8500--behringer-xm...</a><p>Now, for under $100 (surely you have some wired headphone lying around) you&#x27;ll sound better than 95% of everyone else in online meetings. That&#x27;s why I have no recommendation or ones to avoid, because for <i>online meetings</i> all it has to do is what it says on the tin to be better than what you&#x27;ve got now, and &quot;good enough&quot; for online meetings. If you&#x27;re into music, then we can talk about which one is better over another (and frankly, I&#x27;m not the one to ask).')
