Simply stated: Council, Commission and Parliament have to work together, or nothing moves. Each element can block the others. This means that each element has an incentive to actually work with the others and give them what <i>they</i> want, to have any hope of &quot;bringing home&quot; something of what it wants.<p>If MEPs want something badly enough, they will get it, because otherwise they&#x27;ll start sabotaging stuff Council (i.e. national governments) and Commission (the bureaucratic machine) care about, by wielding their veto powers and their electoral mandate.<p>Votes like this might not have an effect today, but they are part of a conversation that The Powers That Be (the Council) have to participate in. It states a political will that has to be somehow accomodated into the agenda, and it grants political cover for the Commission to put forward actual directives that the Council are not particularly interested in. It&#x27;s basically like getting second base.')
