I didn&#x27;t pay too much attention to pricing of things when I was there (bit of a working holiday), but those numbers help put things in perspective.  I&#x27;ve seen some areas in the US with similar speeds like that for business cases be ~$100&#x2F;month - still more than your .ro pricing, but I think most places that can get those speeds will still have somewhat higher pricing.<p>Home - most folks I know don&#x27;t have those sorts of home speeds, nor have access to those speeds in their areas.  Often people bundle internet&#x2F;tv&#x2F;phones&#x2F;etc, so they may get a &#x27;better&#x27; price thinking about individual components, but... $9 is pretty darn good.  My home prices have gone down a bit over the years as speeds have gone up a bit, but I&#x27;m still tied to whatever&#x27;s offered in this geography.')
