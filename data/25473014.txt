A developer might use Electron because it&#x27;s &quot;fast enough&quot; and halves your development time, and &quot;fast enough&quot; is always a perceptual metric, and not a technical one.<p>Faster hardware means even less optimization is needed before something is shippable -- great for developers! -- and a recipe for software continuing to feel just as slow as before, because we only optimize until it&#x27;s &quot;fast enough&quot;.<p>And despite the M1, or any of the advances of the last decade, the perceptual line that is &quot;fast enough&quot; hasn&#x27;t changed.<p>EDIT: Yes of course Knuth was talking about optimizing noncritical paths, but the sprit he’s espousing lives on in system design: use electron, or something else that makes your product more maintainable and easier to understand (because you didn’t build your own bespoke cross-platform app scaffold, and electron is well-documented, etc.), until you’re sure you can’t anymore. Well, the bar for “can’t” is raised every time there’s more cpu to support rapid, maintainable, “nonoptimal” development, and here we are.')
