(The blasts would be incredibly short, and it seems like it would be hard to distinguish between severely attenuated reflections vs noise from other sources.)<p>Re: a mesh in the windows, given that we can’t even shield microwaves, I’m seriously doubting such a weak faraday mesh would be effective.
