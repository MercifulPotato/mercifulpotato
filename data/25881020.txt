It just doesn&#x27;t seem like it could possibly scale to the number of transactions which have to be made globally every second.  That&#x27;s not to say there aren&#x27;t technical solutions to some of these problems, but currently it seems like even if less than 1% of the population tried to start using bitcoin as their only currency, the system would collapse under its own weight.<p>I actually think it might be interesting for something like voting.  Here having a completely public, verifiable record would add a lot to what is currently a very opaque system in a lot of places.')
