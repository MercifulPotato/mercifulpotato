However, I think we are prone to hysteria about certain covid symptoms - I and my extended family have all had covid and we can all still smell. A small sample of 10ish people from thanksgiving thru now but these sorts of click bait articles leave many believing covid is commonly very severe (no, even people in their 50s have mild cold symptoms in general) and had a bunch if terrible after effects. I&#x27;m mid thirties, over weight and eat ramen noodles for lunch and dinner - I got over covid in a day or two of fever.')
