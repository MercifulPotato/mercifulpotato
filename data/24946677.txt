These people may have complained anyway, and if they were close with the higher-ups then Howard wouldn&#x27;t have had anything to point to and say &quot;Hey! That doesn&#x27;t fit this!&quot; Visibility on HN surely helps, but still, even if this had reach HN without a CoC the issue would have been easier to dismiss. This is the clarity that explicitly stating your aims offers.')
