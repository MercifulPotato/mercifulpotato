There is of course a very simple reason why philosophy plays almost no role any longer, which was rightly pointed out by Stephen Hawking in 2010. Philosophers lack the mathematical training and maturity to follow what is going on in modern science. At Einstein&#x27;s time this was not yet the case, at least Special Relativity was relatively easy to follow for philosophers (even though, to be fair, none of them managed to contribute anything of substance to it or anything of substance to early Quantum Mechanics).<p>It lasted up until the 1950s or so, and then philosophers started to fall behind. There has also be a substantial decline in math education for philosophers. Both Russell and Quine contributed directly to the foundations of mathematics, for instance. Even Kripke made substantial contributions to modal logic and semantic paradoxes. Nowadays you&#x27;ll have to look very hard to even find a substantial contribution of a philosopher in logic, even though that&#x27;s historically the mathematical discipline they know best.<p>As for the philosophical ideas without backing them up. People always grab some philosopher who had an idea and point out the &quot;early roots&quot;, but they conveniently neglect the fact that simultaneously hundreds of other philosophers had patently absurd ideas as well. Even within philosophy there is a huge business based entirely on selection bias. People quote Aristotle as authoritative source, but of course only ever those parts of his work that remotely make sense. Democrit&#x27;s theory of atoms is another typical example. It barely made sense at his time, and only so in opposition to other nonsense invented by &quot;nature&quot; philosophers then, yet he&#x27;s misquoted as the inventor of the modern atom theory in every second slide show about chemistry.')
