This is for all those that have had enough of tech recruiters not understanding them or fancy websites claiming they have found the way to do recruitment right.<p>We have a simple claim: that there&#x27;s a growing number of engineers that have ridiculous skills and that they&#x27;re not getting the attention and the jobs they deserve, and that we can mitigate the problem, well maybe I should say I since it&#x27;s only me.<p>You can check out the website here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hiremeyoucowards.com&#x2F; and if you feel you are one of these engineers please fill the candidates form so that we can interview you. If you have feedback, insults, etc. happy to read them here :)')
