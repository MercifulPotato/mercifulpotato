Wild price fluctuations are a consequence of incomplete adoption, relative to the quote currency. Higher adoption leads to less fluctuation as the demand is more constant from day to day.<p>If we judged the stability of a currency by its supply stability, then Bitcoin would be the most stable currency ever to exist. But for now, it must compete with sovereign fiat currencies and everything is priced in those currencies, so it will appear extremely unstable and perhaps unusable for most transactions.')
