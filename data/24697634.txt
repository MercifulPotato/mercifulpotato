Sure I dabbled with Debian and Gentoo when I first go into CS, and I&#x27;ve had a few runs trying to use Fedora and Ubuntu as my main systems, but when I eventually landed a job in a Microsoft rich environment and got bored with having to screw with settings I settled on windows and OS&#x2F;X on my laptop. OS&#x2F;X even became Windows for about a year when WSL came about and I happened to get a surface pro.<p>But these days I really can&#x27;t fathom using Windows for anything but video games, and well, work because I have to. It&#x27;s such a terrible user experience for me, and I wonder where it all went wrong, because I used to genuinely like it.')
