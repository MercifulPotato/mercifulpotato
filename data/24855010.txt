Apparently CA consumes about 7% of the electricity in the US, at 259.9 TWh, therefore averaging a consumption of only 29.65 gigawatts; the capacity is actually 75.9 GW [1]. An energy.gov site [2] says a typical large geothermal plant only costs $2.5 to build per watt of capacity! Compared to a lot of huge-ticket federal and even statewide budget items such as the $686 billion military budget, eliminating off-peak non-industrial natural gas energy production with socialized electricity seems doable.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eia.gov&#x2F;electricity&#x2F;state&#x2F;california&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eia.gov&#x2F;electricity&#x2F;state&#x2F;california&#x2F;</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.energy.gov&#x2F;eere&#x2F;geothermal&#x2F;geothermal-faqs#:~:text=The%20initial%20cost%20for%20the,%240.01%20to%20%240.03%20per%20kWh" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.energy.gov&#x2F;eere&#x2F;geothermal&#x2F;geothermal-faqs#:~:te...</a>.')
