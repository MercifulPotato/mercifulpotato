It is the only 4-substituted indole in all of organic nature. Let this rattle around in your mind for a moment. It is the only 4-substituted indole known to exist on earth. It happens to be this psychedelic substance that occurs in about eighty species of fungi, most of which are native to the New World. Psilocybin has a unique chemical signature that says, “I am artificial; I come from outside.”\n</code></pre>\nHowever, this isn&#x27;t the most bizarre thing, the <i>crazy feature of psilocybe is that you can have communications with it, you can tell it to be MDMA or any drug and it will produce effects very similar</i>.<p>I&#x27;ve definitely tested out the latter statement as first discussed by TM and its a technique that I find has by far the most anti-depressant effect that still lingers.<p>Many people freak out because they try to figure out what Psilocybin mushroom is and then all sorts of craziness is shown to you that can produce panic in beginners.<p>Some people try it once, get freaked out by its deep introspective qualities that addresses the holes in our spirits.<p>In fact one of the scariest experience was the second time I tried it where I experienced <i>ego death</i> for the first time. It <i>literally feels like you are dying</i> but funny enough it is because our body-mind complex is so fixated and attached to our ego, a mere illusion that is created by this...reality.<p>Perhaps the most fundamental change in value systems that occurs during psilocybin creating a feeling of oneness and zen like state that reveals love is the only truth, everything else is falsehood and deception.<p>It&#x27;s no wonder that it poses a threat to hierarchial, dominant culture of centralized power by a small group.<p>Psilocybe is not only the red pill that wakes you from the hypnosis of our modern reality shaped by the petrodollar economy that is destroying the planet, and as such, it is deemed illegal, taboo.<p>One of the most frightening realization was that not the experiences that come out of consuming the psilocybin mushroom but the very reality that we live in and choose to ignore while focusing on only what we want to see because its too painful to admit what has happened in our modern world-an all out war against everything human: our bodies, our thoughts, our expressions.<p>If we are to change this planet and our course of direction we <i>must</i> continue in our discovery of the past because it holds the key to our salvation.<p>If only 1% of the population can cause a shift in consciousness it will have butterfly impact on the rest. We simply do not judge or hold contempt for the close minded, instead continue educating, continue the discussion, so that we can wake from the slumber, our constant desire for novelty and meaningless consumption.<p>Psilocybin works because it is a device which causes truths to emerge from the swamps of lies and deceptions pulled over our heads. Barring sensory deprived meditation states like the Yogis of tibet that naturally produces DMT, the descendants of the Stoned Apes are once again rediscovering the very thing that has led to their dominance on this planet.<p>Perhaps this is what TM was talking about the great &quot;transcendental attractor object&quot;, we are perhaps on the edge of massive transformation of not only the human psyche through spiritualism but physicists will reveal part of the nature of the universe that will add more and more backing towards this &quot;New Age&quot; era.')
