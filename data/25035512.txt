At what point does it not make sense for the end-user to sponsor a FOSS project in order to bring it up to feature parity with a proprietary equivalent if it costs more to pay for the feature than just buying the proprietary version?<p>To use a real-world example, I used to use a program called Tag&amp;Rename for managing my mp3 metadata for years.[0] It had a method of scraping Amazon for album info, which I loved. When I switched to Linux, I switched over to EasyTag[1], which is a fine program, although I still find T&amp;R still easier to use, and I miss the Amazon integration.<p>I would be willing to pay <i>up to</i> $30 to get Amazon scraping into EasyTag, because I believe in the long-term benefits of well-supported FOSS software. But beyond that, it&#x27;s hard to justify, because I could just as easily pay $30 and run T&amp;R under Wine&#x2F;in a VM.<p>[0] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.softpointer.com&#x2F;tr.htm" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.softpointer.com&#x2F;tr.htm</a>\n[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.gnome.org&#x2F;Apps&#x2F;EasyTAG" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.gnome.org&#x2F;Apps&#x2F;EasyTAG</a>')
