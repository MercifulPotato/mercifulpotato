If masks are not adequate to protect you from others who may not be following best practices then I think the PPE standards need to be adjusted. You cannot trust&#x2F;expect everyone to adhere to them perfectly.<p>I live in an area that isn&#x27;t Florida but does not adhere to quarantine guidelines. Personally, I don&#x27;t know of anyone who has been sick. We wash our hands and take basic precautions and anecdotally that has been sufficient.<p>Personal disclaimer: I am anti lockdown. This is causing substantial damage to our economy and I depend on my community having the financial means to purchase my services and products.<p>I work in construction and the majority of the jobsites do not wear masks. We are all ok. If you are feeling sick then don&#x27;t be an asshole and show up to work. Everyone I know has followed this basic guideline. Of course you will say you can have it and be asymptomatic etc and we could discuss this ad nauseum but I will just tell you I am not open to changing my mind. I have an absolutism mentality on this position. I don&#x27;t think we know enough about the virus to make these types of detrimental restrictions. For example we now know putting someone on a ventilator for an extended period of time typically does more harm than good.')
