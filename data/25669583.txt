Democratic, liberal institutions, high standards of living.<p>General MacArthur literally gave women in Japan the right to vote (or rather, facilitated it) and restored a better democracy in Japan than had ever existed. This is not the action of an Imperial power.<p>The USSR was an Imperial Power, the US is a Superpower.<p>The USSR&#x27;s relationship with Belarus, Latvia, Poland etc. are examples of real Imperial power one that happened to be based on a supposed ideology more than anything else.<p>The US&#x27;s relationship with Japan, South Korea and Germany for example, is obviously not Imperialist.<p>The US keeps the high seas open, the Suez&#x2F;Panama Canal open for everyone, even military adversaries, let alone economic competitors. An Imperial power would control those assets and extract wealth out of them directly.<p>Now - to be fair, this is somewhat self-serving, as the US benefits quite a lot from stability and trade. They make a lot more money selling iPhones and coffee from Starbuck&#x27;s.<p>Even the UK Empire was only borderline Imperial. They were big on trade, the colonies enjoyed quite a bit of autonomy. It rose on the basis of the Industrial Revolution - which was fundamentally driven by an underlying economic system, not a political one.<p>True Imperialism would be for example the Roman Empire.<p>It&#x27;s obviously not all roses, I wouldn&#x27;t imply that, but the US is not a good example Imperialism.')
