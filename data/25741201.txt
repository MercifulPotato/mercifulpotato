The design failure is in assuming collisions don&#x27;t exist.  That&#x27;s a poor design decision made by the developer that is directly the responsibility of the developer.<p>If this was a one-off bug in systemd, it could get a pass, but it isn&#x27;t a one-off.  Try to boot a Linux system using systemd when something is just slightly off, like one block device that&#x27;s normally available is missing or when networking doesn&#x27;t come up.  systemd does not handle failures well, and it doesn&#x27;t handle them because the main developer makes no effort to test failure modes.  This incident is yet another example of this pattern of development style.  When I write code, I have to make an effort to test what happens during unexpected failures.  I expect the developer of the most critical component to booting a modern Linux system to do the same.')
