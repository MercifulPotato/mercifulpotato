I grew up in a rural area and I know these people quite well. People in rural areas reject science, general knowledge and social norms of the &quot;big cities&quot; because they are frightened and ignorant, not because of some equally valid world view.<p>Their response to climate science is stubborn ignorance. Their response to different cultures, races and religion is bigotry. Their response to democracy (when it doesn&#x27;t suit them) is reactionary. Their response to education is closed mindedness. There&#x27;s nothing to respect here.<p>Rural people are happy to have iPhones, as long as they don&#x27;t need to understand the science behind the technology, understand the multicultural aspects of it&#x27;s existence or respect the people who created it.<p>As Asimov said 40 years ago:<p>&quot;There is a cult of ignorance in the United States, and there has always been. The strain of anti-intellectualism has been a constant thread winding its way through our political and cultural life, nurtured by the false notion that democracy means that my ignorance is just as good as your knowledge.&quot;')
