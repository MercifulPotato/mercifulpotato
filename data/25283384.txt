The majority of these companies have spreadsheets where people share their salaries, and from what I&#x27;ve seen, it&#x27;s a fairly basic formula based on 3 factors: Level, rating and location. Yes, there&#x27;s maybe a few % of wiggle in there, but generally it&#x27;s fairly consistent from what I&#x27;ve seen.<p>You could argue that the way you get a rating, or even the way you get promoted are a black box, but compared to most non-tech companies, it actually tends to be quite a bit better.')
