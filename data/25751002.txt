Item(by='breck', descendants=None, kids=[25751153], score=None, time=1610475509, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25749926, text='I&#x27;ve supported EFF as long as I can remember, but I don&#x27;t think they will ever come out and say itâ€”we need to #AbolishCopyright and #AbolishPatents. Reform is impossible. The systems are fundamentally bad and unjust. Some people might say &quot;but our founding fathers legalized it!&quot;, yes, but they also legalized human slavery and didn&#x27;t allow women to vote. I don&#x27;t think #ImaginaryPropertyLaws were nearly as big a problem as they are today. It&#x27;s only thanks to the Internet and computing that the opportunity cost of #ImaginaryPropertyLaws has grown to catastrophic size.<p>EFF I think has a broader mandate and I can&#x27;t blame them for not taking the correct position on this issue. It&#x27;s a huge issue and they have a big portfolio already.<p>If a group of people at EFF splintered off to found a new non-profit dedicated solely to #AbolishingCopyright and #AbolishingPatents, I would support and donate to that.')
