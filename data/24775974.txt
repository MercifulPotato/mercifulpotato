At least personally an existing show has to be getting really good reviews for me to care enough to catch up on previous seasons, but if it&#x27;s possible to jump right into season 3 then I&#x27;d be more inclined to check it out.<p>IIRC American Horror Story had increased viewership in the 2nd and then again in the 3rd season, but it did eventually go downhill. Ryan Murphy shows are also pretty weird though, it would be nice to see the seasonal anthology format in broader contexts. I&#x27;m optimistic about the Haunting of Hill House series but that&#x27;s again horror.')
