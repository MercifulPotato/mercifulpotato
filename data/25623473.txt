I personally have used for the last 30 months the app called Time Tracker.<p>Each second of every day is tracked, the timer goes on continuously and I just change the current activity.<p>Looking back at it at the end of the year is surprisingly a double-edged sword...<p>You are hit with a high knowing how much time you spent on work, working out, reading, socializing, etc..<p>But then you get hit with the downside, which is that you see how much time you wasted...<p>When you realize how much time gets spent on gaming, going to the store or even changing your clothed (!!!) you start looking at your time very differently.<p>If anyone has any questions or wants to know something I would be glad to be of use..')
