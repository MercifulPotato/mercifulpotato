I don&#x27;t know exactly what is going on here, but in the above post what I mean by the system applying a default route is that the route isn&#x27;t propagated to the system configration&#x27;s dynamic store and whatever macOS uses for netlink, i.e. the route doesn&#x27;t show up in `route monitor` until the check finishes. However, I do believe it would still be used at some level, either on the T2 or in the kernel to do the NTP stuff.')
