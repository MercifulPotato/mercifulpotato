If I&#x27;m going to trust <i>anyone</i> to learn from their mistakes, passenger aviation are the ones.<p>I&#x27;m just saying that when it comes to complex systems, it&#x27;s not evident that someone who said &quot;I&#x27;ve looked at it and it checks out&quot;, the thing fails, and then the same someone said, &quot;Okay, now I&#x27;ve <i>really</i> looked at it and it checks out again&quot; that it&#x27;s now safe. There&#x27;s more nuance to it than that.<p>Whether or not that nuance has been taken in consideration by the FAA this time I really am not in a position to say.')
