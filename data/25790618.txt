Winterkorn has been accused of two crimes (market manipulation and fraud). In Germany if you are guilty of several crimes the sentences do not simply get added on top of each other, instead there is a &quot;Gesamtstrafe&quot; (One punishment for all crimes committed). That&#x27;s why they discontinued the case on these charges because they are far less important than the fraud charges and won&#x27;t change the outcome in a significant way.')
