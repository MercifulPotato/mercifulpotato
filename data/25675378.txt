Long story short, the CPU overhead of rebuilding data is a real concern.<p>Interesting. I don&#x27;t know about how these systems are implemented in practice, but I&#x27;d be surprised if GF(2^8) was &quot;too big&quot;.<p>GF(2^8) was small enough that it was implemented in 1977 on the Voyager probe project. Yeah, it took a literal supercomputer to decode that RS-code in the 1980s, but modern computers are basically as fast as 1980s-era supercomputers.<p>Modern papers are talking about GF(2^32) to GF(2^128) these days. (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ccis.northeastern.edu&#x2F;home&#x2F;alina&#x2F;papers&#x2F;tos-gf.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ccis.northeastern.edu&#x2F;home&#x2F;alina&#x2F;papers&#x2F;tos-gf.p...</a>). Most implementations don&#x27;t need anything near that size, so GF(2^8) is sufficient.<p>---------<p>I mean, I&#x27;ve done GF(2^4) RS codes by hand. That&#x27;s a very, very, very small system, human calculable with just pen and paper. So you&#x27;re right that its far easier to calculate. I&#x27;m just kind of surprised that anyone would bother with a computer RS code of that miniscule size.<p>Ex: RS(15, 9) is a 9x15 generator matrix and a 6x15 check matrix over GF(2^4). Its on the large-side of hand-doable calculations, but absolutely doable by pen-and-paper (I recommend graph paper). Every symbol is a 2^4 hexadecimal symbol, so a single hand-written character (0123456789ABCDEF) is stored on a single cell in graph paper.<p>-------<p>Are you sure those systems are working in GF(16) fields? Not GF(2^16) AKA gf(65536) fields? GF(2^16) is more of the size I&#x27;d expect a computer to do, more so than GF(2^4).')
