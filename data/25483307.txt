You just allocate a large section of virtual memory before entering seccomp mode. This is not hard. I have used seccomp in production myself.<p>Not to mention sandboxed wasm is similarly restrictive and you need third-party library support to operate in that “embedded” environment. You don’t just get a normal runtime environment for free. Wasm simply gets you memory “bounds checks” but it’s not necessary if the isolate owns the entire process, as in the seccomp model.')
