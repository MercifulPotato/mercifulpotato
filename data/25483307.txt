You just allocate a large section of virtual memory before entering seccomp mode. This is not hard. I have used seccomp in production myself.<p>Not to mention sandboxed wasm is similarly restrictive and you need third-party library support to operate in that “embedded” environment. Wasm simply gets you memory “bounds checks” but it’s not necessary if the isolate owns the entire process, as in the seccomp model.')
