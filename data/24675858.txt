At that point the phones just become extensions of the state&#x27;s intelligence apparatus, and that&#x27;s a net negative for everyone&#x27;s privacy.<p>Apple should certainly allow alternative app stores, and Google should make it easier and safer for customers to install alternative app stores, but I never want to see governments get into that market.')
