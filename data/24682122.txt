As I said, even if no older or more commonly available opiate were available that precisely matched OxyContin&#x27;s duration&#x2F;time release (which is a bit far fetched given the dozens others that were already available well before OxyContin was released), then any self-respecting corner-shop compounding pharmacist will blend a time release to suit any patient (or match one to Oxycontin&#x27;s properties).<p>Blending up a time-release drug requires a knowledge of the normal properties of said drug, an ability to calculate the additional amount of drug after its duration has been extended with delaying agents and the knowledge of the properties of any third drug needed (like another different opioid) if found necessary to add one so as to tweak or fine-tune the process.  Sounds complicated, but it&#x27;s a snack to do for someone with a degree in pharmacy.')
