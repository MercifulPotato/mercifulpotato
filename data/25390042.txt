The few times I&#x27;ve ever skimmed the ACPI&#x2F;Power Events event logs in Windows, it&#x27;s an amazing glimpse into some real wild goings on that rarely seem noticeable from a user level, but clearly indicate that drivers are as much of a mess as ever and Windows does a lot of work to make it look like things are fine, everything is fine, and system is peacefully sleeping (as hardware gets kicked under the table for acting up).<p>I&#x27;m not sure if there are direct lessons there for Linux driver handling as Microsoft has huge test labs that do forward these sorts of event logs to the hardware manufacturers and is in a position to expect at least some of them to do better next time (either next driver update or next hardware refresh).')
