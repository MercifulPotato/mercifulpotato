But pharmacy is very competitive and at some point it&#x27;s a losing game.<p>For example - Walgreen runs about about a 4% margin and profit runs about $4 billion (all very rough numbers).<p>The problem with theft is that its a total loss so it can really chop into margins - these are shelves that you build a supply chain and staff to stock and then get zero.<p>Someone walks in with a backpack and just fills it full (maybe 50 - 100 individual items). Meanwhile you have 20 customers buying a few items (1-5). So you sell 100 items at 104% of all in cost (4% positive margin) and 100 walk out the door (if only the knapsack guy steals) at 0% of cost. Your margin is negative immediately (-40%+).<p>Walgreens actually has budgets for theft store managers try to work with in (pretty high ones actually). But theft the way it happens in SF - you need to understand there are no consequence, the only folks to get in trouble would be employees trying to stop it.<p>It also drives away customers you do want (older people filing scrips will go to what are perceived as safer locations) and moves other sales to online &#x2F; delivery etc.<p>They are robbed while TV crews are filming about robberies :)<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=7FmN4e1fNUo" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=7FmN4e1fNUo</a><p>SF talks a lot of crap about Amazon, but if amazon offers a safe &#x2F; delivery to your garage &#x2F; car &#x2F; inside door pharmacy service it could be game over for a lot of players.')
