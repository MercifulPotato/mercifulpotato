In summary, I had meant to evaluate B=sqrt(f(A^2)) but what I actually evaluated was B=sqrt(f(A)^2), which caused the resulting output to slightly off. \nIn the review process, one of the reviewers looked at the output, and said wait a second this seems fishy, can you explain why it has such and such artifact. Their comments quickly allowed me to pinpoint what was going wrong, and correct the analysis script appropriately -- which actually ended up improving the result significantly!<p>What I take away from this all is that for every article about academic misconduct and p hacking there are 100 more where the peer review process (both before and during submission to a journal) caught the issues in time.<p>But... also probably a decent number where the errors is still in the wild to this day...')
