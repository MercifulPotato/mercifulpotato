It happens in a longer time period of time so the rest of the eco-system (including humans) gets to coevolve with it.<p>I know there is a lot of propaganda that goes into it, mostly to paint the opposition as uneducated irrational village idiots so you can dismiss anyone who brings this up... or you feel the urge to educate them about the basics, so let me frame it another way which may be easier to understand:<p>Are you familiar with the problem of invasive species (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Invasive_species" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Invasive_species</a>)? It&#x27;s when certain species of plants or animals are introduced into a different eco-system that hasn&#x27;t evolved with that particular animal or plant... and the whole eco-system goes out of whack. All GMOs are potential invasive species to all eco-systems. This problem does not exist (or is negligible) with artificial selection.')
