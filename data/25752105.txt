I&#x27;ve had to hand-write a lot of code that I&#x27;m excited about a generics solution automating, but automation can have a price, you&#x27;re exactly right. I&#x27;ve worked on a C++ codebase before that couldn&#x27;t physically compile on my machine because it blew stack on template instantiation recursions (issue never noticed because the original developer had a better machine).')
