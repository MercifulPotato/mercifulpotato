At lower temperatures, it&#x27;s less likely for a given bond to reach the Gibbs free energy of activation, thus preventing degradation.<p>In a biological context, the vast majority of RNA use falls within the &#x27;central dogma&#x27; of DNA -&gt; RNA -&gt; Protein.  It is merely an intermediate, albeit one with important and complex regulatory processes.<p>In RNA viruses and other contexts where stability is required, the RNA is stabilized by its environment, namely by associating with special proteins.')
