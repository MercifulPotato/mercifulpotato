I have often switched to Chromium whenever a Chrome update was breaking various websites I used. Chromium is lagging a bit behind in repositories; some delay is enough to let the website owners update. Then I can switch back to Chrome for that site once again.<p>This has been happening more often lately, in my experience. Sure, you could say that the website is broken and not the browser. But from a user’s perspective, it used to work and now it doesn’t. Users don’t care whose fault it is.<p>But big corps don’t care if less than 0.1% of users are impacted. Even if that means 100,000 people. So it’s ok to break a few eggs.<p>As a website owner myself, I’ve had to make changes about once a year to keep things running properly in Chrome due to deprecated APIs. This is for a website that has not changed at all otherwise in 5 years, and I built without using any external dependencies so that I can avoid updating things.<p>Compare this with other environments: Windows apps usually can run for 20 years without issues; Linux apps even more. Not to mention document formats, like PDF, which are pretty much guaranteed to be accessible forever. Adobe got at least one thing right.<p>The only good thing I can say about this disregard for backwards compatibility is that it gives web developers good job security.')
