Almost every initiative to pay a large number of blogs and creators at once has failed because it&#x27;s too difficult to get them all to sign on and distribute money to all of them.  YouTube is a monopoly for better and worse, so it was easier for them to implement ad-free for almost every video creator.<p>I wish Google Contributor could live up to the same promise, but Google killed it and replaced it with a different version.  It made you a participant in the bidding process for your own ad views.  So unless an advertiser was bidding a crazy amount of money, you would win the bid and an empty ad (or no ad at all) would load instead.  Like YouTube Premium, this took advantage of the existing ad payment infrastructure while removing almost all the ads from your pages and videos.')
