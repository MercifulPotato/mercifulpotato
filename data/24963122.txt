Likewise, if you follow people because you like code, and more people for your other interests, and you follow your friends, and fun stuff, then it gets really noisy too.<p>I follow a lot of people for frontend dev things, but also some more people for wildlife photography, and local Northeast UK tech scene stuff. I had to cut down from following about 1000 people at peak to 300 because I couldn&#x27;t keep up <i>at all</i>.<p>If you can focus who you follow and what you use Twitter for then it&#x27;s good, but for most people who have multiple interests it&#x27;s not. Lists help a lot, but you need discipline to use them well.')
