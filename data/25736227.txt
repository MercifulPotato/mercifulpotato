Odd, the speech you&#x27;re talking about being legal hasn&#x27;t seemed to affect things much at all. Actually, we&#x27;ve done nothing but thrive despite hate speech being legal. Why haven&#x27;t people been clamoring for decades to change the constitution because of all the mayhem caused by hate speech?')
