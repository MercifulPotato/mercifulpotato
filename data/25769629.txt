In fact, I&#x27;m trying to introduce ZIO in my Scala-mostly company. The problem is that a stray UUID.randomUUID() can destroy any and all guarantees. (We&#x27;re already using Monix.)<p><i>That</i> truly is the singular reason that I still prefer Haskell over Scala. I can get over syntax awkwardness, etc. etc. The impure-in-pure is... difficult when you can&#x27;t just grep for unsafe*, etc.<p>EDIT: Fwiw, ZIO is definitely better than Haskell&#x27;s IO. Better than RIO? Perhaps. Is it better than polysemy, tho? I don&#x27;t think so. Btw, I know about polysemy&#x27;s issues as well... hopefully lexi-lambda can get her GHC runtime changes merged so that we can have a true &quot;free&quot; effect system backed by a tailored runtime. Interestingly, Project Loom is also heading in a similar direction (first class continuations) on the JVM. Interesting times!')
