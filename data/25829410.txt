When Prime Pantry launched, Amazon hadn&#x27;t acquired Whole Foods, and they didn&#x27;t have a story for last-mile delivery yet.<p>So they had to ship your order from a warehouse, and the only way to do that profitably on low-margin grocery items was to batch them up into a large order in a box of uniform dimensions.<p>The fact that they no longer need to do this speaks to how far Amazon&#x27;s logistics have come over the last 7 years.')
