Multicolour LEDs have always been a problem for me, and my gf can&#x27;t believe that I can&#x27;t read them... I also have issues with the UI of one of the apps I use regularly (wavelab) as the master section on&#x2F;off is the wrong shades of red and green, so that&#x27;s a problem.<p>Thanks to everyone for posting in here about it - I no longer (at 49!) feel like I&#x27;m the only one in the world who has this issue with LEDs in particular.')
