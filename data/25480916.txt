It still had a lot of information and value even if you entirely remove Chaudhry&#x27;s story. And even for his story, it was very clearly presented as not fully certain. I wouldn&#x27;t call it &quot;nearly-fiction&quot;, it&#x27;s closer to your average True Crime podcast where you are presented with the known information and it&#x27;s up to you to decide if you believe it or not.')
