I was walking across a barren street in our small college town on my way to class, and there was a town cop standing against a wall of a nearby building waiting for an easy catch.<p>I had fully crossed the street and was walking to a nearby building when I heard someone yell &quot;Hey&quot; behind me.<p>I contemplated not even turning around, because I wanted to get to class on time, but I did ... and saw the officer standing on the other side.<p>He didn&#x27;t feel like coming to me, so he instructed me to re-cross the street back to him.<p>&quot;Are you sure you want me to jaywalk back?&quot; I asked.  &quot;Isn&#x27;t that dangerous?&quot;<p>He rolled his eyes and gave me the ticket.')
