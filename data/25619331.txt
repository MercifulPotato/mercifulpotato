Item(by='topspin', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609646808, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25618303, text='&gt; elegant foundation for computation.<p>-1, 0, +1 has as elegant symmetry that will inspire fascination until either someone can prove its inferiority with some heretofore unimagined model of computing or someone builds a clearly superior device based on it.  I strongly doubt such a device is possible with contemporary two dimensional etched semiconductors; too many people have been torturing conventional mosfet circuits for too many decades to think they&#x27;ve left much on the table.  But who knows what the future will deliver?  Maybe we&#x27;ll start computing with proteins next year and somehow 3 (or more) levels will make sense.')
