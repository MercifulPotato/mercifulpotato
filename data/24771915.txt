Online forums were for learning and making friends. Nowadays, Hacker News is one of the few places left where speech is somewhat non-partisan, thanks to moderators putting unthinkable hours into it.<p>Is there a way to maintain online discussions going forward in such a way that one does not get flamed, or canceled, or forever blacklisted for having opinions that donâ€™t fall in line with main stream?<p>It feels like the only way left is to maintain complete anonymity. To VPN, and rotate user names etc. and so forth.<p>Is there better, less nuclear way to have a discussion without the fear of it backfiring in the worst ways?')
