Item(by='BuildTheRobots', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607532857, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25357444, text='Hey, thank you very much for the reply.<p>Either a &quot;link reset at&quot; or even just a note on the share link page saying &quot;this link stays permanent between runs unless you choose to reset it&quot; would be OK I guess. The only reason I realised it didn&#x27;t change is because on arranging a meeting with friends recently, they said &quot;oh yeah, i&#x27;ve already got that link, you sent it to me last time&quot;.<p>Entirely my own fault and own assumption... Maybe even a settings option to &quot;preserve tracking URL between launches&quot; or an option for &quot;URL times out after xxx hours&#x2F;days&quot;.<p>A togglable &quot;show my location&quot; would work fantastically for my use case. Even better if it were to show me a distance (20 miles away as the crow flies is still useful information if you&#x27;re waiting for someone to arrive, though obviously doesn&#x27;t take into account distance or time by road).<p>Multiple users on the map would be fantastic (I really do miss lattitude). I can&#x27;t quite imagine how that would work without an immense amount of extra work. At the moment we tend to just share the URL via a facebook message, me having to paste multiple links in would work fine for me, but I can see less technical users having problems.<p>I guess in an ideal world, viewing someone elses graticule link would open in the app rather than the webpage. At that point clicking multiple links for different people would just add them all into my copy off the app so I could see everyone moving around just by opening my copy of graticule rather than keeping track of other people&#x27;s URLs. Combined with an ability to set a lifetime on the link we could all generate a 24h tracking URL in the morning, post them all into a group chat and then it&#x27;s just a few clicks for me to correlate them all together into the app (and then have them auto-remove as the links time out).<p>Having multiple maps on screen on the computer is acceptable if I&#x27;m just tracking multiple people (eg different delivery drivers); eg their actual location only matters to me. The second I have more than one person trying to meet up (even if it&#x27;s me and someone else), then having disparate maps is a pain. As one tends to want them rather zoomed in I&#x27;m having to expend a lot of mental effort in trying to work out where each location is relative to each other, rather than reality. If it&#x27;s an area of the country where I don&#x27;t recognise village names then I&#x27;m having to crossreference a whole lot of information and keep it all in my head (and I&#x27;m stupid with a bad memory).<p>Hope this feedback is useful. I feel quite guilty about the fact I&#x27;ve suggested a tonne of work for yourself for the sake of making something I use for free easier for me, which doesn&#x27; seem entirely fair :)')
