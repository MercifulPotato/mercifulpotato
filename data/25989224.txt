You can see this when a law similar to what you suggest was passed in Spain and Google shut down just Google News. Or when Germany passed a similar law, without a requirement to participate, and Google just made it clear if publishers didn&#x27;t give Google a license for free they&#x27;d be booted off search.<p>Google is like the mob, in that you literally have to build a whole new law around dealing with it (RICO) that lets you come at the edge and use that to come at the head of the snake.')
