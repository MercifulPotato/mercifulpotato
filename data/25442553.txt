I see this claim made in a few places, but I can&#x27;t find any evidence beyond &quot;Facebook was created the same day LifeLog was shut down&quot; (February 4, 2004).<p>Not that I&#x27;m a fan of Facebook&#x27;s data collection, but claiming it&#x27;s a CIA operation is a substantial claim that would require substantial evidence beyond that date being shared, which very easily could be a coincidence. (Also, if it were really planned as a secret successor, why would they publicly do it on the same date?)<p>I&#x27;m pretty skeptical Zuckerberg was in contact with the CIA when he started Facebook in his dorm room if that&#x27;s the only piece of evidence.')
