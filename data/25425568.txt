The papers you referencing are quire interesting as they validate some ideas I was idly thinking about. I still would call these designs OoO though, just extended.<p>The problem is that building a CPU is very expensive and high risk, going even a bit beyond the classic OoO can bankrupt you. Intel tried with Itanic and AMD almost ate its lunch; AMD tried with buldozer and shared execution units and almost collapsed; SUN tried with flock of chickens and is no more; Nvidia tried with denver, and well, I guess they had a lot of cash. Both AMD and Apple just made completely orthodox designs and were complete successes.<p>Evolution is going to be in small steps, unless a new design can prove to be 10x better than the existing ones which is very unlikely.')
