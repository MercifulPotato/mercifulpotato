Item(by='cmrdporcupine', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602861361, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24801193, text='Cool, they&#x27;re fun vines.<p>I am growing about a 1&#x2F;4 acre of Marquette and Frontenac blanc (a white sport of Frontenac developed here in Canada), and Petite Pearl which is from Minnesota, but privately bred by Tom Plocher (<a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.coldclimategrapes.com&#x2F;petite-pearl.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.coldclimategrapes.com&#x2F;petite-pearl.html</a>)<p>I&#x27;m not blown away by Frontenac blanc and will likely take it out and replace it with another white, as the acids are very difficult to work with.  Marquette is a fantastic grape overall, but the wine quite neutral to the point of uncharacteristic.  Petite Pearl is low vigor, lower sugar, and small tight clusters, but it adds a nice leatheriness to the wine.. thick skins, hangs well, birds don&#x27;t seem to bother with it like they do Marquette.<p>This year I put Marquette pollen onto the first fruit off of a local v. aestivalis bicolor vine and have a handful of seeds from that.  Also put Marquette onto a complex Sauv Blanc x (Aestivales x Aestivalis Bicolor) vine that I grew from seed from Clifford Ambers. Hopefully I can get these planted out next year and get started on more complex stuff after that.')
