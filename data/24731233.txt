Our contract stated I would pay a flat fee and she would cover the filing fees. When we filed the first set of forms, she expected me to pay. When I pointed out the contract said she would pay, she crossed it out in pen, rewrote it in pen stating I would pay. I had already signed the document, and felt obligated to continue using her service since we were months into the process and I didn&#x27;t want to lose the time invested. I felt like refusing, but didn&#x27;t want her to intentionally drag out the process as retribution.<p>This was in 2017 and after 2 years my wife is now in the country. Is there any course of action I could take now?')
