They earned it from us. If they&#x27;d been given this power by a government agency or something I&#x27;d be more concerned, but at the end of the day, we the people directly decided that facebook, and not MySpace or Google plus or whatever,  should have this power. And as a non government agency they have the right to modulate speech on their platform. And as long as they&#x27;re modulating it in this way, by pushing back against holocaust denial, i think they&#x27;re showing that they are at least competent at making these sorts of decisions. If they eventually prove not to be - well - no social media company is truly too big to fail. There&#x27;s no regulatory capture or unfair barriers to competition in this space. Their users and advertisers made Facebook, we can unmake it too.')
