We have child classes that inherit from an AR-backed parent, and on the parent we implement an instance method that transforms it (via #becomes) to the appropriate child based on the value of an attribute.  The final piece is another attribute that stores a serialized object of child-specific attributes, and other methods that dynamically define attribute readers at boot time.  It&#x27;ll be nice to migrate to this new feature to free ourselves from the burden of that last piece in particular.')
