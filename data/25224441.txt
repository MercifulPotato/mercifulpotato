So when you say that entropy is an arbitrary concept, is it simply determined by the likeliest macrostates? So in the case of planets vs dust clouds, would we say that planets have higher entropy than dust clouds because entropy is defined as increasing with the likeliest states and we know that planets are likelier?<p>To put it another way, could someone us their understanding of entropy to make predictions about a system&#x27;s probability distribution beyond what they already know of it? Or is the entropy of a state purely defined by its proximity to a basin of attraction?<p>I&#x27;m reminded of a debate in physics when the time light takes to travel between fixed points changes - a minority prefers to change the definition of C in m&#x2F;s, while most prefer to change the value of m in the portion of the universe we&#x27;re in at the time. To ask the same question in yet another way, Is Entropy like C to the majority? If it appears to decrease, it&#x27;s our  understanding of probabilities for the system that need to be reworked?')
