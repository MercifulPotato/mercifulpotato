Being a kid my mom always thought that was just a stupid story. She played withing a button on a string, and didn&#x27;t know anyone that happened to. Decades later, as an adult she was telling the story about this weird and admonition to a distant cousin (2nd?) of hers, and her cousin got real quiet, and simply stated, &quot;That was my brother,&quot; and then told the story about how it happened, and that he did lose sight in one of his eyes he struck it with a button tied to a string.')
