They&#x27;re very different languages.  If anything, I&#x27;d lump C++ in with Rust.  They&#x27;re both big, complicated languages.  If you&#x27;re just looking to understand the C model of computing that underlies any Unix-like system, spend some time with C.  Learn to write a linked list, experience a few segfaults, and then decide what kind of safety and abstraction you&#x27;d like in your systems language.')
