There is no way to obscure the call to direct &quot;eval&quot; itself; the compiler knows clearly whether it occurs.<p>Without &quot;eval&quot; appearing syntactically inside a function&#x27;s scope, there is no dynamic access to &quot;let&quot; variables, and there&#x27;s no need for the JIT code to check the assumption at run time.<p>Despite no other assignments, the &quot;let&quot; variable does change value: It has the assigned value after the &quot;let&quot;, and the &quot;temporal dead zone&quot; value before it in the same scope.  However &quot;const&quot; also has this property so it&#x27;s not obvious why there would be a speed difference.')
