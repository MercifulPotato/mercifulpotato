After a suicide attempt I decided to just let go and find a therapist who I could really really relate with and let it all hang out. Low and behold this gentleman figured out what I had a feeling about all along but could not put a finger on it. What he figured out was that I had PTSD comorbid with ADHD, when I would get down in a hole via the PTSD the ADHD would leave me in a pattern in which I could not figure out how to put one foot in front of the other, which would leave me in the hole watching the world stack on top of me.<p>He said he had seen this a lot with &quot;resistant&quot; depression because it is not depression at all, it is PTSD coupled with ADHD&#x2F;ADD which is a really bad and many times fatal combo. ADD makes you feel just as worthless as depression, and PTSD is a match in a dynamite factory coupled they can look a lot like resistant depression. I user anyone who suffers from resistant depression to at least have the checks for comorbid PTSD and ADD.')
