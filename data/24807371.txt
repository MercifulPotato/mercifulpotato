It&#x27;s pretty obvious you&#x27;re a CCP shill.<p>But assuming you&#x27;re not, you do realize you&#x27;re argument is a double-edged sword? Why should the world care about a country who locks up millions of people in internment camps? Why should we care about a country who silences people who speak out against atrocities committed by their government. To use your language, &quot;You reap what you sow, I&#x27;m sorry&quot;. If we all had your attitude, then we should all say &quot;Screw China&quot;.<p>Obviously I don&#x27;t use your logic because it&#x27;s flawed and deeply hateful. Your racism and generalization are on full display. You paint with such a broad brush that no one can take anything you say seriously. You label the entirety of the Uyghur population as terrorist. There have been isolated incidents of violence. But that does not justify the persecution of millions.<p>Your racism is truly disgusting. If this is what the world looks forward to with China being a new leader on the world stage, then our future as humanity looks truly terrifying.')
