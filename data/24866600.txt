But what if I mandated every service from a staff must be tipped with atleast 100$, because we value our workers more here.<p>This achieves the same purpose and I get to pretend to be egalitarian.<p>If this law is passed, ride sharing apps will still exist. They will have a smaller roster of higher quality of drivers and be more expensive to use. It will be perfectly fine for most of the people commenting here.<p>Who it will destroy is the &quot;riff raff&quot;, the people at the lowest rungs of the ladder on both ends. Those who cannot contribute work of sufficient quality to be paid for full time work and benefits. And those who cant afford more expensive ride sharing.<p>Basically a way to ask people of a certain level to leave the state because they cant participate in the economy anymore and appear compassionate at the same time. Insidiously genius.')
