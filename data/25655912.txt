The basics of a lot of vocations is something that is very useful to be able to do for yourself. A bit of plumbing, a bit of carpentry, a bit of cooking, a bit of cleaning, a bit of accounting, a bit of public speaking, etc. Pretty much the 101 of being an adult.<p>Or put another way, a skill or service being a vocation just means it&#x27;s useful enough for enough people, so that society can support it functioning as a distinct job (or set of jobs).
