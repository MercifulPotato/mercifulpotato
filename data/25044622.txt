It&#x27;s a recognizable behavior pattern with a name.<p>In my opinion this just delays the question.\nThe question now becomes whether machines can perceive themselves (or really anything at all) or whether they can just mechanically and symbolically represent the perception of objects, including themselves.\nIf the answer is yes, then that implies that any sufficiently large representation of computation has a consciousness and therefore that there is nothing special about it.\nIf it is no, then where&#x27;s the relevant difference to a human brain?')
