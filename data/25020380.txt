Yes, leaders need to listen to experts and advisors and make thoughtful decisions. But they should also stay in tune with the electorate.<p>Perhaps a politician is naturally inclined towards removing regulations so that it&#x27;s easier to grow a business. That&#x27;s a reasonable baseline positionâ€”but if there&#x27;s suddenly an up-swell of support for strong environmental regulations to combat global warming, it&#x27;s completely reasonable to change your position in response to the will of the country.')
