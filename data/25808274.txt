An argument was that they were not <i>single issue</i> voters, but rather they were a <i>foundational issue</i> voters.<p>That all rights (to him&#x2F;them) are supported by the idea the public is a counter force to the government. Fundamental before all other issues because is the prevention of the gov backtracking or infringing on anything “down stream”. So...<p>That if a politician supported the disarming of civilians that was indeed a full stop to other thoughts on abortion or the foreign trade or etc.<p>It was a good read really, because calling them a single issue voter may give the wrong impression, which is good for no one coming to the table on other issues.')
