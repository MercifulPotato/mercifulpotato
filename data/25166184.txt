The results on that video do not reflect your comments; The software encoder is obviously inferior. Also those results are old.<p>I have also tried all the options and there is no comparison. It&#x27;s a night and day difference between software encoding and nvenc. It was more than triple the latency last I tested.<p>I tested steam, parsec and also the best software available today for game streaming, Gamestream + Moonlight or Gamestream on the Shield TV.<p>Anybody would notice the difference in quality and input lag between QuickSync, libx264 and NVEnc. The difference really is very large in higher resolutions (talking about 1440p and 4k in 60&#x2F;144fps).')
