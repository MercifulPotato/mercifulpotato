Item(by='fpgaminer', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610406079, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25736698, text='&gt; Many of the worst bugs originated in story pathways that would only be triggered if various conditions had occurred<p>I think the absolute worst bug I encountered was because of this, but I don&#x27;t believe the story pathway that triggers it was uncommon.  In fact, that condition apparently has a major effect on the story later.<p>Basically it was part of a main story quest where you have to wait a day for a character to call you before the quest can continue.  But I never got a call.  I saw a lot of threads on the issue, and it seems the bug happens if you did some optional dialogue right beforehand.  But unlike other optional dialogue in the game, this optional dialogue was really hard to miss.  I had to actively run past an NPC to avoid it.<p>I ended up losing about an hour of gameplay from that bug :&#x2F;<p>I agree with you that it was likely because they changed something last minute and never checked it again; a QA failure for sure.  And my theory is the COVID situation made QA testing a nightmare.  Still ... that bug was brutal.  Every &quot;wait for X to call you&quot; quest after made me anxious.')
