We&#x27;d ask people to build a priority queue. Items with a higher priority need to be handled before those with a lower priority, but otherwise items should be handled in order.<p>Can you guess what the most common methodology people chose was?<p>Did you guess an XML document?<p>These are people with degrees in comp sci, some claiming 15 years of experience as a developer, trying to get a role at a top 10 bank in New York City.<p>Of course technical interviews shouldn&#x27;t be the only test used for hiring, but they absolutely should be included. Maybe it&#x27;s demeaning that you have to jump through these hoops. Or maybe you&#x27;re bad at them. Or they&#x27;re &quot;beneath you&quot; in some sort of way. But don&#x27;t blame the interviewer, blame the hundreds of other people trying to get a job that they aren&#x27;t qualified for.')
