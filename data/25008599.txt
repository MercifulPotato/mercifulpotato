Just put a limit on viewing 20 articles an hour, no need to differentiate between human and robot.<p>The boundary between humans and robots will blur over the next few centuries. At some point it will just be a spectrum from all-inorganic to mixed to all-organic beings that roam the planet. We might as well prepare for that future by abolishing chemistryism (discrimination against organic vs. inorganic chemistry of a being) today.<p>(Yes this sounds stupid, but 200 years ago, abolishing racism sounded stupid too.)')
