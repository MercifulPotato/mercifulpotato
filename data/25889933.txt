Or on the 100s of sites, you are responsible for all the plug-ins?<p>The short answer is yes, you&#x27;re right - losing being able to write to disk means a lot of functionality is lost. But it does improve security in some contexts so the trade-off might be worth it to some people.<p>I wrote a small plugin that lets me flick between read-only and read&#x2F;write filesystem permissions with the press of a button - so when I need to administer it, I just allow writing, and the rest of the time I leave it locked off.<p>Doesn&#x27;t work in all circumstances (e.g., if there are plugins that need to write to the disk), but for sites which predominantly have static content it means I don&#x27;t need to worry as much about things writing to disk in the event something is compromised.')
