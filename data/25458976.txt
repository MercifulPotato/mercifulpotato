Does code search include issues and pull requests, or just code?<p>Honestly I&#x27;ve always hated Github&#x27;s full text search on code.  Give me an amped-up per-repo grep and scrap global code search entirely.  Maybe I&#x27;m lacking in imagination, but I can&#x27;t see how full text search is useful to anybody.')
