Going from a Intel 6700K to AMD 3950X double the power draw at idle (50 watts to 90+) and that&#x27;s with the same components.<p>On my system the chipset will quickly heat to 57c (when the fan starts) within two minutes regardless of usage. I swear Asus have the cooler upside down (semi-passive heatsink blows air downwards), worse still it ingests warm are from the heatsink. I have been meaning to modify it, right now I have a 140mm fan pointing at it to stop it hitting 1500rpm (where it irritates me).<p>Chasing silence does have diminishing returns. Manually setting the 3950X to 3.6ghz 0.95 volts does make a massive difference. I could run the PC semi passive (no case fans, just CPU &lt;500rpm) if it wasn&#x27;t for the damn PCH fan!<p>AMD also sets the voltage too high for their GPUs, making them actually run slower (the one-click downvolt works well), I think AMD dislikes the planet...')
