Parliament is sovereign: it can overrule anything it likes with legislation. There is no higher authority than parliament in the UK, not even the Supreme Court.<p>Also, the High Court didn&#x27;t rule it unconsitutional, it ruled it contrary to common law. The UK is not the US.<p>The executive (Cabinet etc) cannot simply ignore the ruling, but they might be able to get legislation through Parliament to explicitly allow general warrants.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bailii.org&#x2F;ew&#x2F;cases&#x2F;EWHC&#x2F;Admin&#x2F;2021&#x2F;27.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bailii.org&#x2F;ew&#x2F;cases&#x2F;EWHC&#x2F;Admin&#x2F;2021&#x2F;27.html</a><p>&gt; That principle means that the courts will, when interpreting the provisions of a statute, presume that Parliament did not intend to legislate in a manner which overrides fundamental common law rights. The common law has an aversion to general warrants that leave significant matters of judgment and discretion to the person executing the warrant rather than to the person legally or constitutionally responsible for issuing it.<p>&gt; In view of the importance of the constitutional principle that there can be no interference with property without clear and specific legal authorisation, the words of an enactment must be unambiguous before the court may interpret Parliament as intending to override rights. There are no such unambiguous words in section 5. The national security context makes no difference as otherwise the courts would sanction wide powers to override fundamental rights.')
