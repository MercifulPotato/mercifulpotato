Item(by='matwood', descendants=None, kids=[24718326], score=None, time=1602158083, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24718041, text='&gt; I personally hate so-called &quot;identity politics&quot; because it gives people a personal, group-identity stake in things that not only bias their perspective, but often add a strong emotive current to topics that fuels the creation of stigmas and taboos as above.<p>This is why I&#x27;ll never understand people who are crazy about &lt;insert political candidate here&gt;. No matter who they are, they will do something you disagree with. It&#x27;s much easier to recognize what they did is wrong if you were never part of their group to start. Instead, I see people twisting themselves in knots to defend positions they would normally denounce.<p>And not just too single out politics, but I see the same thing with companies (like Apple). I also don&#x27;t want to sound holier than thou either, since I&#x27;ve recognized it in myself before. This joining a tribe is part of the human condition, so it&#x27;s something I have to actively fight against.')
