Isnâ€™t this part of the progressive dream?&quot;<p>no, the &quot;progressive&quot; label has been appropriated (or misunderstood) in this regard, since &quot;socialist&quot; has been so negatively politicized, but they&#x27;re not synonymous, and in many ways, are othogonal or antagonistic.<p>progressivism aims to empower workers toward social, economic, political, and technological progress, while socialism aims to split stuff among everyone more equally, regardless of progress or holistic benefit.<p>a cursory perusal of bernie&#x27;s policies belie the same aims as other politicians: to shift political, economic, and social power, not a coherent vision for a more progressive future.<p>the working class isn&#x27;t stupid. they (we) know that the both parties are captured by moneyed-interests focused on amassing more power for themselves, not building a great society inclusive of workers and respectful of regular labor.')
