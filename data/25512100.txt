Explain the situation and suggest to the investor that you and the Cofounder need to find a way of working together, otherwise one of you is going to have to leave with 40% of the company. This is a great example of where vesting for founders sorts all of this out clearly and makes it more difficult to get greedy. Of course this makes some assumptions about the legal agreements you have with the company. Do these agreements allow cofounders to be sacked usually, because I’m sure as hell writing into any I sign that I can’t be!')
