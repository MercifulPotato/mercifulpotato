We love the opinionated, batteries-included philosophy of angular, and it does keep getting better over time. We don&#x27;t want to have to make the decisions that are required for React applications. For teams of 3+, I think Angular is the better choice most of the time. It is easy for us to make well maintained, fast applications across platforms. I think you&#x27;ve made reasonable choices over time. Thanks for your work.')
