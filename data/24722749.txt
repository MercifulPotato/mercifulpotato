The CEO said in his initial letter that Coinbase should only engage in politics that are relevant to their &quot;core mission&quot;, but it&#x27;s kind of interesting to reduce a candidate to &quot;What can this candidate or party do specifically for our business?&quot; and ignore other policies that a candidate or party may seek to enact.<p>Pretending that you&#x27;re unaware of or completely ambivalent about the consequences of shifts in political power (so long as it benefits you financially) doesn&#x27;t really qualify you as &quot;apolitical.&quot; You&#x27;re still involved in the political process even if you stick your fingers in your ears and chant &quot;nananana I can&#x27;t hear you.&quot;<p>I hate to sound incisive, but it kind of seems like the position that Coinbase&#x27;s leadership has taken is &quot;The board and CEO will decide what qualifies as &#x27;apolitical&#x27; and as such will dictate the ongoing political activity of the company, which they have no desire to stop being involved in.&quot;')
