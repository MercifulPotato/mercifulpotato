It&#x27;s clear a number of people here consider the command line difficult. I do not. There are many tools that make simple tasks very simple. I use it for manipulating tab files. I can pipe data through scripts and back through command line utilities, pipe it directly into a database, or do the reverse. It&#x27;s very simple, and very powerful.<p>Just because you don&#x27;t understand it or aren&#x27;t familiar with it doesn&#x27;t mean it isn&#x27;t simple, powerful, and user friendly.<p>Most programming languages are very simple. a = 1, b = 2, if a+b &gt; 2, doSomething(). You can&#x27;t actually make the logic simpler than that - this is why visual programming fails. It&#x27;s still programming, but it turns out a limited visual&#x2F;gui tool to do these logical operations is much harder to manage and work with than actual code.')
