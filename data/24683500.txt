Item(by='throwwy_immgrnt', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601858495, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24682594, text='Asians and immigrants tend to value education because it can offer a path to a higher standard of living and coming over to the US kinda self selected for the type of people with an upbringing that valued education and the willingness to take risks in unknown territory (even if it&#x27;s because life in their country of origin was really bad). This is why Asians&#x2F;immigrants and their children have a disproportionate occupation of seats in high caliber schools and jobs at well paying companies in the US.<p>There&#x27;s a couple problems with saying this out loud though:<p>1. Some people are reluctant to admit that culture may be a nontrivial part of the reason why some groups of people do better than other groups in academics.<p>2. People are thinking too much about race when i think immigration is a bigger factor. Children of people from African countries excel in US schools too.<p>For those interested, you may want to look into studies relating to the &#x27;immigrant paradox in the US&#x27; to learn more.<p>EDIT: just to clarify something: I&#x27;m all for immigration and I wish the current administration wasn&#x27;t so anti-immigrant. This country has prospered from the work of immigrants and I absolutely think non-immigrants should compete with immigrants instead of acting entitled and pretending like some immigrants took their good jobs. Just because you were born on the right soil doesn&#x27;t mean you deserve a better chance at getting a job. And immigrants pay taxes too.')
