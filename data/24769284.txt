I guess the radiation doesn&#x27;t affect your whole body when you&#x27;re walking down the street and you get close to a cellular tower (you get pretty damn close to them with 5G cells), or say when you take a crowded subway and someone&#x27;s making a call right next to you (oh and the phone will likely amp up its radiation power in there to be able to hop from tower to tower and maintain a connection in a moving cage of metal). Just two examples out of a million<p>Edit: how am I dismissing your point? I literally just addressed it. And get off your high horse, as though it is completely wacky to consider that something that permeates your environment could possibly have harmful effects on your body')
