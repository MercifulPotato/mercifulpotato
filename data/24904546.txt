It’s a vicious cycle, particularly in predominantly-Republican&#x2F;Southern states. There’s very, very, very little support for public education at a state level — or even nationally; I mean, our goddamn Secretary of Education is Betsy DeVos, who advocates for charter schools to a degree that is frankly sickening when the reality is that they are, on average, <i>shit</i> for the success of a community.<p>It’s gross, and has very recent racist roots. I went to high school with kids whose parents founded “white flight” private schools in my city.<p>It’s not that GP is racist, or something — but to deny the connection between race and public education in the US would be silly at best and malicious at worst (see, for example, Fox News&#x2F;aforementioned DeVos)')
