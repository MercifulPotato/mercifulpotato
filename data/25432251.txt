I think the definition of friendly should include being able to afford decent space to live. I could imagine that for a young well off Chinese or Indian engineer many cultural aspects such as food and being around many members of your community would be preferable in the Bay Area certainly. But Houston is of the most foreign born cities in the US and for less skilled immigrants their pay check will go much further in Texas.')
