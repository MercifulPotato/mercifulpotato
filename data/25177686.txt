My point was that at a personal level, I had every reason to use IPv6 and it was only a matter of whether it&#x27;s provided, thus I started using it immediately after it was made available. However, speaking of the Wayland migration, I have personal reasons for staying on X and not to run Wayland in the foreseeable future, which is why I said my migration to Wayland is probably going to be much slower, not faster, than my migration to IPv6.')
