If people are actually violent, we have clear laws to deal with those actions.<p>Why outlaw threats and fighting words then?  They aren&#x27;t violence.<p>Some of us want to stop easily predictable violence before it gets to the point of actual violence.<p>&gt;If the argument is that certain beliefs shouldn&#x27;t be allowed because they could be construed as &quot;inspiring violence&quot;, then I&#x27;d love to hear about how tolerant you are towards Islam&#x27;s idea of jihad or countless others who believe violence is justified in circumstances that you disagree with.<p>It is curious that you use Islam as your example here.  Various religions preach violence.  The Old Testament establishes the death penalty for people who break the Sabbath.  What matters is the actual practice and how likely they are to inspire violence.  The QAnon conspiracies are more dangerous in this regard than thousand plus year old religions.')
