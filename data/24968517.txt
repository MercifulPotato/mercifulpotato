A Stint comes under the &#x27;bijzondere bromfiets&#x27; category, the same as a Segway (which remains legal on Dutch roads). Each individual model of vehicle in this category has to be specifically approved by the government for use on the roads.<p>After the 2018 accident (in which the brakes failed for an unknown reason), the Stint lost its specific approval. Officially there wasn&#x27;t any effect on any other vehicle in the category, though I can imagine that it might have made the government more reluctant to approve new models- no electric folding scooters have yet been approved.<p>In the meantime, I think the best option is a folding bike, electric or otherwise.')
