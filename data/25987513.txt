They most definitely do. That&#x27;s actually one of the simplest non-objections to naked shorting; in the system we have, the short seller must pay the dividend to the person who loaned them the stock. In a naked short, the short seller would pay the dividend to the person who bought the stock.<p>Voting rights don&#x27;t transfer so cleanly; in the current system, a stock lender can&#x27;t vote the loaned shares. The most natural system of naked shorting would prevent the <i>purchaser</i> from voting a share that was sold short, which would produce a difference between shares sold short and other shares.')
