My counterpoint here would be that HTML is a markup language and that the &quot;equivalent to emacs&quot; would be the web browser itself. My issue with that potential position is that the web is implicitly untrusted.<p>That&#x27;s why developers even deign to put up with Electron in the first place, because their app can run with more permissions and, thus, offer better host integration (i.e. &quot;nativeness&quot;).<p>Of course, everyone loves to hate Electron. Who wants to run 6 different Chromium instances? Nobody, apparently! I&#x27;m not the first wise guy to suggest a single-instance approach that combines the performance wins of a shared browser instance with the trust of an Electron application. It&#x27;s painfully obvious that there&#x27;s a golden medium here, but, of course, if it were an easy problem to solve, it would already be solved!')
