In order of practical danger (most to least), they rank like this: Moose, Bear, Cougar, Snakes, ... Wolves.\nPeople are regularly attacked by Moose and fatalities have occurred in the past few decades. People are eaten by bears every few years and injured by bears annually. Cougars present a real danger but they&#x27;re pretty wary of humans so attacks are more a theoretical risk we hear about from reports concerning mountain bikers in Los Angeles. I never heard of anyone being attacked by a wolf nor anyone being concerned about being attacked by a wolf. Same for Coyotes and Foxes.<p>I don&#x27;t hear people suggesting that Moose be killed on sight.')
