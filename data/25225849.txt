That took a lot of futzing around.<p>2. But <i>way</i> less futzing around than I expected for a fully cross-platform application.<p>I still think the idea of Electron (using modern web technologies to develop applications) has merit. It just needs a better implementation (i.e use native webviews rather than shipping an entire browser.)')
