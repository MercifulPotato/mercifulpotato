It feels to me that protesting decades of racial injustice is vastly different than protesting because you didn&#x27;t agree with the outcome of an election?<p>Again, I am Canadian so I am likely missing some local understanding, but I just don&#x27;t understand this comparison.<p>Now that I&#x27;ve thought about this further, another thing to add. If memory serves from the BLM protests, while there was rioting and looting, that was denounced by the majority of the protestors and not the core intent. From what I saw on Wednesday, the rioting and destruction seemed more central to the protest, and I haven&#x27;t seen anything about the majority of the protestors denouncing the violence and destruction of the capital. It&#x27;s possible I did miss this, and if it has been denounced by the majority I do apologize.')
