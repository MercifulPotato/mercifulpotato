Item(by='AnimalMuppet', descendants=None, kids=[25364163], score=None, time=1607542092, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25362751, text='So a lawsuit goes through some filters before it ever gets to the &quot;presenting evidence&quot; stage.<p>One of them is standing.  If I sue Hawaii for not providing trueluk with a beach house, no evidence gets heard.  It gets dismissed because I am not trueluk, nor am I a resident of Hawaii, and therefore I don&#x27;t have standing to bring the suit.  The courts are not going to hear cases where party A files suit, claiming that party B damaged party C.<p>Another is failure to state a claim for which relief can be granted.  If I sue Nebraska for not granting AnimalMuppet an oceanfront villa, I never get to present evidence.  Nebraska has no oceanfront villas to give away, and a court order can&#x27;t make them have any.  (A more typical form for this to take is that some forms of relief are beyond the authority of the court to grant.)<p>Then there&#x27;s... I forget the name of it.  But the complaint is supposed to give an overview of the evidence.  If that claimed evidence, <i>even if true</i>, doesn&#x27;t give reason for the court to grant the requested relief, then the court isn&#x27;t going to bother to listen to the evidence.<p>Most of the Trump (or on behalf of Trump) cases are falling on these hurdles.  It&#x27;s not that the judges are suppressing the evidence.  It&#x27;s that the lawsuits aren&#x27;t even good enough to make it to the point of presenting evidence.<p>Note well:  IANAL.  Some detail and nuance may be missing from this post, but I think it&#x27;s close to right.  Don&#x27;t take  it as legal advice, though, because it&#x27;s not.')
