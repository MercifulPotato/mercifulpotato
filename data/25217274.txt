Item(by='drewbug01', descendants=None, kids=[25217374], score=None, time=1606370101, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25217145, text='&gt; I&#x27;m talking about what we have in front of us.<p>What we have in front of us is a very poorly executed attempt at damage control - over an article that has not been published - and we really must remember that. If we simply accept what Coinbase has published as truth, then it frames everything differently. But we <i>must</i> read what they’ve written as an attempt at controlling the narrative. They’re asking the world to discredit an article that (as you’ve mentioned) hasn’t been published yet. That deserves an extreme amount of scrutiny and skepticism.<p>&gt; You&#x27;re defending the NYT&#x27;s article without even having seen it.<p>I believe you misunderstand my motives. How could I possibly defend an unread article? It’s impossible and illogical.<p>What I have been saying (in more diplomatic language) is that “this smells like a crock of shit from Coinbase,” and I’ve been attempting to illustrate why their own attempt at damage control actually predisposes me to distrust them. It’s an incredibly amateurish PR move on their part, honestly.<p>But I’m also trying to poke holes at the corporate speak, and trying to understand what they’re saying and what they’re <i>not</i> saying.<p>And of course, it’s partly speculation! But what else could it be? They published a spin piece proclaiming innocence regarding the contents of an unpublished article. Of course we’re in the realm of speculation; the whole game started there the moment they published this letter.<p>&gt; their hundreds of others examples of complete disregard to journalistic integrity.<p>Alleging hundreds of examples of a complete disregard to journalistic integrity requires proof, honestly. It’s a pretty hefty claim that I wouldn’t accept at face value (nobody should). If it’s your opinion, that’s fine - but it’s not fact unless you can point to some evidence. Extraordinary claims put the burden of proof on the party making the claims.<p>&gt; But NYT lies. A lot.<p>Friend, this is not enlightened discourse. That’s an opinion, and not a well-substantiated one.')
