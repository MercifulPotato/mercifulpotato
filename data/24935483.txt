I&#x27;m not totally sure if that means I&#x27;m using automatic mapping or not, but I do explicitly tell it which ports should be exposed and which domain they should route to (all my language about this is pretty fuzzy since I haven&#x27;t looked at it in awhile).<p>I don&#x27;t need to dynamically set up the new ports really. I just have a shell script on the server that forwards the ports using ssh forwarding, and those ports probably won&#x27;t ever change.<p>Have you done something similar with an alternative tool? It wouldn&#x27;t break my heart to migrate from traefik to something else, although I do REALLY appreciate how it integrates into docker-compose and how easy it makes letsencrypt cert creation &#x2F; renewal (I didn&#x27;t really like the nginx solutions I was seeing for letsencrypt)')
