They see a lot of text that would normally be covered under NDA, right?<p>I can sign an NDA with my customers, but they&#x27;d still be obligated to get the ok from their customers, and they don&#x27;t want to have that conversation.<p>What business structure, legal structure or approach can you think of to solve the &quot;I can&#x27;t ask for your help because I&#x27;m under NDA&quot; problem?')
