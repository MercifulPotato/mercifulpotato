The general principle of Article III jurisprudence is that you have to demonstrate concrete, particularized harm to bring a case, not generalized, theoretical harm.<p>If your allegation is that your harm arises from &quot;I could have made a killing if I bought and sold the stock at appropriate times,&quot; well that is <i>theoretical</i> harm (especially when you undercut buy alleging that you could have done so on other platforms). You&#x27;d probably have to allege that you <i>attempted</i> to buy (alternatively, sell) the stock and Robinhood prevented you from doing so, but the fact that you signed a contract saying that you acknowledge that Robinhood can prevent you from being certain stocks is going to be a challenging hurdle to overcome.')
