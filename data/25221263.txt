Either hawks or coyotes (not sure; we&#x27;re in the process of setting up cameras) have taken several of our flock. We&#x27;re still figuring out what to do about it.<p>We&#x27;ve tried the broomstick method but it&#x27;s hard. What works best for us is to take a traffic cone, cut off the top of it, mount it upside down, stuff the chicken in it so their head is poking out the bottom, and slit their throat with a very sharp knife. It&#x27;s gruesome and if your family is squeamish it won&#x27;t go well. But they go quick and drain out, so cleaning is easier.')
