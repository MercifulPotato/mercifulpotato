This is nothing new. If anything, the progress has slowed down.<p>Some fabs get closed down&#x2F;rebuilt for a different process, some stay and produce parts that don&#x27;t benefit from higher densities. Last I checked some ICs still get produced in 0.35 um processes. You don&#x27;t need billions of transistors for an opamp.')
