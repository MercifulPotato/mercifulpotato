Item(by='4cao', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607092038, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25298570, text='&gt; I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m pedantically attacking a strawman.<p>Unfortunately I think you are. Note I never wrote anything about the &quot;PRC&quot; that you keep bringing up all the time. It&#x27;s almost as if you were here to defend the feelings of &quot;PRC speakers&quot; from the perceived slight that I failed to give them enough recognition.<p>I stand by my opinion that it&#x27;s easier to switch from traditional to simplified than the other way round. This isn&#x27;t really controversial, it&#x27;s well-established in literature, and follows directly from the fact that simplification was a lossy process: to claim otherwise is tantamount to stating that there wasn&#x27;t really any simplification.<p>However, there was a simplification as a matter of fact, and it did make things simpler as it was supposed to. It was designed to make it relatively easy for everyone to switch from traditional but not necessarily to go the other way. That there are even so many examples you can provide to the contrary is itself a demonstration of some of its failures, which are also well-known and described, but the fact remains that the issues going the intended way are few and far between, and just not comparable to the fact that as part of the simplification, dozens of common characters such as 隻, 製, 劃, and 錶 were blended into semantically unrelated ones: an extra hurdle you have deal with when going back.<p>I could provide more examples, or even make an exhaustive comparison but that would be unlikely to change your opinion, since you are now arguing not against what I said but against some &quot;common claim[s] [...] on English language forums,&quot; whatever that is even supposed to mean, that you decided to associate with me. I&#x27;m sorry to say that due to this I can no longer see it as a discussion in good faith, if it ever was one to begin with.<p>You are entitled to your opinion of course, as I am to mine: if anyone is serious about learning Chinese beyond the basic communication skills, I would advise them to start with traditional characters. If this happens to hurt the feelings of (some) &quot;PRC speakers,&quot; so be it.<p>Let&#x27;s agree to disagree.')
