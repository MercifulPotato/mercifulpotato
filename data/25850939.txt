They sound good, but they feel like cheap plastic, they require an amp to drive them, they have a 1&#x2F;4&quot; jack and need an adapter etc. The HD555s differentiated themselves from 595s by stuffing foam into the ear cup to make them worse (the drivers are the same).<p>I think AirPods Max will end up replacing a lot of this premium market because they&#x27;re almost as good and they categorically win the other bits (wireless, easy sync with apple devices, nice build, etc.)<p>There will always be a small contingent that wants something different, but I think there are probably more people like me that want something better than your average headphones but the design quality that comes from Apple.')
