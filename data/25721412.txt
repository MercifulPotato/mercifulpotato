In fact, if I were in their position I&#x27;d probably do the same thing. The pressure to do something would probably outweigh my suspicions that the bans are ultimately counterproductive.<p>If I were to place blame on something, it&#x27;d have to be the increasing conflation of hosting content with approving or agreeing with said content. E.G. Facebook gets decried as a conservative echo chamber by left leaning people who point at right wing content they find offensive or extreme. And then it gets decried as a leftist echo chamber by right leaning people who see left wing content on the platform they find extreme and objectionable. In reality people should see that Facebook is a platform, and the content on Facebook is made up of individual people&#x27;s views. It&#x27;s a mirror of society. If we see something we don&#x27;t like we should talk to the people we see in the mirror, not ask the mirror to hide them.')
