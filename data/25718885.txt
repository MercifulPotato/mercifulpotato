Following you will encounter (if you continue here) a seemingly-endless thread of posts from \n people claiming to have &quot;no problem&quot; with their cast-iron cookware (e.g., &quot;Just rustled up a dozen eggs for my family   using my granny&#x27;s cast-iron skillet from Custer&#x27;s cooking wagon at Little Big Horn. Wipes clean with a washrag!&quot;).   Best to ignore them. This posting pattern will repeat about twice each year.<p>Buy a cheap teflon skillet at your local store. When it becomes worn and no longer operates flawlessly then buy a new one. Never pay $17 for 17 oz. of &quot;flaxseed oil&quot; that becomes rancid two months later. Save hours of time cooking and cleaning!<p>Best of all, avoid buying a cast-iron boat anchor that you will endlessly <i>try</i> to &quot;season&quot;. &quot;Try&quot; is all you&#x27;ll do, b&#x2F;c <i>nobody</i> knows really what a &quot;properly seasoned* cast-iron pan  is (i.e., there is no science here, folks). If you own cast-iron cookware, throw it away and move into the 21st century: get teflon pans.<p>Cast-iron cookware is a sucker&#x27;s purchase suitable for only one scenario: old cowboy movies depicting cattle drives.')
