If a necessary requirement to build a bridge is to hire a certified Civil Engineer who has undergone the necessary ethics and reliability training, then you have no choice but to pay up for that certification cost. You can&#x27;t outsource that work to Eastern EU or Asia or hire another one willing to &quot;hack&quot; the bridge to deliver it on your tight timeline.<p>On the other hand, if someone takes software reliability seriously, either they are going to burn themselves out to meet the crazy deadlines or are going to &quot;not deliver on time&quot;, in which case they will be replaced by someone who can &quot;get shit done&quot; cheaper and faster.')
