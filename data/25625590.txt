And they&#x27;re ongoing businesses that probably reached that level through advertising and have money now to use for that.<p>But not only are they already advertising but they don&#x27;t if their word-of-mouth&#x2F;public-knowledge presence will last indefinitely, they don&#x27;t know if just word-of-mouth would let them control their image, would stand-up against future competitors ads and so-forth. So, even supposing you could show advertising didn&#x27;t offer any immediate increase in customers, continuing to spend on it doesn&#x27;t seem to me as irrational as it sounds.')
