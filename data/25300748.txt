Item(by='gexla', descendants=None, kids=[25320051], score=None, time=1607076407, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25299600, text='1st date is more about maintaining the level of interest, not raising it. They were interested enough in you to go on a date with maybe just remote correspondence. A quick date is just an extension of that. Maintaining enough interest in a first date will lead to a second. The first two are just like job interviews. You get a ton more information seeing someone face to face than you do with remote correspondence. I can find out more about a person in 5 minutes of meeting than I can in 5 weeks of chatting on a messaging app. It&#x27;s the in-person 1st impression. That impression can&#x27;t be erased with another hour of time with the person.<p>I&#x27;m looking at limiting downside of a meeting while not necessarily raising the ceiling. The downside is more important to me. If I don&#x27;t pass the first impression, then I don&#x27;t want for the person to be stuck with me for an hour following. Just break it off right there, but we&#x27;ll finish our coffee first.')
