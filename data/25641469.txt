The voters knew what they were voting for, which was to keep the status quo with regard to gig economy jobs, and roll back the broad, messy legislation that the state legislature had enacted.<p>Had Prod 22 not passed, jobs would&#x27;ve been lost in other areas. The small fraction of &#x27;full-time&#x27; gig workers would&#x27;ve come out ahead. The much larger majority of part-time gig workers would&#x27;ve lost their side job. Overall, in the end Prop 22 was a wash. We can&#x27;t paper over our lack of viable careers by creating low-skilled jobs that pay the same as jobs requiring a college education. There is no free lunch.')
