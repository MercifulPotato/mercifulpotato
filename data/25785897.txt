So we&#x27;re not counting China or Australia?<p>I also didn&#x27;t say anything about lockdowns specifically. Those are the last resort after travel restrictions, mandatory testing and quarantine for travelers, contact tracing, universal mask-wearing have failed to slow the spread. We didn&#x27;t even try any of that,  did some weakly-observed lockdowns and then said &quot;See? Nothing works! Not our fault!&quot;<p>&gt; good for the economy<p>I said it would have prevented the widespread misery. The economy exists to provide for human wants and needs. It&#x27;s not an end in itself. If we were going to print money (yes I know that&#x27;s a simplistic view of what happened) give it to people to buy food and pay rent.<p>&gt; The only viable approach is to not impoverish those people in the first place, which was an option.<p>Definitely. By doing everything I said above - testing, quarantine, contact-tracing, <i>not denying the existence of the disease in February</i> etc. Instead we did none of the preventive measures, then half-heartedly locked down in a haphazard fashion.<p>If we&#x27;d done nothing, the virus would have run amok and impoverished those people anyway by destroying their industries and we&#x27;d have way more deaths.')
