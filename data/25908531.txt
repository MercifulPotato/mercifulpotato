Imagine if you sat in a room of software engineers and tried to make conclusions about their life views based on their jargon: &quot;I think what they&#x27;re saying is you just need to form a single value store and react to it, dividing life into small composable micro components that are DRY. We can really comprehend how this minimalism impacts engineers...&quot;<p>Language like WSB uses is meant to frustrate outsiders and limit posers. It makes it hard for the media to reprint things that are said, and even if it does, it would be nonsense. That&#x27;s intentional.<p>And yes, there&#x27;s double meanings and jokes to some of this language. Many WSB&#x27;ers comprehend the gambling-esque nature of what they do, and how many of their strategies aren&#x27;t traditionally recommended.')
