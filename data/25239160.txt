Now, it&#x27;s 2-3x per day. Clothing, LPs, pearl milk tea, ...<p>What are you ordering per day?<p>I&#x27;m happy knowing that I can survive not leaving the house if I need to by doing a single bulk online food shop once every two or three weeks. Then I might need the odd delivery for broken light bulbs and things I couldn&#x27;t foresee. I also don&#x27;t need a car at all as there&#x27;s enough shops in walking distance and decent public transport.<p>I second the concerns about the carbon footprint of frequent orders. At the very least, people should try to do bulk orders and avoid buying stuff they don&#x27;t need. Driving around 3 times a day to buy stuff shouldn&#x27;t be the norm either.')
