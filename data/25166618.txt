I don&#x27;t have proof, but it seems like a good place to start.<p>&gt; <i>It&#x27;s an internet comment not a journal article.</i><p>&quot;It&#x27;s the internet so I can say whatever I want regardless of facts&quot; is not a mindset conducive to meaningful conversation. I&#x27;m guessing again that it might be why the people on reddit dismissed you.<p>You might not think that this is important, but, speaking to your complaint that outlets &quot;give this impression that dissent arrises only from ignorance, and I must be some evil, Mr Burns-esque robber baron&quot;, it seems pertinent that the available interpretations for people encountering what you said are that either you didn&#x27;t know that the real number was far lower than what you said or you knew and were intentionally misrepresenting things.')
