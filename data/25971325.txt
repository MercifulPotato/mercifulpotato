That’s why it has been pushing for “cashless” (even after the callous and disastrous demonetization exercise in 2016 that outlawed some currency bill denominations), linking taxpayers with a poorly designed and implemented non-revocable biometric based number (called Aadhaar), pushing for this flawed system to be used everywhere, etc.<p>Next consider that the current regime has a charismatic leader who gets a lot of vociferous support for anything that can be spun into the “anti-terrorism” and “national security” angles.<p>Since cryptocurrencies are only used by terrorists and tax evaders dealing in drugs and such (this is a sarcastic take here, but is believed so completely by the supporters of the government), they must be banned.')
