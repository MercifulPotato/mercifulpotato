This nutter thinks we have time to write some unit tests and also wants to add an authentication module so we know who uploaded what. And somehow he thinks we need to add logging so we can ensure errors can be tracked and debugged. Amazingly he seems to be suggesting that there&#x27;s going to be errors in our process.')
