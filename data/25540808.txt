The female announcement sounds like it was edited. Badly. This might explain the strange verbiage as well (&quot;All buildings&quot; stands out. That particularly phrase, with its inflection, sounds like it originally came from the end of a sentence too). I&#x27;ve heard other people say it sounds like the same voice used by the city during the summer protests or something along those lines.<p>For the purposes of arguing, let&#x27;s say someone got ahold of some municipal evacuation recordings and chopped them up for this. It&#x27;s not likely they had enough phrases to warn people a bomb would be going off in specifically fifteen minutes.<p>EDIT: For anyone curious about other instances of bad edits, listen to the word &quot;this&quot;; there&#x27;s another word before that, and it was cut off: &quot;thi-this area must be evacuated now&quot;. Also, &quot;if you can hear this message, &lt;unnatural pause&gt; evacuate now.&quot; It&#x27;s not likely any professional voiceover person would announce this way, nor would anyone who&#x27;s paid attention to basic edits before consider this passable.<p>If this is all true, I guess the next question to ask is who would have access to those announcements, and who would think to use them? Most people would probably just use some text-to-speech thing unless it was easy&#x2F;they had good reason. I&#x27;m probably overthinking this, though.')
