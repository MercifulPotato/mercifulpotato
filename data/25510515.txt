Signal propogation in air is faster, and with things like beam-forming there&#x27;s big advantages to having multiple sending and receiving points spread apart.<p>So to push speeds in a similar way with a wire you might end up needing a mesh of wires.<p>Power delivery and (relative) protection against signal degredation are, for me at least, the remaining big reasons to wire things in. Speed not so much.')
