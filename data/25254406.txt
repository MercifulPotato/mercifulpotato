Devices are allowed to keep working Widevine L1 working after bootloader unlock (without needing relock), and it does work just fine on Pixels.\n- Some devices clears their key after bootloader unlock, so unlocking means you&#x27;ll never get Widevine L1\n- Some devices have the key tied to being locked, to relocking will work\n- Some devices doesn&#x27;t have restrictions, but have poorly written drivers that need to be hacked around to allow to work on unlocked bootloader<p>And then, there is the extra issue of what streaming apps decide to give you. For instance Netflix will not use Widevine L1 even if it works unless your device is whitelisted. So if you flash a &quot;simple&quot; alternative ROM on a Pixel 5, you still would get only 480p. The ROM needs to lie, and tell it is the original Pixel&#x27;s ROM. (Also Netflix won&#x27;t be listed from PlayStore unless the ROM lies and says the app that yes the bootloader is locked)<p>In my opinion, the biggest vendor lock-in about bootloader unlocking is that you&#x27;ll loose all your data when unlocking, with no way to properly backup your data on stock ROM.')
