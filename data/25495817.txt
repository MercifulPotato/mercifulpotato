So, no, you can&#x27;t blame the WHO there.<p>&gt; Right. He could easily just make decisions without the Democrats using everything in their power to stop him.<p>...Uh okay? Since when has Trump cared what Democrats thought? Again, <i>why did he not attempt to close the South Korean border if he cared so much?</i> I&#x27;ll tell you why: it&#x27;s because Trump was just looking for an excuse to close the border to a country he already didn&#x27;t like. He never cared about the virus, only about his personal agenda.')
