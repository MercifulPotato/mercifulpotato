Things like the &quot;Can we make people more sad or happy by being selective on the feed&quot; experiment facebook did is just one of the many reasons we wanted as pure a social feed as possible. People you know ordered by who&#x27;s posted most recently and a way to traverse their posts if you wanna know a little more. I don&#x27;t think a &quot;Top&quot; algorithm has a place on a social feed, or you end up with satire but in real life.')
