For a large class of problems, by the time I start typing, I know what I&#x27;m going to type.<p>You can get away with a lot in music that you can&#x27;t in code. The first example that comes to mind is &quot;ped simile&quot;, which means &quot;keep using the pedal in a similar style&quot; without prescribing the exact mechanics. There will be exception for different musical phrases, and the performer will interpret this subjectively. You couldn&#x27;t ever write code with &quot;logging simile&quot; in your middleware, and expect the computer to subjectively get the logging correct. Computers are much dumber than performers.<p>A better analogy might have been writing code without ever evaluating it, kinda like you said, and yes. &quot;hammock-driven-development&quot; also comes to mind...')
