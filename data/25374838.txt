Insane days. Had some great engineers we hired in AMS. We were moving the whole source code into a monorepo as well which was another crazy project. I think if we had not had some of the engineers we did at those exact times, we would have not gotten out of it.<p>Problem here with Swift came down to<p>- Apple not dogfooding its own tech . Hell they did not even help us or other major companies like AirBnB and LihnkedIn (We formed a workforce on this problem with them which then forced the download limit to be upped by apple)<p>- Engineers deciding to adopt a language which they thought was great (and turned out not to be at the time) because they did not do the right analysis upfront for such a significant project. &#x27;Wow look at this shiny new cool tool, lets use it&#x27; (Oversimpiification, swift was more pleasant to write with and you could be more productive which was no doubt a factor here)<p>Also, while management at the time didnt care for the remote offices much, I think the AMS team played a critical role in the success here. With the recent layoffs that occurred, I heard that they were fired.<p>Another fun story, we were trying to bring down our build times on our CI builds which were 1hr+ while battling macstadium and their crappy infrastructure with tens&#x2F;hundreds of patches incoming each day.')
