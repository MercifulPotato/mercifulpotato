Sadly, most of us in the Community are actual staunch advocates of free market enterprise and commerce so we cannot do to them what they do to others out of sheer principal.<p>To this day the best exchange in my opinion was BTC-e, it served as the axiom of what we wanted most from an exchange which is to simply work, and despite all the hallmarks of being a massive exit scam they were the most honest of all until it got shutdown in 2017: its very telling the FBI&#x2F;DOJ went after an anonymous Russian (Online only really) based exchange for &#x27;money laundering&#x27; at a time when neither the SEC or the IRS considered Bitcoin &#x27;money&#x27; at all. This was after having jailed Ross Ulbrich for Life plus 40 for simply hosting a website and acting as middle man and HSBC was caught red handed laundering money for the mexican drug cartels and they walked away with a fine.')
