On the OSM.org website you can use Graphhopper or OSRM routing engines. Both are not &quot;tech demos&quot;, but proper real routing engines for real world use. They are hosted by volunteers, so you shouldn&#x27;t rely on them to be free for everyone for ever. If you want to build a business on them, both OSRM &amp; Graphhopper are open source &amp; self hostable')
