Whether we <i>need</i> to understand this is a judgement call. But v2 opens a different “failure to understand” modality: “getResult” is so blackboxed that the <i>only</i> thing it really accomplished is indirection, without improving readability.<p>I love <i>Clean Code</i>, but I think it sometimes prematurely favors naming a new function and the resultant indirection.')
