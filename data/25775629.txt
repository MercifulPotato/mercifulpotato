Lots of the harm comes from the fact they&#x27;re not legal and cheaply available. For example, heroin, I would say nearly all the harm comes from the fact it&#x27;s not legal. Overdoses are prevented because they can happen in safe places where people will notice. I&#x27;ve even been told of a story where people thought someone was having an overdose and they were told to go home because they couldn&#x27;t risk calling an ambulance, I was told this story by one of the people telling the person to go home, so I believe it. The crime that comes from heroin comes from people trying to make money to buy heroin. Considering tobacco is more addictive, and we have way less crime to buy tobacco, it seems logical to assume crime would drop if drug addicts didn&#x27;t have to spend 20-30 a day on drugs. Then you have the violence and anti-social behaviour which for most drugs is non-existent.')
