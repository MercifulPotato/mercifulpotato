I haven&#x27;t heard the kids complain about the rest of the seating. I&#x27;ve sat in the middle row a couple times and being tall-ish it wasn&#x27;t as good  as the front but still pretty decent.<p>The ride itself is great, and its not noisy. There&#x27;s an active noise cancellation system, not sure if it does anything as I don&#x27;t think I can turn it off to compare.')
