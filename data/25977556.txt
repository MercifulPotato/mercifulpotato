Same for other relatively small islands. Place like EU with its own national, often competing goals can&#x27;t be effectively 100% locked out. That&#x27;s what happens when you have a federation with strong independent parts.<p>Not that I disagree with your points, they should be the baseline for any serious covid response. Lockdown measures have so far always been watered down by politicians due to pressures from business. Business is this time acting staggeringly idiotically, prolonging the situation due to fear of complete shutdown. At the end, they get hurt much more.<p>Some local info - Swiss are faring quite well, while not having that many things closed, ie ski resorts work (since its outdoor activity). Not restricting traveling within country. France on the other hand is going again mental (libert√© has long abandoned the place of revolution, but that&#x27;s happen when you go extreme left in real world). Closing many basic things, but ie annual sales in shopping centres were going very strong till today.<p>I mean how fucking stupid you can be, close outdoor business giving salaries to significant part of population, and on the other side allowing large indoor gatherings of people so they can buy cheap clothes and stores can clean their stock. Even now they only close those &gt; 20,000m2 surface.<p>Outdoor activities also keep many people sane and in good health, which at this point is becoming significant negative side effect of this whole situation. Most people I know, including myself, the fitness level declined in last year. That is tightly coupled with mental health. At least spring will fix things up a bit (looking forward to run in the park again, more sun, less rain).')
