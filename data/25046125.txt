This is a new type of vaccine.<p>&gt; They have a lot of data from previous forms of this type of things suggesting it is safe.<p>How does this make sense, given this is the first mRNA vaccine? The expression &quot;previous forms of this type of things&quot; is as blurry as it can get.<p>&gt; We know the that injected &quot;things&quot; break down very quickly in the body, which again makes us believe there won&#x27;t be any long term problems.<p>Heavy metals are &quot;things&quot;, and when you inject them in the body, they don&#x27;t break down, but stay there and slowly kill you.<p>&gt; Of course in the end who knows. There could be something, and we may not know for 10 years.<p>This is not the attitude I&#x27;d take on something that potentially hundreds of millions of people will be subjected to. I&#x27;m aware that you can&#x27;t ever prove something to be safe. I want to know if the specific risk brought about by mRNA vaccines are well understood or not, and why.<p>&gt; On the other hand, we know that Covid is killing a large number of people right now.<p>It doesn&#x27;t.<p>&gt; We have enough data to confidently state that the long term adverse effects are overall less bad than Covid.<p>Splendid, I&#x27;m not going to ask for sources then, because I like the tone of your voice so much.')
