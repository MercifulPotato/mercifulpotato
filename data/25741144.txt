Item(by='jessaustin', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610415364, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25737828, text='According to an Economist&#x2F;YouGov poll [0], two thirds of Democrats thought Russia tampered with vote tallies. Maybe they weren&#x27;t taking close enough direction from their &quot;elites&quot;? It seems more likely they were taking a great deal of direction from e.g. Maddow. But this quibbling is silly. Democrats didn&#x27;t like the last election, so they subjected us to three years of conspiracy-theory bullshit. Republicans didn&#x27;t like this election, so they sat by and golf-clapped while a few thousand Q-anon whackos defecated in the halls of the capitol building. Of course I wish no one had died, but Republicans kill a lot more people than that every day (and probably did that day too) by not wearing masks during a respiratory pandemic. Republicans like killing; Democrats like bullshit. I don&#x27;t like either of them.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;today.yougov.com&#x2F;topics&#x2F;politics&#x2F;articles-reports&#x2F;2018&#x2F;03&#x2F;09&#x2F;russias-impact-election-seen-through-partisan-eyes" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;today.yougov.com&#x2F;topics&#x2F;politics&#x2F;articles-reports&#x2F;20...</a>')
