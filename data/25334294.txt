We had three colleges in the area so it was perfect for recruiting healthy males between the ages of 18-35.<p>They came out with some advertising showing they paid college kids more money in six months than the state did in tuition support at all three colleges combined. It was enough to get the state&#x27;s attention and got them involved in how they both could be doing more for the state&#x27;s college system. I know at one point the company was donating a LOT of money to all three colleges Pharma school and hiring a lot of their students. It provided them a nice pipeline of talent.<p>EDIT: The company was out of North Dakota. All the stuff we tested was already FDA approved. Most of the studies were companies looking to get less expensive generic forms of those drugs into the market. Here&#x27;s some of the tests I was in:<p>- Naproxen<p>- Sudafed (it was a nasal variety for decongestion)<p>- Diclofenac<p>- Zinc Acetate<p>- Doxycycline')
