Its purpose is to bind strongly to the substrate it&#x27;s on and provide a better surface for that shiny coat you so desire to adhere onto. Primer and language bindings alike.</i><p>Maybe it isn&#x27;t it&#x27;s purpose, but the original post claimed that it was impossible for it to be difference, which is certainly false.')
