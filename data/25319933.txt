They would instead give people a means-tested tax credit for buying books and call it a day&quot;.<p>I think this sentiment applies to much more than libraries or infrastructure. Laws against wiretapping and opening postal letters are vestiges of the past. They never got updated when communication moved digital. They would not be passed today. They are kept on the books only because of inertia. If they didn&#x27;t exist in the first place, no government would create them in 2020.')
