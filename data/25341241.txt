None of the things that enable this interaction on HN exist without pollution.<p>&gt; There is no reason the broader population should have to suffer from the externalities of profit seeking companies.<p>Sure—the reason is that nearly everyone uses the things that are produced as a byproduct of this pollution. And these industries are highly competitive. Just as rising prices of crude oil quickly get passed along to consumers, so do the rising costs of environments compliance. Rising environmental standards also accelerate the exodus of manufacturing jobs to places like China with less stringent regulations.<p>&gt; What other countries are doing in this regard is irrelevant. The U.S. is largely considered the leader of the free world. We need to start acting like it and set examples the rest of the world can follow.<p>Governance isn’t an exercise in moral posturing. It’s about making various trade-odds in a finite world governed by brutal laws of physics and economics. When you increase pollution standards, you save some lives, but increase people’s cost of living, and push more jobs to China. How other countries make these trade-offs is highly relevant.')
