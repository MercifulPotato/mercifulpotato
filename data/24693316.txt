I&#x27;ve seen rising anti-Western (and anti-asian btw) sentiment across the continent, especially throughout sub-saharan Africa. As a matter of full disclosure, I think it&#x27;s a problem. Africa was the last place in the world where ethno-nationalism hadn&#x27;t swept through, and the past year or so has seen it sweep the continent with a vengeance. Even white South Africans, I think, would admit that there are serious problems in this regard. Panafricanism is a thing, to ignore it and say it doesn&#x27;t exist is just sticking your head in the sand. (Pan-Africanism in the traditional sense is not bad btw. It would even be helpful. I&#x27;m talking about the brand of pan-Africanism that demands a harmful kind of ethno-exclusivity. No one has an issue with the pan-africanist tenets of strengthening links between African nations and inviting slave descendants to move to Africa. Which I support as keys to Africa&#x27;s development.)<p>Acephal is also mistaken in thinking young Africans do not think like American blacks. Their exposure to the West, and unfortunately, to the US, has given many first hand experience in, for instance, police behavior. The ones who return to Africa to tell the tale are, if anything, more radical than American blacks.<p>The good news is that I think the rising ethno-nationalism in Africa is very much a reaction to the rising ethno-nationalism in the rest of the world. If it could be checked elsewhere, it may tamp down in Africa as better stories about treatment make it back to the populations of the various nations in Africa. Right now, the stories of what happens outside of Africa have turned decidedly negative. That&#x27;s the issue driving sentiment in my opinion.')
