Some users will happily consider “25th December” to be a date, without any year, because it might be the name of a folder in which they store their Christmas stuff. More seriously, genealogists or historians may want to record “25th December” (again without a year) as the date of a photograph because they can clearly see it was taken on <i>a</i> Christmas, they just don’t know which one. The naive developer would just slap a DateTime type onto the system and feel good about having avoided malformed input.')
