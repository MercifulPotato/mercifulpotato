It&#x27;s even worse, with printed materials.<p>Things move so quickly, in tech, that something is out of date, almost as soon as it&#x27;s published.<p>I&#x27;ve been training for years, and setting up a syllabus&#x2F;course is a big job. Often, my subject matter may be &quot;old hat,&quot; by the time I am ready to give the course.<p>That often means that I don&#x27;t teach &quot;bleeding edge&quot; stuff. When I take those courses, they tend to be mighty &quot;scruffy,&quot; with ill-prepared instructors, and lots of &quot;Well, it worked this morning...&quot; stuff.<p>The same goes for topical material in walkthroughs and tutorials. If they are relevant, they are likely to be &quot;scrappy.&quot; If they are good, there&#x27;s a fairly high degree of confidence that they will be out of date by the time I see them.<p>Nonetheless, I have gotten fairly adept at translating &quot;dated&quot; stuff to my current circumstances.')
