I think the picture and local dimming zones are subjectively amazing for the price. I know OLED is way better for $1k more, but I love the picture on the TV. I honestly don’t feel I’m missing out that much. The dimming zones are far superior to the local dimming on Vizio TVs at the same price, which are laggy and quite prone to bloom.')
