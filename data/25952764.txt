And in particular these folks banded together to use call options to amplify their money (and risk) as they purchased stock to drive the price up.<p>The only thing new is that rather than a few dozen wealthy people coordinating behind closed doors to use a ton of money to cause the short squeeze, it was a ton of small time investors coordinating in public, plus a bunch of others hopping on board when they saw what was going on.')
