Item(by='tagrun', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609968919, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25661819, text='I&#x27;ll give you that it&#x27;s a rather long passing, but title and the overall news article is actually about Palmer&#x27;s work, and Childs paper is &quot;in passing&quot; in the sense that it&#x27;s a relevant recent work that parallels Palmer&#x27;s work ---I don&#x27;t believe Childs preprint would be newsworthy on its own.<p>Regarding the editorial &quot;key qoute&quot;, if you read the preprint <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;2011.06571.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;2011.06571.pdf</a> you can see this conflates two things: the mapping of nonlinear differential equations onto BECs, and the emulation of a BEC on a typical quantum computer (which introduces additional limitations). Note that the latter step isn&#x27;t truly necessary, because one can use a BEC directly to do it.<p>Third, I&#x27;m sorry about how you feel about it, but I stand by my dissent that this can be a coherent statement:<p>&gt; and after reading the article more carefully, I&#x27;m still not sure how QC has any effect on the chaotic nature of non-linear diffeqs . All I see in here is that they&#x27;re trying to map non-linear diffeqs to linear systems via approximations so they can run it on a QC.<p>which mischaracterizes Palmer&#x27;s work at best. I don&#x27;t believe anyone would be happy to have their work (be it physics or software development) disparaged like this, would you?')
