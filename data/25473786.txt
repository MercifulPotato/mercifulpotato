You land on a Google page. Even the URL says google.com.<p>Yes. <i>So what</i>? If I, from the AMP page, click on a link, I&#x27;ll go to the full site (I just checked this on CNN&#x27;s amp pages). Ads and analytics are still supported.<p>&gt; If you swipe, for example, you end up on the next Google property ^W^W that is a news item that Google displays on its own domain.<p>This didn&#x27;t happen when I just attempted it.<p>&gt; And AMP may provably drive traffic away:<p>If you read the article, they say that they got more clicks and pageviews, but fewer conversions, likely because they hadn&#x27;t spent time optimizing the AMP site for conversions.')
