Which means you can create different services for example a zone. Like &quot;myservice-eu-west1a&quot;.<p>The problem is that a pod has <i>no easy way</i> to know what topology it is in to make the choice to go to myservice-eu-west1a. The feature for getting topology labels through the downward api is not there! A pod has no idea where its scheduled!<p>The only way to find out is to ask the kubernetes api, but this requires rbac, a client, libraries etc.. unacceptable! Guess what linkerd does for you?<p>I am glad for the feature linkerd offers as it solves a problem and I can see the benefit of perhaps doing latency based routing as well on top of this.<p>It just ticks me off we need something complex to do something simple: keep workloads to their own zone depending on where they are.')
