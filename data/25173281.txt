A lot of &quot;we fixed voting&quot; systems start with the premise that we know the information of everyone who&#x27;s legally able to vote. We don&#x27;t, and getting that information is very hard and at odds with making it easy to register, and subsequently vote.<p>If you don&#x27;t have that list, then there&#x27;s nothing preventing you from padding the votes with fake people. You can try and implement some way of tracing the votes back to people but, first of all see point 1 up there (oh your phone number&#x2F;email address&#x2F;home address changed&#x2F;was misspelled&#x2F;you&#x27;re homeless&#x2F;you&#x27;re a nomad) and second, you very likely break secret voting.<p>FWIW there is no perfect voting system--that&#x27;s the core problem w&#x2F; this discussion. We have to choose:<p>- Do we have a citizen ID (there&#x27;s a whole ball of wax here, primarily what happens if someone steals or you forget&#x2F;lose your ID)<p>- Do we think some people w&#x2F; a citizen ID still shouldn&#x27;t vote (17 year olds, the incarcerated, etc.)<p>- Do we create a potential link between people and their votes<p>- Do we allow people to not vote<p>- Do we require people to register before voting<p>- Do we allow people to verify their vote was counted<p>- Do we allow people to verify their vote was counted correctly (unclear how this would work)<p>- Do we allow people to vote remotely<p>- Do we create a paper trail<p>- Do we allow people to fix problems with their ballots<p>- Do we require people to sign their ballots, and do we require signature verification<p>Many of these things are at odds with each other, and depending on how you flip the bits, different political interests will win out.<p>That&#x27;s the second reason this is such a nerd snipe. It really, really feels like this is a technical problem but it isn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s political, cultural, and societal. You&#x27;re not gonna fix this with an app or an algorithm. If&#x2F;When we do fix this I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll be involved but, the reason will be multipartisan, multicultural consensus that we need to move forward.')
