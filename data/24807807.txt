Item(by='squarefoot', descendants=None, kids=[24807846], score=None, time=1602915182, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24807506, text='That video was taken from far distance because the drone had to operate unnoticed in enemy territory; pretty sure that they had much better optics and transmission capabilities even back then, but it had to be very far from action. The distance can be roughly measured, if the bullets speed is known, by counting the time between the shots audio (assuming it&#x27;s properly synced) and when they&#x27;re seen hitting the area.<p>Today police drones could look at your backyard from a few dozen meters, and the same qualified immunity that let them execute people in the streets would prevent you to do anything against them; those drones wouldn&#x27;t even need to hide themselves.<p>ps. Upvoted because I noticed you were downvoted, probably by a flesh drone programmed to quench any reference to Wikileaks and the Assange cause, without whom that video would never become public.')
