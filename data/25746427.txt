Off the top of my head, Greece and Italy.  Just read the news regularly.  The Euro has devastated the economies of several countries, and the fallout has been slowly building for the last decade.  You don&#x27;t have youth unemployment over 50%, lack of opportunity, lack of investment, and lack of control over your future without it having far-reaching implications.  The current state of things doesn&#x27;t leave much (if any) opportunity for this to be corrected.  They are permanently indebted.  Exiting the Eurozone and reverting to national currencies is pretty much the only answer to fix their economies.<p>Italy has a lot of very productive industries.  But they can&#x27;t compete with Germany and other northern European countries while the scales are tipped firmly against them due to their currencies being tied together via the Euro.  A freely floating currency would correct that and make Italy a very promising place to invest in and export from.<p>Greece is a different story, and it is not entirely blameless.  It should never have been allowed to join the Euro.  But the cause of its economic woes is the same: its currency is tied to stronger economies with which it can&#x27;t hope to complete, and that economic imbalance has caused complete devastation of its economy.')
