They stood up elastic cloud in AWS of all places. Way to make sure Amazon gets 100% market share in your home market.<p>Then they get all bent out of shape because Amazon used the license the way it was intended, but elastic didn&#x27;t want THEM to use it like that. Everybody else was fine but Amazon doing it is somehow wrong.<p>I call it fair weather open source. &quot;I can&#x27;t do this myself, and I don&#x27;t want anyone else to do it for me... I just want to be remembered for doing it.&quot; Like it&#x27;s possible to have a product nobody can use but everyone will remember.')
