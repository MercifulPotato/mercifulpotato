It includes hosted Kubernetes solutions, application unrelated to Kubernetes (which may run on top, think Postgres), deployment options, built-in metrics, and lots of other random things. It&#x27;s as if someone googled Kubernetes and copy &amp; pasted and first 20 pages without any understanding or theme. This looks like some PR person hired a a low-cost freelance writer to &quot;write something about Kubernetes because it&#x27;s hot and we need traffic, deliver it tomorrow&quot; - It&#x27;s like someone writing &quot;50+ useful Python packages&quot; and just listing 50 completely random packages.<p>I&#x27;ve been operating Kubernetes clusters for years now, and most of these are completely irrelevant to me, dead, or I&#x27;ve never heard of them. Don&#x27;t equate bad lists with complexity.')
