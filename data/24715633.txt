The reason COVID hasn&#x27;t been so bad is because of all the special preventative measures.<p>How does this square up with the fact that places without any lockdowns, like Sweden and South Dakota, still have fewer deaths per capita than places like New York, Peru, Belgium and Spain?<p>A recent study found no correlation between lockdowns and reduced fatality; social distancing is the thing that has an effect: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jpost.com&#x2F;israel-news&#x2F;social-distancing-more-important-than-lockdowns-in-covid-19-fight-tau-644754" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jpost.com&#x2F;israel-news&#x2F;social-distancing-more-imp...</a>.<p>“We found that an early implementation of social distancing is the most significant factor, with a very high correlation to the mortality rate,” said the researchers. “Countries that responded quickly with social distancing measures – not necessarily with a tight lockdown – ultimately emerged from the first outbreak with better results. In contrast, no correlation was found between mortality data and the severity and&#x2F;or length of the lockdown. Even in Sweden, a country that never imposed a lockdown, we can see that the early decrease in mobility, starting in March, was manifested in the mortality rate. Our study is based purely on observations and does not relate to the premises of any existing epidemiological model. We show that the spread of the pandemic can be prevented by quickly implementing basic measures of social distancing – without a rigorous lockdown.”')
