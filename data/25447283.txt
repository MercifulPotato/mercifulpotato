Cracks in in will be weak points. Your tire is thinner on the sides then the working face.<p>Ozone in the atmosphere react with the tire compound and weakens it, leading to cracks forming which exposes more and more area deeper in the tire body to ozone. increased area increases chance of reaction.<p>A tire that has recently been inflated to the upper limit of it&#x27;s pressure range making stiff is traveling at 70 miles an hour, suddenly there is a spike in pressure as if hits a bump.
