Reading the discourse thread he links, I&#x27;&#x27;m guessing one of Richard Feldman&#x27;s recommendations could be to flatten the structure. I&#x27;m sure there are times when that&#x27;s no better than 14 lines to update 1 field, but it should probably be used more than it is.<p>As for why his lenses code can be better than the 14 lines, you&#x27;re exactly right, it can be extracted into its own file making it an easy-to-use API made of stable code. That lenses code is simple, though unusual at first glance. Once it&#x27;s an established pattern in your codebase it&#x27;ll take 5 seconds to grock an entire file of it.')
