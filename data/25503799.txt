Not only does it flash, but every 10 minutes or so it interferes with your whole media system, with some voice stating that you need to fill up on washer fluid.<p>Turns out your washer fluid level is actually OK, seems to be some sensor error, or bug in the software.<p>Problem is - you can&#x27;t touch the car, mechanically or the software. Any modifications will essentially brick the car.<p>Only way to get this error fixed, is to bring the car to some Apple repair shop, where a tech will fix the problem in 30 seconds, and bill you $1000 for the work.<p>Other than the bricking part, that&#x27;s the kind of stuff farmers are experiencing with quite expensive machines.')
