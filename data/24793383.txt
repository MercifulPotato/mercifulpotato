Companies pay the employee who left the review if they can identify them. $1,000 to the former employee to take the review down, along with an NDA.<p>2. Companies push Glassdoor to validate the reviewer was actually employed by the company. Some reviewers may not respond to Glassdoor’s confirmation requests, resulting in the review being taken down.<p>3. Companies’ HR or Talent Acquisition employees write reviews themselves <i>and</i> promote internally to other happy employees that adding “honest reviews” will help accelerate the company. Basically indirectly fishing for 5 star reviews.<p>Any startup with more than ~300 total employees (current + former) generally has attention to their Glassdoor ratings. A local company I know of is a huge offender to removing negative reviews <i></i>and<i></i> flooding their page with 4.5&#x2F;5 star reviews in quick succession.')
