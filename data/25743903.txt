We still need to interact with our lives, and many of the abstractions help us do that.<p>And they are, and they might help you, but trying to ask scientific or metaphysical quæstions about it, is an exercise in futility.<p>&gt; BTW if you just replace the word &quot;delusion&quot; with &quot;abstraction&quot; you&#x27;ll probably see how it makes a lot of sense. Every abstraction is a delusion by definition, is it not? Because the abstracted thing doesn&#x27;t really exist in the same way as source observation?<p>The difference is of course that some abstractions have rigorous definitions rather than purely based on human intuition, and then attempting to reason about them rigorously, quickly leading to reductions to the absurd such as here.<p>The quæstion raised in <i>The Ship of Theseus</i> assumes that there even be a meaningful, rigorous distinction between “same identity” an “different identity” — I reject that and attempting to reason about this with actual logic and empiricism is ridiculous.<p>It is as foolish as trying to have a scientific investigation about who is beautiful and who isn&#x27;t.')
