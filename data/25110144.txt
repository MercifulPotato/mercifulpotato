Painting the whole ethnicity&#x2F;nationality with the same brush is the textbook definition of racism even though we like to hide it behind &quot;not all Roma are like this&quot;.<p>&gt; These ones live in shanty towns, do not send their young children to school even in places where school is mandatory under 15 thus perpetuate the cycle of illiteracy. Is this what educated people here are defending? really? This kids aren&#x27;t even given a chance to succeed.<p>Yes. Gypsies are very insular and keep their culture, but I feel like that is too convenient of an explanation that people are using. In my opinion governments should make a better attempt at integrating them into the education system. Literacy is key into helping them overcome the gadjo vs roma mentality and I don&#x27;t think that people and communities do enough to overcome this problem.')
