Apple is using TSMC&#x27;s 5nm process (they don&#x27;t have their own fabs), which is better than Intel&#x27;s in-house fabs, so it&#x27;s <i>Intel&#x27;s</i> vertical integration which is <i>hurting</i> them compared to the non-vertically integrated Apple.<p>Also, the answer to &quot;is this only possible because of vertical integration&quot; is always <i>no</i>. Intel and Microsoft regularly coordinate to make hardware and software work together. Intel is one of the largest contributors to the Linux kernel, even though they don&#x27;t &quot;own&quot; it. Two companies coordinating with one another can do anything they could do as an individual company.<p>Sometimes the efficiency of this is lower because there are communication barriers and isn&#x27;t a single chain of command. But sometimes it&#x27;s higher because you don&#x27;t have internal politics screwing everything up when the designers would be happy with outsourcing to TSMC because they have a competitive advantage, but the common CEO knows that would enrich a competitor and trash their internal investment in their own fabs, and forces the decision that leads to less competitive products.')
