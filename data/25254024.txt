Or is it because you have the impression that people that are passionate about something have an easier time monetizing it, and your ventures are failing because of it?<p>Also, are you sharing this to get some thoughts on the matter? Or to get views for the post and potentially get people to subscribe to your newsletter?<p>The fact that it&#x27;s even a question is a big hint of what&#x27;s wrong with chasing business above everything: you might not even know which of your interactions are genuine anymore.
