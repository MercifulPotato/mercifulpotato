Item(by='flubert', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609893237, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25649261, text='&gt;I think many comments here miss the point.<p>Is there an area of study that looks at how people discuss things?  Including, but not limited to misunderstanding&#x2F;miscommunication dealing with things analogies, thought experiments, and the like?  So that you could make predictions.  For example, since &quot;story A&quot; used analogies &quot;B and C&quot;, then we&#x27;d expect ~50% of the commentators on said article will fixate on B, since that is their favorite topic, and they never tire of discussing B, even if it is purely incidental the point of the article.  So you could potentially tailor your article help minimize misunderstandings.  Micro-sociology or maybe some sort of specific behavioral psychology?<p>&gt;Iâ€™d be grateful for any references to articles on this topic that can be understood by non-experts.<p>I liked:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bayes.wustl.edu&#x2F;etj&#x2F;articles&#x2F;cmystery.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bayes.wustl.edu&#x2F;etj&#x2F;articles&#x2F;cmystery.pdf</a><p>&quot;...From his reply to EPR, we find that Bohr&#x27;s position was like this: &#x27;You may decide of you own free will, which experiment to do. If you do experiment E1 you will get Result R1. If you do E2 you will get R2. Since it is fundamentally impossible to do both on the same system, and the present theory correctly predicts the results of either, how can you say that the theory is incomplete? What more can one ask of a theory?&#x27;<p>While it is easy to understand and agree with this on the epistemological level, the answer that I and many others would give is that we expect a physical theory to do more than merely predict experimental results in the manner of an empirical equation; we want to come down to Einstein&#x27;s ontological level and understand what is happening when an atom emits light, when a spin enters a Stern-Gerlach magnet, etc. The Copenhagen theory, having no answer to any question of the form: &#x27;What is really happening when - - -?&#x27;, forbids us to ask such questions and tries to persuade us that it is philosophically naive to want to know what is happening. But I do want to know, and I do not think this is naive; and so for me QM is not a physical theory at all, only and empty mathematical shell in which a future theory may, perhaps, be built.&quot;<p>...and...<p>&quot;The Chaotic Ball: An Intuitive Analogy for EPR Experiments&quot;<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;quant-ph&#x2F;9611037" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;quant-ph&#x2F;9611037</a><p>...but that probably only raises more questions, rather than providing answers.')
