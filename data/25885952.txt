I&#x27;m a high school student (and I noticed there&#x27;s more of us in the comments). I have a year and a half of high school remaining, but I realized I&#x27;m not really pushing myself recently, and I&#x27;m very unsure what path should I take. I know that &quot;everyone&#x27;s path is different&quot;, but I still wanted to ask for general recommendations, what options do I have for growth?<p>Specifically, there&#x27;s two key points I&#x27;m considering:<p>Learning more tech: most of the work I did so far was web, Python backend + quite basic JS frontends. I&#x27;ve been contemplating learning kotlin for android, some ML or learning something low-level (that didn&#x27;t sound very intimidating though). What will I benefit from the most?<p>Getting a part-time job&#x2F;internship, something I can do whole studying, to get a sense of reality and some money. I&#x27;m not aspiring to be an entrepreneur (yet), none of my projects were built with a business model in mind at all. Where should I look? Linkedin shows mostly stuff for graduates&#x2F;etc. What pay should I expect (i have absolutely no idea)? Is remote a bad idea?')
