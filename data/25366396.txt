Item(by='cambalache', descendants=None, kids=[25367812], score=None, time=1607553944, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25365619, text='&gt;  I&#x27;m not the one suggesting there are universal truths here.<p>I never talked about truth, I talked about freedoms. I think you should revise your definition of &quot;universal&quot; it seems you dont understand it. The whole idea of my original point is that you cannot say OK this is an universal(for everybody) agreed upon freedom  but.... No but here, restricting freedom to an specific subset of the population who has not commited a crime is a big no-no. I mean, did you actually read the post, it&#x27;s bone chilling:<p>&gt; Limiting the reach of borderline content and prominently surfacing authoritative information are important ways we protect people from problematic content that doesnâ€™t violate our Community Guidelines.<p>They acknowledge the content doesnt violate any community guideline(even less any law) and yet they want to &quot;protect&quot; us from it. Sorry, I will be on the other side every single time. If that means to be next to Alex Jones, so be it.<p>Youtube says: &quot; For example, while problematic misinformation represents a fraction of 1% of what&#x27;s watched on YouTube in the U.S., we know we can bring that number down even more. &quot; This is what I oppose to, to selectively curtailing universal rights. I dont care about any pedantic discussion on semantics, I will gift you them all.<p>&gt;  Laws against upskirt photos are one example.<p>Same case with fictional animated child pornography, this is not a settled issue(<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hindustantimes.com&#x2F;world&#x2F;top-us-court-rules-upskirt-photos-legal&#x2F;story-st5kvkBDeMhryT26fW0XHI.html)(https:&#x2F;&#x2F;abovethelaw.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;11&#x2F;how-do-we-still-not-have-laws-against-upskirts&#x2F;)" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hindustantimes.com&#x2F;world&#x2F;top-us-court-rules-upsk...</a>. Let me repeat that the point is not that. You could still argue for years what it is the best course of action. What you cannot do is selectively enforce those rights or prohibitions against certain sets of the population.That is the problem, that is the violation of the universality of a right, Not the complexity of a legislation.<p>&gt; So do you know agree that there are &quot;buts&quot; on freedom?<p>If you call freedom do whatever the hell you want , yes there are buts. If you say freedom as universally granted rights, &quot;But&quot; let&#x27;s stop this group of having them. There is no valid buts, sorry. I wont never ever be on favor of censoring people who has not commited any violation by expressing their points.<p>&gt; I have the right to vote and have my vote counted. These Youtube videos are trying to invalidate my vote from being counted.<p>This a pretty weird, and frankly out of character for you, argument. Some loonies doubting the election, asking for recall or even a repeat are not violating your right at all. I am dumbfounded for such a jump of logic here anyway. Any decision about the election will be taken by the authorities not random youtubers.  Go search in youtube &quot;Trump should be impeached, jailed,judged&quot; you will find thousands of videos, are those videos invalidating the votes of the people who vote for Trump. Because from my POV either your vote is safe and you have nothing to worry about or your vote is discarded and you will have to take that with the authorities, not Johnie P Schmuck in youtube, who ironically has many more things in common with you and me than with Larry Page or Mark Zuckerberg.')
