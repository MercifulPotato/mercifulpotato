Each home day is a struggle due to weak executive functioning and the plethora of channels and sources of information required to simply understand the day&#x27;s work.  None of the normal school resources are available, so it&#x27;s up to mom and dad to help get through the day.  I rarely get 30 minutes of flow time on Wednesday through Friday.')
