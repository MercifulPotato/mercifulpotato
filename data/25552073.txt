Item(by='zo1', descendants=None, kids=[25554981], score=None, time=1609086500, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25550877, text='As a thought experiment: How would <i>you</i> solve those problems with your hands tied behind your back (i.e. you don&#x27;t have a government to rely on)? Just try one - assume you&#x27;re in a fictional universe and writing a novel or something.<p>Anywho, the problem with this trail of discussion is that you can come up with an infinite amount of &quot;problems&quot; and libertarians can likewise come up with a &quot;solution&quot; to each one. However your rebuttal would always be yet-another problem because the original &quot;solution&quot; didn&#x27;t cater for some arbitrary corner case or something basic that you assume can only come from a society with a government.<p>E.g. &quot;Your customers randomly decide to not pay you. That&#x27;s also OK.&quot;<p>Answer: Have an escrow organization that both parties trust. Rebuttal: &quot;Your escrow organization decides it doesn&#x27;t like a certain legitimate business and won&#x27;t accept your trade.&quot; Or &quot;Your escrow organization&#x27;s owner is buddy-buddy with your customer and he decides to not keep their part of the bargain&quot;. Okay - &quot;contracts&quot;, followed with &quot;but who will enforce the contracts&quot;, etc etc.<p>As a side note: A lot of the time libertarians and anarcho-capitalists don&#x27;t &quot;pick&quot; lack of regulation out of practicality, but rather out of plain moral principle. A lot of what is considered &quot;regulation&quot; and &quot;rule of law&quot;, when stripped of it&#x27;s noble&#x2F;protective aura, is just authoritarianism and bully-like behavior.')
