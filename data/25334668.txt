Item(by='dehrmann', descendants=None, kids=[25335064], score=None, time=1607363273, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25334323, text='&gt; young peopleâ€™s familiarity with Elvis or even the Beatles is dwindling<p>I&#x27;m not surprised you mentioned Elvis, but his catalog isn&#x27;t as deep, the songwriting wasn&#x27;t as good, and between his stint in Vegas, death, the impersonators, and rumors that he&#x27;s not really dead, he seems like more of a punchline.<p>I do wonder how this will play out with the Beatles, though.<p>Funny enough, I think part of what will keep songs going is their inclusion in movies and TV shows, something artists are often reluctant to do.')
