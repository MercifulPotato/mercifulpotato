This has been a huge and tragic net loss for general prosperity, because when wealth is concentrated and workers deal with debt and rent-seeking - from college loans, healthcare, high property prices, and others - the cost-of-entry for a viable small businesses becomes unreachably high.<p>Startups are not s substitute for small-but-profitable small businesses, some of which have the potential to become much larger businesses through genuine organic growth rather than investor goosing.<p>Unionisation isn&#x27;t about your personal circumstances, it&#x27;s about everyone&#x27;s personal circumstances. Part of it is about keeping wages high <i>precisely because</i> this gives smart creative people to build new businesses if they choose to.<p>And before someone says &quot;But what about wage costs?&quot; - remember, you are paying inflated costs anyway, but with no benefit.
