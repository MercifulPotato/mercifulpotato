It shocks me (a Czech person) you&#x27;d claim otherwise, some of his books are actually required reading here - we read foreign literature just as much as local. It never struck me as elitist, this is pure merit - you&#x27;re making it about nations but it&#x27;s just about Pratchett being that good.')
