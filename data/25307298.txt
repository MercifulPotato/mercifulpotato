I used to work for WMF but dont anymore. My opinions are my own):<p>-wikitext unparsable - wikitext is a bit insane  but there exists a parser called parsoid. If we couldn&#x27;t parse it it would be impossible to make a visual editor<p>- most pages are redirects: not sure what the problem is.<p>-boilerplate text - there is a template system to have repeated text in only one place. Not sure what the issue is.<p>- he goes on a rant about no search without giving much context. There is a search feature based on elastic search (older versions were based on lucene directly). In my opinion its a pretty decent search engine (especially compared to most sites that make their own search). I&#x27;m not sure what the actual complaint is.<p>-complaints about wikidata - this is more political than technical, however &quot;If wikidata was a company, it would not exist anymore, and you wouldn&#x27;t have heard of it.&quot; seems patently false. Wikidata is pretty popular even outside of academia, and is used quite extensively.<p>- category tree being a graph not a tree - that&#x27;s kind of unfortunate but what exactly is the problem here. Its a problem on commons, but i&#x27;ve never really seen how its an issue in practise on wikipedia. Complex categorization is being taken over by wikidata anyways.<p>Template ecosystem is complex - it could certainly be better, but the complexity here is a trade-off allowing more flexibility and allowing the system to evolve.<p>Inclusionist vs deletionist: no comment<p>UI design: perhaps a fair point here, although i do kind of like the stability of the current design. Most of the modern web sucks imho.<p>Moral failure: i dont want wikipedia to fix the world. That&#x27;s not its role. Its job is to document, not to partake.<p>Viz editor not being enabled by default: i agree, although i think it was pushed too hard in early days when there was still kinks, but its long past time now.<p>To be clear, i definitely dont think wikipedia is perfect, i just disagree with some of these specific criticisms.')
