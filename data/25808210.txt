Item(by='jariel', descendants=None, kids=[25808484], score=None, time=1610858683, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25808156, text='Yes, but:<p>Both of your comments are out of sync with crude, real-time populism.<p>$2K checks means &quot;MONEY FOR ME NOW&quot; to the proles, ideas like &#x27;tax cut&#x27; (which FYI usually are targeted at the rich), or &#x27;we have to pay for other things over there or&#x27; &#x27;but the deficit is big!&#x27; - are all rational, but ultimately second order thinking. Not populist. Those matter to people &#x27;paying attention&#x27;. Most people are not.<p>You&#x27;re also missing the fact that it&#x27;s a very poignant &#x27;flip flop&#x27; in that for months, the &#x27;Evil Nancy Pelosi and AOC&#x27; had been pushing for exactly that, and were ridiculed for it.<p>Trump&#x27;s move was savvy: he wanted to put Mitch McConnel in a corner and he really did, and he was smart enough to know that his followers are not ideological and will get riled up and support pretty much whatever he says. Especially if it&#x27;s &#x27;free money&#x27;.<p>It&#x27;s a really crystal clear example of flip flopping among the proles, in this case, purely on the basis of individual populism.<p>And again I&#x27;m not taking sides here, I&#x27;m not saying whether it&#x27;s a good or bad idea etc. just realpolitik populist observation.')
