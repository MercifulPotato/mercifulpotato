I believe the government, and more generally a nation, has a duty to ensure quality of life for its citizens.<p>That said, I think this article is grounded in a false dichotomy:\n&quot;As Silicon Valley has had one of its most profitable years in history, thousands of people who live in walking distance from the headquarters of the world&#x27;s best-known tech giants are going hungry.&quot;<p>How does distance to the hungry matter? Companies are already donating. They have no duty to. The failure isn&#x27;t on their end. I&#x27;d also extrapolate that the failure isn&#x27;t on the system currently in place: if they&#x27;re getting funded and people are still hungry: why are they hungry?<p>There isn&#x27;t enough access to jobs, there is too much financial duress, and there isn&#x27;t a layer of support to help these people. That&#x27;s entirely on the government to sort. Blaming businesses for not sorting this problem is simply moving the goalposts.')
