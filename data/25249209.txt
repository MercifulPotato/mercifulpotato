And I’d agree with this reply to just plan more sleep initially, and (if you can) skip the alarm. Why? I have had the same experience as him with resuming dreams, and know that the “cure” for me (and just generally feeling more awake for the rest of the day) is consistently about 8h15m of sleep. That’s my number, from estimating the average over some years and mostly avoiding alarm clocks, and yours is probably different. I believe I happen to need more than average. Sometimes changing time zones by 4-5 hours can help me reset the rhythm, as does planning my sleep timing based around when I want to wake, rather than my natural habitation as a night owl.')
