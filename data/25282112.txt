I always go with the assumption that a job offer comes with the implication that you agree to the legal stuff as you are signing it: If you don&#x27;t, you have refused the job. If you don&#x27;t agree to something that has been updated, you have quit. The only thing that might actually protects you in the last scenario is something like a job contract, but a lot of places in the states simply don&#x27;t have them for everyone.')
