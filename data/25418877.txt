But essentially what is being designed here is just a text document with very specific formatting, that isn&#x27;t even really designed to be parsed that well.<p>What sucks about the format proposed is that it&#x27;s not going to be so easily parsed by a human&#x2F;machine. I would instantly do away with the concept on index data, the hashing technique is really not going to provide any real advantage. I think this is the sort of thing that should be left to the implementer to decide when parsing the documents, rather than per-specified.<p>Honestly, in terms of portability, I would prefer to pick a subset of markdown. Perhaps you could apply the following restrictions:<p>1. Headers to use &#x27;#&#x27; and not underline feature.<p>2. Stick to a line wrap of 80 characters (or less if older machines require it).<p>3. Code blocks should use fours space indentation and not back-ticks (&#x27;```&#x27;).<p>4. Table should be correctly white-spaced to make the formatting nice and human viewable.<p>5. Do away with embedded images and instead use links.<p>6. 7-bit readable ASCII only, no tabs (as they suggest). A tab is different on each machine (and it bugs the living hell out of me in codebases too).<p>7. A twist on the idea specified, &quot;links&quot; (to files&#x2F;documents) should be unique for the first 12 characters (or an appropriate specification). This would allow them to be longer and more verbose, but also backwards compatible.<p>One thing I think markdown compromises on and maybe it shouldn&#x27;t have is links. I think the format:<p><pre><code>    [link_text](link_location)\n</code></pre>\nShould have been something like:<p><pre><code>    [link_location]\n</code></pre>\nWhere the location is simply displayed. I feel like the idea of hiding the content of a link is deceptive - it&#x27;s name should really reflect what is actually is and by displaying the link itself you encourage it to be as short as possible.<p>Anyway, that&#x27;s my 2 cents.')
