I&#x27;m not sure WHY the client depends on the speaker&#x27;s hardware capabilities, but I&#x27;d guess the old client source code was complex enough to warrant a rewrite and it wasn&#x27;t cost effective maintaining backwards compatibility.<p>I don&#x27;t think there was malice involved. Sonos seems like a company that has a very tough time making money, and since they IPO&#x27;d two years ago they are &quot;responsible&quot; to shareholders now (their stock opened at 15 and as of Oct 2 it was 15 -- could be worse!). Bricking old products would give a profit boost if everyone said ok and bought new products, but they underestimated the backlash.<p>It&#x27;s the same reason their client sucks -- it will cost a lot of money to make native apps that take advantage of the respective eco-systems. The client suffices for most people so why bother?<p>That said, I&#x27;ll go back to being pissed if they release new hardware I want and get rid of the 30% discount.')
