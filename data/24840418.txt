Once upon a time, I thought of myself as intelligent and capable. But alas, I&#x27;m a child of the internet, bound by my own insatiable curiosity. Poor executive functioning, a handicapped attention span, and information addiction have dampened my potential. Now the floodgates are open to behavioral addictions of all sorts.<p>Now begins the systematic removal of vices. Digital Wellbeing timers don&#x27;t work - I eventually disable them. I removed YouTube entirely this week - at first there was a visceral, anxious response to the silence that would otherwise be filled with rambling podcasts. Pathetic, yes, but a step in the right direction nonetheless.<p>I still need better tooling, though. Something not-so-dopaminergic. Something that engages me with meaningful, cognitively challenging, long-format material. Something that I can annoyed with notes. RSS feeds are a potential candidate, but integrating that into my digital workflow has proved ineffective. Beam may allow me to replace my browser, left to read and research without wandering off into  information soup.<p>I&#x27;m 26 years old, graduated with a comp sci degree three years ago and didn&#x27;t score the job I needed after graduation. Most of my interviews were &quot;close, but no cigar&quot;. I&#x27;ve been in limbo ever since. I feel like my behavioral addictions may be connected to this unfulfilled career. Anyone else in the same boat?')
