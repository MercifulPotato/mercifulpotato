I would expect that of any modern CPU.<p>&gt; it’s not common for general purpose laptops and desktops<p>Well, yeah, because &quot;memory on package&quot; has major disadvantages. You (laptop&#x2F;desktop manufacturer) are making minor gains in performance and power and need to buy a CPU which doesn&#x27;t exist. Apple can do it, but they were already doing it for iPhone, and they <i>must</i> do it for iPhone to meet space constraints.<p>I think unified memory is the right way to go, long term, and that&#x27;s a meaningful improvement. But as you point out, there is plenty of prior work there.<p>&gt; they don’t have everything that’s part of the M1 system on a chip<p>They actually do! The &#x27;CPU&#x27; part of an Intel CPU is vanishingly small these days. Most area is taken up with cache, GPU and hardware accelerators, such as... hardware video encode and decode, image processing, security and NN acceleration.<p>Most high-end Android cellphone SoCs have the same blocks. NVIDIA&#x27;s SoCs have been shipping the same hardware blocks, with the same unified memory architecture, for at least four years. They <i>all</i> boot Ubuntu and give a desktop-like experience on a modern ARM ISA.<p>&gt; There’s no other desktop ... at the price point of $699<p>Literally every modern Intel desktop does this.')
