Certain sounds in certain frequency ranges trigger it off too.  My youngest kid had a playful shriek thing she did that would palpably hurt me and cause it to kick off.<p>Seeing this post on HN itself is triggering and I&#x27;m now very conscious of the high pitched ringing sound.<p>I would be willing to pay good money to be cured of this.')
