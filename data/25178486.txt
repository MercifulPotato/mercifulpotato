An ounce is both a unit of volume and weight...or rather two units of weight. The two units of weight are less of an issue when cooking because gold is rarely eaten at all and certainly not in troy ounce quantities.<p>Sugar is sold by weight but measured by volume when cooking...and not in volumetric ounces but using cups and fractional cups...a cup being eight volumetric ounces.<p>The nexus between volumetric ounces and avoirdupois ounces is a pint of water is sixteen volumetric ounces and weighs <i>about</i> one avoirdupois pound and an avoirdupois pound weighs sixteen avoirdupois ounces. A roundabout way of sayin “a pint’s a pound the world around.” Obviously empire induces certain conceits.<p>An advantage of volumetric measuring is using utensils rather than mechanisms. A measuring cup can hold a cracked egg and a scale can’t...which also points out that the variability of eggs and walnuts suggests that gram accuracy is not warranted for ordinary cooking...you probably don’t adjust the weight of flour based on its moisture content.')
