Other hedge funds could buy some too.<p>Just have a &quot;dinner conversation&quot; about it.<p>Just like you and a few hedge funds can get together and collectively short GameStop and other companies... as they are doing now.<p>There&#x27;s no rule that I know of that says only one entity can make a specific investment.<p>-edit-<p>Don&#x27;t forget that hedge funds ARE on the other side of this trade. WSB and retail do not have the ability to move this solely on their own. I wonder how long until they&#x27;re on CNBC&#x2F;Bloomberg &quot;we saw a great opportunity in the market and executed our position well&quot;. If it&#x27;s market manipulation - was it market manipulation to even have heard about WSB and entered the trade? WSB is a nice scapegoat for the real money that caught these hedge funds in a bad position. Didn&#x27;t take long before WSB became alt-right, white supremacist, market manipulators... etc.')
