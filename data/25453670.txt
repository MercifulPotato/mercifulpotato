My statistics are a little rusty, so doing a quick simulation shows that the range is about .25-.29 (code sample 1). However, things like operations aren&#x27;t completely random, and you might be more correct by looking at something like a Poisson process, resulting in a range of about .14-.44 for this sample size (code sample 2).<p>All in the end to be taken with a grain of salt of course, as the planning component of operations eliminates most statistical properties :)<p>```\noperations = np.random.randint(0, 365, 980000)\npd.Series(operations).value_counts().sort_values() &#x2F; 980000\n```<p>```\nx = np.random.poisson(.0089, 1000000)\nx = (pd.Series(x).cumsum() &#x2F; 24).round()\nx.groupby(x).count().iloc[:365].sort_values() &#x2F; 980000\n```')
