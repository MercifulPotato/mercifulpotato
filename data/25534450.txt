However, because of the sheer complexity of video editing - and since I focused on speed + ease of use from the get go, I chose to go with a single platform (Windows) for starters.<p>Once I am close to feature complete (as in, be able to properly launch and be rock stable), I can think of porting to Mac (first), and who knows, maybe Linux.<p>I did think about this from the get-go, so I did isolate the complicated code in a specific module. So theoretically, it should not be very easy (read = 2-3 months :D) to port. But when reality will hit, we&#x27;ll see :D')
