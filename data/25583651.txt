They included all the usual phases for their usual durations. That&#x27;s why we only get the vaccines <i>now</i> (even though developing them took far less than a month). What made the trials faster is that they started preparing the next stage while the previous one was still ongoing - which is not normally done, so as to not waste money in case problems are found.<p>As for the duration of testing: As mentioned, the set of stages before approval was not reduced. Vaccines are indeed monitored after being cleared for use, but having to wait decades would not make sense. I understand that this is different for other vaccines that are &quot;forced&quot;, but you admit yourself that this is not true for all of them in the first place.')
