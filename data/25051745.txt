They were saying that in 2016.   In 2020 much more common was &quot;the polls are showing a landslide, but I don&#x27;t trust the polls completely any more&quot;.<p>If you are saying that the polls were deliberately biased, I disagree strongly.   It&#x27;s a really freaking hard job if only 1-3% of the people you try to poll don&#x27;t hang up the phone on you.   That the polling error was under 10% was incredible in that scenario.<p>The media is biased.  The polls had an error.  Two very different things.')
