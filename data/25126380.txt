Item(by='elicash', descendants=None, kids=[25127323], score=None, time=1605633488, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25126197, text='I disagree, and am glad you clarified your position.<p>My view is that these companies are privately run and online communities should be free to run them as they wish. If, say, Christian Mingle wants to ban atheists from using the platform to spread their message, they should be allowed to do that without suddenly taking on liability for things like copyright infringement. If a woodworking community wants to ban discussion of politics, they should be allowed to do that without retribution. If a dating website wants to ban people who say gross things in a first message, there&#x27;s nothing wrong with allowing them to exist and compete in the marketplace.<p>If I, as a user of social media, want to belong to a community that removes misinformation around the election, government shouldn&#x27;t ban such a platform from allowing to exist (since without 230, that&#x27;d essentially be impossible). Companies should compete on an equal footing and shouldn&#x27;t be penalized due to whatever speech policies they favor. It&#x27;s not government&#x27;s job to enforce neutral speech codes.<p>That said, I know some folks disagree and favor government taking a more active role in speech regulations in order to make sure nobody is banned from social media. While both Democrats and Republicans are pushing for changes, <i>mostly</i> only one side favors using the threat of law to enforce their will. It&#x27;s not that you&#x27;re genuinely concerned about things like copyright infringement -- you&#x27;re clearly in favor of laws that would force social media companies to choose between removing the ability of its users to post without a legal review, or using the speech policy you favor, knowing they&#x27;ll choose the latter. (Since, with so many posts, they couldn&#x27;t exist with the former.)')
