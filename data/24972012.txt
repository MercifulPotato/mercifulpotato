You can do that on a phone - kids do it now on paper.<p>What if kids cram tests on their phones for a few hours then read books the rest of the day? Maybe take your phone outside. Sounds like a decent enough curriculum to me.<p>Anyway my point is you donâ€™t really need a keyboard in education. And with that the logic of this stuff as an educational policy kind of goes away.')
