Furthermore, I&#x27;m not talking about the history of hardware&#x2F;software in Hollywood - your original statement was about the use of software by audio professionals. I was an &quot;audio professional&quot;. I trained as a Sound Engineer (City &amp; Guilds 1820 Sound Engineering, and BTEC ND Music Technology), and was there, right around the time period in question. I also worked in London&#x27;s West End for years, which is the equivalent of New Yorks&#x27;s Broadway.<p>I want to be charitable, and hope you&#x27;re getting confused about the &quot;Apple&quot; versions - in that, you&#x27;re conflating when Apple (the company) bought Emagic Logic, for when Logic (the software) was available on Apple Mac OS?! Either way, doesn&#x27;t make your former statements any less incorrect.')
