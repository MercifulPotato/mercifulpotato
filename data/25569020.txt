The slicing is always(?) relative to some implicit or expressed goal, which may vary depending on circumstance. Generally, we as humans would not survive in our daily lives without our classifications.<p>But it can also lead astray, for example when less important categorizations occupy a space that is better served by more comprehensive and valid (not to mention empirically supported) classifications. I would put the linked article in this category, to some extent.<p>As for the problem of vagueness: classification that only contains mutually exclusive categories carry the least cognitive load, but this is seldom realistic especially when classifying human behavior. That said, properly classifying humans is messy, and also risky as human differences tend to trigger emotionally value-lade comparisons. It is a popular pastime, but usually leads to rot of some kind or other.')
