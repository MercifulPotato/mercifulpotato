I think the most difficult issue to solve is the meetings one, especially now that so much work is being done remotely. It&#x27;s easy to have inconclusive meetings in engineering because you can just handwave your way through a project that drags on for too long and any non-technical stakeholders will have no choice but to put up with it. Also, engineering is complex and it&#x27;s easy to over-commit and end up with really tough problems to solve.<p>One thing I&#x27;d like to add is that a &quot;meeting&quot; should minimize the number of active participants. If a &quot;meeting&quot; has more than 4 people it should be considered a presentation. It&#x27;s a waste of to be in a meeting and trying to follow a conversation that you aren&#x27;t involved in. If there is information in that conversation that others need to hear, it should be documented in some way.')
