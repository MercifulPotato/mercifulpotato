All these ghettoes of company private gitlabs are of no use to an Iranian software industry. Arguably it is even detrimental to Iran&#x27;s national security.<p>Speaking of which [the industry], wtf? I left Tehran in 79, and I must tell you, AmirAli, that I fully expected Iran to be a software powerhouse by now (if not earlier), given the national propensities and talents, and the lack of an artificially imposed barrier to starting up an industrial&#x2F;technical sector, and fairly open access to technical literature. Can you shed light on this?')
