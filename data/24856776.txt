Agree for the first 24 to 48, disagree thereafter.<p>a neat-pick. That is BS. If you dont eat for 24 to 48. You will loose roughly 2500 x2 calories worth of weight.<p>And<p>On top of that you will loose weight due to water being dumped from you muscles. After refeeding that amount of water will be reabsorbed &#x27;gaining back the weight&#x27;.<p>So its not like you have to fast for +3 days to loose some weight.')
