You just have to fend off from people who&#x27;d want to take them away from you, right? After all, we do that with pets, they&#x27;re our slaves basically.<p>It&#x27;s clear that you&#x27;re trying to say that animals and people are equivalent, that animals are slaves. If I don&#x27;t believe in that world view, you can&#x27;t make me care. You could show rational reasons like, eating a vegetarian diet is better to combat climate change, which I accept, but having a moral appeal doesn&#x27;t move me to change my meat-eating ways.<p>If an alien can overpower us, sure I&#x27;d try to escape because I obviously want to live, but I&#x27;d be under no delusion that I deserve to not die. The alien captured and wants to eat me, so that&#x27;s going to be what will happen. There is a difference between how I feel, what would happen, and what is morally right. I posit that morals don&#x27;t matter in this case, only power over other beings, which the aliens have over us in this scenario.<p>Said another way, why <i>should</i> morals matter in this case? I&#x27;m genuinely asking, because whenever I ask this, people don&#x27;t give an actual answer and instead say something like, it&#x27;s the right thing to do or it reduces suffering, but this uses morality to explain why morality matters, sort of like using the Bible to ask why things that are said in the Bible are true.')
