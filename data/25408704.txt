When you pick a solution branch too early, you might be tempted to stick to that branch, and only notice the parts of the problem that fit your solution.<p>In your example, you might build the wrong thing based on your <i>assumption</i> of what your users want. You might realise at some point down the road that software wasn&#x27;t even the right solution in the first place.')
