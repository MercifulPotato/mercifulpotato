But if you look into history, 1932,1933 was also pretty bad.<p>Arguably, if we had even more recorded history, such <i>outliers</i> wouldn&#x27;t seem that exceptional - there still is a possiblity that climate change is affecting hurricanes (making them worse) but you can&#x27;t just look at the variance (outliers) - trend is also (more?) important.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Atlantic_hurricane_season" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Atlantic_hurricane_season</a>')
