Build times went from ~6 minutes to ~1.<p>This is a sweet spot for us as esbuild is performing really well and made our development much easier. we still rely on webpack for our staging and production builds.<p>The reason for this is esbuild doesn&#x27;t support a variety of production necessary features (transpiling to older ES, uploading bundles to S3, etc)<p>But I&#x27;m very happy with our &quot;esbuild for development, webpack for deployments&quot; process.<p>Any reason other people are not taking a similar approach?')
