It&#x27;s an environment for making games that covers everything from programming the game logic, to designing game &quot;rooms&quot;, the sprites and sounds in one package.<p>I was introduced to the software by my father at roughly the age of 9 to 11 and we did the introductory tutorial together. After that, I continued messing around mostly on my own.<p>What in hindsight turned out to be quite brilliant, was that GameMaker supports both drag-and-drop programming and scripting. I was able to start off by using drag-and-drop, but quickly realized that scripting was the way to go for more complex logic. The combined environment made it a rather smooth transition, as I only had to add the scripting part to an otherwise familiar graphical environment.<p>It seems like GameMaker is still around, so that can definitely be something to check out. Making games is fun and I remember having great times in the community, too.')
