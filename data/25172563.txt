I recall this being noted in a university course I took on early French Canadian history as well. Very soon the health of early colonists also eclipsed those back home.<p>While those in France needed the permission of the Seigneur(Lord) to kill a deer, and meat was a expensive food, First Nations and Colonists had an abundance of easily available game and fish, and had much more freedom to claim it for themselves.<p>(This is not to say that First Nations didn&#x27;t have concepts of exclusive hunting&#x2F;farming areas handed down through family and political ties, but in general, there was a lot more food to be had in NA!)')
