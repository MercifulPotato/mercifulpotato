The government is deciding what occupations constitute early access to the vaccine. For now, they are prioritizing medical workers and government employees, especially those providing essential public services. The <i>only</i> possible way for that to work is through the employer themselves. This has <i>always</i> been the case, and has been publicly stated as such (frontline medical workers, assisted living workers, etc.). It was <i>always</i> going to be based on occupation initially. Once there&#x27;s enough for general availability, individuals will likely be able to schedule vaccinations themselves or be contacted by their PCP to schedule one.<p>Just because <i>you</i> have not seen any communication does not mean it is not happening.')
