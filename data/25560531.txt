Item(by='kaitai', descendants=None, kids=[25561920], score=None, time=1609173335, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25560271, text='It seems to me that children&#x27;s stories have actually changed quite drastically over the years and between cultures and countries. I read my child many old children&#x27;s stories (say, published between 1930-1960 in northern Europe) and they are scarier and more fantastical and more.. earthy. Lots more casual death and violence between imaginary animals. One reason I keep reading them is that they are interesting and I think they provide better life lessons: now that I&#x27;m an adult, I read one somewhat violent tale of a little girl being led astray by a wolf or something (not quite Little Red Riding Hood but something like it) and I was like, wow, this is quite a sophisticated little story describing and naming grooming behavior that leads to child exploitation! This is actually useful, unlike (so many others).<p>Modern children&#x27;s books often seem to be written as psychotherapy for adults. For instance, one children&#x27;s book my kid loves is supposed to have as a lesson that being together with friends is the best thing and we should live in community, but most of what my kid has taken from it is that the protagonist penguin has the most fun while doing stuff alone and yelling &quot;I can do it myself!&quot; It&#x27;s a pleasant enough book but I think the old stories of danger and foxes and rabbits and bears will stick more. They&#x27;re all about houses on the edge of the forest... does that count as the suburbs?')
