As a result, 100% of your exposure to operator overloading will be, by definition, to cases that have nothing to do with math. While a programmer that uses math will see 1,000,000 good uses and 10 bad uses, a programmer who never uses math will see 0 good uses and 10 bad uses. I saw a similar effect in the Go community where they were debating whether or not the complex type should be removed. It&#x27;s absolutely crucial for signal processing, but to the rank and file REST-ist, it&#x27;s just another annoying case to type out in a generic-less language.')
