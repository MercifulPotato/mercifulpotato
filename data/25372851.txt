Even _granting_ the premise, it&#x27;s not &quot;You couldn&#x27;t see well enough? Well let&#x27;s disenfrancise a few hundred thousand people.&quot; That&#x27;s not a reasonable remedy by any stretch of either common sense or law.<p>Then going back to the premises, isn&#x27;t this in PA the one where they could see, they just weren&#x27;t as close as they wanted to be, and they were exactly as close as the observers from the other campaign?<p>&gt; Other times, e.g. Arizona, only a few were deposed unfortunately. Probably for time reasons? It took weeks to document the affidavits. I would have preferred that Binnall had chosen other witnesses&#x2F;affidavits to swear in, but there certainly wasn&#x27;t time to do them all.<p>Time reasons sounds reasonable to you? They have raised multiple _hundreds_ of millions of dollars, and the candidate has his own funds. They can&#x27;t get more lawyers and assistants to help? This has been going for weeks.<p>You don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s more likely that the witnesses and affidavits they&#x27;re using are subpar because that&#x27;s the best they have?')
