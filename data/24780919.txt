Unless I am misunderstanding the motivation behind this decision. But if they really just lied to make the price appear to be $30 cheaper, it seems kind of strange. I don&#x27;t think customers will be fooled or pleased when they find out the real price, and I&#x27;m not really sure if that was worth it.')
