We have all the technical pieces to enable individuals to communicate, with some effort, with privacy <i>almost</i> guaranteed (you&#x27;ll never beat, for example, a government agent with immense resources that targets you specifically). But these methods are neither mainstream, nor scalable - which is what this article is about. You can&#x27;t create a large-scale platform to democratize speech and content without running into the same walls that social media is now running into. Worse for you, the big guys (governments and media conglomerates) are no longer ignorant on how to control a new platform like the Web. Put another way, the internet was figured out and now we&#x27;re in a persistent decline where control and censorship mechanisms are incorporated into every part of the infrastructure, from DNS, to registrars, to caching proxies, to cloud providers, to social media companies, etc.<p>&gt;But content censorship is a social and political issue, not a technical one.<p>My point exactly. So the creating of another technical solution will do approximately nothing.<p>&gt;Absolute free speech is an interesting goal but solves none of those problems.<p>Nobody is talking about absolute free speech. That&#x27;s a straw man of my argument or at least a red herring. What we&#x27;re seeing is big media backed by corporate conglomerates reasserting their traditional status as gatekeepers. We&#x27;re seeing an entire American political party push for censorship of their opposition under the guise of protecting the public from &#x27;fake news&#x27;.<p>I have no solutions. The only way this works is you have societal agreement that news democratization is good, but we don&#x27;t have that, especially after the moral panic that set in with Trump&#x27;s election. A moral panic which targeted social media for control and increased censorship to stop unvetted information dissemination.')
