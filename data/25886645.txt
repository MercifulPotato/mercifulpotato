It is totally BS.  Spam is NOT a big deal compare to censorship. Any competent developer can use Bayesian algorithm to counter spam on a personal level, and the code can be just sitting on the client side. The big problem is these data company won&#x27;t be able to get your data.<p>Not getting tech support lowers the profit margin for the big corp. However, automation and AI are NOT a replace for good customer support.  Get some freaking real humane tech support in relation to the number of active user you have Google&#x2F;FB. This is one of reason why the world hates you.')
