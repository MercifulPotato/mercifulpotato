Take a look at Django, it got Python 3 support in February 26, 2013 [1].<p>&gt; Django 1.5 introduces support for Python 3 - specifically, Python 3.2 and above.<p>Notice version gap â€” no support for 3.0, 3.1. It was quite common.<p>&gt; python 3 migration where most of the community agree that the move is justifiable<p>If people believed breaking change was justified they would move to 3.0, it did not happen.<p>I&#x27;ve seen both Python and Ruby community, Ruby made two breaking changes (1.9 and 2.0) while Python got its PEP 414. There was a huge split among developers.<p>---<p>Essentially you are describing how switch happened while I&#x27;m describing which lessons should have been learned. It is sad if Python community learned nothing.<p>&gt; the community opinion seem to be split which certainly harm wayland migration progress.<p>Developers done great job, you can&#x27;t run 2.7 code in 3.*, you can run X11 applications in XWayland. Is there a split in developers community? All I see is FUD among users.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.djangoproject.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;3.1&#x2F;releases&#x2F;1.5&#x2F;#python-3-support" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.djangoproject.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;3.1&#x2F;releases&#x2F;1.5&#x2F;#python-3...</a>')
