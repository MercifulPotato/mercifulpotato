If you&#x27;re getting 5% back, then the item was almost certainly marked up more than 5%. So you&#x27;re still paying something for that loan in the form of higher up-front pricing.<p>And, of course, if you don&#x27;t pay your bill in full each month, then you&#x27;re likely looking at 15-20% or more (APR) on whatever balance you left unpaid.')
