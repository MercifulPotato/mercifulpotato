Consider that in pricing his beef normally, the vendor has to account for three things:<p>1. Beef that sells within 35 days at regular price\n2. Beef that sells within 60 days as a discounted price\n3. Beef that sells after 60 days for a loss.<p>The beef&#x27;s regular price has to be somewhat higher than in an efficient market because some of it will be sold at a loss.<p>Getting an order for a set amount per week allows him to disregard the losses he normally has from beef that has to be sold for dog food, because the purchaser is guaranteeing their quantity, smoothing their expectations on how much beef to purchase in the future.<p>It&#x27;s possible that at $18 a pound, without any waste, he&#x27;s making the same margins&#x2F;profit as he would at $34 with some waste.')
