I can understand how this is annoying if you&#x27;re creating apps for other people, but in terms of my own personal experience with my computer, the only time I think about Gatekeeper is when I&#x27;m talking about it on HN. It gets turned off as part of a bash script I run after installing macOS, at which point it&#x27;s gone for good.<p>On my list of annoyances with macOS, Gatekeeper is somewhere below the Library folder being hidden by default. I can&#x27;t say what Apple will decide to do in the future, but I have a very clear line in the sand, and Apple has absolutely not crossed it.')
