If the toolkit is open source, and your &quot;homework&quot; doesn&#x27;t include looking into the contribution process and how it goes working with upstream, then I would say you are doing yourself a disservice considering how this is the most critical dependency that a GUI application has. That gets more important the more your project gets invested in the toolkit, doubly so if you aren&#x27;t paying for support. (Essentially that means you&#x27;re supporting it yourself or relying on flaky advice from IRC and stack overflow, all the usual caveats apply there. Ignoring upstream and refusing to talk to them or collaborate is really not going to help you in that case)')
