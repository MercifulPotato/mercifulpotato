I tried to download the city&#x27;s annual report and failed.  There is none.  Or rather, there are several, and all are incomplete.<p>I believe there are several large scandals brewing in SF government and many government officials are committing crimes against the citizens.  I hope ProPublica or another journalism organization will take on the project to uncover them.  I just donated to ProPublica.  I hope you will, too.')
