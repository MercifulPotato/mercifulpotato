It can do that, because one country is a superpower and a different country is the client.<p>I suspect the reason that does not happen is because NSO does the US&#x27;s dirty work for it, otherwise the US would have stopped it already. After all, the US directly supports those same governments NSO works with. It&#x27;s probably not too upset its dependents are getting support from a different actor.')
