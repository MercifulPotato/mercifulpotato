You have recent Takeouts or sync of your inbox and B. People know to reach you via the address on your own domain, which you can repoint to a new service if necessary.<p>If you&#x27;re doing these two things, you&#x27;re effectively protected from this issue, even if you use Gmail. Of course, it won&#x27;t necessarily help you with losses from other Google services you might be cut out of.
