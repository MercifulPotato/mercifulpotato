Or another way of looking at it is that most voting systems grant more influence to strategic voters than honest voters, but score voting (also called range voting) does that to a greater degree than some other systems we could use instead.<p>(One of the reasons I prefer approval voting over score voting is that there&#x27;s less of a gap between strategic voting and honest voting.  Everyone is forced to give a maximalized yes&#x2F;no vote for each candidate rather than casting a lukewarm vote.)')
