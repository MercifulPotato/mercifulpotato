As a software engineer, my job is mostly the same stuff. There are new frameworks and tech stacks but I feel I have been doing the same thing one way or the other since a long time. What are some exciting areas for a software engineer to learn. Something which is not tangential(a new programming language, tech-stack or a framework) but something really niche and exciting to learn? Something ground-up innovation which is happening right now and is exciting to learn?')
