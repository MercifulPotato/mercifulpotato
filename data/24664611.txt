They do mostly &quot;editorial&quot; style content. Commentary, punditry, summaries of recent events. It may be &quot;quality&quot; in literary terms, but it isn&#x27;t exactly hard journalism in the investigative sense. It isn&#x27;t really the kind of content that&#x27;s in jeopardy.<p>I think it&#x27;s important to beat back the clich√© that &quot;free is the problem.&quot; It&#x27;s often repeated, rarely challenged, taken for granted and factually incorrect.<p>The financial problems of hard, investigative journalism problem exist regardless of content consumption trends. A quality investigative piece requires seasoned journalists to work for weeks, months or years. The economic value is &quot;just an article.&quot; The article doesn&#x27;t really make more money than a commentary piece that takes an afternoon to write. This is true regardless of business models.')
