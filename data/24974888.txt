All 3 of your points are spot on.<p>Healthcare does have an impact, in that the comparison of labor costs btw US and Europe often doesn&#x27;t account for the fact that the cost of labor in the US includes health insurance, generally, whereas the cost of labor in Europe does not.  This is the flipside of comparing tax rates between US and Europe, where Europe&#x27;s rates look very high, but include healthcare generally, so the same cost is booked as labor in the US but as general government spending in Europe.')
