If I had to extend it by 500 years, I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;d decline. If I had to extend it 5000 years I&#x27;d certainly say no. 5M years of existence would be torture.<p>is this a thing you worry might happen? like, if life extension is developed, you&#x27;re concerned it will come in the form of a 5 million year increment, take it or leave it, no possibility of suicide in the middle?<p>&gt; When people express the desire to live forever, either here on earth or in an imagined afterlife, I wonder if they have really thought through the consequences.<p>i wonder why you interpret the desire to live forever as some enforced, not only eternal, but literally unendable existence.<p>i expect we&#x27;ll manage to simply end aging first. that won&#x27;t prevent you from walking out into rural alaska in your underwear.')
