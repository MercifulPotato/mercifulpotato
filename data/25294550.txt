After all, I would not imply that you think that Lloyds bank lost so much market cap because “some dude” was planning their business strategy.<p>I wish to imply that (1) things change, and (2) that a current state of competent management is not something that <i>can</i> be assured forever.<p>This implication was illustrated with one of many historical examples of nations and empires thought indefatigable at their peak which are now no more.<p>I also illustrated it with the example of the global financial crisis which led to Lloyds losing so much value. I believe <i>that</i> was caused by teams of highly brilliant investors applying a Nobel-prize winning formula.<p>&gt; Also the term &quot;The Sun never sets on the British empire&quot; implied geographical dominance across the world, not immortal dominance. Before you guys, it was the Spanish claiming that.<p>I was already aware both that it was previously used by the Spanish and that one usage was geographical, <i>however it was also used by British people in the sense of never ending dominance</i> - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;access-socialstudies.cappelendamm.no&#x2F;c316302&#x2F;tekstoppgave&#x2F;vis.html?tid=368510&amp;strukt_tid=316302" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;access-socialstudies.cappelendamm.no&#x2F;c316302&#x2F;tekstop...</a>')
