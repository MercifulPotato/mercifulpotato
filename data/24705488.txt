It worked the best. It solved the purpose.<p>Then I read Erich Fromm&#x27;s &quot;To Have or To Be&quot; - and it changed me. It made me question if I was just &quot;having&quot; all that knowledge or really &quot;practicing&quot; it.<p>It felt good to know lots of interesting facts of chemistry, physics, geography and code. But I just &quot;had&quot; them - never &quot;enjoyed&quot; them.<p>Will highly recommend the book. For a moment, pause and re-think,  why do we need to remember everything?')
