Same for profit sharing - profit is an entirely invented number. It doesn&#x27;t really solve the problem of options being too easy to fiddle and too hard to cash in.<p>I get the tax advantages of this, though. But I expect if it became common the taxman would want their cut of the nominal growth in value each year, or something. Bastards.')
