In the adjusted models, veteran LEOs who were not deployed were significantly more likely to be involved in a shooting than non-veteran officers. Veterans with a deployment history were 2.9 times more likely to be in a shooting than non-veteran officers.&quot;<p>Interesting food for thought. I&#x27;ve heard many arguments about ex-military folks training in rules of engagement making them less-likely to use a weapon in a frivolous scenario. But, maybe that&#x27;s not borne out by the data.<p>Or there&#x27;s a selection-bias thing. Either way, good point.<p>I think what the parent was getting at though, was that this would silo the guys with all the guns and stuff in a way that they&#x27;re used only in more carefully-considered situations as opposed to giving every yahoo on the force an MRAP, a tactical vest full of 123123 mags for their AR-15, and a fuzzy mandate to enforce the &#x27;thin blue line.&#x27;<p>You both make really, excellent points, honestly.')
