I have about 10TB of media on my current 12tb (4x4 raid5) nas box.  My next plan is a 6-drive raid z2 with 8-12tb drives early next year.  I can&#x27;t justify doubling the cost or more to ensure it&#x27;s all backed up.  The important bits (to me) are in various redundant places... that doesn&#x27;t mean I want to lose it and the parity options allow for some safety without too much lose of storage space.')
