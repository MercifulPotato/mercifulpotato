Often making the &quot;free shipping&quot; with prime not attractive anymore. I rarely need to receive the junk I buy the next day and most products still arrive in 2-3 business days in Germany. Amazon prime is a scam.<p>Cancelling my prime membership made me make way less impulse purchases. It also encouraged me to explore other great online shops that deliver equality as fast, but only carry a curated selection of products, none of that aliexpress garbage.')
