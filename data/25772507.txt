I want to mindmap and brainstorm all of the topics, and <i>then</i> take notes on them - preferably with a time component to that. Even more than that, I want to be able to take notes on the <i>relationships</i> between nodes, since that&#x27;s where the real gold tends to be.<p>Mindmap tools generally don&#x27;t work for this because they want a single topic for each map, and all the words on the one page. KM&#x2F;KB tools don&#x27;t work because I can&#x27;t just draw the relationships between the points, I have to go in and actually create notes that I then get to visualise.<p>I really wanted to like Obsidian, but the way it treats folders puts me right off. I tried Neo4j Bloom, but there are UI difficulties and it&#x27;s not really great for notes. I&#x27;d build it myself but I have no idea where I&#x27;d even <i>start</i> on a UI.')
