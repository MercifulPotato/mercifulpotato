Binding of Isaac isn&#x27;t turn based, Spelunky isn&#x27;t isometric or turn based, neither is Enter the Gungeon or Rogue Legacy. In fact, the only recent game that fits that definition that I can see on steam right now is FTL, and that&#x27;s almost 10 years old. Parent is right, rogue like implies procedural generation, permadeath, optionally intermediate progression.')
