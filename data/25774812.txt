Certainly it&#x27;s not the understanding that I grew up with, but I had the good fortune to have a history teacher who liked JS Mill.<p>What are you talking about? It doesn’t matter who your history teacher is, the entire concept of free speech is about not locking people up for what they say.<p>That said, here in Australia we actually don’t even <i>have</i> a legally protected right to free speech. We don’t even have a bill of rights. And while I support the right to say anything without being punished <i>by the government</i>, I definitely don’t think that people should be able to broadcast a political message without doing the hard yards of actually, you know, telling the truth and formulating a reasonable argument.')
