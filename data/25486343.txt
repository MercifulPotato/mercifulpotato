A perfect example is porn mega-name Mia Khalifa, who was paid a grand total of $12,000 for only a handful of shoots - a tiny, tiny fraction of the value her content has generated for distributors like Pornhub.<p>Nonetheless this problem is not unique to porn. We don&#x27;t criminalize Patreon, Medium, Spotify, PayPal, or Visa. We probably should, but if we&#x27;re going to start dismantling exploitative business practices on moral grounds, why start with the most precarious workers and not the most entrenched and richest middlemen?')
