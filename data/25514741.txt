Fortunes that could go to feeding dozens of children, educating dozens of youths, housing dozens of homeless men and women, instead go to ensuring that a handful of people can keep up with their neighbors in vying for a spot at Yale for their boy or girl. Sure, in the process many salaries are paid, but you could also use that same amount of money and have the recipients of that aid number in the dozens or hundreds rather than be a handful or so.<p>In the end, that spot at Yale will still be filled. The needle on the chances of it being Dr. and Mr. Irgendwas&#x27; child probably doesn&#x27;t move that much, either.')
