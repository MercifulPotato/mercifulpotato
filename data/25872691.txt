This is a long time but it is a very lofty goal as Apple&#x27;s ARM implementation is a moving target to RISC-V has to move faster.<p>But it likely will come close to converging around 5 years from now -- at least somewhat competitive in core count and single core performance.<p>Interesting times.<p>I look forward to the first AMD Ryzen-like chipset designs for ARM and RISC-V.  That is an innovation that is just waiting to be taken advantage of by these newer architectures.')
