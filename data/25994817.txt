Millions of users - community developers, open source projects and Independent Software Vendors - push and pull Docker container images billions of times through Docker Hub. If you are an experienced backend Software Engineer and want to play a critical role in the evolution of Docker Hub and Docker’s next chapter, then this role is for you.  As a Senior Software Engineer in the Docker Hub team, you will build features around the container registry that operate reliably at massive scale and deliver a differentiated experience for free and paid users of Docker Hub. You will develop microservices and serverless functions that offer new functionality to other services within Docker Hub’s service oriented architecture besides enhancing existing services.<p>Docker Desktop team is hiring Sr. Software Engineer (Systems) to join our Europe-based Docker Desktop development team. Docker Desktop is one of our most popular products, with several million developers using it to build their software daily.  We use a wide variety of different operating systems and different languages within our team. Between us, we work on Mac, Windows and Linux; we program mainly in Go, C#, Swift and JavaScript; and we work across the software stack from the kernel and virtualisation layers right up to the UI. We don’t expect everyone to be comfortable in all of those areas, but neither do we want people who can only work in one: our ideal candidate is a generalist who enjoys the opportunity to move around between different operating systems, different languages, and different parts of the stack in quick succession. At the moment, we are particularly looking for candidates who can work on the lower, systems levels of the stack, in areas such as networking, file systems and virtualisation. Examples of problems we have been tackling recently are integration with WSL 2, integration with Apple’s new virtualization framework, faster file sharing between a VM and the host, and reducing CPU load in the virtualization layer. If these sound like the sort of problems you would love to tackle and where you would have something to contribute, then please contact us!<p>to apply: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.docker.com&#x2F;career-openings" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.docker.com&#x2F;career-openings</a>')
