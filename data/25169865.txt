I like knowing my colleagues and having a feeling of we&#x27;re in this together. I like the random break chats throughout the day and meeting folk from other teams organically. I hate that the majority of my day now is just sitting at a desk alone talking to no one. It&#x27;s perfectly valid to want socialisation from work, it&#x27;s not necessarily caused by a poor social life outside of work.')
