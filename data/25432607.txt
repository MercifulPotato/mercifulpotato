A normal day I have dozens of imagined debates, presentations or conversations on varying topics. Some particular topics have been on the docket for years at a time, before enacting them in real life (finally clearing them away).<p>The intensity seems to vary based on my mood and wether I&#x27;m alone. I went on a week long roadtrip with some friends, and realised after a day or two that I wasn&#x27;t thinking nearly as much. It was as if I couldn&#x27;t. Even if I wasn&#x27;t with them for a few hours. My regular dark hole of &quot;I&#x27;ll just work for 50 years and then die alone&quot; was not accessible, even if I tried.<p>I&#x27;ve also had almost the same exact feeling when on a pretty strong acid trip, not being able to hear my inner monologue. That time it was more scary, but also really interesting and relaxing. Microdosing LSD brought most of that feeling back (not sure if placebo though), making me more focused and less sad.<p>I&#x27;m guessing getting to that state is a part of what mediation is all about, but I haven&#x27;t really figured that out yet.')
