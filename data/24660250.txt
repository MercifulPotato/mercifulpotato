As an example (probably just bad coding on my part) I tried to use mobx to track preferences for a photo viewer, every photo then looked at the preference state from mobx. App slowed to a crawl because 300 photos are going through a few hundred lines of code each just to see if `showDate` is true&#x2F;false and because `showDate` is &quot;reactive&quot; there&#x27;s a whole ton of overhead it tracking that each photo is watching it.<p>Now of course I moved the code that looks at that state up the tree and then pass it down to solve but that kind of defeats the purpose of using it in the first place. The upper components should not have to care directly about data for lower components.')
