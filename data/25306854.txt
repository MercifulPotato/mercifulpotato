Item(by='troughway', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607111360, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25305313, text='To be fair this is another article&#x2F;essay in a very, very long string of his that can be filed under some kind of a &quot;Fundamentals of Business&quot; type category. If you talk to owners, they will inevitably say the same things he&#x27;s saying, sometimes verbatim. But these owners wouldn&#x27;t speak in direct words either, because &quot;speaking to customers&#x2F;users&quot; is too context dependent to get into in an HN comment. There&#x27;s too much nuance to bash the person over the head with it when writing this sort of an essay.<p>That&#x27;s mostly what tipped me off to not take his words at face value but to interpret them through his lens as a VC and someone who is trying to communicate business ideas (ideals?) to people who, I would at least hope, aspire to create a business of their own. Whether it&#x27;s a million or a billion, it doesn&#x27;t matter. Nearly everything he talks about applies to &quot;lifestyle businesses,&quot; which is I think partly why YC offers some small bit of money to get the ball rolling rather than go gung-ho and throw massive amounts of money at people. I don&#x27;t know if this has changed, I don&#x27;t think it has. Obviously it doesn&#x27;t hurt to get a leg-up from the counsellors and whatnot that YC provides through their alumni program.<p>I am not sure if he&#x27;s spoken about it but I wouldn&#x27;t doubt that one of his philosophies is that a diverse number of businesses can grow to a reasonable revenue (where the founders are happy and working away at it) with a bit of money to start with, and that way YC doesn&#x27;t have to spend a fortune early on and everyone walks away happy even if YC doesn&#x27;t turn a sizable profit. Some kind of a threshold where YC feels anything above that means they&#x27;re pissing money in the wind and their ROI isn&#x27;t any better, but at the same time they&#x27;re helping the founders as best as they can.<p>So you have to take the times he talks about being Ramen Profitable and talks about building a Billion Dollar Business and find the underlying threads tying it all together.<p>pg can&#x27;t tell you exactly what, how, when, where, why you should be doing the thing you need to be doing to build a business. His words sound like platitudes most of the time to me personally, which is why I take the side of &quot;the people who need this the most won&#x27;t take it, and vice versa&quot;, because the person who started a business and is profitable didn&#x27;t have anyone like pg telling them this sort of stuff. Would someone read his words before starting anything and be inspired to? Perhaps, but it&#x27;s a long journey and counting on such flimsy motivation to keep you going is to me silly.<p>For some, certain things might be common sense. For others, not so much. Plenty of founders, even those with serious business experience, still have it ingrained in them that &quot;if you build it, they will come&quot;, and they neglect every other aspect of business. Yes, I&#x27;m talking primarily about engineering types. This essay is to remind you to focus on the users, and the rest will follow.<p>Aside: I&#x27;m grateful for the Startup School library. I think it&#x27;s a great resource. It&#x27;s got a nice mix of obvious and non-obvious advice in there. When people disparage pg&#x27;s writing, they should take a moment and see what his company has built for people who wish to create a business before declaring him out of touch.')
