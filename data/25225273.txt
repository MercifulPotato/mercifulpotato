He says &quot;<i>Python. I feel bad about this one — I have worked with Python for several years at some point and I’ve never bothered to actually learn it.</i>&quot;<p>He&#x27;s skilled at JavaScript and C# and worked with Python for years, what&#x27;s the betting he&#x27;s as good as any typical Python developer, if not better? Pretty good, I&#x27;d think.<p>&gt; &quot;<i>I struggle to read either LISP-inspired (like Clojure), Haskell-inspired (like Elm), or ML-inspired (like OCaml) code</i>&quot;<p>How many people don&#x27;t know Haskell but <i>can</i> successfully struggle through reading it instead of having their eyes glaze over and completely refuse to try?<p>&gt; &quot;<i>CORS. I dread these errors! I know I need to set up some headers to fix them but I’ve wasted hours here in the past.</i>&quot;<p>&quot;I don&#x27;t know it - but I&#x27;ve also worked on it and know how to fix it and done so&quot; - hmmmm.
