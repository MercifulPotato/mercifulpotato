Canon camera firmwares have been dumped via blinking the LEDs. I&#x27;ve debugged low-level bringup by blinking codes out of LEDs too. This has nothing to do with side channels, it&#x27;s just a case of not having documentation for the hardware so you find the first thing that gives <i>any</i> feedback and use it to dump the rest of the firmware so you can reverse engineer it and figure out how e.g. the screen works.')
