Snark, sarcasm, flame bait, and utterances from beneath a bridge. Fondness of writing for an endless stream of billy goats as an audience. Fondness for competitive typing. Fondness for not knowing better. For not holding myself accountable. Fondness for the rationalizations of a bully.<p>There&#x27;s lots of crap on HN. Because it&#x27;s still the internet. Just because there&#x27;s a lower ratio of crap because it&#x27;s HN doesn&#x27;t mean people won&#x27;t go out of their way to crap on it.')
