Long term effects tend to be an issue for drugs that are taken over the long term. With a vaccine that is only taken twice, the vaccine itself and its direct byproducts (ie the spike proteins) are only in the body for a limited period. After that it&#x27;s only the immune response that remains. There&#x27;s no realistic mechanism for a previously unseen effect to show up from it years down the line.<p>There is a small possibility that there could be detrimental effects to a fetus, which is why the vaccines are not currently recommended for pregnant women. It&#x27;s not expected that there would be a negative effect; it just hasn&#x27;t yet been tested. (Fortunately pregnancy is not a chronic condition, so people can still be vaccinated after giving birth.)')
