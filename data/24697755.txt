I would be surprised if I added an element only to discover that its width was being modified by a wildcard rule, less so with `grid-column` because grid placement is arguably the concern of the grid.<p>As a side note, I like this technique and have already had a good opportunity to apply it instead of the old padding &amp; negative margins method or even flexbox + stretch (and I like flexbox), neither of which actually worked for this very specific case.')
