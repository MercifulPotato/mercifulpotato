Item(by='JumpCrisscross', descendants=None, kids=[25950652], score=None, time=1611873354, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25950400, text='&gt; <i>There is absolutely no case here.</i><p>There isn&#x27;t, but I think one can make the case that there should be. At the very least, communication from Robinhood, from the exchanges and from regulators was piss poor. As a result, we have half the internet wrapped up in some Ken Griffin as Gordon Gecko Batman conspiracy theory.<p>Robinhood was criticized for marketing day trading to people who, to a large degree, didn&#x27;t know better. The counterargument was people knew what they were getting into and were free to do it. Fair enough.<p>This adds a new wrinkle. It wasn&#x27;t ever a day trading platform! A day trading platform should be able to handle high volumes. It should be able to handle increased collateral requirements. It should be able to handle some market makers going offline. What Robinhood did is contractually allowed. But it flies in the face of what they held themselves out to be.<p>Robinhood sold a turd doughnut, folks said &quot;it&#x27;s fine, I want a turd doughnut,&quot; and then the turd turned out to be uranium.')
