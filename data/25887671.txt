I know that min-maxing isn&#x27;t really necessary, but there&#x27;s a part of me that can&#x27;t stand not getting everything done on the first day (which can mean the difference between 2 and 3 harvests in a season).<p>The first year was pretty hectic for me trying to get everything done - basically had no time for relationships until year 2. I would not call that experience relaxing, even though it was pretty fun. But once you hit year 3+, it becomes pretty chill when you have iridium sprinkles + junimo huts taking care of pretty much everything while tons of money rolls in, so you can just focus on getting your farm perfectly set up.<p>Of course, after I had my farm set up perfectly, that&#x27;s when I lost interest')
