Item(by='cycloptic', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608154613, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25448849, text='The entire point of a new version is that it has newer features&#x2F;widgets. Why even bother using a new GTK version if you didn&#x27;t care about using the new features&#x2F;widgets? In that case you could still compile against the old version and expect it to work as it always has.<p>If what you&#x27;re looking for is a way to roll out some new widgets one by one and transition to a new version slowly, I agree that&#x27;s something that could be worked on. But it requires a bunch of additional work that&#x27;s mostly orthogonal to just shipping a new toolkit and it may not make sense for it to happen upstream.')
