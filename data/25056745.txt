Even if you write it down, put everything in a calendar, it require commitment.<p>So, to &#x27;force&#x27; you to do so, my idea is having someone else who have goals too, and each week they schedule a meeting either in person around a coffee, or video call or simple phone call, and list goals that needs to be done for the next week(or 2 weeks or 1 month).<p>Each week, each person list the goals and if they&#x27;ve done their homeworks. if someone don&#x27;t finish they will feel miserable and<p>So the idea is this:\n    - Find a person in a relatively similar life position as you\n    - Schedule a meeting with them every week (or every 2 weeks, or month)\n    - Define a list of goals for yourself\n    - Communicate them to your new friend (they&#x27;ll do the same to you)\n    - Write them down\n    - Have them all done by the time you meet again\n    - Rinse&#x2F;repeat<p>Just the accountability aspect alone is enough to get things done.<p>Also, it helps to sit down for short time and actually think about what you want to accomplish short-term.<p>One of the biggest benefits of this exercise is establishing a stronger relationship with your new friend.<p>So what do you think guys?')
