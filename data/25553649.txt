If I had the time or money I would re-do my degree in a heartbeat.  Math is something I was never really that strong with and there are personal projects I&#x27;ve had where I just don&#x27;t quite have the mathematical depth to push through.  I also sucked at asking for help back in college (goodness I was an idiot).')
