PCIe would&#x27;ve needed larger buffers at the very least, and would need quite a bit of QoS mangling (there isn&#x27;t really a bandwidth reservation system on PCIe, so best you could do would be to just give it highest priority)... which also means more places to fail &amp; get wonky.<p>Also, there&#x27;s no preexisting standard for framebuffers over PCIe.')
