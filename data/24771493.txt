A streamer&#x27;s audience is only &quot;their&quot; audience the way that say the audience for Game of Thrones was &quot;their&quot; audience. It&#x27;s a very, very long tail.<p>Other outfits can probably injure Twitch by poaching key stars, but it&#x27;s not a path to success for these rival services. The absolute most they can achieve is kill off Twitch, at which point it&#x27;s as likely the piles of small creators just do Youtube, rather than figuring out tooling and financials for your new live service instead.<p>And if your plan is &quot;Aha, we&#x27;ll kill Youtube too&quot; well you&#x27;d better be loaded for bear &#x27;cos that platform is <i>not</i> messing around and the people behind it aren&#x27;t going to run out of money any time soon.')
