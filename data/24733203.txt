Any temp or contract-to-hire agency that is willing to work with developers should work in my experience. If they&#x27;re not used to working with developers, sometimes it can take a week or two of checking in regularly for them to find something. My experience was that they want to make money from your skills (and tech tends to bring in more money than something like extra hands for doing inventory) which creates motivation for them to find work for you. Friendly persistence can go a long way. Good luck!')
