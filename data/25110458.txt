Item(by='maccard', descendants=None, kids=[25111615], score=None, time=1605525877, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25108640, text='&gt; In basketball, it is quite easy to prove that some people are simply unable to ever be a great basketball player; there has never been an NBA player shorter than 5&#x27;3, only 25 shorter than 6&#x27;0, and only 10 under 5&#x27;10. Are you really telling me NO ONE shorter than 5&#x27;3 ever decided the trade offs were worth it?<p>Anecdotal, I&#x27;m 6&#x27;1. At a middle school age, I was _hounded_ into playing basketball (until they realised I had no talent whatsoever, or any inkling that I wanted to attempt to improve that). There&#x27;s definitely a selection bias in who gets started playing basketball in the first place.<p>Back on topic,<p>&gt;  some people simply don&#x27;t have the genetic attributes needed to be great.<p>I think this is a massive stretch. I think it&#x27;s fair to say that some people don&#x27;t have the attributes to be in the top 0.01% of the their game (in baskebtall, there&#x27;s a few hundred(?) players in the NBA - that&#x27;s the equivalent of the John Carmack&#x2F;Peter Norvig types that have come up here), but is there any proof whatsoever of any form that says that an &quot;average-to-poor&quot; engineer can&#x27;t become a &quot;great&quot; engineer - (in basketball terms, going from the person who can&#x27;t dribble to the person who absolutely dominates your after-work league consistently)')
