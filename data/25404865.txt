For example, the Polish minister of health gave a press conference last week in which he said that restrictions cannot be lifted until half of the country&#x27;s population has been vaccinated, and he expects that to take all of 2021. I suspect that he was only saying out loud what other EU countries have been tacitly planning for.')
