People should be allowed to make their own choices in what they believe to be their best interests and they should be allowed to get things wrong.<p>&gt; For most people, if there computer was ‘theirs’, it would be that way for about 10 minutes until it was pwned by a bad actor.<p>This may have been true back in the early 2000s when people first had good broadband. However all the major operating systems have pretty decent security out of the box mainly due to the embarassment of events like MS Blaster Worm.<p>&gt; The general issue of other people (I.e. Apple et al) having a lot of control over your computer, is entirely valid even if some of the points in the piece are exaggerations.<p>The problem is that if you buy a general purpose computing device. You should be able to run whatever you like on it.<p>They should just have a button somewhere in whatever the equivalent of the BIOS on these machines is that says &quot;I am an adult and I accept the risks of turning off these protections&quot; and then let you install Temple OS if you so choose to.<p>This is something that needs to be enforced by legal means IMO, something similar to right to repair.<p>&gt; The problem is that people want it that way.<p>I don&#x27;t know about that. They frequently get irritated by it and are just resigned to it IME.<p>However the popularity of single board computers such as the Raspberry Pi, People building their own gaming rigs and people tinkering with gadgets goes someway in refuting this notion. There will be of course many people that just won&#x27;t care and will use &quot;iDevice&quot; and that is fine, however there is a large spectrum between &quot;I only run stuff from the app store&quot; to &quot;I run custom Arch Install with optimised kernel with tk kernel patches&quot;.<p>&gt; The presence of open software isn’t enough without a way for people to know what is trustworthy without being experts.<p>I agree. This is a failing of the open source community. I&#x27;ve actually written a draft manifesto called &quot;better than freedom&quot;. This may actually push me to at least have it critiqued by my friends.<p>&gt; Until we provide that, this situation cannot change.<p>Something has to change. We are sliding back into the 1980s where all the computer hardware was incomptable with one another.')
