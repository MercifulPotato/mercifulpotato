NTD, RSBN, OANN and The Independent (UK) for the most part seem to be the only outlets providing full-coverage of these hearings.<p>There&#x27;s very little editorialising going on, from what I can see.<p>Can&#x27;t speak for Newsmax, I haven&#x27;t seen many of their videos but they do seem to have more &quot;opinion&quot; anchors.<p>Are you arguing that the public hearings themselves contain misinformation? What percentage of the testimonies do you think is misinformation?')
