Most accidents tend to happen at the hand-over from the machine to the pilots when some problem appears. Among those it&#x27;s very common that the both the machines and the manual procedures deal correctly with the problem, but the pilots have no chance of selecting the correct procedures. (The MAX-8 may have changed that picture all by itself, as I said, I stopped following them.)<p>And, yes, airplanes are different. You have pilots that are trained on getting hand-over in a bad situation, and usually have minutes to decide what to do. Car problems must be solved in a second or two, and the drivers never see a bad situation before it happens on real life.')
