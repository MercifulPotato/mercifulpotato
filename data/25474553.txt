It will even sync automatically with whatever git repo you store the settings in.<p>&gt; <i>regularly results in situations where building the project works fine for colleague X but not for me</i><p>This is a problem with relying on the IDE host to also be the host of your applications. Your repo should contain build settings, not your IDE.<p>You should switch to Docker or Pulumi or [insert declarative build tool here] -- something more deterministic and consistent across users.<p>&gt; <i>I&#x27;m dealing with bugs in their refactoring engine</i><p>As others have said, this is much more likely to be a problem with dynamic languages. I haven&#x27;t done much with Python, but I&#x27;ve never had a TypeScript refactoring problem in 3+ years of using it as my primary language and IntelliJ as my primary IDE.<p>&gt; <i>And don&#x27;t even get me started about CPU usageâ€¦</i><p>I have a much bigger issue with memory usage, but it&#x27;s still not a big problem (and I think it&#x27;s a memory leak in a single plugin anyway).<p>Also, JetBrains seems to have (correctly) assumed that dev time is much more expensive than dev hardware.<p>If I have someone whose slow IDE drains 1 hr of work per week and costs $75&#x2F;hr, then it&#x27;s only going to be a few weeks before it was more cost effective for me to upgrade her CPU than to worry about the IDE at all.<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jetbrains.com&#x2F;help&#x2F;rider&#x2F;Sharing_Your_IDE_Settings.html#import-export-settings" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jetbrains.com&#x2F;help&#x2F;rider&#x2F;Sharing_Your_IDE_Settin...</a>')
