Item(by='papaf', descendants=None, kids=[24845793, 24850296], score=None, time=1603264562, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24845194, text='<i>Rust also comes with a very deep standard library for I&#x2F;O, path manipulation etc whereas the C++ equivalents for all of this are still surprisingly lacking even in C++20 (especially on the network side).</i><p>I agree with this point and cross-platform development is painful in C and C++. However, one of the reasons people use C and C++ is because of platform specific development. It turns out the platforms themselves are written in C.<p>For example, the &quot;very deep standard library&quot; for Rust can&#x27;t do DNS TXT queries. On Linux, I run &#x27;man res_query&#x27; [1] and get the documentation. Notice the Synopsis, that&#x27;s C&#x2F;C++ and the Linux specific code I write can use that.<p>Rust can also call these functions but there is an impedance mismatch between the safe world of standard rust and the unsafe calls to the system -- I imagine that a crate is a available to ease the pain of the &#x27;unsigned char *answer&#x27;.<p>I am not making this comment to belittle Rust, I actually think it is a good and safe alternative to C++. However, there is decades of system development behind the C&#x2F;C++ ecosystem and coming onto a C&#x2F;C++ thread (about a package manager) and calling things a &quot;shitshow&quot; is not going to win people over.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;man7.org&#x2F;linux&#x2F;man-pages&#x2F;man3&#x2F;res_query.3.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;man7.org&#x2F;linux&#x2F;man-pages&#x2F;man3&#x2F;res_query.3.html</a>')
