He had an iron-clad alibi, but the police and FBI weren&#x27;t convinced. In court one of the bank tellers said Talley definitely wasn&#x27;t the robber. Nonetheless Talley lost his job, his wife and his family and was held in prison for months:<p>&quot;LOSING FACE: How a Facial Recognition Mismatch Can Ruin Your Life&quot;<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;theintercept.com&#x2F;2016&#x2F;10&#x2F;13&#x2F;how-a-facial-recognition-mismatch-can-ruin-your-life&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;theintercept.com&#x2F;2016&#x2F;10&#x2F;13&#x2F;how-a-facial-recognition...</a><p>FTFA:<p>&quot;Talley said he was held for nearly two months in a maximum security pod and was released only after his public defender obtained his employerâ€™s surveillance records. In a time-stamped audio recording from 11:12 a.m. on the day of the May robbery, Talley could be heard at his desk trying to sell mutual funds to a potential client.&quot;<p>Today Talley is still trying to claw his way back to normalcy.<p>In the outstanding book &quot;Hello World&quot; Hannah Fry examines Talley&#x27;s story as part of a chapter on crime, AI and facial recognition. Reading Fry&#x27;s book convinced me that facial recognition software simply does not work well enough to use in police work. As Fry says:<p><i>&quot;If you&#x27;re searching for a particular criminal in digital line-up of millions...the best-case scenario is that you won&#x27;t find the right person one in six times...&quot;</i>. That is not nearly good enough for law enforcement and the courts.<p>&quot;Hello World&quot; by Hannah Fry<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Hello-World-Hannah-Fry&#x2F;dp&#x2F;0857525255" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Hello-World-Hannah-Fry&#x2F;dp&#x2F;0857525255</a>')
