A lot of film workers talk about their favorite directors as &quot;knowing exactly what they want&quot; or &quot;having a clear vision,&quot; but it&#x27;s harder to know how they get what they want, or how they express their vision, or how they navigate situations where their vision is wrong or conflicts with someone else&#x27;s. Or simply how they do that at 4am at the end of a 14-hour work day. I like the stories about how Tarantino will make everyone say &quot;because we love making movies&quot; as a rallying cry. I wish there were more stories like that.')
