Intel macs (at least the one I checked), along with most x86 laptops and desktops, transfer 128 bits at a time.<p>&gt; Apparently, this alone seems to account for a lot of the M1&#x27;s perf wins â€” see e.g. the explanation under &quot;Geekbench, Single-Core&quot; here<p>That&#x27;s a vague and general statement that site always says, so I wouldn&#x27;t put much stock into it.')
