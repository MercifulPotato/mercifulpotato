Regardless of whether you use docker or even if you use containers at all, your webapp should be able to restart if the connection to the database fails or is interrupted for any reason.<p>You would have the same problem if you used supervisord for example. The general solution is to auto-retry the connection until it comes back up, or hard fail and auto-restart the entire app in the event of a hard failure (e.g. with restart: on-failure or autorestart=true).')
