Western ideals triumph all the eastern ones in terms of attractiveness. They&#x27;re like drugs, unsustainable (especially with consumption), but everyone sees them once and gets hooked. The U.S. rules the western ideals.<p>I don&#x27;t see China having the influence that Hollywood had. There will not be a Chinese equivalent of McDonalds, KFC etc either with their own food that people of other culture would buy.<p>What we might see is a rise of preferential trade agreements without the WTO. China is catching up in semiconductors and aeronautics. It&#x27;s a matter of time, and I would give them a decade.<p>But the west will still rule in terms of art and culture. East&#x2F;Asia will rule with technology.<p>And this will be the century of intense competition. Evan Spiegel already said it and his assessment, I think he is right on mark. Yet to be seen if it turns out to be another century of humiliation for China or is it America&#x27;s turn (yeah it&#x27;s harsh remarks, but you can&#x27;t really cover it up anymore).<p>No guaranteed wins for either side. Whoever gets complacent loses.')
