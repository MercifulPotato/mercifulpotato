You&#x27;re supporting my point. I&#x27;m saying testing should be directly related to the position.<p>If someone doesn&#x27;t need to do binary math or write complex sorting algos from scratch you don&#x27;t test those, just like how you wouldn&#x27;t ask an athlete the mundane questions I posted above. You might ask high level questions to demonstrate knowledge of sorting, but not ask someone to implement that algo from scratch.<p>If someone is trying out for the NFL they&#x27;re not going to have to demonstrate baseball skills, how their shoes are made, engineering questions about how the stadium is built, what software should be used for the ticketing system, or any other questions unrelated to the position. You have them to demonstrate skills directly related to the talents they need to fill their role, like standard field drills.')
