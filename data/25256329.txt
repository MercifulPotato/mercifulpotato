Sharia law in Indonesia? What do they have to do with India? I wish you would google these things before posting such bizarre notions.<p>The word secular was only inserted into the Indian constitution in 1977. How did it inspire Indonesian &quot;secularism&quot;? As for the vaunted Indonesian secularism you tout - is it letting the other religions live and practice or actually allowing them to prosper? How many non-muslims reach higher office in Indonesia. How many non-muslims in Indonesia have a shot at becoming president?<p>Once a country&#x27;s population reaches more than 40-50% Islamic, Sharia law and eventual annihilation of the non-muslim population is just a matter of time. The data shows this again and again - Copts in Egypt, Northern Nigeria, Hindus in Kashmir, Bangladesh, Turkey (Armenians&#x2F;Assyrians&#x2F;Greeks), Iraq (Assyrians)......<p>The Jews of Europe developed into a professional class because of forced urbanization in Europe.  They were very desirable immigrants in the 16th century like the highly educated technology class that is courted by every country. What about the pogroms against Jews that were prevelant in most of Arabia from Morocco to the Arabian peninsula? The Arabic pogroms against Jews were less severe than European pogroms against Jews but hardly a virtue.<p>Islam explicitly sanctions capture, trading and sexual slavery of non-muslim women and trading and ownership of slaves in general. Did you know historians have compiled price indices of the price of non-muslim women sold in the markets of the Ottoman Empire over hundreds of years? Sexual slavery for women and non-muslim men being castrated was the norm till Ataturk (20th century!) and about 50% of the boys died during castration. If you want to talk of the Ottoman Empire as a beacon of tolerance you can watch this truly disturbing video of slavery in Islam and the Ottoman empire [1]. On second thought, don&#x27;t watch the video as it is truly disturbing.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=XIjPPRf0YZk&amp;t" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=XIjPPRf0YZk&amp;t</a>')
