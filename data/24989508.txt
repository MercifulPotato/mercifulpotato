I’m working at a well-funded stealth company based out of LA (remote friendly). We create technology to help restaurants, especially to adapt to current macro trends such as the rise of food delivery. We’ve hit product-market fit and are now looking to expand our growth team.\nIf you’re a self-starter and have a background in technology, banking, or consulting, I’d love to chat! Our team is currently a close-knit group of three, and we pride ourselves on being highly analytical and scrappy. Please feel free to reach out - santhoshnarayan [at] gmail [dot] com')
