You don&#x27;t get to decide for others what speech they have access to. It&#x27;s actually absolutely none of your business what conversations others are having, and what debates they&#x27;re engaging in.<p>You can also ignore advertising and social media in very much the same way you ignore nudity. Hate speech is not &quot;piped&quot; into our eyes and ears. Is there lots of it? Yes. Are you forced to engage with it? No. You don&#x27;t report your cousin Dave to the morality police for racist or sexist comments over the dinner table, despite the fact that you&#x27;re less likely to avoid hearing it than the hate speech on social media.')
