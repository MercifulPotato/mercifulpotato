I go to the 1 and 2 star reviews.  If they are things like the weather was bad, the prices are too high or the waiter was rude to me, I assume the place is pretty good.  People without much taste love places with cheap food and extremely polite and fast service.  I like good food.<p>Because reviews are sometimes fake, and often from people who don&#x27;t know much or have a lot to compare to, the most useful thing is to filter for when people complain about what you don&#x27;t care about.')
