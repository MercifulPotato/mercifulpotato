Illegal and wrong, mind you, but hardly a terrorist attack that it&#x27;s being painted as. A group of kooks and extremists who should have, and could have, been kept out by proper policing.  The Capitol police really screwed up.<p>Actually in a way it&#x27;s good that it happened; exposed some major security holes.  Not good that they shot an unarmed woman, though.')
