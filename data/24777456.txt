I see an uphill battle for twitter, facebook et al to get new people to join and even moreso for people to rejoin. But that&#x27;s what they get for not really moderating (I mean they have enough users that could do their job and would be willing to do it for free but instead leave it to the algos. Well, maybe one day there will be a good moderating algorithm that doesn&#x27;t kill their short-term ad-numbers..).')
