Item(by='devin', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608012040, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25427272, text='&gt; Persistent memory brings new challenges to persistent hash tables in both performance (scalability) and functionality. We identify that the key is to reduce both unnecessary PM reads and writes, whereas prior work solely focused on reducing PM writes and ignored many practical issues such as PM management and concurrency control, and traded off instant recovery capability. Our solution is Dash, a holistic approach to scalable PM hashing. Dash combines both new and existing techniques, including (1) fingerprinting to reduce PM accesses, (2) optimistic locking, and (3) a novel bucket load balancing technique. Using Dash, we adapted extendible hashing and linear hashing to work on PM. On real Intel Optane DCPMM, Dash scales with up to ∼3.9× better performance than prior state- of-the-art, while maintaining desirable properties, including high load factor and sub-second level instant recovery.')
