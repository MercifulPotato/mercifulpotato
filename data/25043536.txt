I contacted them about a scam online car &quot;dealership&quot; that was just stealing money from people for fake cars, and despite ample evidence they wouldn&#x27;t do anything about it, and wouldn&#x27;t even allow me to leave a warning review since I had admitted to them that I hadn&#x27;t bought anything from or personally visited this business. (Which obviously I couldn&#x27;t, since it was fake.)')
