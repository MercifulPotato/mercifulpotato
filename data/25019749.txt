As I understand it there is a register of absentee voters, ballots are generated (sometimes with privacy sleeves&#x2F;envelopes etc) and printed with barcodes that tie ballots back to a specific voter ID up until the point that information is separated for counting.<p>Given knowledge of how that system works and controls put around it I doubt any such vulnerabilities could exist that could be found by statistical analysis that isn&#x27;t already being done...<p>I also think you missed the point of my last sentence which is that you could consider the actual ballot system a lot like AES or any other cryto system you might be familiar with.<p>Cracking the crypto system is stupidly hard because a ton of time was invested making that so.\nInstead attacking the stuff -around- the crypto system is likely to prove much more fruitful. i.e social engineering, side channel attacks<p>In the same way the attacks I listed above elicit the desired effect (a certain candidate having an unfair advantage) but without attacking the actual ballot system itself (which is likely far too difficult).<p>Essentially it&#x27;s a case of lower hanging fruit, you don&#x27;t need voter fraud to &quot;steal&quot; an election.')
