One employee can keep up with all drive replacements, hardware setup, etc with time to spare.  Drives aren&#x27;t super power hungry, so any old office building is suitable.  Encrypt the drive contents on another site so you don&#x27;t need 24&#x2F;7 security.   Total system cost was sub $1M with a running cost of $500k&#x2F;year and storage of 50PB.  Bargain.<p>Now that GDPR applies, most companies need to rewrite backups every 30 days anyway to remove data where a GDPR deletion request applies.   That tips the scale further in the direction of always spinning hard drives.  Just hook up 64 drives to each machine, make sure you only do streaming writes of 1Gb+ files, do some ZFS raid-like scheme, and away you go.')
