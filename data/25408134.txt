Human remember things through story. Initial phase of the vocabulary acquisition is very difficult since you need to remember one word at the time and it is very easy to forget. Once you have enough vocabulary to read sentence and progress to understand story then you have better chance to retain vocabulary at faster pace and less likely to forget the word.<p>Listening is also a skill that people overlook. You need to train the ear to pick up how people pronounce a specific language otherwise it will just sound like noise. Let me give you an example: I have a 4 years old son. He likes cartoon. English speaking cartoon sounds like garbled noise to him. I know because he try to recreate the conversation and it came out like garbled noise. I prompt him with some word with Chinese translation before he watch video then gradually he can recognize the word in the video and gave me correct translation after I asked him.')
