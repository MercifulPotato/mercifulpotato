It is a very well run country that is clean, safe and modern. That said, I thought expats here can&#x27;t really make use of most of the public health, housing and education services? Those that I know also are all sending their kids to international schools and have private health (thankfully the private health packages that come with employment are decent).<p>Have to agree on the tropical weather front. As someone who has lived in Australia close to my whole life you would expect I&#x27;d be used to heat, but it&#x27;s the humidity that kills me. Australian heat is like being on a frying pan, Singapore heat is like being in an oven.')
