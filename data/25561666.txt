The reason? This widget used an Iframe postMessage, but appropriately specified the singular sandboxed domain. As expected, we never were able to speak with a human at Google- they just sent my clients customers intimidating emails about a security flaw on their websites.<p>Seeing Google abuse the postMessage API with a wildcard argument after this fiasco is maddening! If only they were held to their own arbitrary and vague standards.')
