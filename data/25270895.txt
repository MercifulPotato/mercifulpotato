It&#x27;s got a lot of market share and its core product - text chat and messaging - remains pretty solid, despite some missteps.<p>I haven&#x27;t had that level of unreliability issue with text, though I _definitely_ have with calls.<p>I would agree that Slack had an opportunity to compete with Zoom and others because of COVID that it seems to have relatively squandered. Slack calls are still less reliable and usable than Zoom calls for many purposes. You can&#x27;t dial in with a phone, you can&#x27;t mute other people&#x27;s video or even audio (though I&#x27;m not sure Zoom offers client-side video muting either), Slack&#x27;s screenshare is less reliable and doesn&#x27;t have as many options for limiting what you share, and so on.<p>So I guess I&#x27;d say it fulfilled its core promise: &quot;decent enterprise real-time communications&quot;, but it&#x27;s the failure to innovate or even keep up with competing services in some important areas that&#x27;s the issue. Maybe that&#x27;s splitting hairs?')
