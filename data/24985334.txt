Start with Android since that is far more amenable to customisation than iOS. Install an AOSP-derived distribution like LineageOS. Don&#x27;t install the &#x27;gapps&#x27; (Google Apps), use F-Droid and Aurora Store for any &#x27;apps&#x27; you need. Truth be told the need for &#x27;apps&#x27; is debatable with the advent of useable web versions.
