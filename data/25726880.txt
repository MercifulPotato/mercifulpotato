AFAIK it&#x27;s now quite difficult to break. I sort of understand the bank decision on this. There is a lot of malware on Android and users are easily tricked into installing some side-loaded APKs, and there is also a lot of hidden malware on Google Play which is hard to find (e.g. it downloads a payload after the store review is done). This would be a disaster since on Android you can for example use accessibility services to read any input from the user and also control the device. So you can circumvent 2FA and make transactions on behalf of the user on the device. There has been a lot banking malware on Google Play. I think they are getting it a bit under control now, but it&#x27;s still very dangerous.')
