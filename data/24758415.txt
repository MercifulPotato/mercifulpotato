Item(by='Pick-A-Hill2019', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602530854, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24755348, text='I&#x27;m debating about whether or not to post this but if it makes it this far then I opted to do so.<p>A year or so back I stayed over with some extended family, one of which was &#x27;In to IT and earns a living from it. During that time (using the I.T guy&#x27;s network) I noticed that one of my phones was eating through the battery at a crazy-stupid-mad rate. A quick check showed that this particular phone had begun uploading a metric shit-ton of data on an otherwise normally asymetric data profile (in other words Data Uploaded vs Data Downloaded Ratio).<p>A check with the &#x27;family IT guy&#x27; confirmed that he had Remoted In to a high value clients&#x27; system to trouble shoot something at around the same time that one of my phones began to furiously upload any and every thing on its&#x27; memory card.<p>Sounds like one of those &quot;Cool Story Bro&quot; types stories right?<p>All I will say is that because one of my &#x27;Low Hanging Fruit&#x27; thangs got p0wned I was able to alert the $corp of the problem (since the probe originated on their end not mine).<p>As with all things in Life, YMMV.')
