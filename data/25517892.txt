Back in the 90&#x27;s, we used to update the firmware over the air.  We could rewrite anything anywhere on the phone.  Officially we did not do this, not because of any secrets or conspiracy... The fear was that if customers found out we could do this, it would be a support nightmare and not cost sustainable.  We made the business decision to not update the phones over the air to avoid the risk of bricking any of them.  As a result the phones would become out of date and people would eventually buy new ones.  The reason I mention this is that if you can rewrite the firmware and reboot the phone, then you can intercept anything related to encryption, keys, passwords, etc...  I have no idea what capabilities are in place now, but I would be very surprised if they regressed from what we could do in the 90&#x27;s.')
