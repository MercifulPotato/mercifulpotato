The stephen meyer &#x27;intelligent design&#x27;, david berlinski &#x27;doubting darwin&#x27;, ect arguments. The hoover institute did a piece a few years ago on youtube.<p>James Tour has a great series on origin of life that shows in the hard tasks of applying biology we are way off knowing how any of this works. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;zU7Lww-sBPg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;zU7Lww-sBPg</a><p>The counter arguments to stephen meyer&#x27;s idea a &#x27;heirarchy of information guides dna changes&#x27; seem to be good conjectures and nobody really has the next step in the narrative tied down yet. Some say the cell is the powerhouse of life and sidestep the necessity of explaining dna changes. Some stick to the evolved life like Lee Cronin on the Unbelievable podcast.<p>Just curious if anyone has a stab in the dark for the next step in the narrative. A heirarchy seems like a red herring to me, cause it just leads back to an energy based universe that produces information, but I&#x27;m not qualified enough to have a say.')
