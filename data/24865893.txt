I can see people blaming Adobe if they did provide a 10 yr old software without security updates.<p>Talking about software that no longer works, I tried network recovery on a 2016 Mac. 2016 Mac is programmed to download only Mojave. And Mojave can&#x27;t be installed on a Mac that had Catalina at <i>some point</i> in the past (even after a complete disk wipe). It took me a whole day to find another Mac, download offline installer, buy a new USB stick (because the installer was a bit over 8G) and get it reinstalled.')
