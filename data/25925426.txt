Item(by='mewse', descendants=None, kids=[25925573], score=None, time=1611733546, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25925364, text='I use a split keyboard which not only doesn’t have a row of F-keys, it doesn’t even have a number row;  it’s three by six keys on each half.<p>I use chorded keystrokes for F-keys.  I have a layer key (named “Lower”, and located where the ‘Windows’ key is on normal keyboards);  hold that down with your left thumb and the middle row of keys on the left split (caps lock -&gt; g, under a qwerty layout) become F1-&gt;F6.  And the bottom row of keys on the left split (left shift-&gt;v) become F7-&gt;F12.<p>I actually find it a whole heap easier to hit those key combinations than trying to find various physical F-keys three rows away from the home row;  I think I’d actually set up a macro like this even if I was using a full-sized keyboard;  I just find it to be easier.<p>(although I don’t actually use F7-&gt;F12 for anything, normally;  that might be a little awkward in terms of finger positioning and I’d think about maybe moving them over to the right side of the split if I used them with any regularity)')
