The founder&#x27;s ex-spouse can claim a share of their ownership in the company they founded, but not a share of the status of founder, nor corporate offices. (The CEO&#x27;s ex-spouse will likely end up with a decent percentage of the stock the CEO owns, but 0% of the actual corporate office and job title of CEO.)')
