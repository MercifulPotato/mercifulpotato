For it to be an inflation hedge on the scale of gold, the price has to rise tremendously.<p>this same calculation can be done for whatever potential usefulness you come up with. Like if you think it can replace the USD as a reserve currency for setting international oil trades, the market cap of bitcoin has to get exponentially bigger just to handle the scale of those markets.<p>now, i don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s likely to become the world&#x27;s reserve currency, certainly not anytime soon, but if it were you can see where it would have to have more value to be able to do so. I do think it is a great inflation hedge, and I think lots of money managers are going to start recommending to client to put 1-3-5% of their portfolios into bitcoin as a hedge. That&#x27;s happening right now. IF that goes mainstream, the market cap of bitcoin HAS to go up significantly to handle all that new demand, given that the supply is capped.')
