No number of strategic or tactical decisions will change whether a piece of software is ready to ship. Uno going all-in on CoreRT would have meant they shipped a working product later.<p>For context, the Blazor team started with their own interpreter compiled to WASM (via emscripten) instead of using <i>either</i> Mono or CoreRT - because shipping and getting user feedback is really important, and you can&#x27;t do that while waiting for the ideal tech to be ready. It was swapped out later.<p>CoreRT is pretty cool tech but I rarely encounter anyone using it. Hopefully that will change in the future. The only CoreRT-based production app I know of is Streets of Rage 4 and it&#x27;s a very recent release.')
