Them appearing where it shouldn&#x27;t be possible for a car to show up also amplifies the issue (you don&#x27;t need to look over your shoulders in a single lane street, but bikes easily show up there).<p>To be honest, I&#x27;d trust software even less if I was a bike rider riding in a European (or Chinese, Phillipine...) city, but that&#x27;s just me :)')
