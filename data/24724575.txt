Make an API call to the server so it can render the focused Graph section of the page now? Or is it supposed to hook gracefully into some client state that is a part of the aforementioned thin client?<p>Either way it sounds like instead of having one async stage at application load (which can be optimized with multiple techniques), you are proposing that each user action has to wait for a server to receive the request, render HTML, return it to the client, and either refresh the page or inject the server-rendered HTML.<p>I fail to see why this is better than an SPA. Especially given that there&#x27;s context menus and workflow actions everywhere.')
