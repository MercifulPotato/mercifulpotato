So that part of your argument doesn&#x27;t hold.<p>The reason that IP addresses are scarce is not because it&#x27;s not possible to invent a new protocol, but because everyone else uses IP so only IP addresses are useful.<p>Spectrum might initially appear to be fundamentally scarce, but even then, people can invent other ways to communicate (and they did! copper wires! IP!).<p>These are all examples of networks - their value is proportional to their popularity. So yes, anybody can create a new cryptocurrency, but currencies are mainly valuable because of who you can use them with. Dollars are valuable because so many people accept them!<p>So if one cryptocurrency really gains traction, it will be hard for any other cryptocurrency to compete unless it offers something fundamentally new and different.')
