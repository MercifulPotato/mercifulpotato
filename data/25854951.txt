For example, the democrat congressman from my district in MD sent out an email talking about trying to fight the epidemic of gun violence by banning assault rifles and high capacity magazines, even though pistols are used in the vast majority of shootings. A few years ago the MD state democrats also blocked some laws that would have imposed harsher punishment on people who use handguns in crimes because they said it would disproportionately affect minorities. They didn&#x27;t want to look like they weren&#x27;t doing anything about gun violence though, so they banned bump stocks, even though they have never been used to commit a crime in MD, and the ATF says the functionality can easily be replicated with a rubber band or belt.')
