(Sorry to stray onto topics not related to optogenetics. I hope it doesn&#x27;t irk him that Elon Musk has steered&#x2F;captured public consciousness regarding neuroscience.)<p>To stray into sci-fi territory a bit, if money gets poured into the field, is there a chance we might see the Matrix or brain uploads in our lifetimes? And if not in our lifetime, is it ever achievable?<p>I&#x27;m extremely skeptical, but human BCI could be the best&#x2F;most important development in our history. Any problem gradient with a chance of unlocking immortality should be leaned into. It&#x27;s way more important than Angry Birds or iOS N+1.<p>With regard to studying already-alive organisms (we can&#x27;t splice in the genes required for optogenetics), are there non-invasive techniques that can produce signal from humans? Deuterium NMR cerebral imaging seems low resolution and awkward to deploy.<p>Could ML &#x2F; signal processing increase the resolution of EEGs? Could we ever extract video signal from an EEG?<p>Can an EEG induce perception into a brain?<p>With regard to optogenetics, what are the things currently being studied with the technique? What pressing questions can it be used to answer? Are there any improvements to the technique that could push it further?<p>Sorry for so many off-topic questions, but I&#x27;d love to know what an expert in the field thinks. I&#x27;d especially like to get a grasp of the future of the field.')
