Ice cream, as a food that is very close to neutral in pH and without much in the way of preservatives, is a common source of listeria bacteria. To prevent serious health issues, the machine must be sanitized regularly. As I understand it, the process is involved, and any given McDonalds may not have a person with the time and skills to complete it. So the machine shuts itself down rather than produce an unsafe product. This is translated to &quot;broken&quot; when you order ice cream.')
