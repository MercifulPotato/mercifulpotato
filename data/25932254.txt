Claiming it as a true statement is of course problematic (especially &quot;aught to&quot;), but I have discovered a truly remarkable proof of this statement which an HN comment is too small to contain ;)<p>Kidding aside, as I mentioned earlier I suggest the antidote to crony or any other false beliefs is an uncompromising and unrelenting skepticism in every belief. This neti-neti approach can continue until what remains is not a belief anymore, but a recognition of something that is prior to any belief.')
