Plastic would still be used where it is economical, or where it is really needed, but cardboard, paper, and other materials that can be recycled or reused would be cheaper and more common. Glass jars or wax paper could both work, but currently the glass is more expensive than plastic, and wax paper would probably give a shorter shelf life. And these taxes don&#x27;t need to be for 100% of the cost to change behavior.')
