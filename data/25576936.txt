Syylex promised the same lifetime as M-DISC (unlike archival grade DVDs). I think the results are good enough to see M-DISC either doesn&#x27;t live up to the expectations or archival grade DVDs exceed the expectations. Either way, bad news for M-DISC. If Syylex hadn&#x27;t bankrupted, it would have been the best option of course.')
