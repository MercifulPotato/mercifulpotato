This meant as long as you had a semi-centralised site&#x2F; information architecture and a good team on the Perl scheduler and load balancing; any internal content subteam could go off and build what they wanted, with whatever CMS&#x2F;hand tools they had, as long as it spat out a static staging site the Perl scheduler could handle. \nThis model&#x2F;process&#x2F; org structure way out-performed the rest of the UK internet in uptime&#x2F;performance&#x2F;cost, and it let a thousand flowers bloom; but only for a one-way read only system - no custom content&#x2F; ads&#x2F; offers&#x2F; personalisation - probably hard to even do centralised log analysis.<p>&lt;NB agree with Lattelazy - do let the BBC keep innovating, they have come up with some great stuff in content and tech, so keep keep giving them the chance&gt;')
