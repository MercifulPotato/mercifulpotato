Those all tended to have fiber, and anything before did not, and they had no plans to install it.  I pay $65 per month for 940mbps up and down from Centurylink, and it&#x27;s been as advertised so far.<p>Unfortunately, the cable company usually offers some ludicrous 500mbps (burst) download &#x2F; 5mbps upload connection that people are willing to accept for cheaper, so if the phone company comes in and pays to install fiber and charge accordingly for the new fiber runs, insufficient people would switch to the fiber to make the numbers work since they are okay with the shitty cable company connection.')
