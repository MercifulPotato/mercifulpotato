I am not going to refute your points directly, I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re necessarily relevant for the crux of your argument and do a fair bit of obfuscation. In your post it seems more that you are arguing against philosophy - not for &quot;philosophers needing stem professionals.&quot;<p>&gt; which was simply that professional philosophers need STEM professionals in order to do philosophy, perhaps more so than STEM professionals need philosophy to do good engineering&#x2F;science.<p>&quot;good&quot; engineering&#x2F;science - what is that? Define it.<p>I just don&#x27;t buy the argument that philosophy needs stem to do its job. Not knowing how every algorithm works doesn&#x27;t mean you can&#x27;t discuss its impacts, effects, if it&#x27;s ethical or not.')
