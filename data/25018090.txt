For example, there is no way to represent a Record&#x2F;Map type, so you have to transform it to an array of key-value pairs on the way down to the browser (and untransform it the way up). There’s an Int type, but no Long&#x2F;uint etc. For any CRUD application, you have to define your types twice because Mutations can only contain Inputs, not Types. There is no union type for Inputs. You can’t express recursive types... I could go on and on.<p>SQL would have been such a better choice. It’s been battle tested for decades and is so much more expressive.')
