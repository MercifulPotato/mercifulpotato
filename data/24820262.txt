A box on a web page<p>2. Customers write words<p>3. Your software return a list of web pages that contain said words plus relevant ads.<p>Since sometime 2007 - 2009 and Google has dropped the requirement that results actually contains the word and it is extremely annoying.<p>I use DDG these days. They are just as bad, not better or worse but it is faster to add !g to a DDG search than to retype the query in DDG aftee first trying Google.<p>First other search engine to recreate the Google experience from before 2007 can charge me $10 a month and show ads on top of it and still get me as a happy customer.')
