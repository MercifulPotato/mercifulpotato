They make amazing hardware, and their latest silicon releases practically make me want to buy their computers again.<p>Their software is shit though, and their walled garden, and insistence on using apple programming languages and IDEs for development, practically ensures that third party software will either not exist or be shit as well. There are only a handful of software shops that make decent software for apple, and they are all fully specialized on apple and therefore do not make software that plays nice with collaborators on other computers, nor used on a cloud server, etc. And if there actually exists better software from third parties that competes with apple software, you can forget about it ever being fully integrated. &quot;Hey Siri, navigate to city hall using Google maps&quot;. Yeah right.')
