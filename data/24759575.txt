I am trying to argue against your original thesis which I will paraphrase as “a quiz detecting incompetence is actually detecting stage fright” <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24758092" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24758092</a><p>Anyone who thinks XML is a valid solution to a priority queue is incompetent (even if they were prompted by the recruiter as said in sibling comment). <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24758234" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24758234</a><p>Stage fright is real, and it is unavoidable in an interview i.e. even if coding quizzes were removed then the problem still exists, so arguing just against quizzes is silly IMHO.<p>&gt; everyone claims are acceptable casualties of the system<p>I would say instead that casualties are unavoidable - interviews must be imperfect because time is limited (regardless of how much we may try to improve interviews.)<p>&gt; systematically discriminate against people who tend to experience extreme nervousness during auditions but otherwise perform normally on the job.<p>Interviews are by definition systematically discriminatory: one is trying to select one person. The data is dirty, and if you make interviews more inclusive on one dimension you are discriminating against others on that dimension. They must be systematic as per anti-discrimination regulations, or else you will get sued to your cost.<p>How to improve interviews to reduce false negatives is hard, but I think you are oversimplifying it down to “quizzes are bad”, which is at odds with many smart professionals who say they are good for detecting incompetent developers. You have not suggested any improvement that detects incompetence.<p>&gt; Note that this thread started with &quot;Everyone loves to read and write about how developer interviewing is flawed, but no one wants to go out on a limb and make suggestions about how to improve it.&quot;<p>I can also cherry pick a quote further up-thread: “To many people, the coding interviews is a chance to break the traditional mold and land a job that would have been out of reach otherwise.”')
