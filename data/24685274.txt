I made this decision to centralize the command and audio communication methods and also to easily support web targets. For Gstreamer, it should be possible to use the same method as for the Librespot (Spotify) and Shairport (Airplay source) intergration: capturing the stdout of a program. I didn&#x27;t test it yet but there is the `! filesink location=&#x2F;dev&#x2F;stdout` option to do just that. I might also add a way to read on a named pipe (which should be easy to do) if its needed.')
