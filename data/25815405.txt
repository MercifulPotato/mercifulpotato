That’s what we emitted in 1990. Since then we increased emissions by 2.5-3. So we need to divide by 3. And more than that, because what is already emitted is already warming the atmosphere.<p>So we can EITHER choose between heating our house, having a car or travelling once London-NYC per year.<p>We won’t reach it if everyone is finding excuses.<p>- You need to isolate your house so that human heating is enough to warm it up.<p>- Why is anyone even living so far up north. Barely no-one was living in Sweden in 1900, so why do we have to invent schemes so that you can do it (at great energy expense) when clearly, nature wouldn’t allow you to do it?<p>- Unless all the figures of IPCC scientists are fake, which I’m starting to doubt about, because I’ve studied feminism and I know it is possible to persuade an entire country of false figures. Let’s call that the “mass science” effect, where processes can be twisted in order to gain political leverage.<p>But if the “mass science effect” isn’t here, you sure shouldn’t think that using mining as a decent offline activity for your computer is a viable solution.')
