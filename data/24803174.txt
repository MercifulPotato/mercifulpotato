The first prequel was terrible though. I recently watched the movies in Machete order with my kids and it was pretty good. I probably won&#x27;t do it again but I don&#x27;t regret it. The most recent Disney ones have been utterly dire. I skipped the last one completely and nothing Ive heard about it inspires me to give it a chance.')
