Item(by='dahart', descendants=None, kids=[25472030], score=None, time=1608325061, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25471493, text='&gt; Do you work in academia now?<p>Nope.<p>Yes, there is value of being able to get the first job. Though the value isn&#x27;t really quantifiable, and it changes over time. Plus the first job typically has other requirements besides a degree, all of which are valuable for the purposes of not getting rejected before an interview. I was just curious where &quot;90%&quot; comes from. (I&#x27;m comfortable with it being symbolic, representing your feeling that it&#x27;s a majority. I just wanted to tease that out and clarify.)<p>To your original point, for better or worse, incomes and lifetime earnings are statistically higher for college grads. I didn&#x27;t realize the difference was as high as it is, but the Fed recently published that in the U.S., incomes are roughly double for bachelor&#x27;s degrees over non-graduates, and roughly triple for advanced degrees. That means that there is a large financial value wrapped up in getting the degree, one way or another. It might have a lot to do with networking, and it might have a lot to do with the credential and social signaling. I&#x27;m certain there&#x27;s some of both. But this value is definitely a must to know about before deciding to forego a degree, and probably a very good thing to keep in mind before choosing an online program over an in-person one.')
