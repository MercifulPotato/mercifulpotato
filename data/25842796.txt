You&#x27;re just part of the 50% that needs an official office with other co-workers there. And there is nothing wrong with it. Personally I am on the other 50% but I do it for over 13 years now - started freelancing from home in Dec 2007 and never looked back.<p>What is typically now is the wrong response all companies always had. Before whole covid situation companies wanted all boots on the ground at the office, even when 50% of the people were more productive at home. Now it&#x27;s the reverse situation where the &quot;office&quot; style people are less productive.<p>The right response would be to let people that want to work from home, and are productive that way to do it, and the other ones to come to office if that&#x27;s what they want. That would maximize the productivity, but until a big company would actually make this case it will not be the norm in our industry.')
