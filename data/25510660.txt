Item(by='mlyle', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608668086, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25510364, text='&gt; How come today, for home use, WiFi seems to exceed the price&#x2F;performance of hard-wired? Is the Ethernet standard lagging, or lack of interest&#x2F;demand, or some more physical barrier?<p>&quot;Per-port&quot;, 2.5gbps is cheaper than fast wireless.  But one fast wireless interface on a router can work in a star configuration with many devices.  You can get a 2.5gbase-T card for $30.  You can get an 8 port 2.5gbase-T switch with 2 10gbit SFP+ uplinks for $450.  This will run circles around any wireless network in practice.<p>Decent 802.11ax adds more than $30 to your device in most cases.  And a router with good 802.11ax is still a couple hundred bucks.<p>It&#x27;d be even cheaper, but 1gbps is good enough for &#x27;most everyone, so we have to deal with repurposing low-end business stuff instead of consumer gear.')
