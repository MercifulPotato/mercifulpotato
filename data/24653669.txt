If our ideas are good, don&#x27;t we want the most number of people to know them?<p>Do you think the tools for broad communication and peer practitioner communication could be very different because they have different aims? Spreading findings in cutting-edge research as broadly as possible is perhaps in some cases not the primary goal.<p>That is not to say we should in any way that we should gatekeep knowledge!
