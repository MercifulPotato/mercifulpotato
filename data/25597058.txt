There was literally no working guides or people posting with my exact issue, but tons of posts about other people having a nightmare of a time.<p>In the end I figured out I had to go find this one file&#x2F;library nvidia had moved around between versions of drivers&#x2F;cuda even though documentation suggested they hadn&#x27;t and I was using the versions that were supposed to work fine. In the end, fixing it was either by setting an environment variable because the default path was wrong or editing the path in a config file. I&#x27;m not remembering which now.')
