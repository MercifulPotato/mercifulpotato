I know nothing about subvocal mic hardware or even how the audio sounds, but if anyone has a viable answer to this, especially with a good hardware option, please reach out to me.<p>Basically, if someone can point me to a solid subvocal speech recognition tech demo and a reliable subvocal mic (note the sibling comment that indicates generic subvocal mics are frustrating and fall out of alignment easily): I think I could train production subvocal speech models, tune support for the audio style in my app, and ship to the public in a matter of weeks.')
