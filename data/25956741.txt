Here&#x27;s a filter roughly matching your criteria:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;boardgamearena.com&#x2F;gamelist?section=all&amp;playernumber=5&amp;playtime=11&amp;complexity=2&amp;mechanism=0&amp;theme=0&amp;specific=0" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;boardgamearena.com&#x2F;gamelist?section=all&amp;playernumber...</a><p>From the top options presented I can recommend<p>Kingdom Builder - incredibly easy to learn strategy game with just enough depth to keep it interesting over multiple plays<p>Love Letter - one of ourmyregular games to kick off a game night. Quick to pick up, quick to play, and fun.<p>Coup - similar in many ways to Love Letter, but with bluffing, which makes it much more cut throat, but it plays quickly enough that no one gets angry, they just get back at you the next game.<p>Colt Express - exciting game with a unique &quot;programming&quot; like mechanic that&#x27;s very simple to pickup, and allows for some playfully grievous player interactions.<p>Gaia - underrated game that shares a lot of mechanics with the more popular Carcassone. Very strategic, and the advanced version amps up the competitiveness.<p>Carcassone - one of the most popular games around. Can also recommend Hunters &amp; Gatherers.<p>Stone Age &amp; Puerto Rico - great entry level worker placement games.<p>Granted, it doesn&#x27;t have every game imaginable (Catan, Munchkin, Risk) but its selection is large enough to find good games for just about any group.<p>If you want something more advanced, this doesn&#x27;t exactly fit your criteria, but I highly recommend Terra Mystica. One of my favorite games of all time.')
