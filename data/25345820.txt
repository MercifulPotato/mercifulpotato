As long as you&#x27;re getting benefit from Qt by distributing software using it you need to keep paying for it?<p>Development, distribution and usage are different things. I don&#x27;t have much of a problem with selling a subscription for the development environment, but for distribution and usage you should only need a (perpetual) runtime license, which you usually buy in bulk. AFAIK that&#x27;s how QNX does it, for instance.')
