Came to study an university degree and stayed after that.<p>If you&#x27;re pretty young and you work in FAANG then stay where you are and save money. When you get older and want to form a family then move here.<p>Another option is if you&#x27;re living in a poorer country and you want to pursue a degree (for EU people it&#x27;s free) or have a decent tech job (stress is the lowest here, pay is good if you don&#x27;t compare to FAANG). Spain is good to hang out and socialize but when it comes to work it&#x27;s usually miserable so it was an easy decision for me since I can visit the country often while my daily life has been simplified a lot.')
