Sure: there are plenty of great Discord communities for let&#x27;s say game dev, but searching a particular question on a Discord server is very complicated, and it can be even harder to keep track of the solution.<p>It&#x27;s usually easier to just ask the question again, and hope for an insightful answer, it&#x27;s also harder to gauge the quality of an answer: forums users have a reputation (for better or worse), I&#x27;d not treat an answer from a veteran with 5+ years of activity the same as one from someone who joined 2 days before.<p>I believe these issues are much more impactful than the fragmentation of communities itself.')
