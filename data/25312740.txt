I took one after the anesthesia wore off day 1, from then on only took Tylenol because the pain wasn’t that bad and I didn’t want the nausea.<p>Unfortunately night of day 3 pain was worse so I tried the Oxycodone again (it’s mixed with Tylenol so have to choose one or other). No nausea and an impressive night of sleep convinced me to start taking the opioid at nights and Tylenol for working hours.<p>But now it’s the night of day 5 and two hours after taking  OxyCodone has barely kicked in and not enough to sleep. I don’t know if it’s having an interaction with something I ate it my other medication (taken minutes before). But I can see why people up their dosages.')
