You can still have institutionalized slavery without that, like the Romans and a lot of other cultures throughout history. Slaves could be set free, could have semi-decent standards of living, while still being dehumanized. Or they could be treated brutally and enslaved for generations. The term seems to fit here in the broadest sense of the word.')
