Its only in Dutch though.<p>The icons above read: Timeline, Small Facts, 911 emergencies, News, Business, Bankruptcies, Wanted, Video, Buildings (literally &quot;look inside&quot;), Airbnb, Events, Permits<p>The icons are standardized on every city page, something I dig.<p>The timeline is shown by default.<p>People can click on their city&#x2F;town and even their neighborhood.<p>After I wrote this, I saw another one, Drimble [2]. I like that even better than Ozoo (the features seem to be on par I just prefer the UI and colours), but I haven&#x27;t used either TBH.<p>I don&#x27;t believe either of these is the one I heard on the podcast. Also, I&#x27;m not quite sure how these websites arrange the rights fair and square, and since we&#x27;re talking about local business and the little men I find that important. I think they get away with it by quoting, which falls under fair use, and then linking to the original source. That&#x27;s not exactly the same as your product, nor the one I heard in the podcast.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.oozo.nl&#x2F;gemeenten&#x2F;nieuws" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.oozo.nl&#x2F;gemeenten&#x2F;nieuws</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;drimble.nl" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;drimble.nl</a>')
