A glyph can consist of multiple codepoints, and then those can sometimes be standardized to other codepoints.  For instance, Unicode has codepoint U+00C4 for an A with a diaeresis (aka umlaut).  But it also has codepoints U+0041 U+0308 for an A with a combining diaeresis, which should then map to the combined U+00C4 for font rendering.')
