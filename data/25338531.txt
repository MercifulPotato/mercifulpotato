It is unknown if this is enough to account for enough permutations of traffic, but they&#x27;re calling it full self driving while using car owners as paying (!) beta testers.<p>AFAIK, no one is close to releasing an autonomous vehicle that can drive on par or better than an average human driver, but that several have a path to getting there.<p>I believe many companies can thrive until M&amp;A whittles down that list. I don&#x27;t think this is a first mover takes all kinda deal because safety will have to be proven over a long time allowing other entrants to prove their worth.')
