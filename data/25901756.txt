Like &quot;deleted&quot; groups, &quot;deleted&quot; contacts, &quot;deleted&quot; chats... meta links I can&#x27;t get rid off whatever I do. The worst is legacy groups I left, &quot;deleted&quot;, can&#x27;t even use or join anymore, but also can&#x27;t get rid of. They reappear every time I refresh the iPad app. Mind you, the group members are still visible, so I am really happy whistle-blowing, terrorism or crime isn&#x27;t my profession.<p>This made me really distrusting of Signal, when years old meta data popped up again. Like, have they lost some pointers or something? Can I even expect the data to be gone, when I delete my account for good? Doesn&#x27;t <i>feel</i> like privacy at all...')
