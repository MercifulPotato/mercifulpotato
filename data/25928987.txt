In a lot of cases, the update from Ryzen 4000 to Ryzen 5000 mobile is not super impressive (and certainly less so than Ryzen 3000 to Ryzen 4000 mobile, but more so than most of Intel&#x27;s previous generational improvements), and I do worry there&#x27;s not a big improvement in battery life, despite what AMD claims in this article.<p>I&#x27;ve also looked at some RTX 3070 results, and they are not blowing me away either. If anything, the best things to come out of 2021 laptops will probably be screen improvements, and in some cases (<i>ahem</i> Asus) better cooling solutions (though many Asus laptops still lacking webcams!)<p>I&#x27;m surprised that moving from 2 CCX to 1 CCX, doubling the L3 cache, and other Zen 3 improvements aren&#x27;t having a bigger effect on Ryzen mobile, but as seen here ( <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=RjFc5ZRtwP4" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=RjFc5ZRtwP4</a> ) in this direct comparison of Ryzen 7 5800H to Ryzen 7 4800H, some things that Intel was previously excelling at (like Excel ;)!) will now be better handled by AMD.')
