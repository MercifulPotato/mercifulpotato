The point is that poland is a slavic nation and hence far more closer to other slavic nations than to italy&#x2F;rome&#x2F;etc.<p>&gt; If we talking about cultural inspirations, we are much more influenced by ancient Rome and Greece, classical literature and arts than to other Slavic nations.<p>All slavic nations are more influenced by ancient rome and greece than each other because the slavic nations didn&#x27;t contribute much to literature&#x2F;arts until fairly recently. Russian leaders didn&#x27;t call themselves tsars ( russianized caesar ) for no reason. And it&#x27;s not an accident that cryllic alphabet looks awfully like the greek alphabet.<p>Your point is true of all northern europe really as northern europe didn&#x27;t produce any meaningful culture until the past few hundred years. Prior to that, northern europe had to rely on roman&#x2F;greek arts because northern europe was lacking in culture&#x2F;art.<p>Sure poland is more influenced by rome&#x2F;greece than by russia or ukraine. But that&#x27;s the same for russia&#x2F;ukraine. They are more &quot;inspired&quot; by rome&#x2F;greece than poland. Doesn&#x27;t change the fact that they are all slavic nations though.')
