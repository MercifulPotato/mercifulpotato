If it does, you would usually fallback to C&#x2F;C++&#x2F;Rust library doing the heavy lifting, when using &#x27;slow&#x27; languages, or just move the workload to async processes.<p>Web applications spend most of the time doing I&#x2F;O operations, where async programming makes a lot of sense. Async with PHP is still in its infancy, compared to Python, which has native support for it.')
