That seems wrong to me. I think it&#x27;s reasonable to allow companies to terminate service but they should give a reasonable time frame (e.g. 3-6 months) to migrate to a new platform.<p>[0]: Certainly I think this in cases where you have a personal relationship with the customer&#x2F;client, e.g. as a lawyer. It is less clear in the case where the service provided requires no real customer interaction as in AWS, where the services are all provided transparently, with no knowledge of who the customer is. But I don&#x27;t want to get hung up on this issue.')
