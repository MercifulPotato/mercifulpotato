Item(by='bsder', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604274628, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24958876, text='POWER was designed to be a compiler writer&#x27;s dream and has some sharp implementation corners.<p>I think I would probably recycle the Alpha ISA circa 21164 (EV-5) with maybe a CAS instruction.  It was pretty balanced between hardware and software and a lot of the complications in the VLSI design (dynamic logic, mostly) are moot with a modern technology if you stick with reasonable speeds.<p>Presumably now that the MIPS unaligned byte access patents are expired, a whole bunch of the idiocy that Alpha had to abide to avoid that patent can just be sidestepped.')
