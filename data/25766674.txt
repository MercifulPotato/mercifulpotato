I don&#x27;t work as a programmer, but the job exposes extensive SQL and Python to me (SQL for querying db and Python for automating and sticking together things).<p>From my experience, programming is so far the only activity that can satisfy my need for creating things and escaping from this world. I mean I can&#x27;t really cut off all my ties to this world but it&#x27;s nice to have a small world of my own to enjoy myself, from time to time.')
