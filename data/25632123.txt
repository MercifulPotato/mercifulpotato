Here in Europe, I know a lot of people who love their company and are still part of an union.<p>First of, yeah, you could &quot;just go&quot; if you don&#x27;t like what the company is offering. But it is not a reality for a lot of people, even in the tech industry. Leaving your job is not that easy.\nAnd it encourage a race to the bottom. With no union to negotiate, the negotiation will always be unbalanced in the favour of the employee since you are negotiating as an individual vs. a organization. Its way, way easier for company to scare you and keep wage low when their is no union to back you up.<p>Also, union can help you when you have a manager or any higher-up that makes your work life hard. I know a lot of company who try to sweep complain under the rug for one reason or another. But when the union get involved, they just can&#x27;t, they have to deal with it.<p>Finally, employee are stake holder in a company. A lot feel involved and responsible in the company direction and future. You can&#x27;t just excluded them because they are not shareholder. I mean, you can, but that will lead to a strong feeling of alienation. Union help with that, and I know some people who are part of a union just for this: They love their job and the company they work for, so they want to have a say in where the company is going.')
