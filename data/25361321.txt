I understood &quot;they&quot; to be &quot;fedora&quot;, so I thought you said &quot;fedora forks fedora&quot; i.e. &quot;fork fedora to be the new fedora version&quot;. So, I thought you meant &quot;fork RHEL to be the new fedora version&quot;. I see that&#x27;s backwards now.<p>EDIT: &quot;Fedora is like next major version&quot; also adds to the  confusion. If Fedora is like the next major version of RHEL, it makes sense that Fedora forks RHEL and not the other way around.')
