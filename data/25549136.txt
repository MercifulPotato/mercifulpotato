Remember that time it was badly enforced? That means COCs are bad!&quot; And they get <i>upvoted</i> for that. It&#x27;s kind of amazing.<p>Argue about the rules in COCs, or about the way they&#x27;re enforced. Commenting things like &quot;the evil mediocrities that enforce COCs&quot; is just cringe-level bad.')
