That&#x27;s not a gamble I want to take with an $800 phone.  I support their mission but without carrier authorization you&#x27;re one whim away from having an expensive brick in your pocket.  It sucks but that&#x27;s the cell phone market.<p>Note how purism goes to extreme lengths to dodge the question of &quot;which networks will your phone work on&quot;.  They have these elaborate frequency tables but never name any networks, then at the bottom the fine print admitting that they have no carrier authorizations.')
