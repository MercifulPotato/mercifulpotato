So it&#x27;s useful to talk about this concept, but we could never formally call any of those Turing complete (C pointers are limited to so many bits, for example).<p>The discussion about this detail comes up every time, so is there some proper formal term for this?<p>Something related to how much code is required to use the finite pool of memory you have in any way you want, or so (where a non turing complete language may require enumerating all possibilites and thus too large code size)')
