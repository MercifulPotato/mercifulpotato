The walled garden bullshit they pull with the iphone and their other products should not be legal. I don&#x27;t care if customers &quot;want it&quot;. Just as apple is willing to call it&#x27;s prospective customers who want more control over it&#x27;s products &quot;stupid&quot;, I will call anyone who knowingly buys a device they fundementally don&#x27;t control (e.g. no sudo) &quot;stupid&quot;. In situations where customers are &quot;stupid&quot;, proper recourse can be found through government and&#x2F;or legal action.<p>It&#x27;s especially bad because apple legitimately makes better built products than competitors. It&#x27;s too bad that they use this lucrative position to take a sh*t all over not-&quot;stupid&quot; customers while simultaneously baiting the uninformed masses into giving away their computing freedom.<p>Proper adblocking is not even a consideration for most iphone users. Apple users have few defenses against predatory marketing and attention leeches. That&#x27;s horrible for society, and a user shouldn&#x27;t be forced to choose between good build quality and controlling their device...')
