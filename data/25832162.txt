In the meantime, I started using my new email address for all my online accounts and I passed it on to all my contacts. Another thing I did, was to download all my Google data (I saved the archives on my NAS at home and on my Nextcloud instance on Digitalocean).<p>Since then, the only time I needed a Google account was when someone wanted to collaborate on a Google Docs file. I created a &quot;burner&quot; temporary account for that, which I subsequently closed.<p>Every now and then I might watch something on Youtube, but I never really need to be logged in.<p>It&#x27;s funny because before closing my Google account, I imagined it would have been so hard, when if fact it was quite uneventful.<p>During the last 12 months I also closed Reddit, Twitter, Facebook and Instagram. It feels really good. I don&#x27;t waste time during the day, I&#x27;m more focused during working hours and after work I have more time to do whatever I really like doing (as opposed to wasting time watching someone else doing those things on Youtube or Instagram).')
