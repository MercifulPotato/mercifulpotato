How can the game be acceptable or fun when cars run on tracks and NPC’s don’t have a problem being attacked?<p>I don&#x27;t know what to tell you except that in my 10 or so hours of play I have had plenty of fun. The highlights of the game for me so far are the story missions themselves and the world -- the environment itself. Seems like a finished product to me, albeit a buggy one with a diminished scope from what people seemed to be expecting. Don&#x27;t forget that they intend on releasing what was it 3 expansions of content similar to witcher 3? I&#x27;m interested to see how they use the world they created for that purpose.')
