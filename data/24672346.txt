You then cited EMU vs UM.<p>I pulled up the actual per-student data at EMU vs UM, and showed that the data across both 1) corroborates the net tuition calculation, and 2) don’t wildly vary from each other. Again, these are <i>per student</i> calculations. The spot-check samples agree with the aggregate calculation.<p>&gt; [four paragraphs about degrees, ignoring non-degreed people again]<p>I didn’t ignore non-degreed people. When analyzing people that don’t have degrees, we have to try to understand what the root cause is: whether it’s because they don’t want to attend, because they couldn’t get admission, or because they couldn’t afford it. I’m simply making the argument that reason #3 is no more likely today than it was 40 years ago. I gave you maybe 4 paragraphs arguing why that is the case (degree confers higher salary that more than pays for the up-front cost + everyone has access to student loans + median loan amount is roughly == price of an entry level car)<p>In the context of a conversation about the <i>costs</i> of college, I’m also pointing out that (by definition), non-degreed people don’t have to worry about those costs. Non-degreed people are also overwhelmingly the people that earn the median wage, and if you’ve paid attention this entire thread, the numbers for median wage earners are positive — even if not as positive as their degree-holding counterparts.')
