I&#x27;m not seeing any advantage to building on native silicon rather than cross compiling on existing machines AMD64 machines. Even with the power usage of the AMD64 chips being higher, the faster compilation speed will likely net less overall energy used for the builds.<p>I fully understand wanting native silicon to do development on and to work on some architecture specific branch. It&#x27;s easy to just recompile your working copy locally. The original poster was talking about &quot;build machines&quot;. I&#x27;m not seeing the utility as &quot;build machines&quot;, especially if they have far less power than AMD64 machines.')
