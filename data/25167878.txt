During Vista days Microsoft was extra-ordinarily vulnerable, people desperately looking for alternatives and some guy at Google decided that the Chrome must be our religion. Overnight priesthood of Chrome had build massive temples that no one outside of Google was interested. They were putting stupid Chrome OS on powerful laptops where hardware didn&#x27;t get utilized or super under-powered laptops which you always find a scenario you can&#x27;t use. Imagine if they had taken BSD, put on a great usable UX, an app store, auto sync to cloud and wide range of drivers then a strong alternative to OSX would have been born which would have given run for money to Microsoft.')
