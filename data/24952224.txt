I barely kept awake during these early hours, I was also severely sleep-deprived and low on energy all that time. My grades were also sub-par. I had no motivation to pick up anything after school; even gave up on programming (which I started around 8 y.o.)<p>Then I went to university and moved closer to the city centre. The lectures usually started at 9 or later. The quality of my sleep and live in general increased enormously. I was staying up later then before, yet I had more energy. Even managed to pick up new hobbies and come back to my tinkering with programming which lead to the start of my current career.')
