It obviously doesn&#x27;t work because the wealthy don&#x27;t have to invest into domestic jobs. They can also use their money abroad. If you give them more money they are just going to spend more of it outside your country.<p>The opposite is also true. The vast majority of consumers spend their money domestically. Yes the products they buy are often imports but in many cases a big chunk of the money goes to cashiers, delivery drivers and so on.<p>Of course I am simplifying this a bit. In theory the roles can switch and business owners spend more domestically and consumers spend more abroad but as it is right now the rich just invest into Chinese businesses or production capacity in China. Think of companies like Tesla building factories in China.')
