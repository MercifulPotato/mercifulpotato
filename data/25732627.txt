Many have trouble just adjusting to things like the choices in the supermarket...let alone navigating the troubles of finding housing.<p>In the town I live in, (Inland NW, US), the majority of &quot;affordable&quot; rentals are all rented by a small number of property management companies which do not seem to be local and have 1-800 numbers.  This covers a very sizable portion of the apartment buildings...guess what...they DO NOT rent to people with drug felonies...burglar...sure.  But if you sold marlijuana 20 years ago you cannot rent from them...period.\nSo...combine that with an area which the average rent has tripled in the last 20 years...with a massive shortage of for sale properties and what are these people to do?<p>Work and other things are tricky as well...it isn&#x27;t that a felon cannot get a job...but they are very likely to be manipulated by their employer.  They will typically be paid less and be treated differently than their coworkers.<p>Couple all that with the ineligibility for SBA loans if you have felony convictions...now what?<p>You are likely to be able to get a passport and such...but most will never truly see these things go off their record permanently...unless you get a withheld judgement you are still required to say &quot;yes&quot; to the have you ever been convicted question.  Employers being required to ask &quot;in the last x years have you been convicted?&quot; solves that issue...allows for the punishment to be served and forgiven.  &quot;have you ever been convicted?&quot; assumes there is no retribution possible ever.')
