Instead of being optimized to let me tag 50 to 100 people it&#x27;s design to do one person at a time in a tedious way where you pick one face from the list of faces which takes to another screen where you edit the name, then going to back to the list you&#x27;ve lost your place.<p>Further, there is no way to sort or set a priority on people so for example 8 of the top 20 people it shows are people I haven&#x27;t interacted with in 10 to 15 years. I&#x27;d much rather it show people who are part of my life. Further, one of those 8 is an x. I have no ill will toward them but I don&#x27;t really want them at the top of the list. And, there&#x27;s no rhyme or reason who&#x27;s on that top list. it&#x27;s not a list by number of photos or most recent or anything that I can figure out.<p>Why is this important? Because if I can tag my photos I can search for photos of people. But since they make it hard to use it&#x27;s like they don&#x27;t want it to be used.')
