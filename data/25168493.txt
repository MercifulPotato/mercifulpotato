No. But it certainly requires more talent.<p>Unfortunately, programming talent doesn&#x27;t scale with cost at all. In that it&#x27;s like a creative endeavor: you can hire 10000 &quot;professional writers&quot; if you want, but that won&#x27;t get you another Shakespeare.<p>Which is why I find the &quot;software engineer&quot; moniker silly. Software isn&#x27;t at all like engineering.')
