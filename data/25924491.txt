Searching for legacy files, or annoying historical lessons, especially in a codebase you&#x27;re entirely unfamiliar with, is a perfect example of a time to ask a question like that.<p>In fact, I might even put it as an oversight of the engineer that&#x27;s guiding the new engineer if they didn&#x27;t tell their coworker where the files are, especially when there&#x27;s been a shift between old and new styles.
