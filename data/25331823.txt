He was willing to take on bold, grand ideas that were not obviously wrong.  I&#x27;d even venture to say that in the 17th century, the concept of alchemy sounds much more reasonable than the idea that there is an &#x27;invisible&#x27; force of attraction between everything in the universe.<p>A lot of this derision for Newton&#x27;s alchemy comes from hindsight knowledge of the hundreds of years of chemistry knowledge we&#x27;ve since accumulated.<p>And in the end, he wasn&#x27;t really wrong in principle about whether alchemy is possible.  He was just off on the scale of energy required.')
