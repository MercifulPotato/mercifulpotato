In my opinion they are the winner here, they have much less work than before.<p>&gt; From an environmental and sustainability perspective, we need to lengthen support periods, but from a commercial perspective, chipset vendors want to sell the next shiny chipset. Getting Treble somewhere towards ACPI&#x2F;UEFI (you can boot Windows 10 or Linux 5.10 on pretty much any x86_64 system, even if the motherboard maker has abandoned it) as a standard hardware layer is one small step towards that, but there&#x27;s still a long road ahead I fear.<p>I agree, though it&#x27;s hardly as simple.<p>We&#x27;ve stuck to Gbps ethernet for a decade now so drivers have long been included mainline. But we&#x27;re progressing on LTE capabitilies at every new SoC, so it requires new drivers. On &quot;PC&quot; (server, desktops), the only thing that evolves that need drivers is the graphic card, so keeping up with the driver is ok.<p>My understanding is that Google (or rather Android) wants to fix this with Fuchsia: OEMs will provide &quot;user-space&quot;-only drivers and Fuschsia will guarantee ABI compatibility forever. That&#x27;s really not the way ChromeOS people do things though, who prefer integrating drivers into mainline Linux, and so far ChromeOS people have a much better track record than Android at upgrading. (Though again it&#x27;s easier on &quot;PC&quot;)')
