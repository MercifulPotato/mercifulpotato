Should interviews be related to the work at the job or not? The Google type interviews evolved precisely from the philosophy in your first paragraph I quoted: that a lot of domain knowledge can be learned easily and that it was most important to test for more fundamental knowledge and abilities as well as general problem solving skills.<p>If a company wants to test someones basic logical knowledge and fundmental programming knowledge, seems fair enough.<p>There is a massive difference between writing FuzzBuzz and knowing the differences and uses from all the different sort algorithms and being to write optmisied computer science code. One tests programming and logical skills to a childs level (FuzzBuzz is a kids game), the other tests computer science skills to a high education level.<p>If someone wants me to write a basic sorting function, then I would have no issues. But if someone expects me write an optimised quicksort function, nah.<p>The list of the things these Google style questions ask is big enough thath the books for these interviews is quite big. (Lots of fun to read tho, highly recommend them for people wanting to nerd out)<p>&gt;Ultimately I think it&#x27;s a lot easier to criticize the interview process than to come up with a good alternative, as well as establishing some basic criteria about what should be selected for and against. Not that I think Google style interviews are perfect or anything, mind.<p>Well, I think I did come up with a good alternative, basic interview with work trials. You want to know how good they work, not how good they interview and the two actually are different skills.')
