Sleeping Dogs nearly a decade ago and Yakuza now fit that paradigm, and do pretty well for it.<p>A handcrafted open world doesn&#x27;t scale all that well, and Cyberpunk, from my impressions, seems to be both large and vertical, which makes the challenge even harder. Pretty much the only open-world I&#x27;ve enjoyed in recent years is BOTW, and that world is pretty empty, if only because the setting is literally an apocalypse where most people died. (In fact, for people arguing for interaction density, there is a collectible in the game that is revealed when it is 100% to be a pile of feces, specifically to make fun of 100%-ters.)')
