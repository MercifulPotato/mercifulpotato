Likely one of the most beneficial things one can do (with not smoking and eating a diet high in fruits&#x2F;veggies low in processed carbs).<p>We (society&#x2F;physicians&#x2F;etc) need tools to get people to exercise. This is more a study of how effective one of those tools might be (ie supervised exercise vs recommendations). If supervised exercise is no better than recommendations, I find that pretty disappointing. Because as we all know, recommendations don&#x27;t work very well, or at least most people don&#x27;t adhere to them.')
