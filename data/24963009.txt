Especially with communities like MRA, which is even seen <i>federally</i> as a domestic terror group, it is not at all an unfair generalization to reject the discourse commonly associated with that community. It doesn’t deserve any further due process or open forum - it’s just hate speech. I don’t think it’s fair to act as though instant rejection of that sort of community is unfair. It’s not simplistic reductionism based on an in-group, it’s really actually based on analysis of the group’s core tenets and goals and a widely agreed perspective that it’s inappropriate.')
