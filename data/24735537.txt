Reposting as a warning for people:<p>I had mild Vitamin D deficiency which was diagnosed by a doctor many years ago. I was given Vitamin D supplements, which I stocked up on more than usual recently due to my staying in all day due to WFH and not getting any sunlight.<p>I used to take 50mcg of D3 1-2x a week and I upped that (without consulting a doctor) to 5x a week. Within two weeks, I started having extreme thirst. It was crazy to the point where I drank so much water that I could hear it sloshing in my stomach yet my mouth was parched dry and I was still very thirsty.<p>I did a quick Google search and found that Vitamin D poisoning was actually a thing [0]. I stopped my Vitamin D supplements the next day and my thirst went away that same day. Be careful folks.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.express.co.uk&#x2F;life-style&#x2F;health&#x2F;1203879&#x2F;vitamin-d-deficiency-symptoms-supplements-too-much-excessive-thirst-foods" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.express.co.uk&#x2F;life-style&#x2F;health&#x2F;1203879&#x2F;vitamin-...</a>')
