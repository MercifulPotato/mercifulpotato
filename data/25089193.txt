The government could effectively compel any employee to act as a spy, without their consent. Don&#x27;t want to play along? Go directly to jail.<p>&gt; The new law also allows officials to approach specific individuals—such as key employees within a company—with these demands, rather than the institution itself. In practice, they can force the engineer or IT administrator in charge of vetting and pushing out a product&#x27;s updates to undermine its security. In some situations, the government could even compel the individual or a small group of people to carry this out in secret. Under the Australian law, companies that fail or refuse to comply with these orders will face fines up to about $7.3 million. Individuals who resist could face prison time.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wired.com&#x2F;story&#x2F;australia-encryption-law-global-impact&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wired.com&#x2F;story&#x2F;australia-encryption-law-global-...</a>')
