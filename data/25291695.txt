Reading it over and over again, yeah sure I can understand it, but I don&#x27;t see any &quot;point&quot; or relation to the original comment.<p>Some people just seem to feel &quot;smart&quot; by wording things as convoluted as possible, using fancy words and references. The truth is, it is much harder to express thoughts clearly with simple, yet elegant words. Mostly because that makes everyone understand it, and everyone able to see through the facade. Meaning that whatever you say will need to hold up to much more scrutiny and you can&#x27;t hide behind a facade of &quot;fancyness&quot; that scares off readers.<p>It&#x27;s similar to coding. Writing simple code for complex programs is much much harder than writing complex code for complex problems, or even worse complex code for simple problems, which many people like to do.')
