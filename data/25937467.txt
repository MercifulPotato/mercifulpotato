The gp observed that insurance only works to manage risk. Insurance against a risk of 100% certainty costs more than managing the risk itself. Insurance that covers doctorâ€™s visits takes a certain expense and runs it through a system designed for uncertain expenses, thereby adding essentially parasitic loss.<p>&gt; missing routine care often leads to catastrophic outcomes.<p>As a sibling comment observed, this is already something that insurance companies deal with. Failure to obtain regular and preventative care makes one more likely to need intervention, which means the cost of insuring the patient is more. Therefore people who are actually paying for catastrophic insurance can save money by going to checkups. This would decrease costs, rather than cause them to baloon like insuring high probability events.')
