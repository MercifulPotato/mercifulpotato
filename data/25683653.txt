They were replacing PDAs with the iPhone. Which already had Win CE phone&#x2F;PDA hybrids in the market, and Blackberry which persisted a good while longer due to market penetration in business.<p>But more importantly, they were integrating something obvious: people wanted an iPod that was also a phone, that was also a PDA. Which meant they got to carry one device, and they wanted that to work well. Apple as a computer manufacturer and software company <i>did</i> have core competencies across these fields.<p>Where is that for the automotive industry though? Apple have nothing to bring to the core issue of transportation which is <i>transportation</i> and their manufacturing expertise is in solid-state electronics, not the automotive supply chain (which is massive). They don&#x27;t work with traction-scale systems, and they don&#x27;t work with human enclosures or really any of the types of processes and problems which cars have. The only competency they bring is software, but as a company they don&#x27;t have a safety-oriented engineering function (AFAIK) so the synergy is essentially &quot;iOS but in the entertainment system&quot;.<p>Apples contribution is &quot;the head unit&quot;, and maybe that&#x27;s enough, but that&#x27;s not an &quot;Apple&quot; car, and that&#x27;s a problem - they&#x27;d be trying to build up a manufacturing capability from scratch and that takes time. It puts them behind Tesla in a race to execute, and as Tesla has been discovering you can&#x27;t just automate your way out of a lot of the problems there.<p>Which leaves you at, what is an Apple car? It&#x27;s rebadged Hyundai with an Apple headunit in it.')
