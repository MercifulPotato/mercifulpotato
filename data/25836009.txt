Daily exercise. I never worked out with weights before covid, but I bought a kettlebell and the book Simple &amp; Sinister and started doing that routine along with cardio. Makes a huge difference.<p>2. Any kind of mindfulness. I&#x27;ve read a bunch of books on happiness during lockdown. Most all of them say the same things and suggest the same sorts of mindful practices, so I chose to do some practices based on stoicism and cognitive behavioral therapy. (Recommended reading: Why Buddhism is True, Everything is F*cked [starts good, gets bad], How to be a Stoic, A Handbook for New Stoics, Full Catastrophe Living. Choose any&#x2F;all and see what you like.)<p>3. Not reading the news or doom scrolling. I get a covid newsletter each day (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;paulbart.substack.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;paulbart.substack.com</a>) and don&#x27;t read any other covid news. I also got off social media and don&#x27;t read much about politics&#x2F;the general shitshow. Basically, things that are beyond my control I pay limited attention to. When I violated this, obsessively seeking out streams &amp; tweets from the storming of the capitol, I wound up having to take the next day off because I was so out of sorts.<p>4. Connecting directly with friends. I deleted my social media accts this year and started reaching out to old friends directly. First with a bulk email then zooms&#x2F;phone calls with folks who wrote back. It&#x27;s been great to reconnect and everyone is happy to chat!<p>5. Putting strict limits on work. I don&#x27;t touch it outside of what I&#x27;ve determined to be &quot;work hours&quot;. Period.<p>Good luck. Things can get better.')
