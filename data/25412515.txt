As an example, I worked with two 20%&#x27;ers that wanted to transfer from non-SWE to SWE roles. One of them has already succeeded, and another is hoping to be able to do so as soon as head count permits.<p>2) As a labor of love. As an example, we have an epitaphs page containing information about&#x2F;farewells from people that have departed Google. It&#x27;s not an officially supported project but is still quite popular. These kinds of projects don&#x27;t necessarily lead to promotions (although the criteria for promotion have recently changed), but on balance they make people&#x27;s lives better.')
