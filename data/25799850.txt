Item(by='saurik', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610768913, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25799368, text='Since words don&#x27;t have a one-to-one mapping or anything--even in cases where the mapping of words themselves makes sense (and if often doesn&#x27;t, as words in language say have different attachments for how to convey meaning)--this is still mostly a subjective translation problem; if you want to come close to this I recommend playing with apps like Pleco (for Chinese) that are designed to give you the source text in the original language and then let you click each word to get a dictionary definition (in your language) for each word (which of course isn&#x27;t a single word and can&#x27;t be, which is the problem with trying to get a &quot;literal&quot; translation). (I think Google Translate might have a mode like this?)')
