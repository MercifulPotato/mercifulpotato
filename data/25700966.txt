SpaceX developed two new reusable launch vehicles for transfering cargo, whilst not cutting the corners that could not be cut if it were used for a human space program. Then when it came time to put humans on it, it already had a legacy.<p>Starship, however, is in fact designed for humans. But it is not part of a &quot;human space program&quot;, rather it is a multi-purpose vehicle. It is yet to be seen towards which human space programs it will be applied, but even with the Artemis bid many aspects of Starship were clearly designed without the Artemis bid as a specific target.')
