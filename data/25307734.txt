I stopped using is as much after the warrant canary went away, and the new design pushed me away more. For a while I only used city subreddits for local stuff, but even those have gone full on hard-core-left and full-establishment. It&#x27;s frightening.<p>The recent banning of thousands of communities should scare everyone.<p>I say this without a throwaway. I agree with you. Not only do I agree with you, but the fact that so many people don&#x27;t see these very basic things you&#x27;re pointed out greatly troubles me about the future of our society.<p>As far as alternatives, don&#x27;t go for new monolithic platforms like Parler or Ruqqus. Go distributed. Join some Mastodon&#x2F;Pleroma servers, follow random people, post you videos to a PeerTube instance. The Internet wasn&#x27;t originally just 40 big top-tier websites. It was tons of cool independent stuff.<p>oh and one last thing, look up Glassine Maxwell and the reddit controversy. There&#x27;s an account with her name that was very active, one of the most active account, up until her arrest. After that, Reddit started deleting TONS and TONS of of that comments. That is the world we live in. Stay safe citizen.')
