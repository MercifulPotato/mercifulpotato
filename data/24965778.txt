Unbelievable frustrating and next to useless.<p>Thunderbird is a bit clunky but does what you ask of it and has much better+simpler filtering options.<p>Which makes sense, gmail is in the cloud so it can&#x27;t perform intensive search queries because that would cost way to much.<p>Thunderbird has a dedicated machine for it, no matter how old and slow it is it will have way more resources at hand than google will ever allocate to you, even if you pay.')
