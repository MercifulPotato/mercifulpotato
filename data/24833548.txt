Which leads one to the idea that of making this indictment public is contrary to the standard goals of prosecuting a crime, then there&#x27;s a different goal in mind.  That goal is intrinsically linked to making public declarations you can&#x27;t execute on.<p>I can&#x27;t think of a better definition of propaganda.')
