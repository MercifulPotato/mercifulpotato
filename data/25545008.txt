People don&#x27;t generally realize what a rough life birds, especially highly migratory species, have. A pair of song-birds (passerines) will likely hatch an average of ~4 babies each year, and yet the populations are generally stable or shrinking over time. Using rough math that would indicate that 2&#x2F;3 of the birds that exist at the peak breeding season will not be alive the next year.<p>Weather-related events are pretty tough to predict and prevent. There are several things you can do that will have a direct effect on bird populations. I&#x27;m short on time, so I&#x27;ll just list the two most impactful ones:<p>1. Keep your cat indoors. The <i>low</i> estimate for the number of birds killed in North America pet and feral cats is <i>one billion birds a year</i>. That doesn&#x27;t include the many small mammal, reptile, and amphibian species which are the base of the food chain for larger species of birds.<p>2. Reduce your use of insecticides both directly and via store-bought foods. There&#x27;s a lot of evidence that insect populations are experiencing a population collapse, likely due mostly to accumulated insecticides in the ecosystem.')
