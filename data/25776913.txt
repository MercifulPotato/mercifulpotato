It made explicit for me (and other colleagues) knowledge that is typically implicit. Of course, this is a different use-case for stating pronouns, but one that made them sticker (I think) in my work context than they otherwise would have been.<p>So, thumbs up for stating pronouns. If you don&#x27;t state them, people who can will infer pronouns (and may be wrong), and people who can&#x27;t (because of a lack of context) will feel awkward, have to ask someone else (time&#x2F;energy), or get it wrong, which is shitty all around.')
