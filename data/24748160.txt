Item(by='Slartie', descendants=None, kids=[24748337], score=None, time=1602442940, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24747743, text='&gt; Please help me, what real value does an investment like this yield for the economy as a whole?<p>I see this situation to be very similar to the reason why the Bitcoin network burns hundreds of MWh of power per day. They do this because it is the only way to ensure everyone adheres to the market rules that were collectively declared as &quot;fair&quot;.<p>Bitcoins&#x27; fairness rules work by incentivizing an arms race of who can compute hashes faster. The &quot;conventional&quot; stock&#x2F;bond&#x2F;futures markets ensure fairness by resorting to time an order was placed as the ultimate arbiter when it comes to whose orders are filled first. In both cases, there is a physics-related element that cannot be cheated by any one market participant, because nobody can transfer information faster than light and nobody can produce power out of the void.<p>The end product of this is &quot;fairness&quot; - which is extremely valuable, because without a reliable ledger, bitcoins would have no value, and without the ultimate judge of time at the stock market, there would be no stock market, because nobody would trade at a market where a specific participant could just backdate his orders.<p>Of course the &quot;fairness&quot; is not directly a product of the 300m$ investment for that ultra fast data connection. Nor is it directly a product of the MWh of power burnt for bitcoin blockchain hashes. But these two things are direct outcomes of the rules that effectively produce the fairness we want, and without accepting that we get these outcomes, these rules would not function and would not be accepted, which would void them, because they can only produce the desired &quot;fairness&quot; product as long as they are accepted by the market participants. Hence I consider &quot;fairness&quot; to be an indirect product of these two effects - and all similarly-categorized effects that don&#x27;t directly seem to serve any purpose except for being actions in some kind of arms race between market participants.<p>One could also replace &quot;fairness&quot; with &quot;trust&quot;, if that&#x27;s more to your liking. The concept is the important thing, not what the product is named.')
