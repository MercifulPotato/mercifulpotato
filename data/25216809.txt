It won&#x27;t mitigate the attack if you are personally a high value, named target. But most account takeover attacks operate en masse and are coordinated after large security breaches, so having to hand over accounts to a human operator as part of the auth loop would make the campaign uneconomical. It also introduces another step at which an attack can be logged, recognized, fingerprinted and stopped by an incident response team.<p>This is something your security team would probably gladly tell you about if you asked them. There&#x27;s also a bunch of talks about this presented at conferences like Blackhat, DEFCON, USENIX, etc.<p>Stated in another way: not all potential rewards for successful account takeover are high. The modal account in the modal campaign is low value, which is made up for by volume and particular purpose of accessing accounts. If you model these campaigns economically, you can eliminate entire classes of &quot;low margin, high volume&quot; attacks simply by introducing friction that mitigates automation.<p>Then there is a natural cost-benefit tradeoff as to how much friction is allowable on a per-user basis to prevent the most common types of account takeover attacks.')
