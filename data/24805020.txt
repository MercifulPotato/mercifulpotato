In fact, there are many medication that are very effective if administered before the first symptoms appear and are completely useless after. If you get exposed to rabies, you can get a rabies vaccine and have close to no chance of contracting it, whereas if you get a vaccine after you develop symptoms, you&#x27;re almost certain to die.<p>Similarly, the flu antivirals are somewhat helpful if taken early but have no effect if taken too late.')
