You know someone&#x27;s real values by which one they choose at that juncture.<p>Far too many people double down on the looking good option wile being actively horrible. The degree to which I get downvotes instead of assistance for trying to make my life work when I talk about my firsthand experience is evidence of how common this is and it&#x27;s gone on a lot of years.<p>It&#x27;s gone on long enough that I&#x27;m all out of patience for sympathetic explanations about how people <i>mean well.</i> When push comes to shove, far too many of them only want to be seen as good people and don&#x27;t actually give a damn about anyone but themselves. That&#x27;s the entire point of spouting nonsense they don&#x27;t personally back up and walk the walk on.')
