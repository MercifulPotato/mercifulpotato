If it is successful then it will gradually start eating into college market share. It seems like mostly the system has to just wait and see for now.<p>One thing that it could do, I suppose, is reshape the bureaucracy to accommodate a reality of a people educated at lambda schools. There are forms asking you about your education level. Important forms. Immigration for example. Not being able to check the college box could hurt you.<p>If someone has gone to lambda school, and self taught in their free time, could they work as a researcher? Or is that gated behind phd admission which is gated behind a bachelors? That might need a change too.')
