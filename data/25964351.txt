After that, PHP entered a dark age where almost every other language ran circles around it in terms of performance, security, maintainability, tool support... and literally everything.<p>Some of those problems got addressed but by the time that happened PHP&#x27;s reputation was irreversibly trashed and now nobody wants to know about it.<p>That is the world we live in. People do not want to learn PHP or work in PHP. Do a survey on any higher education institution and verify it yourself.<p>All the features you feel proud about... go take a look at the Java VM, .NET VM or a JS VM like V8... Those VMs are much more powerful than the PHP interpreter will ever be. Even CPython is faster.<p>Plus, as a Java developer you can make more than a PHP developer and there are more types of development you can do. Mobile, backend, desktop. PHP is mostly limited to backend and it is not even the best solution for that.')
