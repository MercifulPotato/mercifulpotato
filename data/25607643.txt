I&#x27;d say you could have the honor system (unlocked doors) for 95 percent of prisoners, by letting them know if they escape they&#x27;ll go to a more secure and less free prison. Then you make prison a place to learn new skills and get treatment for addictions and therapy, and you&#x27;ll actually see some improvement in society. Also, send less people to prison.')
