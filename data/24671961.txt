Item(by='bhupy', descendants=None, kids=[24672140], score=None, time=1601731782, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24671739, text='&gt; Treating the two schools equal understates cost, as the per student average is higher.<p>Maybe I didn’t make myself clear: the data pulled from the WSJ tool <i>is per student</i>. It’s what the middle individual (per university) expects to owe vs earn. The size of the university doesn’t matter in the context of that data.<p>&gt; Also, did you “forget” about people with degrees again?<p>No I didn’t, but people without college degrees earn the median wage and do not have to worry about paying off student loans, which was the earlier contention.<p>People with college degrees earn above the median wage, at which point the median numbers here don’t really apply to them.<p>You have to pick your grievance: either you earn the median wage OR you have to worry about paying student loans, but not both. The (wage - expenses) amount is, on average, positive in either case.<p>The ROI number represents the <i>true</i> value of college, because it not only incorporates the price, it incorporates the net expected returns. Not including the latter obscures more than it illuminates. Simply comparing the price now vs the price in year X is not apples-to-apples, because you were essentially buying a different thing in the 1980’s that was worth less than the unique thing you’re buying today. They just happen to both be named “college degree”.')
