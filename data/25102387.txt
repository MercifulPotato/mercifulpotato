If you go from zero to 1,000 requests&#x2F;second then it can take up to 30 minutes to fully scale for that inbound traffic.  And pre-provisioning for that sudden peak concurrency is very expensive.  I think Lambda probably has its place in some kind of backoffice task runner architecture, but it&#x27;s really not good for serving web traffic that might be occasionally spiky.')
