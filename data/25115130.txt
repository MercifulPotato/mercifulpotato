The mere fact that an email can be forged will substantially reduce the likelihood of email being used, unless clear providence can be provided.<p>At the moment that providence can be proved with DKIM. Remove DKIM and now bad actors need to prove that they actually broke into someoneâ€™s emails and stole them. A much high bar to pass, especially as it may mean incriminating yourself of a crime.<p>Emails become just as useful as find a pile of top secret papers on the floor. Unless you can prove the source of those papers everyone is going to ignore you.')
