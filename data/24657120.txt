A surprising number of clients even outside banking, finance, government, etc made a point of enforcing this language, even conducting their own background checks.<p>Freelancing was the approach I saw some people do successfully, but there were lots of projects we couldn&#x27;t put them on.<p>We even saw clients that refused anyone who had even a misdemeanor, at which point I discovered how many of our consultants had misdemeanor DUIs or arrests for various non-violent reasons.')
