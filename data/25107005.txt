I think he&#x27;s renewing his position based on the increasing polarisation rather than actually &quot;switching teams&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s more like political divestment, as the costs of polarisation have increased.<p>His actual values - basic libertarianism like open borders and free trade and limited government - haven&#x27;t changed at all. That&#x27;s precisely why he never backed Trump, and instead continued plugging the values he espoused even as that drew fire from Republicans.<p>For instance: note that he donated a lot more to Rep candidates than to Dem candidates, but it was almost exclusively where the relevant contest involved a pro-markets versus anti-markets debate.<p>As Republicans have moved away from markets into populism, his spending is less and less partisan.')
