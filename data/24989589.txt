The basic features should keep working, even if more clunky, with JavaScript disabled. Of course I couldn&#x27;t do photo editing with that concept in a browser, but that&#x27;s not what I use a browser for anyway. A site that uses drag &amp; drop most probably can implement a pure HTML version that may require a few more clicks but in the end the same action can be achieved. Having this fallback also has the advantage that it helps disabled users and users on poor network connections.')
