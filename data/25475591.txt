Cain shot Rodriguez while conducting Russian roulette on the brothers in an attempt to force a confession from them.</i><p>In fairness, that was the 70s. But the 70s were also &quot;one generation ago,&quot; so it&#x27;s not exactly ancient history.<p>(I could imagine myself being skeptical about your comment before having wised up a little, so I thought I&#x27;d chime in to say yes, this really does happen.)')
