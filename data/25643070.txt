It boils down to EMTs not having formal medical education necessary to make a call as significant as pronouncing someone deceased. It&#x27;s a blanket rule, so even in extreme circumstances like if you find someone beheaded, you just log it as a severe injury and transport the body to the hospital where a doctor pronounces them dead.')
