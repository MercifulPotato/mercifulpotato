But doing so <i>while</i> trying to manage a pandemic isn&#x27;t reasonable.<p>That many places used Excel spreadsheets for storing testing data is neither surprising or <i>necessarily</i> a bad thing.  Until March, no one <i>needed</i> to have huge databases of test results -- now we do.<p>Complaining that places which had , at <i>most</i>, a few dozen cases of <i>reportable</i> infectious diseases should have implemented a database that can support <i>thousands</i> (tens of thousands?) of test results seems rather silly to me.')
