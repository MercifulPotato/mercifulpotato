The flip side of not using Electron.js and going for native development (which would help solve these points) would mean I never would have shipped Loaf. That&#x27;s the issue I was facing.<p>Due to money (development costs) and ongoing support (being able to improve and maintain the UI with CSS) I had to find a tool that would work for me.<p>Maybe one day with enough time and money, I&#x27;ll be able to develop some beautiful native desktop apps for macOS and Windows. That would be nice :)')
