It was pretty standard when you were in a large class.<p>The desks were so far apart that the current &quot;social distancing&quot; standards would be met.  I remember that many courses had multiple variations of the same exam given to students to further reduce cheating.<p>I&#x27;m taking an online masters right now and have taken a few (pre-pandemic) proctored exams.  The nearby university offers to proctor any exam for $10.  They have a bunch of rooms with desks, and it&#x27;s no big deal at all.<p>This proctoring technology thing has gone too far and too fast.  It was a knee-jerk reaction, and with a lot of complaints I bet that a lot of it gets dropped.')
