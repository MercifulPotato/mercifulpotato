It&#x27;s the craziest dystopia nobody talked about. Cameras aren&#x27;t even cameras anymore! Are there some phones with camera-filters on, <i>without</i> the option for you to turn them off? Cameraphones need to make a comeback; you know, phones with <i>cameras</i> and not some sci-fi CGI BS.<p>I don&#x27;t trust anything coming from a smartphone camera now. Even my own phones.<p>Maybe related: I&#x27;ve noticed on iPhones and Samsungs that I cannot get a picture to match reality. I feel like it was easier to get a picture with colors that closely matched reality YEARS ago. Why have cameras gone downhill? Or is it my imagination?<p>When I take a photo of the grass and sky with any modern smartphone it never looks right. I try and try and try to adjust the settings and I can just never get a good photo anymore.<p>Edit: Example: I couldn&#x27;t take a picture of the smoke on the West coast recently. The dark grey and orange skies would all come out looking blue or something. It&#x27;s like the &#x27;camera&#x27; is telling me I&#x27;m f&#x27;ing crazy for taking a picture of smoky skies, and <i>surely</i> I want to pretend the smoke isn&#x27;t there at all! That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m taking a picture right? So I can pretend that reality isn&#x27;t real. I have no photos that match the smoke. I have only my memory and other people&#x27;s photos. WTF.')
