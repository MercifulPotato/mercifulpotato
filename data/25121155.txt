It’s the ultimate encapsulation of <i>don’t hate the player, hate the game</i>.<p>To use a meme, &quot;por que no los dos?&quot;<p>I hate both the player <i>and</i> the game.  No one ordered Mr Xu to get into this business; there&#x27;s no requirement that he abuse the living shit out of his workers and sell them up the river by helping pass prop 22.  At every step in the decision process, he or people he hired and gave instructions to voluntarily made these decisions.  From the pay scale to the inclusion of binding arbitration, they own every single one of those choices.<p>Along the same lines, we own not making the changes we claim to want, while wolfing down our ghost kitchen burritos with subsidized delivery.  California voters absolutely own voting for proposition 22, and signing the petition to get it on the ballot.  We&#x27;re not reforming our labor laws to give some people the flexibility they want while not leaving everyone as an unrestricted free agent.  We don&#x27;t separate health care from employment.  We gab about it, but little changes, and certainly not at the rate of the people exploiting those pressure points.  As someone once told Captain Picard, &quot;you talk and you talk, but you have no guramba.&quot;<p>And now, with COVID, we&#x27;re watching our economy cleave into the starkest case of haves and have-nots in my lifetime.  That split won&#x27;t be permanent, but fixing it is going to happen when we least expect it and is going to be messy and painful.')
