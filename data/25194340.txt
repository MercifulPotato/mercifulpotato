It&#x27;s got nothing to do with charge state.<p>Charged is way easier to ignite.  Having all those electrons trying to GTFO (i.e. the battery is charged) gives a potential ignition source that tends to go off whenever the battery fails so you just need one cell to be breached the chain reaciton can take it from there.  Contrast to a discharged battery which needs external heat in sufficient quantities to actually ignite it.')
