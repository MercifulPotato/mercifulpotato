He isn&#x27;t getting enough of the far-left vote because of their apathy towards his agenda, which does not reach far enough by far.<p>As an example, Florida did not vote for Biden. Not because he&#x27;s too left, but because he&#x27;s not left enough. The proof for this is that they also just voted to increase the minimum wage to $15. The democrats wanted a candidate with broader appeal than Bernie, but they only succeeded in alienating the social-conservatives even further.')
