We use it to enforce sanctions, implement foreign policy objectives, and force the rest of the world into a cycle of circular dependancy on our debt.<p>But enough major players are sick of it that it is falling apart. China, Russia, India, Brazil, most of the Middle East and a good chunk of Africa no longer see this system as providing value for them and they are eagerly looking for ways to settle trade directly in their own currencies and through their own pipelines.<p>If you notice Jerome Powell is on the first panel, which indicates that I think the US has accepted that this transition is going to take place and that they want to get to have as much say as possible in constructing the new system to get to try to retain as much of our power as possible.<p>But to me this signals the beginning of the end of the political era that started when the dollar was made to be the global reserve currency at Brettin Woods in 1944.')
