Either they play too fast to follow along or they play too slowly and time is wasted waiting for it to show me the part I care about (or loop back around).<p>It&#x27;s hard to get the speed just right. And AFAIK browsers don&#x27;t offer controls to adjust the speed, and even if they did, it would be tedious.<p>(2) Personally I find animations (especially rapid or looping ones) quite distracting when trying to read the rest of the page. My eye just keeps moving to the thing that&#x27;s trying to grab my attention.<p>I usually try to work around that by scrolling so that the animation is out of view. So, I&#x27;ll live, but it&#x27;s not a good user experience. And again, (some?) browsers seem to offer no help, like a setting to always enable animation controls (play&#x2F;pause&#x2F;etc.) or to loop only once.')
