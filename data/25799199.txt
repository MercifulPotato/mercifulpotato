But if I was someone who had it posted on my website, I would have no problem posting it to a decentralized network as well.  IMO just further surface area for potentially finding your next job!<p>Secondly: Would you be interested in running a small social network just for your co-workingspace, colleagues, company, alumni, startup-hub, businessnetwork, etc?<p>Maybe, depends on how much work it is to get set up and running, and how helpful it is (how much social&#x2F;professional capital I would gain for doing so).<p>Best of luck!  I like the idea')
