I prefer linux, but win10 and ios are great in the domain they target. C++ is great tools when you want to be low level, like managing memory, python is another great tool when you don&#x27;t want to or don&#x27;t need to or don&#x27;t have the time to. Hey, guess what, it can be the same person that write python and c++ code !! And he even can like both !!! And be good at both !!!')
