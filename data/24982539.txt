After all, parenthood is based on the basic concept of biological&#x2F;genetic ownership, which is more fundamental than a legal decision of some emotionally frustrated judge or a social worker.<p>If a woman wants to leave relationship without good reason, there is a simple way for her to pack her belongings and head for the exit, it&#x27;s not like she should be allowed to appropriate somebody else&#x27;s children or money.<p>Women should really be granted complete equality with men in this area,and treated like any other stupid thief, and be locked up. Maybe even Hillary will finally end up in prison once it&#x27;s clarified who Chelsea&#x27;s father really is.')
