Sometimes I get pieces of wood cut by industrial machines at the shop and sometimes I use my manual saw. I don&#x27;t have money or space to set up a professional wood cutting machine in my workshop. Hand held saw not the best for cutting wood but sometimes it just makes sense. You are right, graph database things need to be done in a graph database but speaking for myself I have never set up or used a graph database. It is easier (not right) for me to learn recursive statements than to set up and learn to use a graph database.')
