You then have to a) sort out the redundancy of the data, and b) the consistency of the data bearing in mind that a node may have data reliant on data from another node.<p>Many of these issues are somewhat related to GC, distributed hash (merkle) trees, CRDTs and actors operating on data (rather than the other way round). It&#x27;s a rich problem area with many coordination applications for the good solutions!')
