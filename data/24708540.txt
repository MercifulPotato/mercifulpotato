It&#x27;s by far the lowest rated vehicle there. Pretty much everything is terrible on that thing. Road Test, 36&#x2F;100, Reliability 1&#x2F;5, Predicted Owner Satisfaction... 4&#x2F;5. I had to go back and double check that again, just to be sure. Apparently people love those Wranglers, no matter what.')
