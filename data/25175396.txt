I interact with a hundreds of folks often with only 1 or 2 chances to speak, and zoom gets everyone in &#x2F; on much more reliabily in my experience.<p>Same with slack. We are using slack between companies now, and trying to figure out google&#x27;s chat app strategy with video &#x2F; screen sharing integration is a NIGHTMARE (even though we pay for gsuite so would prefer it). You have meet, hangouts, chat etc. Some things are in gmail, some things are not. The integration between everything is broken (we also use google voice). We&#x27;ve had issues where I guess folks have domain admins that block them joining a meet call? WHAT! So no your invitee can&#x27;t get in etc.')
