And I will also add that I did not do my degree in the US. Still, I am quite convinced that it is <i>very</i> hard to codify the intention of what the OP wants to do in a generic software license (i.e. one that you do not draft specifically for each client).<p>I do not have the motivation to lay out my full argument as that would take another entire paper, but even if it turns out to be not as hard as I think it is, it certainly isn&#x27;t as easy as is posited here.')
