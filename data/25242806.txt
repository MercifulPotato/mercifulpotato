It ruins the Quantified Self aspect. You don&#x27;t want to falsify your data.<p>2. You&#x27;ve set up an autodata goal and there isn&#x27;t any (easy) way to cheat. Your Fitbit (or Habitica or Duolingo or Project Euler or whatever) just tells Beeminder how many steps got (or whatever your metric is).<p>3.

If you were the type to falsify your data to weasel out of a commitment, you wouldn&#x27;t have signed up for Beeminder in the first place.<p>5. Beeminder does a lot of valuable things (reminders, graphs, community, generally making you awesomer) so arguably has earned the money by the time you first derail.<p>6.
