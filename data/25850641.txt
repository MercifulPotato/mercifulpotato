What fearmongering is this?<p>students have been unable to attend schools since 5 august 2019 and you make 8 million humans suffer because of a boogeyman which doesnt exist? \nhasn&#x27;t the recent arnab leaks suggested that pulwama was a false flag along with arnab getting prior info about something like balakot? if this is true and factually it does look like it, so who is the boogeyman? if allegedly india did pulwama attack on its own people and blamed kashmiri militants for it and pakistan for aiding them which has led to the crackdown on militancy in kashmir and this supposedly &quot;anti-national&quot; elements which in reality don&#x27;t exist so why are we suffering?<p>if modi wants to fuck himself over the blood of indians to stay in power, do it but why am i suffering?')
