Says so right at the top in the first paragraph.<p>I think I have a few thousand files on my computer right now whose names end in &quot;.csv&quot;, and I&#x27;ll bet money not one of them agrees with RFC4180 to the letter except by accident of the data itself, and that&#x27;s a Real Problem to me.<p>I can concede that two parties could agree to interchange according to RFC4180, but as a <i>general</i> format I maintain that for archival and interchange purposes CSV cannot be divorced from the rather complex schema I alluded to without data loss.')
