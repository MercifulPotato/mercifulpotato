It isn&#x27;t just the interactive cursor, or copy-paste, or search-and-replace, or even regular expressions...it&#x27;s decades of accumulated solutions that can handle every concievable text problem.<p>Every time we go to some other way of describing a document we lose all that text editing infrastructure, which is such a huge setback that no alternate solution has yet hit a widespread critical mass, only specific niches in specific domains.<p>Which doesn&#x27;t make text good, it makes it worse-is-better!<p>As I see it, the probable way forward would not be in language design, but in formats and editors. Breaking through the dependency will be a slow process.')
