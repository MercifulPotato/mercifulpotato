The cost of production (strip mining, heavy manufacturing), emplacement (concrete, steel, shipping, land clearing), and short lifespan are easily overlooked when the ideal vision seems so juicy. It’s great to augment a house (assuming you own one) with panels, though without substantial subsidies or disposable income in more northern climes the math still doesn’t pencil out as a good return when compared to natural gas. If your only alternative is imported diesel&#x2F;heating oil, maybe different story, but of course in such places the carbon cost of TCO goes up in tandem with the benefits.')
