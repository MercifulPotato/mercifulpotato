Think of caregivers being paid $9 per hour to clean up Grandpa&#x27;s sick, or teachers who can&#x27;t spend their summers on improving their craft because they have to take a menial off-season position to stay afloat.<p>It also works on the other side-- I think you&#x27;d be hard pressed to find someone saying that top athletes and actors are worth eight figures a year on their contribution to society alone, but the market has bid them there.<p>A much more hands-on system of wage and price controls could at least come from a conscious decision-making process.')
