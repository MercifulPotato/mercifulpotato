New Toyotas have it, GM has had it for quite a while with OnStar, Ford probably has it, and if I bothered to dig more, almost all of them have it somewhere, cellular modem included.<p>It&#x27;s an industry problem at this point, and I really think some day we will have a mass terrorist disaster where some psychotic hacker group would hack all the badly secured cars everywhere, link into the CAN bus (because that is a GREAT idea for some braindead synergistic middle manager reasons) and cause run-away accelerations simultaneously everywhere on some clock script, killing millions and destroying trillions.<p>I&#x27;m 50&#x2F;50 hoping someone makes a popular movie about that, to scare governments world wide to force cars to have a fucking no network mode and no connections to the CAN bus and terrified if it would inspire said teenage psychopaths to do so...')
