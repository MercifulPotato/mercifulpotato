The conceptual model of a WordPerfect document is a single stream of text, interspersed with formatting instructions.<p>That meant, for example, that, after backspacing over a return, you could end up with a paragraph of text with, somewhere in the middle, a “set left margin to 3 cm” instruction, or with multiple conflicting instructions (I think neither was supposed to happen, but all software is buggy). I didn’t use WP, so I wouldn’t know what that meant for the paragraph being laid out. It might have been applied starting at entire paragraph that contained the instruction, at the next paragraph, or immediately.<p>The ‘raw view’ didn’t only allow you to see the (potential) mess of formatting instructions, but also to edit it.<p>So, if you knew your way around there, you could fix any problem with documents.<p>IMO, if WP were less buggy, it probably wouldn’t have needed that mode. I also think its existence put less pressure on WP to fix bugs.')
