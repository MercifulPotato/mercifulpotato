I remind people that it is just that: an advice. &quot;Please, remember the decision is still your responsibility and I don&#x27;t mind you doing anything you see fit with my advice including completely ignoring it&quot;<p>Being advisor is dangerous because you can become entangled in the matter you have no power to decide on. I make sure that people understand managing the issue and advising on it are two completely separate roles. It usually is a chat in the form: If you want, cede the power to make decisions and only then I can try my best to resolve it and be responsible for results.<p>When it comes to somebody&#x27;s life, it is not possible to cede the responsibility and so by very definition it is just not possible for me to take any responsibility for the advice I give and it is still up to the person to decide whether they can trust the advice and how to use it.')
