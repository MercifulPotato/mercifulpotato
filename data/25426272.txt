Item(by='throwaway535', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607998922, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25425565, text='&gt;  My family only showed up in this country in the mid 80s and have zero responsibility for things that happened well over 100 years ago.<p>I guess, here is a simple non-rhetorical thought question: Why should your family get any of the benefits of this country&#x27;s past? I don&#x27;t know you or where you&#x2F;your family immigrated from, but your family came here for the benefits of the US. Maybe the US was a wealthier country than where your family left, or maybe more stable, or maybe they felt there was more opportunity for economic mobility.  Those benefits&#x2F;properties where present before your family decided to move, so why should you benefit from them?<p>Note, I&#x27;m actually pro-immigration and support people moving here, but I think it&#x27;s a good exercise to walk through. All of those benefits were accrued before your family came here, and yet your family gets to benefit from them. Why? As you said, they had zero responsibility for things that happened before they arrived.<p>So by the same token, if the country had both assets and debts before you arrived, why shouldn&#x27;t the logic that says you and your family should take on and gain from those assets that pre-dated you, also not mean that you should take on the associated debts?<p>I can&#x27;t think of a reason why someone immigrating should only take on the benefits of the assets but be excluded from the liabilities. But am open to discussion.')
