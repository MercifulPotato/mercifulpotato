Item(by='vidarh', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611262819, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25863414, text='&gt; Try dealing with something of consequence, like killing your former self (as in: the person in that point of time-space which carries the mutable signifier of “yourself” which is younger than yourself) or giving yourself a kilogram of gold from the future, which I think would violate the law of preservation of energy or whatever.<p>It is entirely irrelevant <i>what it is</i>. The point is that if the system is immutable <i>it is impossible to represent a combination of state transitions that alters an existing state</i>, as such the set of possible space-time combinations would in that case only include those where the time travel does not introduce a paradox that depends on change.<p>The same way the timeline does not include any states where I fold an elephant, because it&#x27;s not possible to do so.<p>You have not presented any paradoxes that can work with an immutable space-time other than perhaps if said space-time introduces divergent timelines at any point of mutation, in which case the paradox can also easily be resolved.<p>&gt; And yet if time travel backwards is possible you simply cannot deny that one would experience (!) that time travel as steps 1–3. Temporal experience. Hah!<p>You can <i>experience</i> it that way, but your &quot;do something&quot; step 2 would be deterministic and could not possibly include steps that introduced a paradox.<p>&gt; There’s absolutely nothing hard about the concept of time being immutable;<p>You&#x27;re still thinking in terms of a mutable space-time. I did not talk about <i>time</i> being immutable, but the <i>entirety of space-time</i>. Your &quot;do something&quot; step does nothing that changes anything in an immutable space-time, because everything is fixed from the start. Nothing moves. No action is taken. Everything is unalterable.<p>Time, and cause and effect, in that scenario is simply an illusion of consciousness at every point of a fixed 4d (or more) canvas <i>that never changes in any way</i>.<p>&gt; The true puzzle is time travel which introduce paradoxes, which your original comment says absolutely nothing about.<p>My original comment gave immutability as an example of a possible solution. Time travel with paradoxes is not possible. That is the entire point of a paradox: The problem as stated reveals a problem with the presumed model. The solution is to identify and remove flaws in the model. Removing mutability is one such solution.')
