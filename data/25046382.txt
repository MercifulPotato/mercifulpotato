It was a way to belittle the importance of people&#x27;s skills and organizational value. When I first read &quot;PatchGirl&quot; I saw switch-board operators, not superheros - because it sounds exactly like a name that would get applied to women&#x27;s work in the 1950s.<p>The same is true for &quot;boy&quot;: if you want to imply someone&#x27;s not a man, you call them &quot;boy&quot;... but no one after the 1950s would do this in an office setting unless they were being antagonistic. Again, it&#x27;s fine for a superhero!<p>I think that&#x27;s why some people will be against the name. Words are powerful, and have been used powerfully in the past. If you&#x27;re not aware of the past (or not adversely affected by it) then it seems like a stupid nitpick - but to some there&#x27;s a negative reaction to seeing history repeating.')
