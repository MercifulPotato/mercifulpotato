Michael Batnick once explained it. If I ask you to calculate 8+8+8+8+8+8+8+8+8 in your head, you can do it in a few seconds (it’s 72). If I ask you to calculate 8x8x8x8x8x8x8x8x8, your head will explode (it’s 134,217,728).<p>what does this have to do with anything. no kidding that multiplication is harder than addition (it requires many additions).<p>Using Microsoft and Bill Gates  as an examples is major example of survivorship bias. What about the hundreds or thousands of other companies and founders  that tried such an approach and still failed. Yeah, in hindsight anything Microsoft does will look like genius given how successful Bill Gates and Microsoft  are. if Bill gates had policy of tying his shoes at work instead of at home, people would probably read into that as part of his success.')
