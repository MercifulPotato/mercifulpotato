To me the increasing irrelevance of a term &quot;functional&quot; is in fact the biggest success of the FP: it is entering the realm shared by, say, the term &quot;structural programming&quot; which is so universal that it became meaningless. It is an amazing feat given that no other terms for programming paradigms ever have been close this much!<p>Given any standard about the FP, there is a definite disparity between languages that should be called functional and languages that are actually called functional. I think the increasing universality of functional paradigm explains this, and kibwen is merely proposing another term describing the latter.')
