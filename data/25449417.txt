It&#x27;s hard to find info about this because most info about listing things on Amazon is hidden behind hoards of information from course sellers and &quot;get rich quick with amazon FBA&quot; content.<p>Essentially, Amazon either wants you to A) register a trademark and your brand (the only way to list things without UPC&#x27;s and use amazon&#x27;s internal &quot;fxn&quot; label scheme) or purchase UPC&#x27;s for each product you sell.  UPC&#x27;s are intended to be the same for your product wherever it ends up on the web and are intended to uniquely identify your products.  Technically you <i>could</i> purchase a new UPC for each place you list your items, but that can get expensive.  Amazon leverages UPC&#x27;s to identify items in their warehouses and more importantly trace counterfeit items or food items that could require a recall.  It used to be common for people to re-sell existing UPC&#x27;s but recently amazon has started banning sellers for this practice.  Having expensive UPC&#x27;s is also a way to make the barrier to entry higher, making sellers on Amazon really have to <i>want</i> to sell on amazon.<p>The game theory and psychology of it all is pretty interesting.')
