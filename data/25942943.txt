Just 2-3 mere weeks before I got fired. To be let go almost exactly after you muscled through a mountain of obstacles and started loving the job and the people... that definitely did hit a vulnerable spot inside of me, I admit.<p>&gt; <i>Also, I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;ve been in that gig and it bites. I suspect you dodged a bullet even if you got grazed.</i><p>Long-term I am sure I&#x27;ll think the same but in the meantime my income took a hit. Sigh.')
