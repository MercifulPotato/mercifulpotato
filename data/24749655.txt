A line of kernel code is much more expensive to develop than a line of application code. Of course, size is not be best metric by which to judge a project; it&#x27;s always better to have more capability with less code if you can manage it. For its size Linux supports quite a wide variety of architectures and add-on hardware. Also, a great deal of effort goes into keeping the kernel codebase maintainable, which is more likely to manifest as lines of code <i>removed</i> rather than added.')
