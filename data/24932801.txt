The real behaviour of humans cannot be reduced to three or four inalienable axioms. Even moreso, these axioms are by definition unjustifiable, which makes any system based on them unjustifiable as well. Any attempt to reduce human behaviour to an axiomatic system is necessarily a total failure.<p>The attempt to criticize empiricism by praxeologists is an exercise in obfuscated hypocrisy and a total contradiction. You cannot at once claim that only one&#x27;s actual behaviour matters, and at the same time arguing that some unknown agent makes that behaviour unreproducible. It&#x27;s completely absurd at every level.<p>This is incidentally why Austrian economics fails so hard at actually making any good predictions. It rejects in its totality the scientific method. It&#x27;s closer to a theology than anything else.')
