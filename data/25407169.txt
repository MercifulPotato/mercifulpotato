Driving aggressively when below the speed limit, or being distracted, is far more dangerous than just driving quickly on a clear road. The emphasis on speed is mainly because it’s easy to measure and enforce.<p>There’s standard etiquette there to slow down when there are vehicles in the distance ahead or curves or imperfect visibility. You don’t have to drive like a mindless drone holding a one-size-fits-all-situations speed limit. You and other drivers are generally safer going 160 km&#x2F;h on a mostly empty highway than 50 km&#x2F;h through an urban where there’s a much higher risk of encountering other people&#x2F;vehicles&#x2F;obstructions.')
