Item(by='qwerty456127', descendants=None, kids=[25224458, 25224650, 25224635], score=None, time=1606435086, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25222166, text='&gt; One of Mutt&#x27;s unusual strengths is that it actually displays message threads correctly. When people complain that they have trouble following email conversations involving groups of people, what they typically mean is that they are using a client such as Gmail that does not properly display the reply structure of email messages. When an email user hits the reply key, an In-Reply-To header should be added to the email. Mutt refers to these headers, and to the related References header, to keep track of which messages replied to what, and builds a tree to show the structure of the conversation. Some other mail clients attempt to construct this tree using only the Subject header<p>This seems somehow wild to me. Why don&#x27;t other email apps use the appropriate header fields? Why do they even try to use the subject field? Why do they insist on quoting the whole thread text below the message body? Why not do all this the proper way?')
