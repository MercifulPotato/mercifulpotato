You have to start somewhere and this is the first step towards it.<p>&gt; Seems silly, but it tells how serious this accord is.<p>Not silly at all. Peace Accords bind Nations. It has nothing to do with who was present at the signing ceremony. As long as it is accepted by the Nations involved it is as legitimate as they come.<p>&gt; We&#x27;ve had relations with the UAE for decades, they were never hostile to Israel<p>Hostility is not just in terms of War. Hostility can even be in terms of who the country votes for in the UN on key issues that concerns Israel. If you look at it that way, India has never been hostile towards Israel. Never waged a War. But we always supported the Palestinian cause. That has started to change because of the development of Israel-India ties with India moving closer to Israel than ever before since 2014. It was because of Modi&#x27;s visit to Israel and Netanyahu&#x27;s visit to India. These things might seem silly but this is how diplomacy is carried out. How else would you think a solution can be achieved without waging a big War? Through diplomatic means. For Israel, truly making friends is a big criteria. It helps in putting diplomatic pressure on Israel&#x27;s adversaries instead of resorting to military options! Right now Israel is using military options because it lacks unanimous support across the World. Nearly half of the countries in the World oppose Israel&#x27;s moves. Through these Peace Accords, the countries that were on the fence when it came to Israel will now be more enthusiastically involved in achieving final Peace in the region. Because they are now stakeholders too. Once these countries (and many others) join in, pressure will build on Israel&#x27;s adversaries to come to the table and negotiate a Peace deal. This is how it is done. One small step at a time.')
