It doesn&#x27;t have to be this way, it&#x27;s a product of our laws and can be changed.<p>Those feedback loops are directly created by wealthy people for wealthy people, because politicians like money like just everyone else its easy to manipulate them into creating feedback loops that help those wealthy folks amaze even more wealth.
