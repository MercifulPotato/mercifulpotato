I am fairly confident that the only reason Huawei is such a threat to US national security is that it will lose its power to go through your data. It is far difficult to have Huawei doing something dirty in Europe or US. Store your data with western companies if you are in China, and store your data with Chinese&#x2F;Russian companies if you are in Europe seems to be the least worse idea to me XD')
