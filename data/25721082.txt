They should have pivoted to be a free speech alternative to <i>sensible</i> conservatives, with sensible moderation, and market their product as such. As it is, no one wants to do business with a company that openly allows neo-nazis, anti-semites, and lately, criminals, on their platform, and no one with a brain would even want to be on such a platform.<p>I&#x27;m open to a Twitter alternative that is lenient on conservative views, as long as it has the right sort of moderation. And I really hope this alternative learns from Parler&#x27;s mistakes.')
