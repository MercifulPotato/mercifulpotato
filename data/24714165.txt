I guess if the host is choosing at random, and you conditionalize on &quot;being shown a goat AND a door you didn&#x27;t choose&quot; then you&#x27;re reducing that particular sample space down to be more heavy in the &quot;you got it right originally&quot; scenario, because the &quot;you got it wrong originally&quot; scenarios rule out half the goat doors from the hosts choices we&#x27;re considering.')
