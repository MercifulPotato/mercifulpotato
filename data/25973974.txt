You can sign up instantly for your organisation.<p>They throughout your time on them send you a spammy marketing email once every 3 to 5 days - the sort of stuff that&#x27;s everyone ignores. You get one renewal remind amongst all that crap a week before your final month, usually sandwiched between two other mails.<p>Then when you want to cancel it...there is no easy link to cancel online they way their is to sign up. To top it off, you have to cancel it before that final month before hand by opening up a ticket on their system. Then it&#x27;s not automatically cancelled, they setup a call to speak to a rep. If you miss that and then you enter your final month - they automatically renew and make you pay for another year up front! Even endless calls with the German call centre does not get a refund for this dark pattern.<p>TLDR: avoid TeamViewer')
