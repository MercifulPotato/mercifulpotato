That being said far more often that not, I don&#x27;t have that camera with me, or the ability to grab it and take a photo in seconds when a moment is fleeting, so certainly use my iPhone camera very often since it&#x27;s always with me, always on. And being able to get more out of those photos in raw editor that I would use for my normal mirrorless photos, is a great benefit. So while of course shooting raw in general is niche and shooting proraw would of course be more niche, certainly don&#x27;t think it would be infinitesimal in any respect.')
