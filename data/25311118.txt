It also means more complex opportunities like living in better areas with a greater chance to meet like minded people and having better&#x2F;more dumb luck.<p>Opportunities among the poor aren&#x27;t equal either. A rural poor kid has less access to things than the equally poor kid that lives in the big city. These things include industry outreach, better libraries, museums, concerts, better schools, all around greater access.<p>Rather focusing solely on educating and motivating a populous, we should also be figuring out how to provide better opportunities for our citizens. Instead of H1-B&#x27;s we might be better off forcing companies to hire kids that didn&#x27;t go to a small select number of schools, or to hire people from middle America, or just incentivize them to hire and train Americans.<p>Further we could expand our broadband infrastructure, provide a computer and internet to every person in America who doesn&#x27;t have access to neither.')
