I have a c910 and it is quite good, even in fairly low light. I would complain more that webcams don’t generally give you fine grain control over exposure, sharpness and resolution. Logitech did, until they decided to update their software to be more “friendly”. The camera is still solid, but it’s frustrating to see companies do this to themselves.')
