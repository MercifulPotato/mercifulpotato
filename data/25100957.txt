If we want equality and open dialogue, we have to be careful to make our language inclusive. &#x27;Vulnerable&#x27; is associated with being weak for some people and isn&#x27;t an inclusive word.<p>I don&#x27;t consider myself vulnerable when I share something close to my heart. I would never share anything in a space where being &#x27;vulnerable&#x27; was encouraged.<p>Open and honest.. not vulerable.')
