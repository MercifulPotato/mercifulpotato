We will prioritize the needs of the worst off. Neutrality never helps the victim.<p>Social justice is a progressive view normally running counter to the individual responsibly outlook favored by conservatives. Prioritizing the needs of the worst off could be supported by conservatism but they will probably define &quot;worst&quot; in a way conservatives find objectionable. As for &quot;Neutrality never helps the victim&quot; that runs counter to a lot of American conservative thought that rule of law and applying rules neutrally is a massive progress over previously biased systems. The implication of the statement is that they want to remove neutrality in certain circumstances for certain people which goes against the conservative view that all people should be treated equally.')
