We expect our new fully driverless service to be very popular, and we’re thankful to our riders for their patience as we ramp up availability to serve demand. Later this year, after we&#x27;ve finished adding in-vehicle barriers between the front row and the rear passenger cabin for in-vehicle hygiene and safety, we&#x27;ll also be re-introducing rides with a trained vehicle operator, which will add capacity and allow us to serve a larger geographical area.<p>I&#x27;m struggling to understand what this meas. On the one hand &quot;In the near term, 100% of our rides will be fully driverless&quot;, but, on the other hand, &quot;Later this year, ..., we&#x27;ll also be re-introducing rides with a trained vehicle operator, (...)&quot;. So &quot;the near term&quot; is at least next year?<p>Anyway it&#x27;s difficult to understand exactly what is changing with this announcement. The (original) title makes it sound like <i>everyone</i> in Phoenix (&quot;...the general public in Phoenix&quot;) will be able to hitch a driverless ride, but the text on the announcement makes it sound like only Waymo One members -and their relatives- will be able to do so (&quot;Beginning today, October 8, we’re excited to open up our fully driverless offering to Waymo One riders. Members of the public service can now take friends and family along on their rides and share their experience with the world.&quot;).')
