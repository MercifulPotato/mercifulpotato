Then convince your manager of that idea, usually by getting him&#x2F;her to think that they came up with the idea on their own. Then keep on repeating this, and people will be able to accept more and more process improvements that have less and less direct ties to shipping more features, because they&#x27;ve seen the results of all the improvements along the way. And then eventually your manager gets promoted for doing such a great job on improving productivity in their team, and because they like and trust you, you get promoted into their vacated position.')
