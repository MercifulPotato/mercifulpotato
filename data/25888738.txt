I clocked over 2 hours of wasted time every day for the average person for the 4 teams I am able to observe from where I sit. all expectations were met, and on time and on quality with this 20% time wasting. \nwfh has freed up 1.5 to 2h a day for me because people don&#x27;t walk up to my desk a literal 6 times a day to go get coffee or see what&#x27;s up. also the volume of &quot;can I run something past you&quot; had plummeted to only 10% of what it use to be. that use to happen once or twice daily, and now happens like once a week. if people don&#x27;t see me sitting there, they don&#x27;t ask me how to do their job. it&#x27;s amazing.<p>not to mention I can now walk on a treadmill while at my desk, save time commuting, save money on dry-cleaning and gas, and I can be productive with my life during all those meetings you are forced to attend but don&#x27;t involve you in any way. wireless headsets with the camera off is great. I can talk when needed, mute myself for 50 of the 60 minutes, and do a mindless task like vacuum, dust, dishes, fold laundry, etc, while listening to people debate pointless shit.')
