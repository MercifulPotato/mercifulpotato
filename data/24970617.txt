Your efforts to convert a nearly 100% far-right, Trump-led problem into an obfuscated “both parties” 50&#x2F;50 issue is completely untethered from reality and is so extremely far away from basic civil discourse that it’s unacceptable. By repeatedly trying to dogmatically assert it’s an issue of both parties, you are doing nothing but assisting horrific fascism from the far right. We are way past any point where someone can just casually claim this is debatable.')
