For me there&#x27;s a fine line between &#x27;somewhat functional&#x27; and &#x27;invalid&#x27;.<p>Two years ago, on a submission titled &quot;Laziness Does Not Exist but unseen barriers do&quot;, one of you all used the term &quot;invisible disabilities&quot; [0]. I found this to be descriptive of what I&#x27;ve experienced since I knocked myself out at the lake when I was 17 years old. From my reply to [0], &quot;I used to think I mostly recovered from that head injury, but I&#x27;ve recently realized that it left me rather non-functional. I&#x27;m making progress, but I guess I&#x27;m &#x27;invisibly disabled&#x27;, in certain ways.&quot;<p>In the beginning I went to some doctors trying to figure out my nerve condition. One of the tragedies of modern medicine [1] is how sometimes doctors diagnose their patient and treat the diagnosis, instead of looking deeper for causes behind the patient&#x27;s symptoms. Such is the essential nature of a 10-minute office visit. I did get a helpful idea recently -- a PA suggested my one symptom indicated &#x27;allergies&#x27;. My subsequent searches turned up better treatments than the medications I was prescribed.<p>Recently I made a disability-act complaint with the state attorney general&#x27;s office about being discriminated against by a business. The main thing was they didn&#x27;t realize they did anything wrong, and I&#x27;m not the only person getting discriminated against in that specific way. I figured that by making the complaint I was also helping others who are similarly &#x27;invisibly disabled&#x27;, much worse than I am, who aren&#x27;t capable of figuring out how to stand up for themselves against societal idiocy. The state Attorney General&#x27;s office was swamped with similar complaints. It was 1.5 months before my intake interview. I don&#x27;t know how many complaints they decide to go with, but I had my story and documentation in order and the AG&#x27;s office agreed to file charges on my behalf. I bet the business won&#x27;t even remember me.<p>tl&#x2F;dr: many people have chronic conditions. Sometimes people can recover, sometimes they won&#x27;t, but I think it important to help people maintain &#x27;hope&#x27; that they can do something to improve their situation, or find some insight into their predicament that provides a silver lining. Christopher Reeves&#x27; [2] comes to mind. Two quotes:<p>&quot;When we have hope, we discover powers within ourselves we may have never known- the power to make sacrifices, to endure, to heal, and to love. Once we choose hope, everything is possible.&quot;<p>&quot;You play the hand you’re dealt. I think the game’s worthwhile.&quot;<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=17721273" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=17721273</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25355990" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25355990</a><p>[2] actor who played Superman (1978) &amp; became a quadriplegic in 1995 after falling off a horse...')
