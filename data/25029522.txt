The amount of information transmitted is 1 bit.<p>I don&#x27;t understand the argument here.<p>In order to get <i>up</i> to one bit of information, you need to take account of the fact that &quot;yo&quot; is only sent at particular times. If you ignore that fact, sending &quot;yo&quot; provides exactly zero bits of information, because it is the only possible message. <i>All</i> of the information content comes from the existence of the message; none of it comes from the contents.<p>So in order to claim that there&#x27;s any information present at all, you have to admit that time of sending carries information. The amount of information carried then depends on the duration over which messages <i>might</i> have been transmitted, since that possibility is what imbues information into messages that <i>are</i> transmitted. It also imbues information into messages that <i>aren&#x27;t</i> transmitted, unless you believe that a binary message of 01000110 transmits just 3, and not 8, bits of information.')
