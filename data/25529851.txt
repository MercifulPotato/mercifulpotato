How you behave in private is different to how you behave when you know someone might be watching.<p>Our access to privacy is normative of our patterns of thought and way of seeing the world. The lack of privacy might not seem important in individual cases but the cumulative effect is a weakening of our ability to think without boundaries.<p>Reducing the possible scope of discussion around this issue to one of political&#x2F;economic control I think fails to see a whole set of other important aspects here. Of course power and control are important issues too - just not the only issues. Privacy has always been an aspect of human societies - loosing it has the potential to change more than just our political and economic lives.')
