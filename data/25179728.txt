Some HNers say there is no difference because light is still light arguing this distinction is pseudoscience, but I&#x27;m left unconvinced. An argument for the distinction I&#x27;ve heard is that &#x27;transmitted&#x27; (or perhaps, better, &#x27;emitted&#x27;) light gives a false image that doesn&#x27;t allow the eyes to focus well. Does anyone know (of a good article that explains) the science behind this?')
