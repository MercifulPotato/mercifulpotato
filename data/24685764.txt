Still, you&#x27;re unlikely to go hungry.<p>I like the comparison to organizing a workshop. Everyone has their own preferred environments, editors, scripts, etc. And you&#x27;d probably feel as uncomfortable using someone else&#x27;s .vimrc as an ancient smith would have been in an unfamiliar forge. A craftperson&#x27;s tools are like clothes; it feels uncomfortably weird to use someone else&#x27;s.')
