It might make their business more expensive in certain parts but there are multi-billion dollar criminal empires that invest in things like their own submarine tech. Do you think e2e encryption isn&#x27;t something they&#x27;d develop in-house &amp; resell to each other?<p>At best it might help catch some street level crime but any serious organized crime (which arguably is a bigger problem because it&#x27;s organized) will have the tools available anyway. Consider it this way. There&#x27;s already a black market for security exploits with exploits frequently costing far more than they might actually otherwise be worth (there&#x27;s a limited time utility before the exploit is patched). How much do you think e2e encryption would cost &amp; do you think there&#x27;s not going to be buyers &amp; sellers for this? Especially since, unlike exploits, this is an infinitely distributable solution. I can sell to as many buyers as I want without risking my revenue stream.<p>On the technical side we&#x27;ve observed what happens with this stuff. We&#x27;d be one Snowden-style leak away from all websites instantly becoming vulnerable. Do you not think that might be valuable to adversaries of the USA?')
