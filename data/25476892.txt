It&#x27;s not bad per se, but it&#x27;s not solving any issues. Just think of the times you had fun with friends, that&#x27;s what friendship is. All this deep, near metaphysical thought on friendship simply does nothing, just as thinking hard and deep about food does not make it taste better.<p>Love, food, friendship, music, you can talk, think, write about it, but it does very little for the actual experience of them. If anything, it makes you less able to experience them because you&#x27;re too busy anaylysing it.')
