He said that no other therapy and approach looked at shame. Shame was at the root of many violent offences. I think one example, for example, was that an offender held intense personal shame for things that happened to or by them and that shame was a driving force. I think he said that shame is so deep down that people will do everything to avoid others uncovering it.  So you have shame and are willing to break the law to avoid others seeing it.<p>Im leaving this hear as it will probably be missed in the active chat, but perhaps someone in the future will find it via a search, if you do, I&#x27;d be interested in this theory as I&#x27;ve never heard anything more about it since.')
