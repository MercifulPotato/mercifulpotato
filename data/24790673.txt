SF makes most of its income in tourism and tech. There isn’t much travel right now and there is a tech exodus. So the deficit is growing everyday.<p>Bars and restaurants have been either on strict lockdown or reduced capacity since early March, a lot of them that have been around for decades are closing.<p>So now we have an exodus of small businesses, tech workers, and reduced tourism.\nThe city will have to convince tech workers and small business owners to come back while they probably increase taxes to work off the deficit. The lack of small businesses and increase in squalor will impact tourism even after COVID and the longer COVID goes on the more damage there is.<p>I don’t see the SF govt cutting expenses until it’s absolutely necessary. Overall it seems like an uphill battle. I feel really bad for the small business owners in SF who are likely never going to recover from this.')
