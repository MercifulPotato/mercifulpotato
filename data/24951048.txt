Modern sound cards however tend to use sampling rates twice as high - 44100 Hz or 48000 Hz”<p>CDs are&#x2F;were 44100 hz, they were never 22000, because you need two samples per wave and because you need slight over sampling and to make the conversion from 48k in to bad math to discourage DAT machine as a lossless copy format for the masses.')
