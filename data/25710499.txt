The most effective way is with weight training at a gym, but it isn&#x27;t the only way. Bodyweight training can definitely help you put on muscle, it will just be a bit slower. There are some natural limits to how far you can take it, but by the time you hit them you will be way more comfortable and aware of where to go next.<p>As a fellow hardgainer, as the industry calls it, I would recommend weight training if you want to get it done within the year, but if that isn&#x27;t an option yet, get started with bodyweight stuff.<p>No one is trying to sell you anything with general weight training, it&#x27;s tried and true. Just forget the paid programs. Forget supplements, just eat well and regularly, and be mindful that you can only grow as fast as you can recover so sleep and food are just as important. If you aren&#x27;t able to eat enough, you can train a bit less. It&#x27;s all a balance.')
