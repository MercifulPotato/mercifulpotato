I upgraded from a 2015 Macbook Air (both used), and the extra speed was useful. I don’t really feel to need for it to be any quicker though. But like you I use the ports all the time—so upgrading would in some sense feel like a downgrade.<p>(btw in my experience the battery can be replaced easily, also at non-official repair shops)')
