The books my kid has are mostly rural or have no setting at all.<p>I agree that stories involving houses tend to portray single family homes. I can&#x27;t think of any that actually portray that house in a suburban setting (the premise of the article). I&#x27;m sure they are out there, but none come to mind for me.<p>Then the question is really, so what if the settings are not suburban? I didn&#x27;t really see an answer to  that in the article, so I guess they were just trying to point out that there may be fewer topics for childhood adventures set in suburban areas.')
