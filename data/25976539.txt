This should not be surprising. There is no career path for you doing software in an agency like the CDC run by bio science people. Same for the Air Force, which is run by fast jet pilots, the Congress by lawyers and liars, Commerce by thieves, etc. Even banks and trading firms, who live and die by software, are run by accountants and economists.<p>Unless an organization recognizes the core importance of software and carves out a specialisation stream and C level ownership of it, they rarely achieve more than brief or isolated competence.<p>This is the reason why SV is so appealing -- nowhere else do SWEs hold sway over entire companies and industries.<p>Govt can do excellent software if it becomes a priority, they could pay competitive wages (there are special pay scales for doctors and lawyers), but they choose not to because of risk aversion from politicians, who mistakenly believe they can outsource the risk.<p>For something like this, paying Eventbrite to do it wouldn&#x27;t have been a bad place to start. But the fat cat consulting firms never have domain expertise beyond getting Govt contracts.')
