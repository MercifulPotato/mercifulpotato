If people want to form small clubs within which to share lived experiences without fear of societal retribution, then I&#x27;m fine with that.<p>&gt; make spokespeople and activists extremely vulnerable<p>As you&#x27;ve demonstrated, anonymity is an imperfect system of protecting such spokespeople, so they should have greater legal protections. Reducing the spectrum of internet anonymity would actually support this goal as it&#x27;d simplify applying existing legal protections such as restraining orders within the internet domain.<p>&gt; Beside, plenty of far-right reactionaries are entirely unafraid of attaching their names to their beliefs. Just look at the stuff people say on Facebook.<p>Perhaps, but that far right ideology must receive social promotion through &#x27;likes&#x27;, &#x27;shares&#x27;, and other such mechanisms in order to spread their message. Why is it necessary for these acts to be anonymous?<p>I sincerely don&#x27;t understand how further decentralisation or federation could help resolve the problem. It just seems to me like you&#x27;d be making the moderation problem harder as you&#x27;d be shifting the burden from a few large companies to many small companies.')
