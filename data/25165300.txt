In the case of a government, there&#x27;s a broad prohibition against censorship regardless of content.  So whether or not I approve of an idea doesn&#x27;t enter into the equation when faced with government censorship.<p>But if I don&#x27;t feel there&#x27;s a similar prohibition against corporations or individuals censoring things on their platform&#x2F;property&#x2F;whatever, then I have to think about whether or not I agree with the proposed censorship for other reasons.    That&#x27;s not a retreat to the motte - that&#x27;s just an acknowledgement of the fact that anti-government-censorship arguments don&#x27;t necessarily apply to private entities.<p>Once we&#x27;re dealing with an entity for which I don&#x27;t have a blanket objection to censorship, it makes perfect sense that I would accept some content bans but not others, based on my opinion of that content.')
