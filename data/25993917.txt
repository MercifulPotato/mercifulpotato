Item(by='cxr', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612213437, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25991239, text='&gt; I&#x27;d personally like to see more of a focus on productivity applications<p>Agreed.  I mentioned recently (yesterday), however, that if the Solid Project focused more attention on an architecture that better accommodated &quot;dead&quot; formats, such as a way for someone&#x27;s $USERNAME.github.io static site to serve as the front door to their data store—at least the parts that they&#x27;re already putting in public—then there&#x27;d almost certainly be a lot more interest and adoption.  The current state of Solid and the (few) Solid apps that exist unfortunately assume a sufficiently smart data store.  (A similar thing applies to the remoteStorage protocol, too, which has been around for some time now, and is in some ways a precursor to Solid, but has still seen little adoption.)  The net effect is that despite people voicing their support for it in principle, few people are actually willing to migrate and live &quot;in&quot; the thing—including most of the folks in the Solid community themselves.  &quot;Social&quot; is overblown (I&#x27;m certainly one of the first to say so), but network effects do have some value.<p>Mastodon as I understand it is similar.  The subset&#x2F;flavor of ActivityPub that it uses (to the best of my knowledge) does not expect a person to be handcrafting notes and placing them on a static site.  It too assumes a sufficiently smart server for managing subscriptions, etc, which is unfortunate and a violation of the Principle of Least Power &lt;<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.w3.org&#x2F;DesignIssues&#x2F;Principles.html#PLP" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.w3.org&#x2F;DesignIssues&#x2F;Principles.html#PLP</a>&gt;.  It is ultimately about the <i>data</i> after all—linked data.  It&#x27;s not supposed to be <i>about</i> &quot;live datastores&quot; or &quot;active services&quot; as things unto themselves.<p>Compare each with RSS, for example, where adding a feed for a site hosting on GitHub Pages is trivial.  Look further to the Wayback Machine.  Platforms and services die, but data in its useful form is already dead.  It&#x27;s still susceptible to being lost, but live systems are <i>much</i> more fragile.')
