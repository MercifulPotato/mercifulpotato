I wrote that it was probably legal (at least within specific boundaries) for the Israeli&#x2F;US governments to approve such actions on foreign soil, which are after all one of the <i>raison d&#x27;etre</i> of the CIA and Mossad.\nBut of course the operatives in Iran did commit murder under Iranian law and they were subject to that jurisdiction.<p>It&#x27;s always a question of perspective.<p>Regarding your second point, there is obviously a part of intimidation in doing something like that. It&#x27;s even mentioned explicitly off the record in the article:<p>&quot;<i>But some American officials argued that the death of Mr. Fakhrizadeh, the latest in a string of such mysterious killings of Iran’s top nuclear scientists, would send a chilling message to the country’s other top scientists working on that program: If we can get him, we can get you, too.</i>&quot;<p>&#x27;Terrorism&#x27; is a term always used against others, the bad guys.
