The part not being considered is that some problems are hard to solve and developers will make a mess even with the right tools. Programming isn’t easy, but especially in uncharted territory. I think that’s why choosing tools you at least know has merits.<p>I spent a lot of my career consulting as a mess cleaner, more or less, and even very smart people end up making a mess sometimes. Time constraints, shifting goal posts, all of it.<p>I’d say the worst thing I ever see, regardless of tools, is premature optimization getting in the way of everything else.')
