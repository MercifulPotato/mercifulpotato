The board supports two 27&quot; 4k monitors. One laptop stand has legs under the bed and an arm that extends over the bed. The other laptop stand holds a counter weight and clamp to make sure the board is stable. One of the 27&quot; monitor is over the bed, the other is next to it but not over the bed.')
