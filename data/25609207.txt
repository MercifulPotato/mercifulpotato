To whose satisfaction?<p>Because aside from everyone under 18 being proxied through their parents&#x2F;guardians and a limited subset of wards of the State&#x2F;people granting powerof attorney for reason X, Y, Z, the legal reality is that yes, in fact by definition, those people do have the capability to make that judgement.<p>Deep down, you&#x27;re more annoyed that they don&#x27;t arrive at the same answer you do, even when presented with what you consider the samme set of facts and reliable sources. Let&#x27;s be clear.<p>You&#x27;re more annoyed you can&#x27;t compel them, or have the government compel them to do what <i>you</i> want. While whatyou should be thankful for is the fact they generally can&#x27;t do the same thing to you, leaving everyone at relative liberty to live life as they see fit.<p>You are free to do as thou wilt. Take your precautions. I certainly won&#x27;t judge you unreasonably.<p>But stow the arrogant and dismissive attitude around others exercising and having the same liberties you enjoy and using them to different ends. Further, the fact that none of these types of legislation ever include sunset dates is more evidence that people are just looking to centralize and enshrine broad and disruptive enforcement powers without regard to the overall effect on the landscape of our overall set of civil liberties.')
