Then, 20 years ago, it was all forgotten.<p>Behold my 1989 Bronco II:<p><pre><code>    ----------[++]-----------------------------------\n    MAX A&#x2F;C   PANEL  PNL&#x2F;FLR  FLOOR  FLR&#x2F;DEF  DEFROST\n\n    -----------------[++]----------------------------\n    COOL                                         WARM\n\n    OFF * * * HI\n\n    PUSH FOR A&#x2F;C\n</code></pre>\nIt has two sliders with positions as labeled above, then a rotating knob with 5 detented positions for the fan, and the label PUSH FOR A&#x2F;C. The COOL to WARM slider is also color coded blue fading to red.<p>Turning on the headlights lights the display.<p>No manual is needed to fully operate it. I never even had the manual for that car. The knob and sliders are trivial, tactile, and visual. There are no modes.<p>It&#x27;s near perfection in user interface design.')
