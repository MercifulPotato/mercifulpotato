Can bad representations of white people not simply remain encapsulated to them?<p>Saying that everything related to the impoverished <i>must</i> by some means also relate to people of colour is not only clearly wrong, but the <i>classism</i> that the author is ranting against.<p>Lastly, the author is wrong where she writes<p>&gt; White supremacists are natural villains but shouldn’t be glorified even a little, which limits their effectiveness as a fictional threat...<p>The critical success of Lovecraft Country which features villainous racist wizards, puts this to shame, as does the success of Watchmen before it which shed light on the Bombing of Tusla (aka Black Wall Street Massacre) that a whole generation of children likely did not learn about before.<p>In other examples, comic book villains have historically been associated with America&#x27;s enemy du&#x27;jour.
