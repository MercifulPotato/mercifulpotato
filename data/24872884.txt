The stylegan &quot;input&quot; is essentially used to control parameters at various stages within the network, so you could adjust them one at a time, or on varying schedules or something, to get the sort of gradual effect.<p>I know that randomly instantiated neural networks can produce some pretty trippy image transformations as well, so maybe there is a way to bootstrap without paired data.<p>Lastly, I doubt this is on the right track but it would be cool if you could produce appropriately styled images with a &quot;compression&quot; approach. ie, trying to fit the audio information into some small visually meaningful latent space, and then using that to generate images.<p>edit: ok just watched the first example, back to square 1 for me. Its literally pulling stuff from paintings.')
