There are a lot of levels here, but when this is all done I suspect that the aggregate spent by retail traders on premiums for options that expired worthless will eclipse the final market cap of GME.<p>When there is this much volume, you have to remember that <i>someone</i> is in the middle of it taking a tiny fraction in order to facilitate it. These people are likely doing a very good job limiting their risk, and just printing money right now.<p>I suspect that overall we&#x27;ll end up with &quot;Hedge Funds&quot; (as an aggregate) in likely the same positions, intermediaries and market makers <i>wayyyy</i> up, and Retail (as an aggregate) way down. Which, I guess is the system that people are virtual-rioting over.')
