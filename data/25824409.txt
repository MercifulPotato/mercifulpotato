Nobody is moving these kids into the prison system. Traditional parenting can provide personalized rearing and still have that child end-up in prison. We also know that a single-parent household, even with a dedicated loving parent, will have challenges rearing children. How is the state supposed to do it? Worse, the kids who end up in foster-care, more often than not, will already have significant trauma and behaviour or mental issues.<p>So to summarize, you have the State dealing with two major issues that individually create an immense challenge, but together make it even harder:<p>1) The state can never scale resources to match typical parental rearing.<p>2) The state has to deal with a population of kids who are already suffering from behavioral or mental issues, drugs, or trauma. An affluent two-parent household with dedicated support workers would have trouble raising kids like that. How is the State supposed to do this?<p>I&#x27;m not sure what the right approach is here but it&#x27;s clear as day that there is no easy answer here.')
