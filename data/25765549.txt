I got lucky and saw a news article, perhaps on HN, about the infection the next day or two, verified I had it, removed it, and ran a set of offline backups. Had I not caught it, after a several day waiting period the malware would have encrypted my drives for ransomware. So I got ridiculously unlucky to get the infection, and then ridiculously lucky to see an article suggesting I might have it before it went off.<p>About HN, the parent comment is getting a disappointing amount of up and down voting relative to its total score.')
