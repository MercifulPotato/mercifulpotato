Item(by='mbrumlow', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611513237, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25893252, text='&gt; produces lists of suspects without explanation.<p>No. They will come up with some fancy sounding term to describe these situations. Some experts will agree this is a <i>sound</i> method and it will be used to get warrants.<p>They will just put the cause as &quot;suspect by unattended abnormalities&quot; (aka phone not used during crime)<p>Everybody will smile. Warrants will be made. Life&#x27;s turned up side down. And likely false arrest and convictions.<p>Even if we program rules into th3 AI to avoid this there is a real chance that the AI could work around and add people to thr list that it suspects is involved in one crime but could not list thr suspect do to rules, but a new crime opened a way for it to allow a suspect of crime one to br listed on crime 2.')
