It&#x27;s to give legitimate lower&#x2F;upper bounds of where Bitcoin could be in 10 years if it is successful.<p>I&#x27;m not saying it will reach the $1M price point. I&#x27;m saying &quot;If it does not fail, it could go there&quot;.<p>As you point out, there is still a non-zero probability that it fails and goes back to 0.')
