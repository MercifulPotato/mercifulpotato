The old USGS maps are often wrong and may not have been corrected if tree cover is sufficient you can&#x27;t see the road from the sky.<p>My late-model Garmin is conservative about what roads it takes, avoiding many good roads, but last week I saw some lady get stuck in an unplowed road in the state forest that her GPS sent her down despite a sign that says the road is unmaintained from Dec 1 to Apr 1.')
