Now, I&#x27;m creating Value Objects to ensure my data is both valid and correctly used elsewhere.<p>Same. I&#x27;ve written some complicated ETL&#x2F;data transform processes in PHP, and used arrays because the array_* functions are so useful for manipulation.<p>But keeping track of what keys were available was a nightmare - especially coming back to maintain the system.<p>Like you I&#x27;ve switched to Value Objects. In many ways it&#x27;s a pain (the intermediate representation that I&#x27;d stick into a new array key and pass to the next transformation - it doesn&#x27;t belong on any of the objects; and PHP needs the equivalent of the array_* functions for objects) but knowing I can&#x27;t use the wrong key somewhere makes it worthwhile.')
