Item(by='borroka', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609350176, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25567303, text='I hate to contradict you, but I am being told I am quite a positive person who&#x27;s helped many people on their journey to become more accomplished people. I did and I am doing quite well academically, professionally, and athletically. And I became accomplished by doing the exact opposite of what the Goggings, that other lunatic of Jocko Willink, Tim Kennedy and the Army, Navy Seals &quot;influencers&quot; recommend (I hope you are understand they are no different from the tik-tok dancers in terms of their ultimate motivation: money, spotlight, followers). In particular, I became accomplished by enjoying what I was doing, not f-this, f-that, let&#x27;s run for 30 miles with the hips close to the ground (Goggings) shouting nonsense at our (poor) partner who is filming from the car. How can you listen to that guy if not for the occasional laugh at the lunacy?<p>Why someone who is not a troubled teenager (and all these influencers were troubled teens) or a middle-age disappointed man (the message is always for men, where are the women?) should wake up at 4:30 am to do squats, bjj, or running? There is no reason whatsoever if you are not in one of those buckets. It is counter-productive, it is silly, it is kicking oneself in the genitals to tell their troubled internal voice: see, I can hurt myself, I can take it, I am strong. What an insecure, troubled way of approaching life!<p>Why someone should give up on things and actions that have been pleasurable since the dawn of times for all, say, normal people? I am thinking, and these are all hated by the military influencers, about a glass of wine, an escapade, a sudden decision that is not joining the Navy Seals, a night out with friends that ends at 4 am (not staying up late shooting other people, a favorite of Goggins and Willink. Yes, to give them a better future, I know. I have always found funny that men join the military at 17 because they, as they never forget to repeat, want a better world, which is always also what the US want, a terrific coincidence).<p>&quot;The concept that doing things that you hate doing is &quot;exercising of the muscle of willpower&quot; is very revealing. It&#x27;s something I&#x27;ve tried to do adopt, and it&#x27;s been a very powerful motivator in getting me to work out and reduce procrastination.&quot; - That&#x27;s terrible (long-term, short-term anything can work) advice, outside the tails (like people who hate showers, kids who hate calculations, middle-age men and women who hate small portions). Why not working toward enjoying the run, the squats, the learning? Why not &quot;following&quot; people who have a sense of lightness around them, who are &quot;fun&quot; to be around while being accomplished, instead of these soldier-philosophers who seem always pissed and look incapable of not putting a life lesson even in the broccoli they had for dinner? \nLet me give you an example: I don&#x27;t like exercising in the morning, it often gives me an headache, I tend to go hard and it tires me out more than I like during the day, I prefer to workout after 5 pm (like many other people). Now, tell me: why should I do &quot;something I hate to exercise my willpower&quot;, instead of— listen to this insight—exercising after 5 pm?<p>&quot;What good does writing a comment like this do you (or me, or anyone reading it)?&quot; - There is no big vision behind my comment; but since I have seen one too many people buying into this &quot;hard-man for hard times&quot; trope, I would like them to read my cynical comment and say to themselves: they (i.e., me) are right, I am not a troubled teenager that the Army can straighten up, I am not a disappointed man who needs to be radicalized by these early-risers lunatics, I am better than that.')
