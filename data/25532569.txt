Not being able to see extended family especially during holiday season can feel lonely and depressing.  Please, please, please don&#x27;t make this a solo suffering,  use FaceTime, Xoom, WhatsApp, Meet whatever to talk to friends&#x2F;family if you can.<p>If things feel worse - don&#x27;t keep it to yourself, for those in the US - 1-800-273-8255&#x27;s the number for National Suicide Prevention Lifeline.  And remember - this too shall pass, there is a light at the end of this fucking tunnel and we will get through it.<p>Take care and happy holidays!')
