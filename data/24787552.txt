Item(by='luckylion', descendants=None, kids=[24787950], score=None, time=1602762437, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24787464, text='&gt; Nativist anti-immigration demands in Europe or North America are generally criticized as hyperbole because immigration will not actually lead to demographic replacement in the near future, in spite of those activists’ claims.<p>The US is steering towards Majority Minority, is it not?<p>&gt; Furthermore, in Europe the immigrants invariably assimilate linguistically to their host country – by the second or third generation, the language of the old country is forgotten.<p>That would be great, but isn&#x27;t the case.<p>&gt; China has the numbers to change Xinjiang’s demographics, and almost none of those Han Chinese immigrants are learning Uighur and using it in public.<p>Absolutely. My point isn&#x27;t that it&#x27;s great what China is doing, it&#x27;s just weird that &quot;you need to assimilate, it&#x27;s <i>their province</i>&quot; is a weird take when that same stance is violently opposed in other circumstances.<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s necessary either, human rights don&#x27;t need a justification of regional ownership. Even if you don&#x27;t think that Han shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to settle there, you can still be appalled by the things the Chinese government is doing.')
