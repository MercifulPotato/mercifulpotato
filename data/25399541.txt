I know plenty of earnest (and, frankly, quite talented) people. What they lack is capital and guidance (and maybe some discipline and motivation, to be fair). But, they will read a PG essay and say, &quot;Hey! That&#x27;s me! Why can&#x27;t PG invest in me?&quot;. To which case, they quickly realize, &quot;Oh, cause I can&#x27;t show that I can make any money from my idea. Or, because I&#x27;m not savvy at manipulating people or presenting my ideas well.&quot; Or something like that.<p>So, what are those types of people to do?')
