There&#x27;s a reason why most countries have a very tight control of gambling places, and that&#x27;s not because they&#x27;re classists.  When gambling is allowed, the whole society suffers, because there will be a few lucky winners and many who just lost their life savings, and they still have to eat (and their families have to eat) so someone&#x27;s tax payment is going to pay for them.<p>I agree that it&#x27;s a problem when &quot;too big to fail&quot; players get away with their shenanigans, but that&#x27;s a separate problem, and you don&#x27;t solve that problem by encouraging common folks to gamble away their wealth.')
