Item(by='waterhouse', descendants=None, kids=[24843939], score=None, time=1603240165, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24843487, text='&gt; Kids can take the California High School Proficiency Exam, leave high school at 16<p>Yep.  Though I didn&#x27;t do any college after that.  I messed around with mathematics and programming for about 5 years, then made a serious effort to find a programming job, and have been working since then.<p>I didn&#x27;t know about the CHSPE until 9th grade, though, when my sister told me about it (because she had a friend who used it too).  Before then, my impression was that there was no feasible alternative to school.  Certainly no one at school mentioned it.<p>Also, you&#x27;re not allowed to take the CHSPE until either age 16 or in the second semester of 10th grade.  Which strikes me as stupid.  Seems to me that, if you manage to pass it at a younger age, then that is a <i>stronger</i> proof that you&#x27;re smart&#x2F;hardworking and shouldn&#x27;t be stuck taking 9th grade or 8th grade or whatever.  (I imagine most of my peer group could have passed it in 6th grade; it is really a test of basic minimum competency.)')
