Sure the colors weren&#x27;t great, but the cubes were about five feet high and relatively big.<p>They blocked out most of the sound and very few visual distractions when you were sitting down. They worked well if you wanted relative peace and quiet to concentrate.<p>Since then they have switched to open-concept with cubes about half the size and walls that are maybe four feet high. So now people have plenty of visual distractions and a lot more noise. Didn&#x27;t help they added sit-stand desks so you will have people who get on calls while standing and can be heard 30+ feet away.')
