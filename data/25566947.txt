And, if social necessity were how work were allocated, rather than what makes capitalists the most money, we&#x27;d almost certainly see more tree planters and animal rescuers and homeless person assisters.<p>But, I&#x27;m afraid you&#x27;re wrong about the main concern, if only in my particular case.
