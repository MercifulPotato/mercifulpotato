The defining characteristic of roguelikes is exploring game mechanics amidst permadeath. Starting over is fun, and different every time. These are the important traits. BoI, FTL, Spelunky et al are most definitely Roguelikes in that runs don&#x27;t influence future runs, the world is randomly generated and doesn&#x27;t persist, and things can take wild turns and every run ends drastically differently.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what the author is going for, beyond pedantry for the sake of being pedantic. I don&#x27;t know any Roguelikes developers (Angband, Caves of Qud, etc.) that feel strongly about use of the term. Enjoy it! Play good games!')
