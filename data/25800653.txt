You can be dogmatic about, for example, code comments - and dogmatics are not thinkers.<p>I used to work with a guy who was representative of this dogma. He&#x27;d give people a hard time if they didn&#x27;t comment every line of code, and his own comments would be shit like:<p><pre><code>  if (country == &quot;Japan)     &#x2F;&#x2F; If the country is Japan\n    total_cost = price       &#x2F;&#x2F; set total_cost equal to \n  price\n  else\n    total_cost = price + tax &#x2F;&#x2F; Otherwise, set total_cost to price+tax\n</code></pre>\nHe thought this was great, and was upset when I&#x27;d tell him this is completely useless (comments don&#x27;t provide any information over the code) and it&#x27;s missing the one thing that would be good to actually document: <i>why</i> is Japan different?<p>People like this heard somewhere that comments are good, and thus good people write comments, and if I am a good person then by gosh I am writing comments. They don&#x27;t think about utility at all.')
