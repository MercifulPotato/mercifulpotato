Depends on the apocalypse.<p>Imagine a climate change apocalypse rather than the nuclear wasteland of Fallout or Mad Max.<p>Let the sea levels rise enough to displace everyone who is within 30 feet of sea level, add in some famines (also brought on by climate change) and since it&#x27;s the theme this year, a plague or two exacerbated by a billion climate refugees in camps and slums being ignored by anyone still prosperous.<p>You could end up in a situation fairly apocalyptic, but still have the scavenged resources to assemble an internet, assuming there wasn&#x27;t some sort of anti-tech uprising among the survivors, angry at technology for causing the disaster and determined to smash any surviving technology (and technologists) to prevent it from happening again.')
