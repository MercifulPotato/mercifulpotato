But they aren&#x27;t under Best Reasonable Efforts obligations to <i>use</i> this capacity for the EU. (The definition of Best Reasonable Efforts overlooks distribution entirely.)<p>It&#x27;s a shitty situation. Pain has to be allocated. But based on contract, versus loose notions of fairness, AstraZeneca is under no obligation to export British-made doses to the EU.')
