Item(by='HenryBemis', descendants=None, kids=[25942361, 25942149, 25941757], score=None, time=1611841896, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25941277, text='&gt; privacy oriented fintech<p>this phrase is an oxymoron. Banks need to monitor, track, report activities. Central banks &#x27;siphon&#x27; all transactions every day&#x2F;week&#x2F;month, so they can cross reference that Henry Bemis made in total $100m transactions today even if he used 50 different banks. A single bank can only track&#x2F;monitor for AML its own clients. Central Banks can do that. Tax authorities can tap into bank&#x27;s data.<p>Side note: There is no such thing as privacy when you use a card. The only thing that &#x27;protects&#x27; you is that your bank won&#x27;t sell your data to Facebook. But NatWest banking app DOES talk to FB when you fire it up... so... at least they don&#x27;t tell FB (yet) everything you do.')
