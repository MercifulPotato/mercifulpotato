Not among image optimizers, but among tools that can be accessed with any web browser simply by typing a domain name in the address bar. Most of those tools are merely frontends for a server doing the work and as such something that wouldn&#x27;t even be allowed in many lines of work.<p>I see what irks you, calling it &quot;privacy-aware&quot; and not something more technical like &quot;installation-free client side&quot;, but it can be a pretty cool approach to many rarely-encountered problems.<p>I&#x27;m not much into &quot;JPEG optimization&quot; (whatever that is, I just bite the bullet and wait those ten seconds GIMP takes for startup on my otherwise comically fast Ryzen 9 Windows box whenever I feel like tweaking JPEG compression), but <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hexed.it&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hexed.it&#x2F;</a> has been a friend for many years: i rarely need a hex editor, but even if I happen to run into a &quot;guess it&#x27;s time for a hex editor!&quot;-situation twice on the same OS installation (unlikely), the last time would be so long ago that I would have forgotten what I installed. hexed.it is a godsend.
