Depending on the size of your datasets the JIT might slow you down a little, but the speed of Julia outweighs this. Liberally using functions really allows Julia to shine.<p>One thing that I’ve recently seen which concerns me long term is the creation of various competing macro syntaxes for reducing the wordiness of Julia. There are many competing implementations of pipes and other syntax sugars. These macros definitely make things easier, but as you use them the code becomes more difficult for another to understand and since there is at this time, no one set of macros to use, you’ll have to know each of the competing sets to make since of examples.')
