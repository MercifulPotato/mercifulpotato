We are very nervous...But<p>I have exciting news: we are launching the Huespace app (IOS ver.) today!<p>Huespace is a home decor community platform that creates color palettes for every home. Our color suggestion tool allows users to re-imagine their space through different colors, styles, and products. Users can also post images of their beautiful rooms to inspire other users.<p>As you know, current social media platforms are too vast - the experience there is not catered for people who are seeking ideas for their rooms. Most home decor images out there are ads or sponsored content. We strive for a more authentic platform by allowing users to share their own spaces.<p>We strive for a community where non-experts can become designers of their own spaces. And we need your help: please give us feedback on what you liked or disliked about our platform, so we can better serve users like you.<p>Thank you - and enjoy Huespace!<p>Demo Video : <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=t0mHgFV-sMw" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=t0mHgFV-sMw</a>\nIOS App store: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;app&#x2F;id1532674161" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;app&#x2F;id1532674161</a>')
