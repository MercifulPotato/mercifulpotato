Item(by='teraflop', descendants=None, kids=[25875385], score=None, time=1611341697, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25873902, text='&gt; It’s 1&#x2F;2 + 1 isn’t it?<p>&gt; That would mean in 3 servers you need 2.5 aka 3 machines to commit a change. Then 4&#x2F;5, 5&#x2F;7, 6&#x2F;9, 7&#x2F;11.<p>No, the requirement isn&#x27;t 1&#x2F;2 + 1. Any <i>strict</i> majority of the cluster is enough to elect a leader. So you need 2&#x2F;3, or 3&#x2F;4, or 3&#x2F;5, and so on.<p>&gt; Not to mention the time during which 1&#x2F;n machines are down due to an upgrade gets longer and longer the more machines you have, increasing the chances of double fault.<p>Generally, this is not the case. If individual machine failures are random and equally probable, and if each machine is down on average less than 50% of the time, then adding more machines makes things better, not worse. (This is a basic property of the binomial distribution.)<p>Of course, if you have a single point of failure somewhere -- e.g. a network switch -- this assumption can be violated, but that&#x27;s true regardless of how many machines you have.')
