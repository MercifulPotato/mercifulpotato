The most obvious case are NPCs that aren&#x27;t &quot;relevant&quot; anymore, e.g. people that have places around the city that depend on time of day. If their &quot;active&quot; time ends, they&#x27;ll start wandering off from their location. If you follow one, you can for a long time, but if you then even look away for a split second they&#x27;ll be removed, presumably because the game tracks them as something it wants to unload after their useful time has ended, but won&#x27;t do it while you look.<p>In earlier GTAs like San Andreas there is an explicit difference between &quot;traffic in the distance&quot; and &quot;traffic close by&quot; - the former will be removed if out of sight, doesn&#x27;t have full-fidelity 3D models, apparently doesn&#x27;t have physics applied to them, ... Once they get close enough, they get more complete and sticky. (GTA V quite possibly does the same, I just know less about the details there and its a lot less obvious)')
