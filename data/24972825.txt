With a multirepo you have to worry about code review and merge order before you get to worry about the deploy order. I would like to be able to review the library API change together with the changes in the app that need the new API. At my work we either review library changes in isolation, or we skip the review on library changes (if the author deems them trivial) and only do review on the main app changes, but that means we often miss opportunities for making the library API fit the use-cases as well as they could.')
