That was my first real introduction to programming. I had seen a BASIC prompt on an Apple II, but that lacked sufficient discoverability given my age and available resources at the time.<p>Hypercard, on the other hand came with some example stacks (its name for a self-contained application), and it was just a couple clicks to see how <i>anything</i> worked. It was, of course too limited to be used for serious work without external tools, but the potential, had it remained bundled with every Mac and given a few more iterations was huge. It was a big step toward making the personal computer a bicycle for the user&#x27;s mind as Steve Jobs once described it.<p>Nothing has really replaced it, and Apples most popular current platform now would forbid anything with equivalent functionality.')
