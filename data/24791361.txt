Item(by='AnIdiotOnTheNet', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602783601, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24791020, text='&gt; (1) is definitely by convention and not technical limitation, I definitely stated that during our last conversation.<p>Indeed, now that I think back I believe that was ultimately what you clarified about my misunderstandings of Haiku and package management.<p>What still baffles me somewhat that it seems normal (non-ported) Haiku applications are actually made less flexible by packaging them because they 1) have no non-base-system dependencies and 2) hpkgs only work from certain locations (IIRC currently hardcoded but could potentially be configurable).<p>Cortex does look a lot like the kind of system I&#x27;m thinking of. That&#x27;s wicked cool. When Haiku supports hardware accelerated video one imagines they could stick arbitrary shaders in the video pipeline to accomplish some useful, or at least really neat, things. I know built-in audio routing functionality would save me a lot of time on the Halloween display each year, maybe I should look at doing that with Haiku next time.<p>I see this quote in the comments about &#x27;hey&#x27;: &quot;hey is not a tool to send generic BMessages&quot;, which seems like a missed opportunity from way out here at 100ft. Otherwise the only thing that seems needed for GUI exposure is a script editor with &#x27;record&#x27; functionality and perhaps some kind of manager for how scripts are tied to system events.')
