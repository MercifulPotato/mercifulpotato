I obviously don&#x27;t have much to say about its overall efficacy yet, but I will say why I&#x27;m hopeful.<p>One of the initial steps in the process is to think about specific scenarios when you suffered a traumatic event (in my case, bullying) to bring up a physical, emotional response. In my case, even though this happened ~30 years ago, it&#x27;s not hard for me get into the memory, to feel the same fear response and to start crying. The idea behind EMDR is to essentially &quot;reprogram&quot; you body&#x27;s <i>physical</i> and <i>neurological</i> responses so that the memory no longer brings up the fearful&#x2F;depressed automatic nervous system response.<p>Now, there is a lot of debate over the effectiveness of EMDR, but in my research it seemed most of the debate was really over whether you get just as much benefit doing everything <i>except</i> the eye movements. From my personal perspective, I honestly don&#x27;t really care that much if the eye movements are the primary factor, but I will say that having to focus on something physical does feel more relaxing to me than just &quot;normal&quot; talk therapy about these experiences in the past. I&#x27;m really hopeful that, at least for now, it feels different, in a positive way, than what I&#x27;ve tried in the past.<p>Whatever you end up deciding, good luck!')
