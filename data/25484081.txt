Item(by='joshuamorton', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608442063, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25483386, text='&gt;  Also remember that at this time, the vast majority of the economy is self-sufficient farmers<p>By 1850, 40% of the population was employed in non-agriculture, GDP of non-agriculture was higher. Its unclear if this number included slaves as part of the population or not, but either way that suggests that either a minority (though a plurality), or a slim majority at most, was employed in subsistence agriculture style work.<p>But I want to reiterate that I&#x27;m not disagreeing with your conclusion, just with the line of reasoning that 5% of exports implies only a small amount of the economy.<p>&gt;  And the wealth that drew people to the country was mostly created after slavery was abolished.<p>I&#x27;m not sure I see the point here beyond &quot;slavery was a long time ago&quot;, and given the historically exponential nature of wealth and economic growth <i>most</i> of it will have been acquired recently. That doesn&#x27;t mean that perturbations to the initial conditions don&#x27;t matter, just the opposite: their impacts will be magnified many times over.<p>I&#x27;ll reiterate: could America have flourished without slavery? Probably (there&#x27;s some questions about early America and investment in the new world without slavery, which I think the 1619 project raises, but if you start from 1776, yeah at that point United States could probably have done fine without slavery, and it&#x27;s a tragedy that the founders didn&#x27;t make that choice). But the founders didn&#x27;t make that choice, so we&#x27;re left with a United States that did have an economy dependent on slavery. And it was dependent enough on slavery that half the states were willing to fight a war over slavery (I mean also the racism and white supremacy, but economic anxiety was at least one component even then).<p>&gt; That’s a very “original sin” view of slavery, where the country is forever tainted by the fact slavery existed at one time, regardless of whether there are any traceable benefits to people living today resulting from slavery.<p>But, like, there are. I mean you&#x27;ve admitted as much with things like the wealth gap. A significant portion of the white&#x2F;black wealth gap in the US can be traced back to slavery (and a lot of the rest of it to racist policies since then, some of which still exist today). That&#x27;s a tangible benefit.<p>I&#x27;m willing to concede that the 1619 project is perhaps to focused on slavery specifically, and might better be phrased as &quot;the US was founded on white supremacist principles that continue to exist and benefit many of its citizens at the expense of others, even today, with slavery as but one of the most visible,&quot; but I get the feeling you&#x27;d object to that also.<p>And those kinds of policies do influence the kinds of people we let immigrate, and who gets VC funding, and who gets hired, and and and.<p>As for &quot;original sin&quot;, I think drawing attention to broken systems is important, especially those systems we hold in extremely high regard. The aura around the US as the city on a hill or whatever that people like to push tries to absolve people of responsibility to fix broken systems, either by pretending that there are no problems now, or that there never were any problems to begin with.<p>Yeah sure, an immigrant who came here in the 70s didn&#x27;t contribute to the creation of slavery and the systems that grew out of it, but as long as those systems persist, they&#x27;ll be the beneficiaries (or victims, depending) of those systems. And yeah, some of those systems run deep in the American ethos.')
