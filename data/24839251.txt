We give them _visual_ control of everything. But say you wanted to make a component that pull the last 10 tweets from an account or a Stripe Checkout button or some other custom component, then you can.<p>Any React component is already a Makeswift component, the question is, how do you get the props? Well we&#x27;ve got a whole bunch of what we call prop controllers for basic stuff like numbers, colors, images, padding, margin, etc. You can also make your own. For example, in the Twitter feed component, you might make a panel that lets you search for tweets and then once you pick the account it passes the Twitter username to the component as a prop. The component can then fetch the tweets using the Twitter API, etc.<p>We have plans to open source all of our components as a reference for third-party developers building their own custom Makeswift components. Also, if you&#x27;re a company that already has an internal design system built in React, your marketing team can just drop those in to your Makeswift site (constrained by the props the developers decide to expose).<p>This is all internal right now, though. I can&#x27;t wait until we can release this API to the public, haha.')
