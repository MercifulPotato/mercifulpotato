I know it. Its about showing you &quot;fit in&quot;. You&#x27;re part of a certain class of people. Its stupid and humanity needs to move past it.<p>You know why I built a new computer on 7&#x2F;7&#x2F;2019 using an AMD R9 3900X chip? Because it was literally over 300% faster than my E3-1231v3 Xeon, that&#x27;s why. It wasn&#x27;t about &quot;signaling&quot; that I&#x27;m &quot;hip&quot; because I have AMD, it was because it cut my build times measurably and literally made me more productive.')
