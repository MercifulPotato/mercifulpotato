Nobody ever talks about the illiteracy in terms of &#x27;trees are air.&#x27; or &#x27;lasers are focused light&#x27; both of which are not common knowledge. Most people think Trees come from the ground and lasers are focused sound.<p>&quot;Scientific Illiteracy&quot; is almost always not about knowledge but rather political policy. Or in his words &quot;scientific facts people may remember.&quot;<p>That&#x27;s why Amy Coney Barrett&#x27;s vague non-answer is being construed as science illiteracy. While Kamala Harris is being portrayed as the winner. ACB is not giving any answer, she outright says she&#x27;s keeping her nose out of the political issue. There&#x27;s no answer whether or not she believes in climate change.<p>&gt;Inappropriate claims like this by politicians who want to be on the right side of science but who can’t be bothered to think about what it implies don’t help.<p>I think this illustrates the problem. This isn&#x27;t about scientific literacy, it&#x27;s about politics. This has nothing to do with science.')
