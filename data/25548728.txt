These are the sorts of skills that take a lifetime to develop.  All of the most senior staff at the intelligence agencies fall into this category.<p>This is why the intelligence agencies stick their fingers in their ears and sing &quot;LALALALALALA... I can&#x27;t hear you&quot; every time Chinese intelligence humiliates them.  They&#x27;re a one-trick pony: anti-Russian operations.  That&#x27;s all they know how to do.  They&#x27;re just trying to get to retirement, no matter what it costs the country.')
