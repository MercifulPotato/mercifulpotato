A few Webdev&#x27;s can write software that enables an entire web company in a few months. Due to the poor state of embedded development ecosystem the same is not true in hardware, compounded by the time&#x2F;effort required to workaround bugs in the hardware plus working in error prone C. Then embedded developers&#x2F;companies don&#x27;t share workarounds via open source, so every team must spend time working around already solved issues. Personally, I&#x27;m using the ESP32 largely because of the open-source SDK, that didn&#x27;t require an NDA or some crappy IDE, then I ported Nim to it. But normally it might take 2-3x more embedded devs to create products with comparable profits to similar devs in pure software')
