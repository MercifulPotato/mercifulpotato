Its why the romans did it, why the Germans did it, why the british did it , and its why we do it. It doesn&#x27;t take an econ degree to know that.  That was the reason the gold window was closed in the first place.<p>If the whole point of inflation, mind you, is to encourage investment, then why does the fed react by spiking interest rates in the , 60s&#x27; 70&#x27;s, 82 to address inflation...yet introducing a bona fide investment meltdown ? \nThats what reveals the facade.  If the purpose of inflation was to encourage investment, it is certainly an odd to react to inflation by increasing interest rates, and destroying business investment in the process.<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;You’re not supposed to save money under the mattress, s you’re supposed to save value by purchasing assets.<p>This sure sounds like you know better than everyone else. Its probably an attitude that would be frowned upon by someone that believes in freedom of choice, like we do in USA.<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Wages have on average kept pace with inflation.<p>I don&#x27;t know if that is true since you have no sources, but the total count of people living in the US under the poverty line is exactly where it was in 1959, and now, post pandemic, it is certainly far higher. So even if wages kept pace, which is uncertain, with technology advances and the dollar as the reserve currency, you would expect the total number of people to be lower.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;File:Number_in_Poverty_and_Poverty_Rate,_1959_to_2017.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;File:Number_in_Poverty_and_Pov...</a><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;You keep a small slush fund for a rainy day in a savings account that at least partially offsets inflation and you invest the rest. You don’t save money, you save value. You transact money. If you’re saving money you’re doing it wrong.<p>This is valid because there is inflation. But it saddens me to think that you think it is perfectly rational and acceptable to steal money from the savings of hardworking people, who often have to fend off scams left and right...and thus keep the money for themselves, for no real reason other than that it is what... you think.')
