Postgres&#x27; EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, SETTINGS) &lt;query&gt;, which shows a good bit of what you want, can slow queries down substantially (in some workloads). Primarily because of timestamp overhead.<p>Just always collecting that information just in case it may get accessed thus isn&#x27;t really feasible. It&#x27;d be good to make it possible to query cheaper information on-demand though (e.g. asking for the EXPLAIN of a query running in another session, without analyze, should be doable with some effort).<p>You can already set up things in a way that allows to correlate connections &#x2F; queries with distributed tracing. But it&#x27;s a more work than it should be. Postgres&#x27; pg_stat_activity shows queries, and it can include information that allows to correlate in the connection&#x27;s &#x27;application_name&#x27;.')
