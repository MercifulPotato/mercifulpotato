Also, the Mueller investigation and then Ukraine extortion impeachment trial both brought Russia into our daily thoughts.<p>That being said, this news isn&#x27;t anything specific to being Russophobic. Instead, it is more about how it would be naive to think that the website being hosted outside America makes it inherent that the NSA will hack it. And it being hosted in Russia means Russian intelligence will certainly have an easier time surveiling a site that was certainly already a target. Both of these intelligence agencies hacking and surveiling Americans without any due process is concerning regardless of which political party you belong to. Russia will certainly use any information it learns to aid its agents in the US further manipulate the Republican party. And the NSA, even if we less nefarious motives, still will be conducting such surveillance without and judicial oversight. Thus, I don&#x27;t think this amounts to an obsession with Russia as much as a valid concern and topic of discussion.')
