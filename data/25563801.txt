First there are loud drones and quiet drones, noise pollution can be regulated. Next the video from a drone for spying on a woman jogging is nothing compared to someone with a decent DSLR with a telephoto that makes zero noise. And third drone deliveries could have airspace carved out that avoids residential or places that would annoy people.<p>Now that said some people are obnoxious with it, they fly by people, make noise, I agree that should met with criticism, maybe fines, but I also believe drones will have a big impact in quality of life not just from delivery bots but police, medical, and including hobbyists.')
