I encourage you to build up a habit of diving deeper. Oftentimes our intuitions are wrong because they&#x27;re influenced by our local experiences, which are very rarely representative. It&#x27;s why we do things like run studies and experiments, because we&#x27;ve learned we can&#x27;t trust our experiences and intuitions. This pattern is, unfortunately, widespread and leads to a lot of problems.<p>This is actually a great little microcosm of one such problem: income inequality is a <i>huge</i> problem in the US; societies with dramatic income inequality are historically corrupt and unstable. However, it&#x27;s counter to a lot of people&#x27;s intuitions and experiences. So whenever someone tries to rally people to address it, people like you toss out lots of unrepresentative anecdotes (and employ other common fallacies) to try and convince people either it&#x27;s not a problem, or that it&#x27;s a feature and not a bug. And it works, because these fallacies are common bugs in the way people think about things.<p>It&#x27;s up to us to recognize these patterns in ourselves and others and work against them.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;press.princeton.edu&#x2F;books&#x2F;hardcover&#x2F;9780691167404&#x2F;success-and-luck" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;press.princeton.edu&#x2F;books&#x2F;hardcover&#x2F;9780691167404&#x2F;su...</a><p>[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nber.org&#x2F;papers&#x2F;w23733" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nber.org&#x2F;papers&#x2F;w23733</a><p>[3]: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.equality-of-opportunity.org&#x2F;assets&#x2F;documents&#x2F;race_paper.pdf" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.equality-of-opportunity.org&#x2F;assets&#x2F;documents&#x2F;race...</a><p>[4]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Anecdotal_evidence" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Anecdotal_evidence</a>')
