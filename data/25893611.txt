Seeing such discourse led me to finally take some action.<p>We shouldn&#x27;t be intentionally mean (and I agree there&#x27;s too much of that), but they&#x27;re literally killing themselves with their lifestyle. It&#x27;s something that they should be strongly dissuaded from by their peers and by society, for their own sake and society&#x27;s sake. It must be the leading health crisis in rich countries right now, now that smoking is unpopular.<p>It&#x27;s not 100% the obese person&#x27;s fault: food companies have hacked their dopamine systems with added sugar&#x2F;salt&#x2F;MSG&#x2F;etc (similar to social media companies hacking attention mechanisms), obesity is largely genetic (in terms of the tendency to overeat and ability to satiate hunger), obesity is likely triggered by some underlying mental health issue (e.g. depression), and evolution programmed us to eat us much as we can get our hands on. It&#x27;s hard to fight biology. But it&#x27;s not accurate that obesity is just a metabolism issue. Obese people take in too many calories, usually from added sugars and carbohydrates.
