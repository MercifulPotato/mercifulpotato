I gave most of that a read. It sounds like they’ve had members with ties to white supremacy, but the group isn’t overtly white supremacist (though, they’re labeled that quite a bit). The McInnes guy who started it seemed to shy away from that stuff as did the current guy? Are there specific hate crimes they’ve committed? It sounds like most of the violence they’re involved in is focused on fist fights with Antifa types and drunken bar fights.')
