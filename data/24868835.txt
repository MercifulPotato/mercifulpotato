For simple conversions?<p>I&#x27;ve been running basically this, which is a simple conversion to ogv, mp4, and VP9 webm, with a tiny bit of audio cleaning:<p><pre><code>    ffmpeg -y -nostdin -i $f -threads 8 -codec:v libtheora -qscale:v 4 -codec:a libvorbis -af afftdn -qscale:a 0 $f.ogv -codec:v libvpx-vp9 -qscale:v 4 -codec:a libvorbis -af afftdn -qscale:a 0 $f.webm -codec:v mpeg4 -codec:a aac -af afftdn -qscale:a 0 -qscale:v 4 $f.mp4\n</code></pre>\nAcross a huge dataset from a huge number of backgrounds, usually incredibly crap, for about 18 months, now. Without downtime. And with decent quality output, or at least pretty close to equal the input (did I mention it is often incredibly bad? Including near-broken files, and even some files with less than 20,000 pixels, total).<p>I&#x27;m not sure exactly what &quot;never worked&quot; means without more detail, but I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a workhorse.')
