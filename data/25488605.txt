Are you seriously suggesting that Tesla production will increase by 100x within a decade? Even if we assume that 100% of the vehicles sold in a decade are electric (highly unlikely), the majority of the increase is likely to come from the other companies. They are not going to sit still and let Tesla devour them.')
