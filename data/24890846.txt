The hospitality works could have another job, but those jobs can&#x27;t get created fast enough. How can they get paid by other people rather than the government.<p>Another question is post-covid do we want to ramp up consumption again. Do we need people flying to hotels to meet up, or will Zoom do? And if Zoom will do, what of the hospitality industry (already taking a stab wound from Airbnb etc.).')
