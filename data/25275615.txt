The licence document is clear on this:<p>&gt; <i>You may use the software in the virtual hard disk image only to demonstrate and internally evaluate it. You may not use the software for commercial purposes. You may not use the software in a live operating environment.</i><p>I think the heading <i>Get a Windows 10 development environment</i> is referring to downloading the image, rather than to licensing. I agree it&#x27;s not very clear.')
