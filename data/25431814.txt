This is actually exactly what Portabella (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;portabella.io" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;portabella.io</a>) started out as around 7 months ago.<p>I found that LocalStorage isn&#x27;t reliable enough to keep all your important stuff, so my thought was to encrypt everything client side and store in LocalStorage + a database. On session startup you just check the lastEdited date of the LocalStorage version vs. the database version and take the data with the latest.<p>That way it&#x27;s still offline first but you can also access your data on different machines.<p>Not trying to plug Portabella too much but I followed this logic and thought, how can I now allow people to share data? What if I give them different views? How about notifications? Pretty quickly I had fleshed out a full product.')
