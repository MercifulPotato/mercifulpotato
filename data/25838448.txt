Free exchange is thus already limited before we even get into censorship.  The large number of people in China means they have the potential to create a new ecosystem. They just need to get a few of their own people to start it, and then let things grow. I don&#x27;t know if they can pull it off, but they have enough people to at least make a good try at it.<p>Of course they can then censor it as desired.')
