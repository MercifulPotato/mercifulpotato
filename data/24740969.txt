I assume the article was about the US. The US has the very best CS universities in the world, do they not teach these basics? Or are we talking about smaller lower-tier American universities? I think there&#x27;s also a difference in which programs you look at. There are, for example Computer Engineering programs and also Computer Science programs, which are not the same. In Germany, there are universities (Universit√§t) and &quot;universities of applied sciences&quot; (Fachhochschule), which differ in the balance of theory and practice.<p>My big picture point is that the complaint is really general and <i>isn&#x27;t specific to machine learning</i> (ML is more of a click magnet here). The same could be said about other parts of CS and about the general computer-handling skills of CS graduates.')
