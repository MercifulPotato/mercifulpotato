Item(by='bayindirh', descendants=None, kids=[25655181], score=None, time=1609914334, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25652088, text='&gt; Here&#x27;s an example: in a typical apartment block, each resident runs their WiFi access point at full power. In any one apartment, there&#x27;s a ton of interference from neighboring units. If everyone coordinated and reduced their WiFi power to just what was necessary to cover their unit, it would result in less interference and higher net data rates for everyone. But no one is incentivized to do take action unilaterally.<p>There&#x27;s a lot of assumptions here. First of all None of my wireless access points except a single range extender has transmission power settings. In that case, the setting is ganged for both 2.4GHz and 5GHz radios. So, I can&#x27;t take this action unilaterally even if I want to do.<p>Second, wall thicknesses and home geometries are very different across the world. Both my and my family&#x27;s houses have very thick walls and tall storage units which effectively double the wall thickness so, with a relatively small house, I can&#x27;t have reliable wireless everywhere at home even with two access points.<p>I could increase coverage with more, less powerful access points but it needs recabling in a small, packed house which is not feasible. If I want to use range extenders with wireless repeating, trying to reduce wireless power becomes moot. This house runs on ADSL and the phone lines are at very strange places so both houses are effectively <i>legacy systems</i> with very small wiggle room.<p>So, what&#x27;s the solution?')
