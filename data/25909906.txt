I registered, put up ads, and a week or so later I sent out an email to my list and had ~50,000 visitors to the page. $X,XXX revenue later, Google locked the account for &quot;invalid  traffic&quot;. I&#x27;m 99% sure the cause of this problem is that I went from 0-50,000 visitors in 24 hours (because I sent an email to my list) but there&#x27;s no human in this review process. Is there someone here at Google I can reach out to and explain the situation in more detail? It&#x27;s been nearly 2 months (the review was supposed to take 1 month maximum) and the account is still limited. Thanks!')
