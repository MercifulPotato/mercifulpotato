As someone quite steeped in the conspiracy world, some of the most intelligent analysis and thoughtful pushback to the &quot;there&#x27;s no such thing as conspiracies&quot; bluepill perspective has been on HN, and in general it has not been suppressed or downvoted unless advanced in very combative terms.<p>Although perhaps you&#x27;re right that if you start bringing up Project Monarch or the like you might get some pretty severe pushback. Even then I&#x27;m not sure you&#x27;d necessarily be downvoted to oblivion.')
