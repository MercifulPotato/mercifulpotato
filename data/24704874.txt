My neighbor is a teacher in a rural district about 35 miles to the southwest. 65% of students don’t have internet, and many don’t have phones at home as the landline network rots away and is expensive. ($60&#x2F;mo unless you qualify for food stamps)<p>So they are parking school busses in areas with cell signal with hotspots for kids to do work and mailing or distributing paper for kids to work on.<p>In the city, I think ~30% lack internet, which is gross considering that 90% of the population is within a few hundred yards of extensive fiber optic infrastructure laid to support the state government and universities.')
