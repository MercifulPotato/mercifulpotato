I know personally many people who don&#x27;t have any &quot;posts&quot; in any meaningful way or quantity, and a number of ones that don&#x27;t have any presence on social networks. Then there are a lot of other people who technically have presense there, but just in a way that they have an account - not in a way of using it or logging into it.<p>It is also strange to hear that if you have a landlord who is weird by asking for facebook account - that the assumption is that it&#x27;s Mark Zuckerberg&#x27;s fault? Shouldn&#x27;t you blame the landlord for that?')
