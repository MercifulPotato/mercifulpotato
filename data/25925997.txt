Item(by='bumbada', descendants=None, kids=[25927091], score=None, time=1611739232, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25924750, text='I believe the mistake the author is doing is trying to simplify the world so much into a binary mindset, zeros and ones, all or nothing, pure qualitative.<p>That mindset is wrong, because the world is much more complex than simple axioms, and there is a qualitative part on everything too. Plato&#x27;s cave, you don&#x27;t see the world but its distorted image.<p>For example, the statement &quot;vaccines cause autism&quot;(pesticides create autism is a fact) can be real in some amount like one in a million and also the statement &quot;if you don&#x27;t vaccinate you have a significant probability of dying from a virus, bigger than 1%&quot;.<p>Both statements could be true. It does not need to be pure true or pure false just because my thoughts are binary.<p>If I go B.A.S.E jumping or diving or downhill skying or biking there is a probability of me dying. People just accept the risk and do it anyway because they weight the advantages against the risks.<p>X-rays create cancer. But they are also very useful, so they are used anyway, trying to minimize the risk.<p>If you believe the statements &quot;x-rays are safe&quot; or &quot;skying is safe&quot; as 100% true, you are wrong, but the belief will be more useful than the opposite belief, that is also wrong, &quot;if you get x-rays, you will get cancer&quot;.<p>You don&#x27;t need to belief in bipolar beliefs.')
