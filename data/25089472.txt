But I also think the likelihood of a coup is way overblown. After Esper was pushed out, the other three people resigned; they weren&#x27;t fired.<p>People said the same thing about a coup when he was first elected, when characters like Steve Bannon were in the White House whispering in his ear. At peak Trumpism across the country, before his approval rating started going down, that probably would have been a better time to do such a thing if it were going to happen. And yet... it just didn&#x27;t. Lots of callous and shortsighted and regressive policy-making ensued, to be sure, but nothing like a coup.')
