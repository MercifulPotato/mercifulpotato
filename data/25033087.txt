[...] Generally we donâ€™t have a directly elected ministers in Europe, [...] they are selected by the head of government.<p>This is all mostly true. But also very indirect, yes? I remember the discussions about the EU constitution project and the treaty of Lisbon, and this system with national government representatives was sold to us as a necessary democratic counterweight to the &quot;dominance&quot; of the most populous states (especially Germany) in Parliament. I acknowledge the need for some kind of balancing between pure population majority one the one hand and the needs of smaller states on the other hand. A proper elected &quot;upper house&quot; similar to the US Senate, with a fixed number (more than two!) of members from each member state, would be <i>vastly</i> superior to the current system.<p>(Also, when the corrupt Austrian government collapsed last year, it was replaced for half a year with an &quot;expert cabinet&quot;, with a chancellor and ministers who were all very capable and all, but <i>not</i> politicians, and <i>never</i> elected for <i>any</i> position. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Bierlein_government" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Bierlein_government</a> They did refrain from big EU-level moves, but nothing would have stopped them.)')
