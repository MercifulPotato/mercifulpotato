I shook his hand afterwards and told him that while I disagreed with some of his opinions, I really respected his conviction to give a talk to a room full of &quot;crypto zealots&quot; and stick to his opinions.<p>A very kind fellow in conversation, but he sure knows how to deliver bitter critique.')
