NYC tipping wage is $5&#x2F;hr less than minimum.  NY state is almost $4&#x2F;hr under.  NJ and MA are more than $7&#x2F;hr under.  DE and RI are more than $6&#x2F;hr under.  MD is more than $5&#x2F;hr under.  PA is more than $4&#x2F;hr under.  CT isn&#x27;t too bad, though, at within $2&#x2F;hr under.<p>Somehow I doubt you&#x27;re implying most HN users live in HI, IA, or ND - the only other states with legal tipping wages within $3&#x2F;hr of minimum.  I also doubt you&#x27;re implying most HN users live in AK, MN, MT, or NV - the only other states without legal tipping wages.<p>Not that it matters.  Even if the overwhelming majority of HN users lived in a west coast state (maybe it used to be that way, but I&#x27;m skeptical of that now), most HN users also probably don&#x27;t work as restaurant staff.  A bad thing isn&#x27;t <i>less bad</i> just because it doesn&#x27;t directly affect you.<p>Do you have an actual point to make against anything I&#x27;ve said?')
