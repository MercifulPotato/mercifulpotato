You create a schedule 2. Members get messages to book shifts 3. Notifications are sent to channels about who’s on shift<p>We’ve used this technique at Algolia to organize the whole-company support (40 engineers) and in general share any repetitive team task automatically.<p>My tool is very new so really looking for feedback. If this gets some love I’ll create a proper HN post.')
