I&#x27;m not an iOS or macOS user, but I&#x27;ve worked on systems over the years.  It really seems like they&#x27;re happy to let someone get popular to identify the niche that needs to be filled, roll an MVP to cover it, and kick out the originators with no real excuses.<p>It&#x27;s like they&#x27;re still focused on hardware development and the software is just things users want to do so let&#x27;s have an app only as needed to retain users, ish.<p>Really schizoid from my point of view.')
