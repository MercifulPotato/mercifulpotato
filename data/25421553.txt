All the rest of the NISQ work for gate-model quantum computing is limited to less than a hundred qubits so far and with the &quot;logical qubit&quot; error correcting requirements, it&#x27;s going to take millions of those qubits before we can get to breaking RSA keys of any length used in the last decade.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t worry about this one anytime soon.<p>&gt; Could a state actor or motivated rich person burn $10M or $100M to steal the biggest wallet?<p>You could burn $100M on a moonshot to steal it with no guarantee of success. It&#x27;s almost like trying to win the lottery by buying a ton of tickets, except the space of all possible options is bigger. Lotteries are something like 300 million combinations; 2048 bit RSA is something like a 600+ digit number, though your cost per play is obviously lower and you can iterate quickly.<p>You wouldn&#x27;t want to go after just one wallet, of course; you&#x27;d probably want to have a big battery of large wallets to test each combination against. Still, doesn&#x27;t raise your chances by much. If you have a 10 million core supercomputer and you can test, say, 100 million combinations per second, you&#x27;re still looking at a 600-digit number of years to work your way through it.')
