Whatever it was, it will be studied for years in Harvard Business School and the likes. They&#x27;ve been consistently a few nodes ahead of the entire industry for decades.<p>But, whatever it was, it was bad. They&#x27;ve been stuck basically at the same node for <i>5 years</i> or more.<p>And, according to the article, their next CPU will still be at 14nm, which is completely nuts. There&#x27;s no way you can compete with such brute force disadvantage.<p>It&#x27;s remarkable to watch, but I wouldn&#x27;t count on Intel getting their act together any time soon.')
