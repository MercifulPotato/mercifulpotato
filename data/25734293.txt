You are looking for others to give you a platform to reach a wide audience. There are <i>many</i>. But no platform requires people to publish you. You have lost being able to yell in a public square, temporarily, due to public safety, but you haven&#x27;t lost the ability to transmit speech that would have been acceptable in the public square.<p>So so so tired of these false equivalencies, and an unwillingness to engage with the <i>type</i> of speech that results in this. Normal, political speech is just fine. Incitement to violence, no.<p>Hell, AWS still hosts the publication that posted Bezos&#x27; dick pics! These shutdowns are not some sort of political censorship, these shutdowns are the natural result of speech that societies have determined <i>not</i> to be free.')
