While, yes, others may have similar backup plans, as an outsider, it feels like GitLab&#x27;s handbook seems cooler even if only for their publishing, and making public of their practices and processes. I&#x27;ll caveat that I&#x27;m not really a fan of zoom&#x2F;slack&#x2F;hangouts (I&#x27;m an unashamed fanboy of matrix and its numerous clients), but gitlab&#x27;s approach is still really neat! Kudos to gitlab!')
