It had a targeting option called &quot;React (Javascript Library)&quot; in Additional interests. That has been removed since last month. But Angular and other frameworks still exist as a targeting option. It is crazy because React is a Facebook product. I literally have no idea why they deprecated their own product&#x27;s targeting option. And as usual, if you ask anything from support, you get back canned replies. If you are in the drop-shipping world you&#x27;ll know the daily gripes drop-shippers have with Facebook Ads. Like is said in the article, the first few days are decent and then it tanks completely. Someone at Facebook who knows what they are doing needs to get Facebook Ads under control. It was working fine until all these changes wrecked the platform!')
