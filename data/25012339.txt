A key element (IMO) of a Roguelike is randomness in the maps&#x2F;scenarios, not just the encounters. I say &quot;key&quot; in the sense of &quot;necessary but not sufficient&quot;. Most MUDs have fixed maps, perhaps with a few small areas that are randomized. So you can memorize the layouts of many, if not all, areas. There is exploration, and you may forget areas, but the exploration is really a one time thing. In Nethack, by contrast, you really don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s coming next (though sometimes it reloads a level you died on before [0]).<p>[0] I was killed by a mummy. And in my next run found my now mummified former self and the mummy. After a few runs that level was full of mummies. Needless to say, it did not go well for me.')
