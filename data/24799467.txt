What I really like about this notation is you can use alignment to indicate precedence:<p><pre><code>  \\&#x2F; &#x2F;\\ A\n     &#x2F;\\ B\n  \\&#x2F; &#x2F;\\ C\n     &#x2F;\\ D\n</code></pre>\nWhich represents (A &amp; B) || (C &amp; D). It helps quite a bit for parsing large formulas in your head. In TLA+ the individual expressions are usually much more complicated than a single variable.')
