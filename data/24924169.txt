Basically, you need 2 servers, one to run HLK Studio and the Controller, and the other to run the HLK Client where the driver will be tested. Under HCK, the servers have a network connection.<p>You use the Studio&#x2F;Controller UI to select and configure the tests and to find and select the driver on the remote server to be tested. Selecting tests is a bit odd on a software-only driver, but through trial-and-error and a lot of reading, I was able to find an appropriate set (it&#x27;s a file system minifilter).<p>Once you start the tests, go find something else to do - the tests ran for about 12 hours in my case.<p>When you come back, you have to very carefully use the UI to collect the driver and the test results into a package file. You separately sign the package file with a cert that has been previously submitted to Msft (so they know who signed the package), then use the UI to upload the package to a Msft URL.<p>There&#x27;s a website where you can view the signing process - it goes through several stages. In my case it took anywhere from 10 minutes to a few hours to get through all the stages. At the end, if all goes well, you&#x27;ll be able to download a zip file that contains your driver signed by Msft. Once you have your driver, put it in an installer (we used WiX [0]) along with any other components (like a nice userspace tool for configuration, or to run as a service and load the driver to do useful things)<p>For a software only driver, it&#x27;s a lot of busy work. I really don&#x27;t think the HCK exercised my driver at all. Nevertheless, either me or the release engineer at work got through the process several times.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wixtoolset.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wixtoolset.org&#x2F;</a>')
