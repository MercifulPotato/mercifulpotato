Can&#x27;t put the genie back in the bottle. Full time employment for the service sector will continue to go down. It&#x27;s either this or outsourcing.<p>As of now benefits (health insurance, retirement benefits, unemployment etc.) are too tightly coupled to the employer and are very lopsided in terms of tax benefit. This is basically a legacy system from WW2 era.<p>Laws need to be updated to provide more rights to gig workers and benefits should be accessible in proportion to hours worked, preferably independent from the employer.<p>Ideally a contractor who works 10 hours a week should cost 25% of an FTE.')
