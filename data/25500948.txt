I&#x27;ve been trying to find ways to turn Amazon boxes into either something more compostable or something that consumes less space in my recycling bin.<p>I ended up with a paper shredder that will shred cardboard, but it&#x27;s still a pain in the ass to tear up the boxes.  I would kill for something like a mulcher than I can just chuck whole boxes into and let it deal with.<p>I should probably order less stuff online, I know, but the recycling around here sucks.  They only pick up recycling every 2 weeks, and the bin is smaller than my trash bin.  Despite the fact that I generate a lot more recycleables than I do genuine trash.')
