I really think that the only reason notebooks are so popular is that Python never had a popular IDE with a high-quality REPL where people can learn to work interactively while writing code in plain text.<p>R illustrates this very well - as an R user you can have your pick between RStudio, Jupyter and Rmarkdown and the overwhelming majority of users pick RStudio and notebooks are reserved only for a niche set of use cases. It also speaks volumes that almost no one writes R in Jupyter even though it&#x27;s supported very well - R users just have better options available to them.')
