You&#x27;re now competing against the guy in Nowhere Town, this guy can do your job and he&#x27;s willing to do it for less because he&#x27;s never experienced an expensive reale estate market.<p>I run a small consulting practice. We are highly skilled and very experienced. We can often charge much less than our competitors because we don&#x27;t have the overheads our competitors do. A 1 million dollar deal for my practice is worth a lot more than a 1 million dollar deal for Accenture. We can go down to 700,000 and still have over 90% profitability, Accenture will walk away at that price point because it&#x27;s not worth their time.')
