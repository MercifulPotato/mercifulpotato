Period.<p>Bad ballot Rejection rate of 6% in previous election to now 0.02%, with mail in ballots. Mismatched signatures resulted in a rejection for only 0.02% of all absentee ballots cast. How is that even possible. They counted almost everything. \nFor those of you that think its unfair to reject ballots. Well how do you verify that the person cast the ballot is the one that sent it in?')
