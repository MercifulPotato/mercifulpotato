I read an article like: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;26&#x2F;opinion&#x2F;republican-disinformation.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;26&#x2F;opinion&#x2F;republican-disinf...</a><p>The interesting thing is that the assertion is that the right-wing have been detached from reality. An epistemological crisis wherein the the blame is on the internet. Thus we have situation where Internet entities like Youtube and Twitter are actively censoring right-wing views. While allowing left-wing misinformation.<p>So the way forward to fixing wrong-think is to deprive people of viewpoints? This doesn&#x27;t seem quite right.<p>What&#x27;s also quite interesting, it&#x27;s the left-wing who are at odds. The median democrat has moved left and has created a political divide.<p>Makes me wonder if perhaps it&#x27;s not the rightwing who became detached from reality.<p>If the left-wing are the ones detached. Then their need to censor other viewpoints to maintain their bubble makes complete sense.')
