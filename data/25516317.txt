But for the opposite reason.<p>The linked post explains that there is a performance regression in a very rare and specific usecase: creating 100k files in a short span of time.  And I&#x27;m not talking about unpacking boost, that&#x27;s not enough files.<p>Additionally, it will be fixed before any distro packages it.
