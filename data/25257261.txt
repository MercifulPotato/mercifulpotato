In my opinion, as someone who not too long ago left the American public school system (but was also &#x27;unschooled&#x27; [1] for the early years of my education), so many of the problems that arise in school are due to a lack of self-direction. We teach children to rely exclusively on authority figures for motivation, and then get discipline them when:<p>1) they don&#x27;t submit to their teachers and follow directions.\n2) they aren&#x27;t able to direct themselves to complete tasks on their own.<p>Finally, at least in my experience, teaching students something they aren&#x27;t interested in or motivated to learn is basically futile. Maybe they learn enough to pass the test, but it&#x27;s quickly forgotten.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Democratic_education" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Democratic_education</a>\n[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Unschooling" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Unschooling</a>')
