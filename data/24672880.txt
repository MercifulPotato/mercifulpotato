Building phase.<p>Locate, obtain, and add value to the resource.<p>Rich finds and big accumulation always mean overwhelming leverage can be applied if desired.<p>Complete the project one brick at a time, that&#x27;s the purpose of leveraging the resource, and it takes a lot of labor to go along with the resource.<p>2. Peak Pyramid phase.<p>The value added by shrewdly combining resources &amp; labor is at a maximum, the landmark nearly-impossible project is complete.<p>Built to last, it can then be maintained virtually forever with relatively insignificant resource drain compared to when it was being built.<p>It does best what it was supposed to do.  Enjoy the maximally leveraged resource and minimized drain.<p>3. Crumbling phase.<p>If labor &amp; resources can not be wisely supplied at the way required for maintenance of such a wonderful structure, it will become less wonderful all on its own.<p>This can often occur when the whole optimized structure changes hands.<p>Somebody has to still make decisions long after the unmatched original builders are gone.<p>Newcomers not there from the start can fail to realize how nearly impossible it was to get built to begin with.<p>Well built, it may still seem to look like it will last forever anyway.<p>4. Deconstruction phase.<p>Changes of priorities in resource &amp; labor allocation, or major fluctuations or trends can result in resources being drawn from a built structure rather than by adding value to raw material.<p>This is an extremely deleveraging process, more expediently accomplished than the building phase.<p>Value is lost faster and more irreplaceably than it was originally added.<p>To the same basic resources.<p>Often it can be when the responsible parties benefit more from the underlying accumulated resource in place than they do from the continued existence of the structure as a whole.  After fully depreciating the unique combination of labor and time that made the structure possible to begin with.<p>__________________<p>It could be worse, depending on the system with overwhelming leverage you could have a pyramid using resources that are not even there.<p>Seems a lot faster to build that way, and could get pretty big on faith alone without a firm foundation, but may not stand the test of time.<p>Would be more subject to collapse from the peak rather than showing early signs of crumbling.  No resource recovery could be expected either.')
