There are some individuals of course who are born with a very acute sensitivity from a very young age (which is spooky) but there are also people who learn it later.<p>If you can imagine learning to recognize and accurately sing just one particular note (say, middle C). Then if you develop amazing &quot;relative&quot; pitch it&#x27;s basically the same thing. Training more still will enable you to hear very subtle differences in tuning, but it has to be a standard part of your training.')
