This isn&#x27;t normal, but on markets, it is.<p>&gt; The &quot;moral notion of value&quot; is a nonsensical concept<p>No, it&#x27;s the fundamental concept. Economic value should aspire to approximate it if we want the market to be a force for collective good. To the extent that economic value fails to approximate moral value, the economy fails to serve our collective interests.<p>In CS terms: greedy algorithms fail hard in predictable ways.<p>&gt; [So why don&#x27;t you give more through GiveWell?]<p>Because I&#x27;m stuck in a system that&#x27;s designed to punish me for doing so above and beyond the intrinsic cost of providing for the kid. Here&#x27;s a counter-proposal: I&#x27;d <i>absolutely</i> sign up for a wealth-proportional share of a tax for ending world hunger. I&#x27;m not poor, even by HN standards, so this isn&#x27;t cheating, but the fact that this formulation of the solution wasn&#x27;t obvious to you demonstrates how thoroughly you&#x27;ve been trained to see the world through the circus-house lens of wealth-weighted utility, and just how perversely that lens distorts the world.')
