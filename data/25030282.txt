Item(by='tekknik', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604880740, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25028860, text='&gt; Guns are notoriously out of control in Mexico.<p>How did it get this way? There&#x27;s laws in place to prevent it. Buying an AR in MX is impossible. How do they get in the country? They should be stopped at the border. Just like hard drugs should be stopped when coming across the US border. Proof that even import controls don&#x27;t work. We&#x27;re also in the age of 3d printing and home fabrication. Guns are not going to disappear from criminals hands, only law abiding citizens.<p>&gt; But it&#x27;s interesting that you would pick a country with a long-running inter-cartel drug war, rampant police corruption, extremely weak enforcement, and less than a quarter the average household income as somehow directly being comparable to the US.<p>So two questions here, how did it get corrupt in the first place? What has stopped corruption in the US? If the Mexican citizens wish to end this corruption, how can they? I&#x27;m going to disregard the poverty claim because it&#x27;s just senseless to imply poor people are violent.<p>&gt; The more remarkable question we should be asking is, with all that going on, how on earth is the US struggling to do any better than Mexico?<p>Great question! Perhaps violence is just as out of control here as in Mexico?<p>&gt; No, what Mexico shows is that gun control legislation is pointless if you can&#x27;t enforce it. I&#x27;m not arguing that gun control legislation alone is some panacea; that would be absurd. It needs to have teeth.<p>What does the legislation having &quot;teeth&quot; entail?<p>&gt; Apart from anything else, it means the police can de-escalate themselves from assuming that they might get shot during any encounter to assuming that if they don&#x27;t get close enough to get stabbed, they&#x27;re less likely to be in immediate danger. That&#x27;s a good thing.<p>So then if the police are overly violent, or if they were to take control, then what? Wasn&#x27;t a majority of the left just rioting over police being too violent? You want to throw your trust entirely into the hope that they are sane?<p>&gt; It seems reasonable to you that your position requires me to undergo an experience so traumatic as to prevent rational thought? Think I&#x27;ll pass.<p>How is the desire to defend one&#x27;s self irrational? This just seems like pure opinion, and slightly scary. Again, for those in immediate danger how do they defend themselves? You clearly lack experience in any traumatic event, and are now running around saying that because of your lack of experience, nobody should be able to defend themselves with firearms. Really?')
