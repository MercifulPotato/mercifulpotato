I&#x27;ve had such amusing results as:<p>- Four bunches of ~7 bananas instead of 4 individual bananas<p>- A single cherry tomato instead of one pound of cherry tomatoes<p>- Candied walnuts substituted for fajita seasoning<p>I&#x27;m not overly upset about it, but the main problem is definitely the quantity issue-- several different drivers have purchased absurd quantities that seem like something one would obviously question and double-check. Or that something would be flagged when the price is so far outside the expected price on the app. I would think this would be totally solved by store-provided shoppers though.')
