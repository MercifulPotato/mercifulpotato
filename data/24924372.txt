Seeed has embedded the Geppetto electronic design tool into its platform, so users can go straight from creating a design to manufacturing in one session.<p>&gt; Geppetto make it possible to create an custom Arduino board for under $50, including design to pcb manufacture and assembly.<p>I haven&#x27;t looked at both closely, but it looks like ALC is a broad component design service, and Geppetto is constrained to a set menu of components that readily fit together.')
