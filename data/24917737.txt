I think most of us just wants it to be more reliable than a human driver that&#x27;s not drunk or sleep deprived. But the liability challenges could mean you&#x27;ll want more &quot;perfect&quot; reliability.<p>&gt; They have to operate in weather. Rain, snow, dark. They have to adapt to novel conditions.<p>Seems like the solutions out there are already getting pretty good at handling the kind of rain, snow and darkness you&#x27;d see in most urban&#x2F;suburban areas. Maybe you&#x27;ll &quot;never&quot; be able to drive autonomously to your cabin in the woods, but so what?<p>&gt; I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ll see these things for another decade, and when that next decade arrives we&#x27;ll be saying the same. Another decade.<p>What exactly do you mean by &quot;seeing these things&quot;? By some measures they&#x27;re already here. The ones that are truly self driving are slow, and mostly on static routes. The ones that drive on highways need to be monitored by a human, but they&#x27;re doing pretty well. I think you&#x27;ll see these different solutions just slowly become better and better. I&#x27;d be very surprised if you couldn&#x27;t hail a fully autonomous robotaxi in many urban areas in a decade. Maybe it can&#x27;t drive it anywhere, maybe you can&#x27;t use it in a snowstorm, but it&#x27;ll be a case of &quot;good enough&quot;.')
