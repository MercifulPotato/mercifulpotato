Nice, that&#x27;s my favorite!<p>Then a few months ago some update was pushed (iOS? Apple Home app? Philips Hue app? Philips Hue Basestation OS? No idea) and now that <i>exact</i> phrase (which has worked for two years) suddenly elicits a response: &quot;OK, which room?&quot; -- followed by a listing of the rooms in which I have devices and a catch-all &quot;Everywhere&quot;.<p>So now I&#x27;ve had to change my incantation: &quot;Hey Siri, please set <i>all</i> of my lights to green.&quot;<p>I&#x27;m just waiting for her to start asking &quot;Do you want Lime Green, Aqua Green, or Vomit Green?&quot;. Or worse, maybe she&#x27;ll just give up and say &quot;OK, here&#x27;s a list of Google results for Green Lights.&quot; Maybe even throw a captcha in there asking me to select the green lights at intersections, just for good measure.')
