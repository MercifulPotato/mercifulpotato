Item(by='jlgaddis', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602863631, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24799332, text='&gt; <i>But the onus was on me to prove it by finding the bug.</i><p>As a network engineer who has had to prove numerous times that &quot;it&#x27;s not the firewall&quot; or &quot;it&#x27;s not the network&quot;, you have my deepest sympathies.<p>--<p>Story time:<p>My most memorable instance of this was when I worked at a .edu and was going through yet another iteration of the back-and-forth, &quot;it&#x27;s not on our side, must be on your side&quot;, &quot;no, it&#x27;s not us, it&#x27;s your firewall&quot;, finger-pointing blame game.<p>This particular issue had been dragging on for a while and, eventually, I got a packet capture from their side (packet captures are, to me, the ultimate source of truth, &quot;the last word&quot;). Yet, even after showing (and explaining) it to them, they continued to insist that their firewall was absolutely, positively, 100% configured properly and, thus, it <i>had to be</i> my firewall which was not properly configured.<p>Finally, I called in a favor from a (Ph.D.) faculty member who &quot;owed me one&quot;. After explaining what was going on and, more importantly, showing him the timestamps, he agreed to help me out. He wrote up a wonderful e-mail (which I still have a copy of, somewhere) stating how it just was not possible, literally, that mine was the &quot;offending firewall&quot;. He explained how he was able to conclude this with absolute certainty, thanks to <i>the laws of physics</i> and politely suggested that -- unless they had evidence that Checkpoint was able to somehow <i>violate</i> those laws of physics (in which case he would be <i>extremely</i> interested in their proof) -- that perhaps they might wanna take another look at their firewall?<p>I waited anxiously, curious what the response (and latest excuse) would be. A few days passed before, finally, an e-mail appeared in my inbox. I quickly opened it and read the one-line reply:<p><pre><code>  We found the problem, it&#x27;s working now.</code></pre>')
