It also estimates the cost would climb from $4.2 billion to $6.1 billion.<p>Unfortunately this is a very old story with the nuclear industry: they consistently over-promise and under-deliver.  The closer projects get to completion, the more costs grow and the further the completion date gets pushed out.  This has been true of most of the recent builds in the US and Europe.<p>The tech is fine, but there seems to be something wrong with the industry.')
