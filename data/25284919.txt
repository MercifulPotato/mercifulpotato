Your relationships and your career will benefit from pausing and moderating what you say.<p>To the content of your comment: -<p>There is a sizable menu of options to make wind and solar more reliable.  Two  technologies with nearly a century of history behind them are pumped hydro and CAES (compressed air energy storage).<p>Batteries have been technologically feasible for decades, and are on the cusp of economic feasibility (that is: being cheaper than the alternatives), thanks to the manufacturing learning curve that the OP makes so much of.<p>Better grid interconnections also help a lot and probably have an even more illustrious history than pumped hydro and CAES. Demand management (asking large users, e.g. pulp and paper mills to pause for a while), is also a venerable technique.<p>It is possible to use surplus power to make fuels to burn when the sun is not shining and the wind is not blowing.  This is still in its infancy only because we have never before had periods when electricity had a negative price.<p>These are just the things that sprang to my mind without thinking about it.  There are others.')
