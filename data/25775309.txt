An important historical note.<p>This phrase comes from a judgment in the case Schenck vs. United States [0], where the judges found that U.S had the right to punish a pacifist for spreading leaflets that induced young men to resist WWI draft.<p>This is a pretty sordid case from today&#x27;s point of view and has been partially overturned half a century later by Brandenburg vs. Ohio, which established a much more restrictive &quot;likely to incite imminent lawless action&quot; test for punishability of speech.<p>I wish people were more aware of the context of this phrase when uttering it. It sounds innocent and reasonable, but so do &quot;states rights&quot;, which were a code word for slavery. Only in case of &quot;states rights&quot;, most people know the history of the phrase.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Schenck_v._United_States" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Schenck_v._United_States</a>')
