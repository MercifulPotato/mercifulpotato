Or at least you don&#x27;t need two cars in the household.<p>A bicycle is a perfectly viable option for transport for about 8 months of the year, or at least 6 if you&#x27;re afraid of the weather (or can&#x27;t change clothes at work). The bike paths are excellent and safe and if your route involves going through the city center, it&#x27;s by far the fastest mode of transport (you can average 20km&#x2F;h easily, can&#x27;t match this by car or bus in the city). Bicycling may not be quite as good as continental Europe, but it&#x27;s pretty good and the city is small enough to go everywhere by bike.<p>The rest of the year can be covered by public transport, which is very reliable.<p>Unfortunately COVID has hit the public transport in many levels, but hopefully that situation will get better. On the other hand, it did bring grocery delivery everywhere so that negates another need for a car.')
