Yes, there&#x27;s the narrative and the certainty that wealthy people participated in the snowballing&#x2F;astroturfing and profited from it. But it&#x27;s still the case that small investors made some money playing by the same rules as the hedge funds, and the institutions have nakedly tried to stop that through any means possible, from curtailing the actual discussion to media campaigns to directly plugging at the source with Robinhood. It has nothing to do with the actual nature of GameStop, but that&#x27;s part of the message of the stock market itself and the broader economy being more and more nonsensical and divorced from production.<p>The nihilism is increasing more and more. This is just one instance of it, where institutions are so brazen that they don&#x27;t even bother to come up with an excuse and just pull the plug after some cost benefit calculations. Eventually there will be the straw that will break the camel&#x27;s back, which is what I mean by an impetus for change. If more and more people come to understand that working hard and saving is a sucker&#x27;s game and that any escape from that game is rigged at the institutional level, they will stop wanting to participate in the current social contract.')
