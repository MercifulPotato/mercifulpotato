I was surprised to learn they were an available option.<p>I also installed a browser extension to automatically bring me to smile.amazon when buying anything on Amazon - so far it has had no weird glitchiness when <i>not</i> buying something and works exactly as advertised. Highly recommend looking into this option if you&#x27;re forgetful like me - so far it has helped me donate 4 times that I would have otherwise forgotten.')
