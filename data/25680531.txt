I remember getting the Fire Stick and finding it incredibly prone to crashing and regularly overheating. Chromecasts aren&#x27;t much better, but newer ones are also meatier in size. Video streaming wasn&#x27;t meant to be done by devices the size of a pack of gum.<p>Roku Premieres are pretty compact but work much better than the sticks. And Roku Ultras are really, really smooth, and support Ethernet!')
