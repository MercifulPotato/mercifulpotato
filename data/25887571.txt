You should know the definitions of words before you use them:<p>&quot;The belief that certain persons or members of certain groups deserve favored treatment by virtue of their superiority, as in intelligence, social standing, or wealth.&quot; and &quot;Behavior arising from or indicative of such a belief.&quot;<p>...neither of which describes the statement that I made.<p>(in case it&#x27;s not clear - even if my statement were false, it would still not be elitism)<p>&gt; Backed by nothing.<p>It&#x27;s pretty clear that HN users are way more tech-savvy than the average user - don&#x27;t try to deny it. If you absolutely insist on evidence - take five random posts from the front page of HN, show the original content to a random sampling of people you meet at the library or at a coffeeshop (your family members and friends could be biased technically), ask them to make comments, and then compare to the HN comments on the post.<p>Only the very tiniest fraction of users are going to write anything like [1][2][3] - <i>those</i> are developers, and their knowledge, skills, and behaviors are <i>dramatically</i> different than the average user.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25883791" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25883791</a>\n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25881911" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25881911</a>\n[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25885196" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25885196</a>')
