C was created and got popular in the times when resources were cut and even the constrains the language imposed were considered high-level stuff. If you think why it didn&#x27;t evolve, well it actually did and we call it c++. What c++ shows is that backward compatibility with already existing code prevents lots of optimizations that rust can afford to build in from the start.')
