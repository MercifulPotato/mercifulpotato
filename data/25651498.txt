I understand why Apple wants to reuse its existing development, review, and distribution platforms, and it makes sense for some apps, but it&#x27;s simply not reasonable to expect cross-platform browser extension developers to go through the hassle of building and distributing Mac apps just to support Safari users.<p>If you have an existing Mac app, it might be worth it, but personally, there&#x27;s no chance that I would bother porting my own standalone WebExtensions to Safari under the current system, whereas I went to the trouble of doing so ($99&#x2F;year fee and all) for the legacy framework, even though I don&#x27;t really use Safari. Maybe Apple is OK losing large numbers of smaller extensions, but for me, it just means I&#x27;d never seriously consider Safari as an alternative to Firefox or Chrome.')
