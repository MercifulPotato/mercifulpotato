Even high end Epyc machines (200 watt TDP) with 8 x 64 bit memory channels have to try hard to get a cacheline every 10ns.<p>Eh? That&#x27;s not how memory latency works. The cheaper consumer chips with &quot;non-spec&quot; RAM and without ECC are regularly better here than the enterprise stuff. This isn&#x27;t something that scales with price.')
