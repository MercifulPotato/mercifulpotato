But since you don&#x27;t know when it all might come crashing down, you may as well be doubling your bet every time you lose at roulette -- that also feels like you keep winning, until you don&#x27;t.<p>One thing that would probably be good is to have people create accounts, and ensure all their sessions are logged. That will make it so that people can&#x27;t just forget their losses and pretend to themselves that they usually win.')
