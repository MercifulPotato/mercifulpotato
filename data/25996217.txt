The Stanley Parable is a good example of this, if you&#x27;ve heard of it. I use &quot;world&quot; and &quot;explore&quot; very loosely; exploring where you can go and what you can do as the engineer of a train would fall under this umbrella. Even if the answer is &quot;not a whole lot&quot;, there&#x27;s an aliveness and a wondering that comes from even such a tiny slice of a world.<p>But as soon as a performance metric is introduced there&#x27;s this &quot;should statement&quot; hanging over my head, reshaping the whole experience.')
