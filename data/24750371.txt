I remember as a kid whenever we went to a gas station my dad would always be careful he goosing the trigger of the gas pump to line up the decimal point on the rolling dial. That was just part of going to a gas station. You basically walked in put down a 2 $20 bills and said “40 on three“ for example. For you millennials, this meant put $40 on pump number three. But let’s say your tank only took 35-ish dollars in gas. Well you didn’t wanna be left with spare change, so you always just squeeze the trigger just enough until the meter read and even dollar figure.<p>For the first decade of my driving life that’s how I did it as well. But that now seems to be such a distant memory as I am 100% of the time just paying with a credit card at the pump.')
