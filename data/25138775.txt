Confluence is somewhat better but comments are not handled well with respect to the source document. Add in Smart sheet and the rest as kludges and I have 10 different things to check for a single project with dependencies.. it&#x27;s nuts. I am not sure if anyone has really figured the information based workflow out yet.   There needs to be some auto association and project based aggregation (maybe tags?) .. that and a personal workspace of things you need to do in each system.. right now everything is asynchronously propagated by slack or email.<p>I am interested in trying out Asana and Facebook Workplace to see if they have solved this in a more natural way.')
