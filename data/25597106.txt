It&#x27;s not just a matter of being semantically correct in some abstract sense, it completely breaks the user experience for a keyboard user like me.<p>If you have a form with, say, two text fields, I expect to be able to type into the first field, hit Tab to the second one, type into that one, and press Enter to submit.<p>All too often, when I press Enter, nothing happens! This is because of the very problem you described: the developer used a click event handler on the submit button instead of a submit handler on the form as they should have.<p>It&#x27;s such an easy thing to get right; why do so many get it wrong?')
