So if an employee said of a group of black rappers &quot;the gangsters are out today&quot; under your logic it would be wrong to fire that person, even though they couldn&#x27;t possibly know what that person was, is, or wants to be.<p>You&#x27;re assuming guilt by association, and probably falling to Godwin&#x27;s law. There&#x27;s a difference between what someone may be, and what you may say in the workplace. The fact that the person who said is is Jewish means nothing, it&#x27;s only a distraction from that an employee referred to a group of people as Nazi&#x27;s and the employer took a offense and..the employee is looking for a new job.<p>You can&#x27;t fire someone for behavior and excuse it in the other simply because you agree with their politics.')
