She hasn&#x27;t really done that for 9 months, aside from quick targeted trips in&#x2F;out while a bit stressed. She is very excited to just be out next year.<p>Now, how many retail businesses won&#x27;t ever open again is the real question. Plenty of small businesses closed and won&#x27;t re-open and there might be strong hesitation for new businesses to spring up in their place. Sure, target will be fine, but the mom and pops could potentially never come back to the same level. They were already barely making it.')
