People have fled the right either to no party or to the center left. That leaves behind the extremes on the right which have become emboldened by Trump and their shrinking bubble.<p>It&#x27;s like evaporating water out of a glass of salt water. The water left behind becomes more and more salty. If you have ever had a salt water aquarium you&#x27;ll know that you don&#x27;t add salt water back to the tank, but fresh water in order to balance out the evaporation.<p>You mention racism. The same people may have been racist before, but now they are ok yelling it out loud because the only people left in their bubble think the same way (Trump may or may not be racist, but he certainly stokes this fire). And this is why it&#x27;s difficult, because if someone tells me they do not want black people living in their neighborhood, I&#x27;m going to tell them that&#x27;s a racist statement.')
