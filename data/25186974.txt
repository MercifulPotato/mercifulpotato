I was working in a startup for the last few years and my salary, due to personal relationships and negotiations have been much much lower than industry standard. I was given 1.5% equity when starting and also flexible working hours and the freedom to take days off whenever needed.<p>Few weeks ago, I applied to a new company just to see what it&#x27;s like and I cleared it and was offered around 4 times the current salary. When I notified it to the current employer, they offered me 8% of shares to stay.<p>I am now confused on what to do, because on one-side there&#x27;s a sure financial benefit, but maybe stricter timelines and procedures and on the other, there&#x27;s a possibility of high magnitude of benefits if the current company grows. I&#x27;d like to hear your thoughts')
