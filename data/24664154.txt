Or, am I wrong?<p>I feel like most (capitalist) people don&#x27;t actively spend their existence in a driven pursuit of excessive wealth with the intention&#x2F;moral imperative to fuck everyone else over to get there or stay at &quot;the top&quot;.<p>Or at least I like to hope.<p>Also, here&#x27;s the thing about &quot;liberty&quot;: If you&#x27;re not a hypocrite, you don&#x27;t attempt to control other people or decide what decisions they&#x27;re allowed to make (barring things that would directly harm others) whether you agree with them or not.<p>I do not agree with the behaviors of these hyper-capitalist, exploitative people.<p>But it would make me a massive hypocrite with double-standards to say &quot;Well, actually now I think you have enough, you don&#x27;t get to have any more money.&quot;<p>If you spend your life getting to this position (legally), it&#x27;s not my right or place to take it from you.<p>And this philosophy of &quot;Okay fine, but I don&#x27;t necessarily condone&#x2F;agree&quot; is the difference between freedom and oppression.<p>I VERY FIRMLY believe nobody has the right to push their ideals on others.<p>This kind of thinking is how you get things like gay marriage being illegal, preventing women from having abortions, and all numbers of unsavory things.<p>Genuinely believing in liberty, individualism, and personal freedoms means standing by those ideals even when you don&#x27;t agree with the way these freedoms are exercised by others.<p>Anything else is being nothing but a hypocrite.')
