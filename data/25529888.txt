The IAAF relies on certified courses and timing systems for world records. No brand of fitness trackers are officially used for competition.<p>Some of the better fitness trackers do now have a &quot;track run&quot; activity mode which will use the known shapes of running tracks to smooth out the errors in GNSS signals. That gives a nice perfect oval shape on the map and ensures the distance is accurate. But that&#x27;s still just for training and bragging rights, it doesn&#x27;t really count for anything.')
