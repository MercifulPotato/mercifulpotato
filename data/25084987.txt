Which would imply a causal relationship. The paper says that &quot;lifestyle intervention&quot; lowers the risk of diabetes. This intervention could also explain the weight loss, hence a corollary relationship.<p>That said, there is such a thing as bad science and there is literally decades of it when it comes to nutrition and chronic diseases. And more keeps coming out all the time. I don&#x27;t blame the OP for being skeptical, but he&#x2F;she was skeptical of the wrong thing in this case.')
