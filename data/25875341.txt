Nadella is smart and is mostly moving to Azure services and O365 on strategy - I think windows and the consumer market matter less.<p>Apple owns their entire stack and is well positioned to continue to expand the delta between their design&#x2F;integration and everyone else continuing to flounder.<p>AMD isn&#x27;t that much better positioned than Intel and doesn&#x27;t have a solution for the coordination problem either. Nvidia may buy ARM, but that&#x27;s only one piece of getting things to work well.<p>I&#x27;m long on Apple here, short on Intel and AMD.<p>We&#x27;ll see what happens.')
