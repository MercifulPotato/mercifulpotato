Of course, Apple are starting to muddy the waters with UIKit for Mac — but even then, the fact that iOS apps can now run ‘natively’ on macOS goes a long way to showing that just because an app links against the relevant frameworks compiled for the right processor architecture, that doesn’t make it native in the Apple-y sense.<p>Apps made using cross-platform frameworks like Qt and GTK certainly don’t register to me as native. They don’t just work differently, they even look odd. I don’t think this fazes Windows and Linux users&#x2F;developers as much because there has never been any level of consistency remotely close to what Cocoa and macOS offers — if an app puts a few buttons in a slightly odd place, that’s not seen an a problem.<p>So I agree with your point on a technical basis that my assessment wasn’t 100% technically true — but I think from the point of view of what ‘native apps’ means when discussing Apple platforms, I don’t think I’m too far off the mark.')
