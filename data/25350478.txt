Personal sanity:  When the majority of the group becomes stacked with yes-men you disagree with on principle, then you have no way of stopping them from doing what they’re going to do.  Fighting that is like tilting at windmills and can be emotionally exhausting.  Humans have a finite supply of energy and focus, and wasting it in such situations is neither productive nor pleasant.  Better to just leave and go devote your energy to positive and productive endeavors instead.<p>2.  Avoid tacit endorsement:  When you become the minority in any group where the majority starts doing things you disagree with, especially ethically, then it’s very difficult for you to publicly distance yourself from those decisions while remaining part of the group.  The minority members usually get less air time, less media attention, less soapbox opportunity to voice dissenting opinions.  The only way to distance yourself decisively and indisputably is to leave the group.')
