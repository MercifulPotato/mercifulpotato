For a while now we have been making a yearly printed album of our favorite family photos. The first one was a gift for our parents but we liked it so much we continued the project.<p>When close friends and relatives visit, it is much more likely that we&#x27;ll pull an album off the shelf and enjoy the memories together than we would digitally go through a year&#x27;s worth of pictures.<p>It&#x27;s a fun family project and you end up with a nice curated keepsake that will last a long time.<p>I also store a copy of each album sealed in a mylar bag which should keep them nicely for any curious decedents long from now.')
