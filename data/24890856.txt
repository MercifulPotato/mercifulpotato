The reality is, the country as a whole is also not as liberal either, regardless of what these pollsters are asking people. You think the party is youthful, and ready for progressive ideas, but alas, the party wholly rejected an amazingly progressive candidate in Sanders. You think everyone’s super pissed at Coronavirus handling, and police brutality, healthcare, but alas, you find out people associate BLM protests with crime, and the virus with China, and socialism with unfair wealth redistribution. We can keep learning this the hard way I guess, this is America after all.<p>It’s important the technical discussions are happening this time around, because there was virtually none the last time. The post mortems for these forecasts being wrong again should be a death knell for accumulating bad data. I’m certain the models are good, but I’m not certain the data is.<p>Anyway, if you want my hot take, the conditional forecasting is to save their ass on election night from being embarrassingly wrong again. Imagine writing a giant if-statement that looked something like ‘and if(imWrong) changeMyAnswer’.')
