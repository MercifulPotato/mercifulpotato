I count only about seventeen of those that I&#x27;ve seen, despite having seen old movies in the hundreds.<p>Funnily enough, my favourite old Hollywood genres are musicals and westerns.<p>I grew up only really being exposed to post 1960 movie musicals which I never really liked. About seven years ago I thought, &quot;I&#x27;ve never really watched any old movie musicals&quot;, and just started watching them. It was a revelation to discover the (to me) amazing stuff from the 30s, 40s and 50s. My ideal movie musical was made in the 1930s, stars Fred Astaire, and has songs by the Gershwins, Cole Porter or Irving Berlin.<p>Some highlights for me would be:<p>42nd Street (1933)\nNot the first `backstage musical&#x27; but sets the template. One of the things I love about old movie musicals is that people don&#x27;t randomly start singing and dancing: they sing and&#x2F;or dance because they are singers or songwriters or dancers or choreographers creating or rehearsing or performing.<p>Gold Diggers of 1933 (1933)\nMore Busby Berkeley.<p>Footlight Parade (1933)\nMore Busby Berkeley.\nJames Cagney stars.<p>On the Avenue (1937)<p>Shall we Dance (1937)<p>Lady be Good (1941)<p>You Were Never Lovelier (1942)<p>The Gang&#x27;s All Here (1943)<p>Anchors Aweigh (1945)<p>The Pirate (1948)\nDon&#x27;t listen to the naysayers, this film to me is pretty much perfect.<p>An American in Paris (1951)\nContains the amazing sequence in which Oscar Levant is portrayed conducting, playing every instrument, and being the audience of Gershwin&#x27;s Concerto in F for Piano and Orchestra (which I think is much better than the more famous Rhapsody in Blue).<p>The Band Wagon (1953)<p>Daddy Long Legs (1955)<p>High Society (1956)<p>Funny Face (1957)<p>Gypsy (1962)<p>And then a couple of years ago, I asked myself: which film genres have I never really watched? Westerns (and Horror, still haven&#x27;t gone there) being my answer. Turns out I really love westerns.<p>Some favourites:<p>Destry Rides Again (1939)<p>Stagecoach (1939)<p>Fort Apache (1948)\nTo me, this is the best of John Ford&#x27;s `cavalry trilogy&#x27;<p>Red River (1948)<p>Winchester &#x27;73 (1950)\nMy favourite of the Anthony Mann &#x2F; James Stewart westerns.<p>Vera Cruz (1954)\nAction movies weren&#x27;t invented in the 1980s.<p>The Man from Laramie (1955)<p>Seven Men from Now (1956)\nThe best of the Budd Boetticher &#x2F; Randolph Scott westerns.<p>Man of the West (1958)<p>The Horse Soldiers (1959)<p>Last Train from Gun Hill (1959)<p>Two Rode Together (1961)<p>The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance (1962)<p>El Dorado (1966)\nRio Bravo gets all the love, but this is the more satisfying result for me.')
