In 68 counties where Amazon has opened one of its largest facilities, average industry compensation slips by more than 6% during the facility’s first two years, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In many cases, Amazon quickly becomes the largest logistics player in these counties, so its size and lower pay likely pull down the average. Among economists, there’s a debate about whether the company is creating a kind of monopsony, where there’s only one buyer—or in this case one employer.</i> though.<p>The &#x27;warehouse wages tend to fall&#x27; cuts out a bunch of variables, you end up with &#x27;warehouse worker pay&#x27;, and it goes down. It could be that warehouse jobs tend to pay for tenure or something, but that goes to the question I asked; are people leaving other warehouse job to go work at Amazon?<p>After your edit: I guess picking for $11 is worse than driving a fork lift for $20, so they probably aren&#x27;t improving overall work conditions if they are hiring so much that the structure of the workforce changes.')
