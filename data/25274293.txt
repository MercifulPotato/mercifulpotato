No, I don&#x27;t need you to give me code snippets on how to do my actual list.<p>- Obviously Julia can do everything that Python can. And most of it will look ergonomic, short and simple. The difficult part isn&#x27;t whether the language can do it once you know how, it&#x27;s how quickly you can get to figuring it out when you don&#x27;t know it.<p>- So what makes the small things difficult is really the mix of unhelpful error messages and the limited resources online.<p>This is my overall point - if you take someone who hasn&#x27;t written code in either Python or Julia, give them access to online search and ask them to complete almost any task, they&#x27;ll do it faster and with less effort in Python.')
