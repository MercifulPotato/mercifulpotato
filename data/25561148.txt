Housing demand (and so, related, prices) is obviously related to the number of people and what they can pay.  If anything, the lowering of the 10 year yield, which is used to determine mortgage rates, allows people to spend more for a house due to the low interest rate.  If interest rates go up, then the prices should go down to keep steady with what people are able to pay for a monthly mortgage.<p>Same thing about all the retirees eventually dying off and liquidating or handing down all this money, stock, and housing (honestly, I feel the same about political leanings, but that seems fairly steady unfortunately).  Seems like if history has shown us anything, while one person might be good with money, the same can&#x27;t always be said for their children (3rd generation rule - by the 3rd generation, 90% of wealthy families lose it).')
