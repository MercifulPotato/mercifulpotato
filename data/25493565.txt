The members are indoctrinated to the point that the term brainwashing probably applies and the group is extremely litigious and vengeful against those that leave, much like any other cult. I&#x27;ve seen the parents of a good friend be sucked in to this, their whole life revolves around that trash and they are up to their necks in debt because of it. It&#x27;s as if Scientology, multi-level marketing and homeopathic treatments had an evil child.')
