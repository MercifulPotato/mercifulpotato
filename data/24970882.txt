I combined with Noodler&#x27;s Bernanke Blue. It dries extremely quickly and it&#x27;s very smooth writing. At 0.3mm (Platinum Fine), it&#x27;s really hard to tell the difference between inks but Bernanke Blue is a fairly pleasant blue.<p>I think I paid 1000 JPY for it, but these days it&#x27;s around $10-$20 on amazon.')
