Twitter&#x2F;Facebook&#x2F;Reddit&#x2F;etc DO have a legitimate interest in keeping disinformation, garbage, and kiddy porn off of their platform if for no other reason than pol-bots make for a terrible user experience. And notice that when so-and-so gets “deplatformeed” it’s almost always for being involved in large scale platform “reach manipulation” not for being repugnant.<p>I am tired to death of conversations that end with, “but ma’ speech!” but would love to hear a serious policy proposal of what the platforms or governments should do about the legitimate UX problem here. What is a scalable solution to policing reach manipulation that doesn’t look like censorship from the outside?')
