This is also true of many FOSS projects which AWS, Microsoft, Google et al contribute to under the most liberal license conditions(such as MIT licensing which you&#x27;ll find in 95% of Microsofts contributions for example). Furthermore, I do not believe FOSS should concern itself with who is using the codebase, as fully open source software is about opening the code indiscriminately, whether individual dev or large corporation. As soon as you begin to discriminate between small and large corporation you are no longer truly free (and fwiw elasticsearch itself is a large corporation that has arguably exploited the good will of individual dev PRs with relicensing under a non-FOSS license).')
