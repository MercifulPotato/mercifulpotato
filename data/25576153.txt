Item(by='throwawaysea', descendants=None, kids=[25576170], score=None, time=1609283078, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25576053, text='&gt; Given the &quot;disagreement&quot; between Domingos and Anandkumar, who as others mention, sits on the ACM editorial board, this could be an attempt to censure or &quot;cancel&quot; her for her personal views. This is antithetical to the values held in the letter itself, and leaves a sour taste.<p>Shouldn&#x27;t her <i>actions</i> at least be censured? Her behavior has corrupted the science community, limited speech, created a culture of fear, and is ultimately inhibiting others&#x27; from freely disseminating their findings to the rest of the community (at NeurIPS and elsewhere) unless the author and&#x2F;or their work passes a political purity test, effectively. If that&#x27;s not discouraged, then I think science and open discourse will continue to be under attack.')
