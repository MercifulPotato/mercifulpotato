Christians inherited that and dominated the world.<p>Ostensibly, Christians dominated the world by pioneering monotheistic proselytization. The day of rest didn&#x27;t necessarily preclude Abrahamic religion from continuing the human sacrifice culture carried over from the polytheistic Canaanite roots of early Judeo-Christian religion. To the contrary, human sacrifice was elevated to the foundational myth vis-a-vis prophetic martyrship and symbolic rebirth.<p>On the whole, I agree with your broader point. Sacrifice cultures and result oriented cultures are intrinsically at odds with each other -- at some point, the culture must decide what is more important: appearances, or sustainable throughput? Cultures that decide to prioritize the latter almost all converge to your experiment A.')
