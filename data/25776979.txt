Item(by='ezzzzz', descendants=None, kids=[25779837], score=None, time=1610636103, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25776553, text='Although I am concerned about the 1A and big tech being the arbiters of it, it seems like such a system has yet to go to production (probably never will). I understand that there are technical, financial, and legal complexities that are much more nuanced than &#x27;FB doesn&#x27;t care, as long as they can profit from potentially dangerous content&#x27; and &#x27;FB just wants to suppress any speech which doesn&#x27;t align with their neo-liberal ideologies&#x27;.<p>What I find troubling is that, a system to find&#x2F;flag radical&#x2F;violent content likely exists within the auspices of the NSA. Despite the massive infringement of privacy that these systems create, it seems that they still can&#x27;t prevent people from being &#x27;radicalized&#x27; by content from the platforms that is designed to do exactly that. Furthermore, they couldn&#x27;t (or didn&#x27;t) do anything to actually prevent people from storming the Capital. This begs the question, does this massive surveillance state need to exist if it does not do the thing it is purported to do (find and suppress violence, prevent terrorist attacks, etc).<p>If the owners of the platforms have any conscience, unfortunately, it seems that the responsibility will be up to them. It&#x27;s murky territory for sure, and you have to strike a balance between far reaching censorship (i.e. infringing of 1A) and allowing disinformation, hate speech, and calls to violence to spread like wild-fire (i.e. how we got into this mess in the first place). I hate to say it, but the older I get, the more something like &#x27;the great firewall&#x27; of China seems to make more sense.')
