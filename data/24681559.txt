All of AC circuit analysis and the signals theory classes you take as an electrical engineer, for example, are firmly rooted in the language of DEs and just being able to plug some equations into a computer misses out on all of the real understanding you need to have in those fields to use them in practice.<p>One of the big red flags a junior electrical engineer can show, in fact, is too much reliance on simulation tools without having a good background understanding of what to expect from them.')
