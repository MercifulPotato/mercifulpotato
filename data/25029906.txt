We all need to learn to coexist. If both parties can agree to disagree, then a compromise is found which actually makes both parties happy. In a sense, this is an agreement in and of itself. You could even posit this is one of the fundamental ideas behind multi-culturalism. Now I&#x27;d say this is different from hiding your values. If you&#x27;re afraid to speak to your friend, because you think they will turn on you if they knew you didn&#x27;t align with their views, that is not a friend and you should probably get rid of this person from your life as they are a liability. But not trying to force others to think like you is definitely a good quality, forcing anything on anyone in my value judgement is mostly bad.<p>Now, I&#x27;ll say generally though, it is hard to be friends with someone who&#x27;s values goes against your own. For example, if I&#x27;m pro-life and you are not. Or if you favour white people over black and I am black. Or if you are anti-gay and I am gay. There is no easy resolution here, compromise isn&#x27;t a real option. If people only hold these diverging values as opinion, but don&#x27;t take actions on them, it could still work, but as soon as someone takes actions on them, it&#x27;ll create a conflict that the person with the opposite value set cannot easily ignore, especially if they are the target of the act.<p>That&#x27;s why in some way, any country needs to align on value set or risk falling appart. Thus discussing why we each hold our values, and trying to unify people&#x27;s value over time through education, conversation, discussion, is a healthy activity in my opinion.<p>Sometimes people hold values because of other values. Like I might value peace and law abiding attitudes, and therefore hate black people, because I am afraid they promote crime. Untangling these and making people realize that they might have the wrong data leading them to the wrong inferences can help.<p>And so, this is why I personally value &quot;liberal values&quot; above all else. And I believe these are the axioms of any peaceful, prosperous and free society. Because the liberal values are a set of values that win over all others, which are designed for peaceful coexistence of people, even those of diverging values, beliefs and opinions. But while you can diverge in all other aspects, you can&#x27;t diverge on the value of liberal values, that is, if you don&#x27;t value peaceful and harmonious win&#x2F;win coexistence with others above all else, well you cannot achieve it.')
