(low CoL but why stop there, why not look for cheaper people)<p>Low skilled people will slow things down, will destroy any quality and advantages you have in your code and then leave as they get better (or stay if they&#x27;re really crappy)<p>It&#x27;s worse if they stay as they have a tendency to multiply and get promoted to middle management and crap even more on things...<p>This will only be noticed via the occasional question &quot;why does it take so long when competitors already did this&quot; after a few years.<p>Also, by not keeping talent you lose their knowledge. All for what?, I doubt their wages factor too much in any product.<p>Alternative is to keep good people and pay them well, nurture a culture of excellency and kick out occasional bad hires.<p>That way you get great products and usually good costs as you tend to need fewer people to get things done (even if they cost more)<p>Note: I&#x27;ve seen both types of companies and some in between.')
