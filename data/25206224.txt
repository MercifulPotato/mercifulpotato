Instead of memorizing fallicies, you can approximate the quality of nearly all arguments to two theory-of-truth claims:<p>1. The premises are themselves valid: you buy that they are truthful.\n2. The argument&#x27;s logic coheres: when added to your existing beliefs there is no contradiction.<p>Fallicies manifest through violations of these claims. But you don&#x27;t have to know the name of that violation to raise a complaint: you can derive it on the spot. Discussing these fallicies mostly acts as a practice tool, and provides a useful bit of jargon if you are writing philosophy and need to convey the idea quickly. But most arguments in online spaces are dismissed with: &quot;the premise is invalid&quot; or &quot;the reasoning is incoherent.&quot;')
