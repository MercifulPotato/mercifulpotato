Being from a third world country, and not having much personal wealth at that time, I was forced to skip the Tutankhamun exhibit in the Cairo museumâ€”something that I regret even today.<p>Note: I was in Cairo as part of an official delegation (i.e., my country paid for my travel, and the sponsor organization in Egypt paid for my bed + board). At that time, I couldn&#x27;t have afforded either.')
