That has to have benefits in power and latency. So if a future Mx chip supports discrete RAM, it may not seem quite as magical anymore. Then again, Apple&#x27;s volume and margin is high enough that they could just build a single package with lots of RAM. You wouldn&#x27;t be able to tinker with it, but it&#x27;s not like Apple cares about that.<p>Makes you wonder if AMD or Intel will come up with a similar package for x86-based laptops.')
