If we&#x27;re going to outsource manufacturing abroad, domestic agriculture to migrant farmers, might as well import some Chinese construction who can build a million unit ghost city in a few years.<p>E: post too fast<p>@dghlsakjg<p>The only saving grace in Toronto condo construction is many of them maybe as shoddy as Chinese construction and hopefully will fall into disrepair and replaced before their life spans.<p>&gt;Chinese building practices assume a certain disposability<p>That&#x27;s Japanese residential construction. Chinese construction meme is lack of quality control which implies durability problems. But it&#x27;s a meme, housing stock too new to really generalize on. My personal experience (worked adjacent industry in both markets) is some of the Toronto new constructs are experiencing much quality issues sooner than Chinese developments. Chinese build so much that they can build well if incentivized too. In terms of cheap, fast, good... Canadian developers simply don&#x27;t have a fast mode... nor a cheap mode... and frequently not even good. China can at least get you fast &amp; cheap or fast &amp; good.')
