For the Pi, some things will differ obviously.<p>Not only does this type of setup give freedom for experiments (which NetBSD really does in general) but it makes expts easier.  You can put multiple different kernels on the USB stick and reboot into each of them to test pros and cons of different release versions and&#x2F;or configurations.  Or you might boot one computer with kernel A, pull out the stick, insert into another computer and boot kernel B and run them simultaneously. No HDDs needed.<p>I might do a writeup; some users have done writeups on &quot;disk-less&quot; in the distant past.  I have some simplification tricks no one has ever written about.  However NetBSD has such great documentation relative to almost every other project and the developers tend to be &quot;quietly competent&quot; in the best way.  It was never a culture of &quot;HOW-TO&#x27;s&quot; as you will find in Linux.  Studying the source and following source-changes and other mailing lists is better than any writeup, IMO.<p>It is like the old saw about teaching a man to fish.  It is worth learning.  Things do not change in NetBSD so fast or dramatically that what you have learnt will be later considered &quot;obsolete&quot;.')
