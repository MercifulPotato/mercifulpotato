Item(by='rewq4321', descendants=None, kids=[25018944, 25018791], score=None, time=1604779808, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25018453, text='JavaScript is very dynamic. Here I define a variable with `let` and then change it:<p>let foo = 10;\neval(&quot;fo&quot;+&quot;o = 10&quot;);<p>I could &quot;obfuscate&quot; that eval assignment as much as I like. So you can&#x27;t completely statically analyse `let` variables.<p>That said, it&#x27;s likely you&#x27;d end up with perf <i>very</i> close to `const` in a very &quot;hot&quot; part of your code, since a good JIT compiler like V8 will eventually make &quot;assumptions&quot; about your code, and optimise around them, while having (ideally cheap) checks in place to ensure the assumptions continue to hold.')
