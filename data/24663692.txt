How much control do you ultimately have over them? How long should this metric haunt you?<p>When hearing how US credit scoring works I do not think it is a system worth striving for.<p>This quickly becomes analogue to another HN discussion today about job opportunities for felons. That is hard threshold - it is easier just to skip them.<p>Should we let the market forces rule freely?<p>If not totally free then how big a pooled risk is acceptable to you? A pool for those with kids and another for those without?<p>I have no kids and personally I prefer one pool. Even with those unruly kids upstairs!<p>When I see a society with gated communities I feel sorry for them. I live a place where we do not have them and I am grateful for that. They might be happier than me - but I do still not envy them.<p>I often find people who argue fair pricing are the ones who think they are in the sweet spot.<p>The example seems a little contrived as well. If Evans kid stains the wall he would fix it. If not - then it is when you have the deposit to mitigate that risk.<p>I do however get the gist of it. And personally I like the pooled risk. I think that we do much better together than as individuals. The pricing might seem unfair but sometimes it in your direct favour. And the &quot;insurance&quot; feels nice too.<p>Naturally it comes down to your own philosophy.<p>So while I agree that it could give a variant of more accurately pricing I do not think that kind of &quot;precision&quot; is healthy.<p>I am afraid that the privacy ship has sailed but I still think it is worth fighting as the current course have a high risk of a truly dystopian future.')
