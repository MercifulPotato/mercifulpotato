Are you saying that China <i>deserves</i> to decline, because they are authoritarian, or that they <i>actually</i> are declining, and the numbers show this?<p>If China&#x27;s economy is really declining, I&#x27;m curious what the evidence of that is. What are the numbers? Are they experiencing a shrinking economy, declining productivity, technological stagnation? I&#x27;m not an expert, but I would be surprised if that was true.')
