Consider a couple alternate questions brought up in this thread:<p>* How many bytes of register files does the OS have to save on task switches? (With this question, subregisters shouldn&#x27;t be counted.)<p>* How many registers does an emulator (such as Rosetta 2) have to implement and test? (Subregisters should be counted.)<p>Even these one might argue aren&#x27;t directly useful; when considering context switching, one could dig down further into how much of the context switching time is attributable to saving the registers, validate that with experiments across architectures, etc.')
