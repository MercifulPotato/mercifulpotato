Each implementation grew the class divides even more. So far China, I would say, is the most economically viable model due to their opening to international market practice. However, the party still controls it and divvies out the work to a select few. Their social credit system helps them determine who is more worthy by putting people in different categories... oh wait that&#x27;s just a class system with extra steps.<p>It&#x27;s not a capitalist fault. It&#x27;s a human fault. We&#x27;ve done it for not hundreds of years, but thousands upon thousands. Long before Adam&#x27;s or Marx parents were a twinkle in anyone&#x27;s nethers. Finding a scapegoat for problems you dont quite understand and refuse to research beyond a 10min youtube cartoon does not constitute as good logic.')
