ML was around since 1973, which defined the ML family (Ocaml, SML, F#) and influenced Haskell and others. The Lisp family of languages had been around since 1958. Some parts of the lecture can be seen as related to languages in the APL family (originated in 1965). These developments influenced the lecture itself.<p>To gain context into Dijkstra&#x27;s response, it may be worth reading it [0]. Here&#x27;s the conclusion of his response:<p>&gt; <i>In short, the article is a progress report on a valid research effort but suffers badly from aggressive overselling of its significance, long before convincing results have been reached. This is the more regrettable as it has been published by way of Turing Award Lecture.</i><p>Regarding &quot;He tried to destroy it.&quot; Dijkstra is known, and often criticized by others, for his hyperbole. Perhaps instead of imitating this heavily criticized aspect of his, you could tone down your rhetoric and actually create an argument rather than try to dismiss someone (and all their work) for one thing you disagree with.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cs.utexas.edu&#x2F;users&#x2F;EWD&#x2F;transcriptions&#x2F;EWD06xx&#x2F;EWD692.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cs.utexas.edu&#x2F;users&#x2F;EWD&#x2F;transcriptions&#x2F;EWD06xx&#x2F;E...</a>')
