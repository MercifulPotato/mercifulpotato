Whereas in the past you could expect the same IP to expose DNS on port 53, FTP on port 21, or HTTP on port 80, now the same IP will serve you everything over the handy port 443.<p>So a software developer can very well go this route if they want to obfuscate DNS calls and you wouldn&#x27;t be able to discriminate the traffic like you would today with ports.<p>Any global (OS&#x2F;network) policies become meaningless if your browser or app decide to only ask the DoH resolver &quot;who is google.com&quot; or &quot;who is facebook.com&quot; once, and have all subsequent queries go that way inside an encrypted HTTPS stream.')
