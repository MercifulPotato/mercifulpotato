You called it &quot;free speech&quot;. I wish we all had the 1st Amendment in Europe, but unfortunately we don&#x27;t. Every European country claims it has free speech, but at the same time puts limits on it, let that be anti-communism laws, hate speech laws, laws against offending religious people, or whatever really. That&#x27;s just how things are in Europe, sorry. Whatever the Polish government might have done to that point, they have my applause for trying for once to actually expand the freedom of speech on the internet. And even Merkel seems to agree with them and I don&#x27;t really like or trust her either.')
