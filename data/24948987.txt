Until then nuclear presents the only proven way of decarbonizing an energy sector to a great extent that works in any environment.<p>It&#x27;s true that nuclear doesn&#x27;t make economic sense relative to running a gas plant and using solar when you can. You can get a greater immediate carbon reduction by spending the cost if a nuclear plant on supplementing fossil fuels with nuclear. But that&#x27;ll only go so far. Once you outstrip demand during peak generation hours, you&#x27;re effectively getting less energy for the same capacity. It doesn&#x27;t provide a path to decarbonization without storing large amounts if energy - much larger than what we&#x27;ll be able to store for decades at least.')
