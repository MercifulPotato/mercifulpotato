Common Lisp has a type system. Have you ever written it? Do you actually know anything <i>about</i> it? Moreover, macros are a plus - you clearly have not actually used Lisp macros, which are categorically different than macros in other languages.<p>&gt; * Doesn&#x27;t have parantheses and the annoying prefix notation<p>Spelling mistake. Additionally, the parenthesized syntax is a choice, and one that you get used to quickly. Subjective, and therefore not valid as one of the items you listed.<p>&gt; * Your knowledge of SML can be translated easily to OCaml, Java, Scala, which are more or less part of the same family<p>Meanwhile, knowledge of Common Lisp transfers to almost every dynamically-typed language ever made, and a good many static ones - including Java and Scala - because Lisp influenced <i>all</i> of those languages. That is, Lisp knowledge transfers to far <i>more</i> languages than SML knowledge does.')
