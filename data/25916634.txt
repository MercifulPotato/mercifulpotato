That&#x27;s both a blessing and a curse. The curse is obvious. The blessing is that it means that they will let you get <i>much</i> further with vertical scaling. Especially if you take the time to learn how to tune them.<p>Support for horizontal scaling comes at a cost. When I&#x27;ve done performance analyses, I regularly find that parallel and distributed implementations spend most their wall clock time on synchronization and communication. Occasionally more than 90%. That creates a big up-front cost you need to overcome before you see a net benefit. It also leads to a sort of horizontal scaling version of the rocket equation where returns can diminish rapidly.')
