While some of it might be warranted, projects like this—that strive to solve a large, global issue through somewhat charitable actions—are generous and have only increased my respect for the Google&#x2F;Alphabet&#x2F;X team. I hope they don&#x27;t get flamed for this, and hopefully some of their research and donation funds can live on and solve the issue that Loon originally intended to one day.')
