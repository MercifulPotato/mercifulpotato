The first thing I always do is make a custom Settings class which just loads settings via good old `Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable`. Super simple and never failed me.<p>Bonus Points, by loading all settings at once into strongly typed properties at startup, it will fail fast if a setting is missing, which to me is a benefit.<p>But I still pass this class via DI to the controllers for testability reasons. If you are using ASP Net, just do things the asp-net way for the sake of other people who have to inherit the code.<p>Outside of AspNet I never use any automatic DI.')
