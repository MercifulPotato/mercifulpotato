So if Windows saves a <i>single support issue</i> per year, per user - then it&#x27;s worth it.<p>3) Data Ownership - like everything, the pragmatic reality of the situation matters more than ideology.<p>So many factors: security, integrity of host, does the data have &#x27;long term value&#x27; (do you need granular data from 5 years ago?).<p>Do you really think that your home-baked file server in the corner hosting your shared documents is more secure, supportable, maintainable, lower cost than the SaaS?<p>Maybe - but probably not.<p>Summary: invest in things that are materially useful to your operations, and if they do &#x27;help&#x27; they are probably worth quite a lot but have the self awareness to not get addicted to &#x27;distracting&#x27; SaaS, and make pragmatic decisions about what data will sit in the cloud and why, and finally you can still push vendors to provide more &#x27;controlled&#x27; data scenarios, such as co-locating services that they run etc.')
