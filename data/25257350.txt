I did not spend any money on turning my dollars into bitcoin, because I already had bitcoin. I did not pay $90 in electricity costs, it seems a little silly to bring the block reward up. You already have a good argument for what you&#x27;re trying to say, you don&#x27;t need to pretend that a cost others pay is a cost the transaction sender pays. As far as I know the recipients of my transactions did not pay any fees to convert the bitcoin back into their local currencies, because they were fine with holding on to it as Bitcoin.<p>I am not trying to say that Bitcoin solves every problem. I agree with you that there are many problems it does not solve. The $399 number is disingenuous though, you&#x27;re ignoring that there are situations where bitcoin really does have lower fees than the alternatives.')
