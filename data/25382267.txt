What&#x27;s the watt hours per kilogram they&#x27;re expecting to get?  Is Toyota pursuing a particular research path that is releasing its findings to the public yet, or is it all a closely-held secret?<p>A full recharge in 10 minutes means it will be charging at 6C, which is impressive.<p>I&#x27;m not a battery expert, but in a few years I guess their main competition will be whatever Tesla manages to accomplish with lithium ion (assuming they don&#x27;t switch to something completely new), and lithium sulfur if someone figures out how to manufacture it in a way that&#x27;s durable and cheap.  Maybe there are other promising alternatives I&#x27;m not aware of (possibly including other solid state chemistries).')
