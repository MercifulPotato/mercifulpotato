It takes another one just to plan to built it.  That is assuming you get the regulation approval with zero delay.<p>Building a Fab means absolutely nothing if you cant get the process to yield. Look at Samsung Foundry in the past 3- 5 years.<p>Intel&#x27;s Leapfrog chances was their Intel Custom Foundry. Had they not mess that one up they would have a Fighting chance. Even if they had a Design that Leapfrog Apple&#x27;s M1 <i>today</i>, it would still be let down by their 10nm SuperFin Process.')
