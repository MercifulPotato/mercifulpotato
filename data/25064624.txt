Nobody expects to come in proficient on day one for ProTools, or Avid, or SolidWorks, etc.<p>That said it&#x27;s totally fair to not have the time to commit to learning a complex tool. There are other, more accessible DAWs out there you can use if you don&#x27;t need the power this one provides. Garageband, for example, is easy to use and straightforward. Curious if folks know other ones similarly easy to use.')
