Item(by='ilaksh', descendants=None, kids=[25537336], score=None, time=1608908554, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25535260, text='I think that something like UBI is the only humane way to run a society, especially with the increasing automation.<p>Personally I think that if people study the problem they will realize that there are reasons that UBI is universal and that non-universal UBI probably won&#x27;t work.<p>I also believe that if you look at the cost of living in the US and the potential federal revenue increase from radical corporate tax reform, it will still not add up.<p>So I think that we need extreme cost reductions.  But beyond that, I don&#x27;t think the monetary systems we have now actually can support UBI indefinitely.  The math just doesn&#x27;t add up due to the high cost of living.  Eventually the poor countries can&#x27;t tolerate letting the rich countries increase their debt infinitely anymore.  This is going to be a big risk for global war in the next few years.<p>So I believe we need a totally new type of high tech money.  One that integrates more information and has more fine-grained controls.  I believe the only way we are going to have global security is if this new money is built on a fair international standard.')
