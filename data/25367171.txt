There may be a handful of Richard Spencer types but no one I know agrees with anything like that. What I know is a multi ethnic coalition that is anti-globalist, anti-bureaucratic, anti-war and nationalistic in the sense it believes in strong American identity and state and it believes in free and transparent elections.<p>The same &quot;extremist&quot; comments could be made about antifa types but it wouldn&#x27;t be representative of all Democrats, many of whom are probably something like school teacher union and human resource members not communists with Molotov cocktails.<p>These are big coalitions but you are smart person who spends a lot of time over the years commenting on politics and you know that I&#x27;m sure.<p>I hope you are wrong about blood in the streets. I really do. But you might not be. Both sides have gotten a bit too extremist and utterly convinced of their righteousness so it might go to bad place no matter the outcome.')
