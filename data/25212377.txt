They oppose deliberate measures against repair, such as:<p>- Parts which are produced by a third party who signed a contract with the manufacturer to not sell the part to other people. So you cannot find whatever $2 power management unit in your phone&#x27;s main board even if you are willing to use complex equipment to replace it.<p>- Parts which &quot;marry&quot; their devices and refuse to work when you plug them into another device.<p>This kind of behavior actively fights against you repairing the device. I find it unacceptable.')
