But they are not boring. If anything they create a ton of distinctly un-boring problems like build chains, packaging, framework of the week is no longer supported (or has a new incompatible version).<p>Engineers may like these for whatever reasons, especially before they have tried the higher quality tooling provided by real boring tech but inevitably they lead to projects that either run behind time because of technical issues not related to business problems and&#x2F;or rot after development is paused and are hard to resuscitate and maintain afterwards.<p>Also NoSQL doesn&#x27;t &quot;scale&quot; better than SQL. NoSQL stores can scale better in certain data access patterns but if your data model is inherently relational and you implement it on top of NoSQL all you have done is reinvented a relational store in your application model and likely crippled integrity, scalability and performance in one fell swoop.')
