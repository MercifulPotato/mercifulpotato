Mopar sells manuals online if you subscribe to TechConnect but you still really need wiTech to complete many of the procedures.<p>Automotive repair has been relinquished to tribal knowledge and it’s unfortunate. I think most of us advocate for right to repair but it has such a strong second order effect it doesn’t get the attention it deserves with the broader public.<p>My dealer is incompetent. One of the techs did burnouts in my car and posted it on youtube 12 years ago. Ever since then I have never used dealer service again. I even went as far as not taking advantage of my warranty once.')
