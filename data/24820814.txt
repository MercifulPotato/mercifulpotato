It doesn&#x27;t always prevent the patronizing, snippy slaps, but helps a lot.<p>I&#x27;ve asked almost twice as many questions on SO as I&#x27;ve answered. It&#x27;s a valuable resource to me, and I appreciate it.<p>I do try to give back, and usually try to paraphrase questions that I&#x27;m not sure about, like &quot;If you are trying to get <i>X</i> working, then here&#x27;s how I did it.&quot; I&#x27;ve learned to try to remove as many &quot;you&quot;s as possible, and keep it focused on my experience and point of view, qualifying it as such. It does, sometimes lead to people accusing me of &quot;Making it all about you,&quot; but it also removes elements of judgment.')
