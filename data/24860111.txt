The modernized mindset is to put things on a sticky platform, preferable one which hardware keys they control, data mine everything for profit, and not have any way for &quot;customers&quot; to contact the company and object if the customer get kicked out of the platform.<p>For people who do care there is a spectrum of issues they might care about, including free vs non-free. Surveys like this might even help the developers to identify which of those issues users do care about, and as such, the people behind the survey likely want to make the survey as inclusive to that spectrum as possible.')
