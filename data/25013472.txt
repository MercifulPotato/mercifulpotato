Some SMD LEDs output a non trivial amount of light in a very small area - if you put black electrical tape, the high power density (over a very small area) can cause the tape to start smoking and burning.<p>A friend had a Razer Phone 2 which melted its camera lens and would cause burns if you covered the LED while it was on. While I&#x27;m sure that particular case may have been a faulty device&#x2F;faulty design,<p>I&#x27;d think that to make a brighter LED flash, you&#x27;d need more than one LED source. While this would be fine for general illumination, perhaps if they were not tightly coupled together some odd shadows could result. And it&#x27;d look kind of funny to some.<p>As for the actual amount of heat output by a relatively bright LED, it should only add about a watt or two to the budget at most, which I&#x27;d say is manageable given current LED flash implementations aren&#x27;t really thermally managed or coupled with the device&#x27;s internal heat sink.')
