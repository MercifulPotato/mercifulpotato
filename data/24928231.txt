I found some of my original series GPK cards in mint or near mint condition. I don’t have 1a (Nasty Nick), but a graded mint 1A sold on eBay for $12,900 with 30+ bids. Others from series 1 go from a few hundred per card to several thousand.<p>Going with this article, yes there seems to be a nostalgia bump on eBay for things from 70s - 2000s. Hot Wheels, GPK, YugiOh, Pokémon, all seem to have some value recently.')
