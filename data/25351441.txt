Upon firing, the chemical energy of the powder is converted to kinetic energy in the bullet.  When the bullet hits the target kinetic energy is converted to tissue damage.  More powder = more kinetic energy = more damage.  Heavier bullet = more momentum = more recoil.  That&#x27;s why the Glock has so much more kick, while the AR-15 has more penetrating power and range.  There are also pretty massive differences in the aerodynamics of the bullet, which probably helps the AR-15&#x27;s range a lot:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;qph.fs.quoracdn.net&#x2F;main-qimg-ab7ec2e9df26a1afc268032e6ddd41ab" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;qph.fs.quoracdn.net&#x2F;main-qimg-ab7ec2e9df26a1afc26803...</a>')
