The counter-example would then be: instead of always trying to catch the biggest fish you can also make a few examples and disturb something like a criminal network by messing up the actions of their foot soldiers.<p>I suspect the way you go about it increases or decreases the amount of individual requests you need in order to execute your mandate.')
