I would trade my best technical skills for better social skills (which I didn&#x27;t manage to develop at this crucial age) as I can see from experience now that that&#x27;s what brings you what really matters in life: good friends, success in romantic relationships, even success at work where I observe that most people who get &quot;promoted&quot; are the people who others like, not necessarily the best technically.')
