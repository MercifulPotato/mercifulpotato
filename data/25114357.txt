It&#x27;s highlighting one of the most common misunderstandings that laypersons have regarding video download&#x2F;streaming. Most people think that you can &quot;view&quot; content on the internet without downloading it. In this context, a tool which purports to &quot;download&quot; content, you know... sounds like it&#x27;s nefariously doing something that the &quot;viewing&quot; tool (like a web browser) doesn&#x27;t do.')
