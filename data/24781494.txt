I&#x27;ve used a Quest. I bought an Index in August because of this FB account crap but ending up selling it 2 days later.<p>I&#x27;m not a fan of the Index. First problem, it has horrible black levels. Everything looks like you&#x27;re in a layer of fog compared to the Rift. Maybe if you&#x27;ve never used a Rift before you won&#x27;t notice but it was shockingly bad for me.<p>The headphones are utter crap. I don&#x27;t get whoever thought headphones that hover 1&#x2F;2 inch away from your ears would work. Take whatever headphones you have now that you&#x27;re listening to music on and pull them 1&#x2F;2 inch away for each ear. The sound goes down, it sounds tinny, less full, bases are missing, etc. The Index sounded exactly like that. Some friends said you have to get them perfectly lined up but if that&#x27;s true the moment you move your head suddenly in some game they&#x27;re no longer going to be aligned.<p>This also means the sound leaks into the room far more than it would with on ear headphones. It&#x27;s not going to be loud but it is going to be annoying for anyone within a room if they aren&#x27;t making some louder noise.<p>Next up, Steam VR is just not as good as Oculus Connect (or whatever Oculus&#x27;s home screen system is called). In part because Oculus has built in &quot;pull up your desktop and&#x2F;or multiple windows&quot; at anytime in anytime game and pin them to say up. Apparently there&#x27;s a 3rd party app that will provide this for Index&#x2F;Vive but I use that feature all the time. Inside a game want to look up a walkthru just pin in there in my view.<p>Now for some things that no one will admit to but I will...<p>The Index Controllers didn&#x27;t feel as good to me as Rift Controllers. I get they have fanciers sensors. I get they grip your hands. But, probably the #1 use for VR is porn. Controllers that require 2 hands to put on are not good for things that require one had to be free.<p>I have lots of friends in the industry, I see none of them using an Index and plenty of complaints.<p>As for Quest&#x2F;Quest 2, even if there wasn&#x27;t the FB issue it&#x27;s like choosing an iPhone instead of a PS5. iPhone has tons of great games but it doesn&#x27;t have PS5 level games. Similarly Quest has tons of great games, but it doesn&#x27;t have PC level VR games and it will never have any porn games being locked up by Facebook. (and even if it did, do you really want FB knowing which porn games you&#x27;re playing?)<p>I&#x27;m praying the HP Reverb G2 gets good reviews and solves most of those issues. It&#x27;s apparently a month or 2 from shipping so I&#x27;m crossing my fingers I can get rid of this Rift.')
