Every white car around was off-white.<p>The other day I parked in a line of 7 white vehicles in a row.<p>In my defense, I wanted orange, but the orange they offered was more of a red than an orange. They had two other types of red available, so that was ridiculous. Then I wanted a deep gray, but the Japanese tsunami wiped out the plant that made the pigment.  I would have liked green, but their green option was also a terrible shade.<p>So, white. With black stripes.')
