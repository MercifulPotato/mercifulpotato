There was this old strange employee that at first gave me the creeps, but eventually we became casual friends. On his last day before retirement he gave me the book he wrote. It turns out this guy was a millionaire and had a very diverse set of skills.<p>His book said that even though he was an accountant, stock broker, song writer, etc he preferred to work in the restaurant business because he liked working with the public and being social.<p>What I learned from him is that you really aren’t your job. Even if you have to work at subway to enjoy life, don’t think less of yourself ;)')
