The best example I can give is the tftp module, which I wanted to use to do pxe booting.  After about 2 days of trying to track the spaghetti callbacks back and forth between the tftp, tftp_engine, tftp_lib, and the callback module to fix a bug and commit a change to OTP, I gave up and wrote my own TFTP module in Elixir.  With a very conservative amount of `use` macros, to help organize calls it came out beautifully:  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hexdocs.pm&#x2F;trivial&#x2F;Trivial.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hexdocs.pm&#x2F;trivial&#x2F;Trivial.html</a><p>My point being, is that sometimes some patterns (in the case of tftp, a really awkward java-esque factory pattern) do not do so well in erlang&#x27;s pure functional system and if you instead pass behaviours with `use` you can do much better and have saner code.')
