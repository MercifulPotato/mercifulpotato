Item(by='mousebaiker', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602242937, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24727499, text='The original paper mentioned in the article [1] deals with metric TSP, so a triangle inequality must be satisfied. This means that you can actually find a space where the points will be the coordinates.<p>Anyway, the grandparent solves the Euclidean TSP which is still an NP-complete problem. I will be reluctant to say that it is an easier problem in a general sense. \nI agree though that there are better and easier approximations for it.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;2007.01409" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;2007.01409</a>')
