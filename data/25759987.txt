This makes a lot of tricky things easier, but there are pitfalls.<p>Also deleting stuff for real for real immediately is really hard.<p>You need to delete it from the database, the one that&#x27;s replicating to, caches, online backups AND offline backups. And that&#x27;s after you&#x27;ve confirmed and reconfirmed from the user that they actually want to delete the data, not just store it in the recycle bin or something idiotic like that.<p>The easiest way is just to flag as deleted and prune on some kind of schedule. Backups will be overwritten at some point and the data will go away eventually.')
