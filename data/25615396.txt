As more money gets dumped into equities their price goes up. Since those &quot;investors&quot; are just looking to hold the equity until someone else comes along and pays more for it they don&#x27;t care about fundamentals or dividends.<p>Some companies have good fundamentals and have done well despite the pandemic. Many more have only gotten by with government handouts. A lot of exuberance today comes from big traders picking up stocks at a huge discount last March. The huge market drops were basically an interest free loan to anyone with enough money to pick up <i>more</i> stocks.<p>It&#x27;s a great environment if you&#x27;ve already got money or retired recently with stocks as a large component of your investment portfolio. For everyone else the markets haven&#x27;t done anything useful, if anything they&#x27;ve convinced low information voters that the <i>economy</i> is doing better than it is.')
