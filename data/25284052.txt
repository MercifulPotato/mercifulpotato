You get a number, and that&#x27;s your number.<p>Nor do I mean to imply that it&#x27;s awful, or worse than X. I know from experience how unfair individual negotiation can be, having been on both ends of massive pay ranges for the same title and responsibilities at the same company. It&#x27;s not all sunshine and roses in my current job as a software engineer at $BIGCORP, but I do appreciate the relative fairness with regard to pay, and the magnitude doesn&#x27;t hurt either.<p>Still, it&#x27;s worth pointing out that a) unions have done great things for workers across many industries, b) that tech workers usually have no institutionalized collective bargaining power, c) that <i>many</i> tech workers have essentially no <i>individual</i> bargaining power either, and d) that tech work has been following a trend of increasing commodification.')
