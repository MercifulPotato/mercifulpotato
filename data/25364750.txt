The feature was implemented by lulalala and includes a query interface, enables more precise testing, and access to error details.</i><p>This has been in the work since Rails 5.x and I believe Lulalala extracted it from his work on Gitlab. And it was lot of hard work.<p>Since both Github and Shopify now runs on Master, I dont think there are any other open source web framework that is more battle tested than Rails.<p>Still waiting for New Magic though.')
