That makes the therapeutic index 1.875-2.5 as I mentioned. 12g over 2 days is 1.5X. Again that’s <i>without</i> alcohol which folks do not seem to appreciate.<p>People can and do exceed these numbers hence the 50,000 ER visits per year. It is the leading cause of acute liver failure in the United States.<p>The bar shouldn’t be “often enough for most cases” when 1.5X the dose for 2 days can kill you. Either the safety margin is too low or the warnings aren’t nearly big enough, but the numbers don’t lie, the status quo is bad. Especially when the alternatives require way less diligence on your part and are sold as equivalent adjacent products.')
