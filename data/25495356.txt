Item(by='arp242', descendants=None, kids=[25495666], score=None, time=1608561993, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25495140, text='I worked with both Python and Ruby daily for several years, both quite a few years ago and now just write the occasional scripts in those languages (small scripts, maintenance of older projects, patches for various projects when needed, etc.)<p>I much prefer Python for this. As an occasional Python&#x2F;Ruby programmer I find it&#x27;s just so much easier to work with. Ruby has a lot of features, which is part of its appeal, but that also means a lot of remember and ... a lot to forget. If you&#x27;re not steeped in it, then that makes things quite a bit harder.<p>I programmed some Ruby a few weeks ago; it had been quite a while since I last did any Ruby, and ended up having to look up the syntax for blocks. This is really basic stuff, but I had written str.gsub!(&#x27;pat&#x27;, {|m| ... }), and the correct syntax is of course str.sub!(&#x27;pat&#x27;) { |m| ... }. Kinda silly I guess and a bit of a &quot;oh, du&#x27;h&quot; moment; I spent two years with Ruby as my day job, but that was also five years ago, and I think these kind of mistakes aren&#x27;t that unusual if you&#x27;re not programming Ruby too often.<p>And then there are caveats like using &quot;return&quot; where you should have used &quot;next&quot;, and quite a few other things.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I like Ruby, and there&#x27;s also a bunch of things I don&#x27;t like about Python. But I can definitely understand why people settled on Python. I think Matz once said &quot;Ruby is 80% Perl and 20% Python&quot;; I feel that with a slightly lower Perl-to-Python-ratio Ruby would have been better.<p>---<p>There may also have been implementation considerations by the way. I believe that historically at least, Ruby has been a lot slower than Python, although I think the differences today aren&#x27;t very large. And a lot of these tools are written as native extensions, which Python seems to support a bit better.')
