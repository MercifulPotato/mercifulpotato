Just stating information I&#x27;ve viewed. That&#x27;s all.<p>If anything those coming from backgrounds I didn&#x27;t list should try to be as involved as possible with startups. Thanks for the alternative take, but nothing stated was meant to deter as much as inform.<p>We also shouldn&#x27;t erase potential truths for lack of crowdsourced data. We as a tech community have a large desire to ask for the source, which is great, but double edged.<p>Relaying information of this sort that I and others brought up is important on the basis of more eyes on the potential problem and looking into the data than not.')
