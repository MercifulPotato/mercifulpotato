Oracle is not suing app developers for writing Java code to run on an Apache Harmony based mobile OS. It is suing Google for proceeding to base their mobile OS on Apache Harmony after they backed out of licensing negotiations. As was observed during the hearing, everyone else who made a mobile OS was able to do it without copying someone else&#x27;s API structure, so the idea that the API structure is essential to the functioning of a mobile OS is simply absurd.<p>There&#x27;s a whole section in that opinion I linked above titled, &quot;Google&#x27;s Interoperability Arguments are Irrelevant to Copyrightability,&quot; that&#x27;s worth reading for a deeper treatment of the issue. In particular, Judge O&#x27;Malley (quite reasonably) calls bullshit on the very premise that Google copied the Java APIs in order to achieve interoperability, pointing out that Google did specific things to prevent such interoperability (as an aside, we now know that their desire to do so, and Sun&#x27;s unwillingness to agree to that, is a major reason why they could not come to terms on a licensing agreement), and was unable to produce any examples of a pre-existing Java program that also runs on Android.')
