Item(by='M277', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602947643, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24810218, text='I am 20 and my experience slightly mirrors yours -- it was all about wanting to do something, so I went to learn it. However, I got into the internet much, much earlier than my peers. I was regularly on the internet when I was 7-8 (2007-2008), so I did see <i>some</i> of the old internet. My first time on the internet was when I was 6, but I didn&#x27;t really use it much at that time and I am not sure if I understood anything about it at that time.<p>My passion for computer hardware (and to a lesser extent software) comes purely from my childhood, I&#x27;d say. It had a great effect, and actually led me to many paths I wouldn&#x27;t have taken otherwise. Also, I gained non-tech skills as well, like my handling of the English language, for instance.<p>I can&#x27;t answer your question, since I have had quite a different experience, but the reason my acquaintances are picking up tech skills is because it&#x27;s the future and it&#x27;s where the money is, or because their parents told them to. This is really unfortunate because they don&#x27;t actually bother picking up any tech skills at all unless they absolutely need it (which is very rare in 2020 due to how everything is so convenient &#x2F; available).  However, I am from a poor country, so I am not the best person to answer this.<p>Personally, I prefer the old internet. Not only due to what I mentioned, but also because the current internet is just full of messed up things like the current state of social media (really, HN is the only one I tolerate) and how rooted it has become, or how people in general became more afraid of expressing themselves on the internet, and so much more.')
