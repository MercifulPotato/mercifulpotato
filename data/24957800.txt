I would had probably passed it anyway, but wanted to be sure. I downloaded the official Goethe B1 wordlist (2.5k words), and one week before the exam I started learning it in Anki.<p>I spent on avg. 2.5h per day, and out of those 2.5k words, I didn&#x27;t know maybe 800. I&#x27;ve learnt them. Many of those words appeared later during the exam.<p>I told about it my German teacher, somewhat excited, and she was sort-a &#x27;meh, whatever, you can also learn in other ways&#x27;. I tried to explain, that &quot;800 words, and in a week, and so fast&quot;, but as much as she loved my good exam results, she had no intention to recommend this way of learning to others.')
