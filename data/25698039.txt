I saw the effects first hand of several policies sold by &quot;progressive&quot; politicians to me and my family as instruments of change that would expand the welfare of the nation to us, and for several years hoped they actually would.<p>Yet each policy meant to help us, only ever seemed to do the opposite. I drove a car that I was lucky if I could get started each day to go to college and to work, yet the liberal &quot;cash for clunkers&quot; program meant to give people an opportunity to buy a new vehicle meant that not only could I not afford a new car even after the additional &quot;cash&quot;, but now the used car parts market was so expensive because of the sudden destruction of &quot;clunkers&quot;, it also made keeping my car running nearly impossible.<p>A healthcare bill that I hoped would fund my parent&#x27;s healthcare needs ended up giving us a choice - pay for a plan we couldn&#x27;t afford with deductibles so high we would never be able to use it, or take our chances that the IRS would never collect on the individual mandate.<p>Each step of the way, liberal politicians would pass something on the notion that it was to help people like me, only for it to hurt me, but even worse, I was now &quot;racist&quot; and &quot;dumb&quot; for opposing them.<p>I reached a point where I no longer wanted government to help me be &quot;equal&quot;, I just wanted them to leave me alone and stop making it harder than it already was. Yet I kept being told this elitist group of leaders in Washington knew better than me, even as with each &quot;experiment&quot; they were left completely unaffected by the consequences that I was left with.<p>After 4 years of college towards a computer science degree, I&#x27;m incredibly grateful for my education, and I have since been able to do incredible things for my family with my income from a career I love.<p>I now have the freedom to advocate for the same liberal policies my co-workers advocate for, knowing that whether they work or not, I will be wholly unaffected. This way, I could be easily accepted and free to voice my political opinion along everyone else, without fear of being called a bigot.<p>But my experience growing up is exactly why I believe what I believe, and I can promise anyone willing to listen that, for as strongly as you believe you are representing the welfare of the poor,  or of minorities, so do I. Not out of racism or ill intent, but precisely the opposite - my own experience, and my desire to help others with what helped me.<p>My education served to expand my mind to be open to everyone&#x27;s perspective in a way that I feel gave me empathy. Empathy to see that, while my experience drives me to conservative fiscal policy and socially libertarian policy, I would never want to judge someone else&#x27;s motives based solely on their political persuasion. Others likely had different life experiences that I would do well to learn from.<p>To me, the goal of an education is the ability to have empathy for multiple, potentially conflicting views at once, and make decisions based on that. I really struggle with the notion that many seem to have that, instead, being educated seems to mean &quot;empathize with a single viewpoint, and make decisions for everyone based on that, with the assumption that I must be more correct in my assertion than the people for whom I&#x27;m deciding, because I&#x27;m educated and they are not&quot;.')
