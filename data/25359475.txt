I&#x27;m really curious what happened to all those hardware and electrical engineers developing phones for Nokia&#x2F;Microsoft before they went bust, respawned as HMD, packed up and moved their production and R&amp;D to China.<p>Did they pivot to other industries in Finland? If so, which industries? Were they valued as much in the other industries or did they take significant pay cuts? Or did they have to pack up and move elsewhere where they would be valued? If so, where?<p>I&#x27;m asking since I met a few ex-Nokia people looking for work in Switzerland&#x2F;Germany&#x2F;Austria years ago.<p>If anyone knows more I&#x27;d like to find out please.')
