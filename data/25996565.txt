Item(by='Igelau', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612230073, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25992390, text='&gt; Easily distracted by noise (hypersensitive to external sounds like birds, cars, construction, etc.)<p>I suffer from misophonia in a way that is similar to this. There are certain high, mid-high sounds that cause a painfully disorienting &quot;touch&quot; sensation for me, along with the usual suspects like chewing. I hear sonic animal repellents that most people out of their teen years don&#x27;t.<p>&gt; Noise cancellation headphones to eliminate distracting sounds<p>I was skeptical about these in the past. I received a pair as a Christmas present and they&#x27;ve been literally life-changing, especially in COVID World with the kids at home. They&#x27;re Bose and probably cost more than I would spend on myself, but they are priceless to me now.')
