Examples are dedicated classroom teachers in an educational bureaucracy, many of the engineers and launch technicians and scientists at NASA, even some agricultural scientists and advisors in the former Soviet Union collective farming administration.<p>&gt; Secondly, there will be those dedicated to the organization itself. Examples are many of the administrators in the education system, many professors of education, many teachers union officials, much of the NASA headquarters staff, etc.<p>&gt; The Iron Law states that in every case the second group will gain and keep control of the organization. It will write the rules, and control promotions within the organization.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jerrypournelle.com&#x2F;reports&#x2F;jerryp&#x2F;iron.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jerrypournelle.com&#x2F;reports&#x2F;jerryp&#x2F;iron.html</a><p>This (and other organizational failures and technological innovations) is why there will always be startups and small businesses eventually where there was once a big entrenched business or two (or sometimes three).<p>There is also, of course, whole new industries and niches to be created out of nothing, value and wealth is never a finite pile. It&#x27;s mostly a matter of human effort to find and break out these new areas. Sometimes just reinventing things as the old talent grows old and dies off, providing value in learning history.')
