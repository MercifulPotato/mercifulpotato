There was clearly something wrong in 2016 when they repeatedly failed to predict the GOP primaries<p>Polls don&#x27;t predict anything. Poll-based forecasts are different than polls, and done by different people.<p>The major polls in 2016 conducted close to the election were well within the MoE of the actual results, so as far as polls go there is very little evidence that anything was wrong.<p>Some of the poll-based forecasts made errors like assuming independence of state-level deviations from polling averages woere independent rather than linked, which gave Trump a very small chance of victory; that doesn&#x27;t accord with history, was called out by 538 <i>before</i> the election, and I doubt anyone is making that mistake again.')
