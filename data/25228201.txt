Examining your thoughts, and the spoken assertions of others, is valuable if only to train critical thinking.<p>I do think it&#x27;s possible to prize independence in this regard too much, though.  Taken to the extreme, it&#x27;s a sort of personal not-invented-here syndrome: it can shut you off from valuable sources of ideas and mentorship, and cause you to endlessly re-tread mental ground that&#x27;s already been covered.  Taking the successful scientist as an example: they &quot;stand on the shoulders of giants&quot;, and their &quot;independent&quot; thoughts are only possible because they&#x27;re immersed in, and actively synthesizing, lots and lots and lots of &quot;conventional&quot; thought.<p>The &quot;independent&quot; breakthrough is just one small iteration on heaps of &quot;conventional&quot; thought.  The &quot;independent&quot; product is just one small iteration on heaps of &quot;conventional&quot; technology.  It&#x27;s the deep familiarity with the &quot;conventional&quot; part, and thinking through what all that really means and makes possible, that makes the &quot;independent&quot; part possible.<p>So: are you really thinking independently?  Or are you just thinking blindly, without that familiarity?')
