For example, you won&#x27;t go to a seminar on microrheology and have a physicists point out in disgust that the presented derivation is &quot;wrong&quot; because it used Newton&#x27;s second law without the relativistic component. While this is perhaps an extreme example, it is the case that we often have to ignore certain effects&#x2F;make certain assumptions to make equations solvable and interpretable. If we believed that our physics equations represented some &quot;absolute truth,&quot; then we would never allow ourselves to make these sort of assumptions in the formulas we derive.')
