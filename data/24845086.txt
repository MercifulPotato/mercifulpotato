No doubt they are all trying to influence the U.S. election. None of that has anything to do with the damning evidence of Hunter Biden selling access to his father for millions of dollars.<p>I linked to professional staffers on Twitter from Politico and Fox. They&#x27;re not random contributors, they&#x27;re journalists and they&#x27;re quoting specific government officials.<p>At any rate, I know, neither journalists nor government officials have a very good reputation these days, but you asked for evidence, and I provided that, along with photo evidence of Hunter&#x27;s signature on the laptop repair ticket, which matches the Paternity suit signature filed by Hunter&#x27;s baby mama in Arkansas last year. It&#x27;s the same RHB (Robert Hunter Biden) signature. I don&#x27;t know what to tell you. Look again.<p>The laptop had incriminating photos of Hunter smoking crack. Those photos were published. Where else would they have come from? Also, the dates on the emails match up with Secret Service travel logs from 2014: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theepochtimes.com&#x2F;secret-service-travel-logs-match-details-in-alleged-hunter-biden-emails_3546692.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theepochtimes.com&#x2F;secret-service-travel-logs-mat...</a><p>I&#x27;m convinced Biden is corrupt, because power corrupts. That&#x27;s an almost universal law of human nature. And Biden had power for 47 years. You cannot be a part of that scene for that long without corruption rubbing off on you. After a while, you start to think you&#x27;re invincible. Especially if the media covers for you. Conservatives don&#x27;t have that benefit. They&#x27;re always under far more scrutiny than liberals, because over 90% of journalists are liberal and they don&#x27;t cover Democrats the same way. They spent 3 years on a fake Russian scandal against Trump. Spent $50 million+ and wasted the nation&#x27;s time based on some DNC paid for propaganda hit piece by a washed up ex-MI6 agent. And the media spent 3 years breathlessly covering every &quot;bombshell&quot; report only to come up with nothing.<p>Again, there is signatures, emails, photos, and witnesses on the Biden story and you had a made up tabloid story that dominated news coverage on Trump for THREE YEARS.')
