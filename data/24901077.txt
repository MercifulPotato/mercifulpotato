It simply isn&#x27;t a great input method. It&#x27;s loud, it lacks privacy, and for short commands it takes way too long.<p>I think a lot of people are counting on speech to bring us into a sort of Star Trek future.<p>The real game changer for input is along the lines of what the neural lace is supposed to be. Cognitive input. Silent, fast, efficient. In many cases once the technology is mature people won&#x27;t even have to internally verbalize commands. Just look at a light and desire it to be dimmer.. it dims. &quot;typing&quot; at the speed of internalized though will also be amazing.<p>Every time I hear someone (including myself) tripping over &quot;OK Google&quot; I cringe.')
