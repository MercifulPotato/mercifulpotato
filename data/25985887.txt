Item(by='dataflow', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612158086, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25985812, text='I get that <i>legally</i> it&#x27;s different, but when ordinary people (like me) read &quot;Melvin exited these position&quot;, they take it to mean &quot;Melvin accepted the loss and gave up&quot;, which is in turn seen as implying &quot;they no longer hold said positions&quot;. If Melvin bought and re-shorted all their shares at a similar price, then to many, many people, that&#x27;s a legal distinction without a material difference. It&#x27;s not &quot;lying&quot; technically, but it&#x27;s pedantically misleading enough to be pretty darn close to lying for those of us asking the question. So when people question the veracity of the first statement, they&#x27;re really wondering about the others too.<p>Basically, my point is: if your rebuttal to the question of &quot;did they lie?&quot; is &quot;no, that&#x27;s preposterous, it would be a death sentence for the firm&quot;, then your answer might be correct <i>technically</i> as to the literal meaning of the question, but you&#x27;ve missed the spirit of what was being asked.')
