They <i>look</i> harder, but any parts with leads and 0805 or larger are just as possible in my experience to hand-assemble and I find SMD generally slightly faster. (All assuming a board with solder mask and the intention in board design was to allow hand-assembly, which if you’re using 0805s everywhere today, that’s probably your intent.)<p>That specific board would be easy to hand assemble by anyone who finds through-hole assembly easy.')
