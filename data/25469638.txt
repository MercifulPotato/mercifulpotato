The Xeon&#x27;s outlier latency on specjbb is superior until it hits its throughput limits. A lot of machines are bought on the basis of latency, not throughput.<p>Also you really have to grind your teeth to get past AnandTech&#x27;s habit of comparing, on a performance-per-dollar basis, just whatever CPU that happen to have laying around. The entire reason the Xeon Platinum costs $10000 is because it scales to 8 sockets, a level needed only by people who have backed themselves into a corner with Oracle or SAP and who now need a gigantic single host at any price. Anyone who was actually planning to build a 2-socket server would choose the Xeon Gold 6258R with the same core count, the same cache, higher clocks, and less than half the price. Suddenly when you make a comparison to a <i>comparable</i> product, you find that Intel has the cheapest product of the three, along with certain favorable performance aspects.')
