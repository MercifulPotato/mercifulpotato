My guess is that you&#x27;re not going to want them on your pizza cause they might just be toxic.  Will we only be replacing one kind of waste with another?<p>For plastics the answer is out there, biodegradable plastic made from corn.  It has to overcome two problems:<p>1. It&#x27;s slightly more expensive<p>2. If we want it to degrade rapidly we need to make an investment in plants to do it.  Otherwise you&#x27;re looking at 100 years versus 300+ years for regular plastic.')
