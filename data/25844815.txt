FM2 &quot;race&quot; intercooled turbo w&#x2F;standalone ecu and alcohol injection, ohlins dfv coilovers and tubular swaybars, R1Rs on 15x9 6ULs, 12&quot; rotors w&#x2F;wilwood 4-pot calipers, torsen lsd, the list goes on.<p>But driving a manual in SF proper wasn&#x27;t really all that interesting compared to other CA gems like PCH, 9&#x2F;skyline, 36.<p>Surprisingly that particular car never got fucked with.  The mx-5s mentioned in my comment about petty crimes were mostly stock.  Dumb luck I guess...')
