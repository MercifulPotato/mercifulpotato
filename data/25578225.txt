So many, at least from my reckoning online, seem to assume complex AI is just a given and we&#x27;ll have it soon enough, but the reality is that these things are mostly puppets and the kinds of brains you need to come up with a clever song and dance on your own as opposed to having one carefully programmed into you is night and day. I think there&#x27;s a reason we don&#x27;t have mini, less capable, robots like these in our homes. We have the bodies, sorta, but we just don&#x27;t have the brains.<p>Dancing just isn&#x27;t impressive and like you say, seems a lot like a higher tech version of Disneyworld. What I want to see is one of these, on its own accord, run into a burning building and save a child. Choreography just isn&#x27;t impressive outside of the &#x27;wow&#x27; factor. Without advanced AI brains, these bodies are almost useless shells and I imagine Google getting out of this space may have had something to do with that.')
