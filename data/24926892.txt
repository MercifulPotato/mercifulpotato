What is the differential improvement a CoC can provide over a <i>good implementation</i> without a CoC? Code of conducts are not codifying anything mysterious or disputed that a good common sense judgement cannot arrive.<p>On the flip side, a CoCs can give <i>bad implementation</i>s a veneer of legitimacy. And whenever humans relinquish their best judgement to an inanimate piece of text written by enthusiastic people, bad things happen. It makes the way to say &quot;It is the policy&quot;, &quot;That&#x27;s what it writes there&quot;, &quot;I didn&#x27;t make the rules&quot; and get away with not taking responsibility for the complexity of adjudicating over human affairs.<p>Law is complicated enough that it took millennia of iterations to arrive its current form and we still have to employ tons of dedicated professionals to apply it while having a reasonable false positive rate. I can&#x27;t understand the hubris of the author or enforcer of a CoC thinking that they can possibly be just, fair and overall improve the state of things by making and using their own piece of text at the expense of good human judgement.')
