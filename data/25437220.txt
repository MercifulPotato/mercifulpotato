I wondered how feasible it would be to connect two Ataris through the Controller B port and implement some sort of dual-screen game.<p>Each port has something resembling 5 GPIO pins (direction UDLR and the button) and 2 analog pins that work like the IBM joystick adapter interface - reset the capacitor and wait until you get a 1 to measure the potentiometer resistance.  No interrupt connection, so it&#x27;s totally polled.<p>I wondered how effectively the 5 joystick pins could be used to implement a bit-banged RS-232 interface.  The Commodore 64 KERNAL did that over the user port, speeds up to 2400 baud.  From there maybe you can implement PPP but you are still talking about getting a minimal TCP&#x2F;IP stack on there.<p>Now ... you probably can&#x27;t drive the display at the same time.<p>And I&#x27;m sure the TCP&#x2F;IP implementation would be super limited and only one TCP connection possible at once.  Some caching reverse proxy would be needed.  And maybe even then only fixed length responses with little or no headers.  Could it be done in 4Kbytes of ROM?')
