I&#x27;m skeptical about the idea that simply having the SDV technology somehow also translates to being in a leadership position in terms of regulation, customer support, branding&#x2F;marketing&#x2F;being-installed-on-peoples-phones, etc etc.<p>Uber already had to fight uphill regarding regulation in many places so it definitely has some moat now (see, e.g. Uber and Ola in London). Waymo is on completely uncharted territory, regulation-wise.<p>I&#x27;m also curious about how the economics and logistics will play out. One criticism of existing ride sharing is not accounting for vehicle depreciation and wear and tear (and this on mass produced vehicles). Waymo vehicles have a lot more expensive technology on board, so I&#x27;m curious how that balances out in terms of lidar&#x2F;etc shelf-life + specialized tech inspections vs ROI.<p>Also, cost of switching goes both ways. If this forces the hand of the other players to roll out SDV (via Cruise partnerships for example), Waymo doesn&#x27;t necessarily stand to dominate the market, since it&#x27;s already so crowded w&#x2F; well-funded&#x2F;well-positioned players from all sorts of directions.')
