The typically &#x27;hello world&#x27; program in eg Java teaches you more about the lingo of Java than about solving the problem of putting &#x27;hello world&#x27; on the screen.<p>(Of course, there are still plenty of bad reasons to describe simple things in complex lingo.  But the above is one good reason.)')
