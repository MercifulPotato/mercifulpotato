Odds are that there was <i>something</i>, and you have every reason to state otherwise. You&#x27;re really focused on the URL, but a whole domain will be tagged when random queries are met with content dispositions with malware, which can be automatically flagged by the search engine.<p>As an aside, your commentary about Google alerting to phishing emails seems like you&#x27;re misunderstanding and trying to use this to further your &quot;it&#x27;s all random!&quot; claims. They aren&#x27;t flagging it because of the sender, but instead because the contents included a URL on the blacklist. Google re-scans and when they find URLs that are now blacklisted, they warn about Phishing. This isn&#x27;t new and they&#x27;ve done it for years, and it seems pretty obvious and logical.<p>e.g. &quot;That email you got a while back that claimed it&#x27;s from the Netflix billing problem website is actually phishing. If you gave them details, that&#x27;s a problem&quot;.<p>&quot;Protecting end users from nothing at all (like I said, there is no offending URL) is not more important than making sure Google doesn&#x27;t literally gatekeep the entire Internet&quot;<p>This system protects countless people from malware and phishing daily. I have no reason to believe your particular claims about this (though I&#x27;m skeptical given that you are blocking details that would allow others -- such as Google -- to repudiate your claims. Why block the subdomain? If it hosts static resources, what&#x27;s the concern?).')
