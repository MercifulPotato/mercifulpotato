I can&#x27;t remember where, but a while ago I saw an interview with some guy who did pretty much that: he opened a studio but instead of calling it yoga he came up with some &#x27;cool&#x27; name like &#x27;RX+fitness&#x27; or whatever (you get the idea) and marketed to &#x27;tough guys&#x27;. He even said in the interview it was mostly yoga with some cardio, but that the whole ambiance was designed to make males feel secure doing it. He was making a killing.')
