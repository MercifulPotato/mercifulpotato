That won&#x27;t happen because there&#x27;s no market drive for it. There&#x27;s no company with a huge budget trying to develop a consumer-tailored Linux-based OS: the other two companies that develop consumer OSs do it just to sell additional hardware (Apple) or services (Microsoft). And expecting a community of people, each with their own interests, to just work for a goal that&#x27;s not their own is but a fool&#x27;s dream.')
