I don&#x27;t think I will ever use a service which keeps the data on their servers, no matter how privacy preserving it is. Real-time location data is just too valuable.<p>That being said, I might consider using a self-hosted version of your software, but then I would only pay maybe 1 to 2$ a month maximum for it. But my use case is mostly location history, not real-time sharing, so it doesn&#x27;t really match yet.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;owntracks&#x2F;recorder" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;owntracks&#x2F;recorder</a>')
