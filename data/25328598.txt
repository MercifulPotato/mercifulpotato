The idea is to invert the web, which is inherently public, and you get an experience that’s inherently private. With privacy you can do things that aren’t possible or healthy on the public web.<p>It works out of the box if both end points are IPv6 but IPv4 will require some additional service support to work outside of private networks, due to NAT.<p>The application is currently just a file sharing tool but soon it will have a text message component. It’s about to achieve fully distributed test automation in the browser, which is a necessary maintenance tool to test the application using user events and DOM navigation across multiple computers for distributed end-to-end tests. If I modify the architecture of the application to support loading and unloading of external components then the application becomes a micro operating system, but this requires many security considerations I have not explored.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;prettydiff&#x2F;share-file-systems" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;prettydiff&#x2F;share-file-systems</a><p>Please keep in mind this application is highly experimental.')
