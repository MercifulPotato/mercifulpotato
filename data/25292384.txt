So if something seemingly small snaps, then the strength of the rest of the cable is compromised. Each of the strands in the cable is rated for a specific amount of weight&#x2F;tension. I&#x27;m sure there was <i>some</i> tolerance&#x2F;over-engineering in the amount the cables could support, but as the individual strands started to pop, it was only a matter of time.<p>&gt;seems like it was pulled out of its base<p>That&#x27;s pretty much what happened. All of that weight on the cable pulled it away from its support structure on that tower. Gravity did the rest.')
