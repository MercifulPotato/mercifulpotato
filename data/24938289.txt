Like the parent comment said, I will sometimes allow ads to play through if I&#x27;m away from the remote expecting the actual content to continue after a 30 second interruption. When you suddenly have the &quot;channel&quot; changed on you from something like this it needs to stop. Hell, I can&#x27;t even listen to a full album in YT without a &quot;are you still here&quot; after 4 or 5 tracks. That &quot;are you still watching&quot; should come up multiple times in the ad by itself. Maybe the popup should be &quot;Are you still watching? Why?&quot;')
