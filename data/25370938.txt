I don&#x27;t like having so many eggs in one basket, but it really is by far the best streaming experience.  I gave GFN and Luna a fair shot.  I wanted to love Luna before it was even released.<p>All that said, sure it could be shut down.  But so could PS5, or XBOX.  Sure it&#x27;s probably less likely, but I&#x27;ve come to expect nothing is forever and to enjoy what&#x27;s here while it&#x27;s here.  And personally speaking, this is probably easier for me since the number of times I go back to play an old game is essentially zero.  I&#x27;d imagine most console folks are similar.')
