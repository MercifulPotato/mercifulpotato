If more people owe shares than there are shares for sale, you have a serious supply and demand problem depending on when those debts come due.  If shorts are significantly over 100% of float, then it would seem that they are still vulnerable to further squeezing.<p>Further shorting is completely possible - nothing stops shares continuing to be lent, but doing so just makes the likely supply shortfall worse.')
