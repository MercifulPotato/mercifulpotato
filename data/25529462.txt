There&#x27;s something elitist about this paper that I couldn&#x27;t quite put my finger on, and I think you got it. Perhaps obsessing too much about twitter polls and what constitutes &quot;stupidity&quot; is what chafed. When someone starts attempting to categories who is &quot;stupid&quot; (even though OP states &quot;people are not stupid&quot; at the end of the article), my BS detector starts going off. Especially when it is focused on minutia (parity of zero) and &quot;good enough&quot; knowledge (earth&#x2F;sun). The earth and sun orbit each other, but the focal point is inside the sun (and every atom in the universe orbits each other in an N-dimensional space), why is that dismissed as &quot;nitpicking&quot; by the author, but parity of zero is somehow an important indicator of stupidity? smh.')
