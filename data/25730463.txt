One thing I try to do to combat that is to &quot;commute to my bedroom office via the garage&quot; --&gt; I go for a short loop ride in the morning that replicates my commute length.<p>I find that it really helps my energy levels and mental state in the same way my commute used to.  Obviously, it takes a bit more discipline, but I actually look forward to it - a chance to check in on the neighborhood etc.<p>Another hint is it do something new on the route every day.  It has grown to be quite a mental challenge to figure out a street or alley (or way of hooking things up) that I haven&#x27;t taken before!')
