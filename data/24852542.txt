First, let&#x27;s create an &quot;innovation group&quot; whose job it is to innovate. They&#x27;ll have their own budget. See investors? We&#x27;re innovating!<p>Make sure the innovation group isn&#x27;t comprised of anyone with any experience or expertise in the industry vertical, or any other vertical for that matter. After all, we don&#x27;t want them tainted with experience! That may interfere with their innovation! They can&#x27;t be constrained by existing knowledge!<p>Create a plan for how the innovation group is going to innovate because, you know, we need to show the investors what&#x27;s being bought with their money. So, let&#x27;s look at the set of problems that have been bedeviling us and everyone else in our industry for years and lay them out on a roadmap! We&#x27;re going to solve all these problems!<p>What you end up with is a group comprised mostly of recent college grads having next to no experience and a group of older grifters who&#x27;ve decided to make a career out of &quot;innovation.&quot; Those poor college grads have no clue they&#x27;re being conned and that the grifters are blowing smoke up everyone&#x27;s ass until 3-4 years later when little to nothing has been &quot;innovated&quot; they&#x27;re all let go. The grifters know when to bail, those poor college grads don&#x27;t. The grifters move on to con somebody else, the college grads meanwhile struggle to find another job.<p>I&#x27;ve seen this play out several times at several different companies. You&#x27;d think people would catch on and it would stop but no one wants to admit they made a mistake. So the grifters con on.<p>This is all to say you can&#x27;t <i>plan</i> innovation, just like you can&#x27;t <i>plan</i> inspiration. You need to have a company culture where people can scratch their own itch and have time and resources with which to innovate if they so desire. It&#x27;s the same with science - you can&#x27;t <i>plan</i> discoveries and breakthroughs. You don&#x27;t know <i>a priori</i> where all the blind alleys are. Failure is useful - it communicates to others where not to look, but no one wants to admit the failures so they don&#x27;t tend to get published. Therefore we only want to put our money on what we&#x27;re reasonably sure will succeed, which is risk-averse and here we are. More and more money going in and fewer results coming out.<p>I feel like the 21st century is all about going through the motions and not caring about the actual results.')
