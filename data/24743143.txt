I ended up doing contract development work for a retail petroleum distributor about 15 years later.<p>A couple of these that I can think of:<p>- The temperatures in our underground storage tanks were very stable, varying only by a couple of degrees F irrespective of the air temperature.<p>- Fuel almost always arrives warmer than the underground temperature, so you see contraction of volume on your tank monitor as newly-dropped fuel cools.<p>- Gross volume is the amount dispensed into the distributor&#x27;s transport trucks. Net volume is the amount dropped into the Customer&#x27;s tank. Gross vs. Net and temperature adjustment factors are a place where distributors play around to eke out some margin. I wrote some code that took into account air temperature at the terminal (the &quot;rack&quot;) where trucks were filled, along with historical rack temperatures, to produce temperature-adjusted normalized costs. When you&#x27;re making fractions of a cent per gallon margin every little bit helps.')
