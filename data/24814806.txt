I don&#x27;t mean to pick on you personally—we all do this. But it&#x27;s certainly a thing.<p>I&#x27;m well aware that you&#x27;ve been posting here for 13 years. I think that&#x27;s great. Unfortunately your recent comments (say, this year at least) have been full of swipes at other users—not all of them (fortunately!), but enough that you&#x27;ve been doing it routinely. That&#x27;s just not cool. Would you please edit those out when you post?
