Under these democratically deliberated laws, Parler has as much freedom to use Twitter &amp; Facebook as you have freedom to do use my lawn. The principle still holds even if every neighbor in your neighborhood hates you and denies you access to their lawn; The scope &amp; scale of their lawn restriction is irrelevant because American society finds their freedom over their property to be more important than your freedom to use it.<p>There are things that the US government deems too important to restrict, but Facebook &amp; Twitter is well outside that category. That&#x27;s where American society has drawn the line, and it&#x27;s a line that I agree with as well.')
