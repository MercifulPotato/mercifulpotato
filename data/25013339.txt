Furthermore, ensure that if JavaScript is needed or used for something, that even if the script is disabled, documentation and&#x2F;or other relevant information is available (e.g. &quot;JavaScript is needed to use IRC&quot; isn&#x27;t helpful; instead, display the host name, port number, and channel name; another example is if something uses a API, ensure its documentation is available even if scripting is disabled).<p>Also ensure it works fine with Lynx; if it does, then it will probably work fine with others too, even if users change the settings. Specifically, it should work well without CSS.<p>Accessibility is important too; use ARIA, and use the HTML commands (e.g. &lt;H1&gt;, &lt;STRONG&gt;, &lt;TABLE&gt;, etc) properly, rather than misusing them.<p>It is also a good idea to make it fast. This is done by not including too many pictures, CSS, video, etc (you will rarely need any included in the document itself).<p>It would be possible to do much better, but the design of HTML gets in the way.')
