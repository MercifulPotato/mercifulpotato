I suspect this varies from org to org.<p>I&#x27;ve noticed a marked increase in meeting pre-amble:<p>- General checkins about how people are doing &#x2F; holding up (mostly a positive thing)<p>- Chitchat about the latest thing: new COVID restrictions, or a favorite restaurant closing, or &quot;I finally braved a haircut&quot;<p>- Fires<p>- The usual small chitchat about the weather, etc.<p>I&#x27;ve interpreted this as folks feeling desperate for connection. Connection they&#x27;d usually get by being in the office.<p>When I started typing this comment, I was trying to categorize the type of meeting where I&#x27;ve seen this happen, but it&#x27;s actually pretty universal, ranging from:<p>- Daily standups and other standing meetings with immediate team<p>- Broader planning discussions<p>- I&#x27;ve even seen this &quot;personal interest&quot; chatter from execs who are usually a bit more private.<p>At times, it&#x27;s nice to indulge in this. Over time, it&#x27;s had a negative impact on productivity. It&#x27;s hard to know how to react to it - on the one hand, it feels like people are in need, and this is their way of staying sane. On the flip side, there aren&#x27;t very many hours in a day.<p>Could be a company culture thing.')
