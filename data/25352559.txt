Touring is where much of his income comes from and he had recently “invested” in creating a new album and setting up a tour, but COVID wiped that all out putting him in a less-than-ideal financial situation.<p>I think that much like working at McDonalds or dealing drugs most people don’t make much - the financial rewards are fairly concentrated to a few individuals.')
