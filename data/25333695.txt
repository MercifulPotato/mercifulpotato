I&#x27;ve wasted way too much time because of this. Doing code archeology to understand why data persisted to database many years ago breaks some seemingly unrelated feature for a customer is definitely not my favourite part of the job. Working on a validator that someone was &quot;too busy to add&quot; in the first place is also not fun (and a waste of time - because original author could probably do this in matter of minutes; whereas someone fixing things post-factum need to reverse engineer what is going on; check whether some funny data wasn&#x27;t persisted already and potentially handle it).<p>To phrase my frustration in more constructive way: it&#x27;s always a good idea to put explicit constraints on what you accept (What characters are allowed in text-like id - only alphanum? Only ASCII? What happens with whitespace? How long can it be?). Otherwise it&#x27;s likely you will find some &quot;implicit&quot; constraint down the road; ie. other piece of code breaking down.')
