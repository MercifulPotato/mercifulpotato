She should stay home, and she&#x27;s curtailed a lot of other activities she used to participate in (like hanging out at the local cafe), but she personally draws the line at walking the dog.  It&#x27;s a calculated risk.  Our neighbor is sparsely populated, the streets are wide and there are lawns, people are good about walking in the street to pass her, we live near the ocean so there&#x27;s a constant breeze blowing in fresh clean air, and so on.<p>This guy is letting his mind play tricks on him and then using that to argue that quarantine isn&#x27;t important to prevent the spread of the global pandemic that is still killing people.')
