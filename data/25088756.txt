I&#x27;ve found that occasionally deliberately just letting it happen, initially just for a couple of minutes and building up to 10-15 minutes or so, has been extremely useful in gaining some kind of control over them rather than just being overwhelmed. I don&#x27;t know if something similar would be helpful with depression, but it may be worth considering.')
