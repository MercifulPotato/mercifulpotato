We used to have patches and CVS commit messages on code review groups and fork discussions seamlessly into dev groups. Mailing list email to NNTP gateways allowed ready collab with workers outside the group. Common NFS share allowed easy joint work without huge amount of code &amp; build duplication. And it was possible to just grep every message in the News spool.<p>This was much better than Slack + github + email + Confluence + Teams + file shares + SharePoint -- no one knows where anything is or which chat system a conversation was on. Searching Slack is a fool&#x27;s errand.<p>I attribute the failures of these systems to be their reliance on the pattern of centralised SQL+httpd+templated crud+js vs federated standardized exchange+text.<p>In modern web apps the client is embedded in the app by its very nature, and so the proprietary nature of each system makes community contribution impossible.')
