I was suddenly hospitalized for 4 days with pneumonia and &quot;something else.&quot;  About four months later, I got on a treadmill and couldn&#x27;t run for more than a minute.<p>Long story short, I was diagnosed with viral cardiomyopathy.  A virus basically comes in, fucks up your heart, then leaves.  Myocarditis was the method in my case.  They never ran a test to see what virus, because at that point, there wasn&#x27;t any reason to.  The damage was done.  My ejection fraction was at 15% (50-55% is normal).  I was given a defibrillator vest to shock me if I collapsed, and eventually I got a permanent implant.<p>In various conversations with cardiologists, they mentioned that it&#x27;s believed to be much more common than they once thought.  My primarily cardiologist said the week prior to me, she had a young, perfectly healthy male, in his early 20&#x27;s that had a very similar hospitalization event.  His was so bad they immediately put him on the transplant list.')
