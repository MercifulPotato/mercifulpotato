I believe the exact opposite is true.  Creation spurts from learning, so if you want to be creative it pays of to spend most of your time learning things that already exist.  In the context of programming, this means implementing algorithms for which several other implementations already exist.<p>Sportsmen spend nearly all of their time training, and just a tiny (but very focused) amount of time competing.  Likewise, scientists spend most of their time preparing experiments and reproducing results of others, and a tiny amount of time &quot;creating&quot;.  I do not believe that programmers can successfully escape this scheme.  The best programmers I know, spend an inordinate amount of time rewriting well known algorithms (and oftentimes, improving them with slight variations).')
