It&#x27;s difficult to discern, but too often the question of &quot;what are the social&#x2F;cultural issues preventing the community from moving forward, and how might those be addressed?&quot; gets dismissed because the people who get into community development have a messiah complex and can&#x27;t imagine how these poor victims they&#x27;re saving might have contributed to their own circumstances. When talking about communities of color the question is often dismissed as racist.  The result is superficial, overly-idealistic solutions that almost always fail.')
