Traditionally, the things you can easily accelerate automatically are algorithms you can write naturally in Fortran 77 (lots of arrays, no pointers), and that&#x27;s one limit on the applicability of these automatic tools. (Other limits that other posters have pointed out are compilation+place+route runtime, and reconfiguration time.)<p>They are claiming you can use malloc and make &quot;extensive&quot; use of pointers in C programs and still have them automatically compiled for the FPGA. That&#x27;s where details are needed and they are mostly missing.<p>I watched their 30 minute demo film. The speedups are impressive, and on the small example it&#x27;s impressive that it does the partitioning automatically. However, the program contains only a single call to malloc, and all pointers are derived from that address, so it doesn&#x27;t do much to convince us that it the memory model and alias analysis give you more flexibility than the F77 model.')
