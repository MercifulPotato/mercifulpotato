And then immediately did a hard brake because a woman was illegally crossing the road around a bend, covered by trees,<p>1.) If you cant see, you should not speed up.<p>2.) If you cant see, she cant see the crossroad either. Also, pedestrians dont are the ones with requirement to have driving license - drivers are the ones supposed to be in the know and in control.')
