It runs BSD&#x27;s and Linux distributions, it has no UEFI, and I can tinker with it to my hearts content. It&#x27;s great for writing and coding and everything else I do. If I want to play games, my son has several games consoles.<p>I recommend that you take a look at the Raspberry Pi and other single-board computers. They&#x27;re cheap too :-)')
