The rudder controls did invert: the pilot tries to turn slightly left, the plane turns right, so the pilot naturally tries turning harder left until the rudder is in the full right position, and they&#x27;re in an uncoordinated turn.  The wing on the inside of the turn starts to drop significantly or even stalls.  The plane is then sideways and in a dive, and on top of that, the rudder is all the way over in the direction that makes the dive steeper.  The planes quickly rolled over on their sides and went into steep dives.<p>My understanding is that a big break in the case came when a pilot figured out what was going on and successfully landed a plane with reversed rudder controls.')
