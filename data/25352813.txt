(It&#x27;s among many reasons game developers pretty much need to unionize to avoid mistreatment from management, because &quot;passion&quot; is always going to be a weakness in negotiation.)<p>[0] The call to &quot;passion&quot; tends to work the other direction too in that game developers are overwhelmingly young, fresh out of school, and the turnover ratio in the industry implies a huge turnover of skills and experience over time as well as consequent losses to institutional memory. There aren&#x27;t a lot of safe spaces in games to build skills and game companies have fewer incentives to retain skilled workers than a lot of the, for instance, &quot;dark matter&quot; enterprise uses of backend developers where the backend developer becomes an institutional knowledge bottleneck.')
