The democratic aspect of this feature, where anyone can say why something is false, and others can say whether they agree with that counter-claim, seems bound to fail. It elevates the opinions of random people for no reason. If you wanted to disagree with a tweet, there was already the reply feature for that.<p>Facts and truth require trust in the institutions that claim to present them, because we cannot verify everything ourselves. I&#x27;m not really sure you can &quot;crowdsource truth&quot; as Twitter seems to be attempting here. It will just be whatever the most people who saw that tweet thought, and people who disagree with the report will just use it as more fuel to victimize themselves, regardless of whatever is actually true.')
