You’re limited only by the size of your pot.<p>Additionally the ingredients tend to be inexpensive compared to “nicer” cuts. Similar to BBQ.<p>Not to mention the end result doesn’t have to be stews, etc. I like to braise brisket in a liquid of peppers and stock and then use the resulting liquid for salsa’s and shred the meat for tacos.')
