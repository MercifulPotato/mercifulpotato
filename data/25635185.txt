Pitch your candidates before they apply', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='Are you concerned about your job posting being treated like a Tinder profile on AngelList or Hacker News where you are evaluated on just a short profile and some descriptions? We observed that a lot of candidates move forward in the interview process without good due diligence – they don’t know much about your company, but they just want to get an offer first.<p>Most people want to hear directly from you, the founders, about the genesis and the mission of the company. So we built a platform where you can live pitch your company to experienced professionals seeking startup opportunities. After your pitch, genuinely interested participants will apply and stay more engaged.<p>Checkout https:&#x2F;&#x2F;streetcreds.co! and the product walkthrough video (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=a5VNIrWbxc4&amp;feature=youtu.be)<p>Also feel free to comment if you experience any hiring problems for your startup. Would love to talk to you :)')
