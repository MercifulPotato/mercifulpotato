Linux good because package manager!&quot;<p>Yes.<p>&gt; Microsoft offering a &quot;store&quot; (most software on it is free anyway) and allowing signed installers that won&#x27;t trigger warnings - also bad!<p>Yes, but ONLY because they require you to create a Microsoft  account. If you could use it without the account, then it would be fine.<p>Edit: I also tend to trust package maintainers for established distro&#x27;s more than I trust Microsoft&#x27;s QA. This is just me though so only partially relevant.<p>&gt; So which is it? And more importantly, how is this any way worse than the common practise in Linux to install 3rd party software via some variation of &quot;wget -O <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;some.totally.trustworthy.website&#x2F;install" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;some.totally.trustworthy.website&#x2F;install</a> | sudo bash&quot; that won&#x27;t show any warning whatsoever?<p>(Windows Store) is worse than (random.exe)||(wget -O some.stupid.site&#x2F;something.sh | sudo bash) is worse than (Proper package manager)')
