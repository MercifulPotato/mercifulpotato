Urban schools could be great places if we ended their stockhousing and controlling programs - but any school that did that would see a massive drop in graduation rate, from all the students who don&#x27;t value education and won&#x27;t show up unless compelled. If the cost of nice, non-controlling urban schools is a 30% graduation rate, is that a price anyone&#x27;s willing to pay?<p>(And that&#x27;s without touching the problem of actively violent, disruptive students, who would probably need to be expelled far sooner than they are to protect a non-controlling environment.)')
