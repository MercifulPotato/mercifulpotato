Item(by='rantwasp', descendants=None, kids=[24740678], score=None, time=1602349911, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24739994, text='yeah. what people don’t understand is that the return has to be processed when it comes back. in an ideal world anything like a GPS tracker would surely be discovered.<p>there are also several issue with how the return may go. amazon may tell you to just keep the item (if the cost of shipping + processing the return is higher that the actual product price &#x2F; margin on the item). they may decide that the item is in not good condition when it comes back. the packaging may be missing parts or damaged. i would guess that a lot of items don’t make it through the process.<p>also i would guess that because Amazon keeps existing and making a profit they have this baked into their business model. Also I would be shocked if the return rate is 30-40%. Again guessing, I would say it’s probably 1-2%. A lot of people buy shit they don’t need and keep it.<p>As far as “hacking the system” I think that they should have a system in place to track how many things you return (and if they were in good condition&#x2F;could be resold) and how much money they made on your purchases. If overall you’re a net negative I would not be surprised if your account got suspended&#x2F;banned. Why would they do business with you if you’re a bad actor?')
