Item(by='GekkePrutser', descendants=None, kids=[25576819], score=None, time=1609279742, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25572014, text='Yeah about this, I never &#x27;got&#x27; why Microsoft expected people to jump on Edge all of a sudden when they rebased it on Chromium.<p>Basically they admitted they can&#x27;t make a decent browser that people want, then they re-skin someone else&#x27;s work and suddenly expect us to want it more than the one they copied? How does that even make sense. Who would pick a mod kit over a real Ferrari.<p>Apart from people not caring about the engine, Microsoft has a very bad history in the browsing arena which is why I (and many others) don&#x27;t trust them anymore. I don&#x27;t want them to become big again in the browser market. We already know what happens then: years of stagnation, platform lock-in, no interest in security. And no, they haven&#x27;t changed their tune, the same is still happening with MS Office where they still own a de facto monopoly.<p>Of course what plays into this for me as well is that I don&#x27;t like Chrome either so I stay with Firefox anyway. But the pressure Microsoft are exerting at work to move everything to Edge is annoying.')
