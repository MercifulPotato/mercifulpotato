Item(by='pyb', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609766767, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25629801, text='Where we find out that extradition from the UK for political offences is actually largely permitted. \nSome protection from extradition remains, but it is very narrow. It only stands if the person is being prosecuted &quot;on the basis of their political opinions&quot; :<p>&quot;53. The EA 2003 created a new extradition regime, described in Norris as a “wide-ranging\nreform of the law” (§45). As the US points out, it is a prescriptive regime, setting out the\nsole statutory basis on which a court is obliged to deal with matters, and does so in a series\nof imperative steps the court must follow. These steps no longer include a consideration\nof the political character of an offence, and there is no opportunity, within the scheme of\nthe EA 2003, to raise this as an objection to extradition. The EA 2003 retained the bar to\nextradition where the request is made for the purpose of prosecuting the requested person\non the basis of their political opinions, pursuant to section 81 (the political opinion bar),\nbut removed the protection for offences which have the character of a political offence.&quot;')
