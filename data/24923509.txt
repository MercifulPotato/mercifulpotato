If you paid with your debit card over the phone, they wouldn&#x27;t even card you since the beer was already bought and paid for.<p>One time they did check, and my friend lied and said he didn&#x27;t have his ID with him. Then the delivery guy who was probably only a couple years older than us just asked to see his actual underage ID to prove he wasn&#x27;t a cop and handed us the beer anyway.')
