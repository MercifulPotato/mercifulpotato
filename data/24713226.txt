Union participation is still way higher here than in USA. Obviously right to work isn&#x27;t hurting union participation that much, or unions would be dead over here.<p>Banning right to work is just there to protect corrupt unions from members being able to leave a corrupt union on their own.<p>&gt; But if it&#x27;s members don&#x27;t want to be part of the union, then why is there a union. Part of that statement doesn&#x27;t jive with the other.<p>Because other members wanted to be a part of the union. If 70% wanted the union but 30% were forced to join then those 30% still didn&#x27;t want the union afterwards, it is that simple.')
