Democracy is not a new invention, it was theorized and implemented back in Athens in 5 BC. If it took 100 years to fall apart, it would already have fallen apart. A pure democracy doesn&#x27;t scale well and so requires some corrections to be implemented in the real world. If anything modern technology has accelerated the corrections required to sustain a government based on liberal democracy principles.<p>Also I&#x27;m not sure what makes you think that China is not ruled by mob mentality. I would argue that propaganda and censorship, which is the foundation of a communist government, is more likely to produce mobs. While classical communism might not have a strong opinion on information censorship, China&#x27;s modern communism is strongly for censoring speech as well as information.')
