Ask what is most essential for future you to know or remember about the topic once you’ve forgotten what you know now. So when you go to google the problem, you may end up landing back at your own blog.<p>There are other people probably similar enough to “future you” to also engage with what you write. But if they don’t appreciate it, then forget them, they’re not the primary audience anyway!<p>(And those that do engage will be the kind you want lasting relationships with. Which is a nice side benefit).<p>I’ve long learned deep engagement from a handful of people, or just future me, is far more meaningful than shallow engagement from many randos.')
