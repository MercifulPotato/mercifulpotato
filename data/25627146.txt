Item(by='seibelj', descendants=None, kids=[25627515], score=None, time=1609724827, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25627092, text='Tether has a very powerful place in the crypto ecosystem - it is the most widely used stablecoin. It was revealed in a court filing that it was not fully backed, it was like 70%, because governments seized some of the funds (according to Tether). This broke a fundamental promise Tether made - that all USDT was fully backed 1 for 1 with USD in bank accounts.<p>To remedy this, Tether now states USDT is backed 1 for 1 with cash and cash equivalents. For example, Tether released an &quot;IOU&quot; coin called UNUS SED LEO (LEO)[0] that trades at the amount of USD missing. Therefore Tether states it is now fully backed.<p>The veneer of sketchiness is actually preferable to a lot of crypto traders, who live in fear of various governments. This is why USDC is not as popular as USDT - many traders prefer a &quot;vaguely sketchy&quot; coin that is less likely to have their funds frozen by court order.<p>All that said, I worked at a company (Circle) that redeemed and minted billions of dollars of Tether back in 2017 &#x2F; 2018. Tether serves big trade desks and is extremely popular in Asia, while USDC has become more popular in DeFi and is bigger in the west. Tether is not a giant ponzi scheme - it really has assets, and huge desks regularly mint and redeem billions of dollars.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;coinmarketcap.com&#x2F;currencies&#x2F;unus-sed-leo&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;coinmarketcap.com&#x2F;currencies&#x2F;unus-sed-leo&#x2F;</a>')
