Item(by='crazygringo', descendants=None, kids=[24971437, 24971550], score=None, time=1604340168, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24965671, text='Sidenote, but I find this post <i>maddening</i> to understand, because the author seems to be using the word &quot;e-mail&quot; to mean both &quot;e-mail address&quot; and &quot;e-mail message&quot;, and then uses ambiguous pronouns to boot:<p>&gt; <i>In conclusion, if you only use emails for transactional emails, you might be able to only store hashed versions of them.</i><p>HUH?<p>The most obvious way to interpret this sentence is as storing hashed versions of transaction e-mail messages. Which makes no sense and isn&#x27;t what the author means, but wow this is some confusing writing.')
