Thanks for taking the time to read and respond.<p>&gt; The Figma example that&#x27;s given seems to completely undercut the &quot;Productivity vs Privacy&quot; argument. Figma didn&#x27;t discover those use cases by spying on users, they did it by talking with users and working WITH them. You know, using that whole consent thing?<p>Figma is a great example of non-obvious productivity gains being _discovered_. I believe building a multiplayer experience like Figma would be considerably more difficult if you would need to also keep everything e2e, managing multiple keys, etc. In that sense I think there might be some tension with privacy-preservation. The primary reason I mentioned Figma, though, was the discovery part. I could&#x27;ve made that more clear.<p>&gt; And you can be very interoperable and maintain privacy - but your users will need to choose to enable that interopability. Facebook can &quot;promote interopability&quot; by linking my Instagram and Facebook, or forcing me to use Facebook on Oculus and that is interopability - but it&#x27;s sort of by force and not in a way that is acting with my consent. On the other hand, my email I send with Protonmail is perfectly interoperable - I can email anyone and get email from anyone, import and export emails and use whatever client I want - as long as I choose to allow it to be by decrypting my emails.<p>You can be interoperable, but I see many scenarios where it&#x27;s not straight forward. For instance, you lose control over the preservation of privacy when your ProtonMail user forwards an email to his Gmail friend with an entire conversation in it, even though on a technical level you&#x27;re completely interoperable.')
