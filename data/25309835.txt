The error cases you didn&#x27;t think of, wouldn&#x27;t count in this metric of course, but they might still be missed.<p>Code coverage as a metric says as much as number of lines as a metric. Meaning nothing, it&#x27;s just a number. Aiming at any sort of code coverage metric misses to think about what to actually cover. 0 code with 0 tests has 100% code coverage, doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s actually a good program.')
