Also the recursor for local systems.<p>I received great help and had some fun chats on IRC in the beginning. PowerDNS has been a great part of my &quot;infrastructure&quot;. My only complaint is that packagers and other naming can&#x27;t choose between &#x27;powerdns&#x27; and &#x27;pdns&#x27; :)')
