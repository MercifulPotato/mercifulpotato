Do you want to proceed?” dialog. If OK, tries to open socket. Upon such request, OS will try to dial up on modem with PPP, which takes ~30s. PPP session disconnects after few minutes. Else abort. If browser is online in the first place, skip that dialog part.<p>- Was caching a thing? Did disks have room to hold cache?<p>Oh it was, there were rooms. Alas, 56kbps(7kB&#x2F;s) ideal means each pages are kilobytes to single megabyte large at most. ADSL connections at ~1Mbps(1&#x2F;8 MB&#x2F;s) means a 256kB page loads in 1 second on a fine day. Even a 200MB disk space holds 1024 of such ~200kB pages, and IE back in those days had a hidden attributes but ordinary folder deep down from C: that holds about that large random cache of files that it decided to hold.<p>Fuck I’m old now')
