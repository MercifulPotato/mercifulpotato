I need to read more Tocqueville before I really start espousing any diagnostic on the psyche of the US but...<p>This type of mindset is what occurs when someone searches for their identity and meaning then places that whole &#x27;life&#x27;s worth&#x27; in the form of businesses or enterprising endeavors.<p>It can be broadly characterized as externalizing one&#x27;s identity, which is painfully likely to fail or let you down in some way. In its most extreme forms, it&#x27;s really a mental disorder (bordering the wildly high-functioning creative schizophrenic) that the Startup Zeitgeist has hailed as &#x27;how to innovate&#x27; and find your &#x27;life&#x27;s work.&#x27; The disorders become evident once one sacrifices all of self at the alter of this &#x27;give a shit&#x27; goal - burn out is not the goal of human life.<p>I&#x27;ll say I&#x27;m recovering from this mindset and have a fonder appreciation for what it means to foster a community (be that business, HOA, religious group, friend group, etc) that allows you to have a &#x27;life&#x27;s work&#x27; that gives you resources to flourish in ways you never thought you could.')
