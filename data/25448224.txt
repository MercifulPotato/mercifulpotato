Item(by='chrisweekly', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608150891, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25446762, text='Thanks, quite right. (I realized same too late to edit my comment.)<p>FWIW I liked &quot;Zeit&quot; better than &quot;Vercel&quot; (shrug). But preferences aside, I was annoyed that the new redirects for &quot;now.sh&quot; URLs were -- uncharacteristically for a team famous for attention to detail -- mishandled, e.g. breaking a fantastic preso I&#x27;d bookmarked (which grauch used in his React Conf 2017 talks) and which I had cause to reference today in promoting NextJS with a client. It&#x27;s the only real &quot;footgun&quot; move I&#x27;ve seen them make. Here&#x27;s hoping it&#x27;s an anomaly!')
