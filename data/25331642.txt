Most code that I for example write will be tens, maybe hundreds; it&#x27;s mostly glue code between a database and REST api for a relatively low-traffic internal management application.<p>But it runs on a Linux machine which, for every HTTP request between the browser and my back-end, will run thousands of lines of code and iterations (I guess?). I really don&#x27;t mind if the code looks clever if it means it&#x27;s ten times faster than the readable code.<p>Besides, clever does not exclude clarity.')
