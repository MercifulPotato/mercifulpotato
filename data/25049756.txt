In practice it means people who don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re talking about (but can bullshit) get promoted more than people who earn $500k&#x2F;year understanding the subject, who can&#x27;t be bothered to dress their point up or engage in arguments because their time is valuable.<p>Case in point: I&#x27;ll give you good odds the person saying $3.7 million &quot;isn&#x27;t a lot&quot; is not on the ludicrous salary they&#x27;re citing. It&#x27;s a dumb sentiment.<p>More broadly when someone earning half a million says you&#x27;re wrong about their area of expertise, you should probably just listen. Deep understanding isn&#x27;t easy to explain, and most people with deep understanding won&#x27;t explain things laboriously.')
