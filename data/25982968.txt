To inspire and encourage developers to rely on Apple’s platforms to build apps that are exclusive to those platforms. Apple benefits promotionally from such exclusivity, and users benefit from apps that are crafted to take advantage of native platform features.<p>As a user of multiple operating systems it saddens me that exclusivity is seen as a benefit. Often only the platform owner truly benefits. Any marginal benefit to users is usually eclipsed and in the long run only reinforces centralization of power and markets.')
