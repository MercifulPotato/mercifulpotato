Item(by='eythian', descendants=None, kids=[25132791], score=None, time=1605609005, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25120708, text='It&#x27;s not really registering with the police, though they probably get access to the information. When you do it you go to the council building and register there (at least when I last did it several years ago), so it&#x27;s more like registering with the city. This means that things like local taxes and such go to you automatically. I do know a lot of people who aren&#x27;t registered where they live, because they&#x27;re illegally subletting or something so they&#x27;re registered at their parents&#x27; place or whatever. It&#x27;s pretty accepted that this is common.')
