Certain types of misinformation&#x2F;disinformation are already considered torts because they do cause harm, e.g. defamation&#x2F;slander&#x2F;libel. Continuing the metaphor, in the case of Youtube it appears that among other things they don&#x27;t want to host videos of people encouraging others to make prank 911 calls because it causes lawsuits, bad press and lost profits in addition to it being illegal in a lot of places.')
