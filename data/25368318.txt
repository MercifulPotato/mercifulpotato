But I worked as security at a federal government organization. I noticed doing daily tasks was taxing my workstation and saw it only had 2 gigs of ram. I talked to my colleagues and they mentioned they had been putting in requests every year for more ram and we get nothing. Later I attended a procurement meeting and saw the manager of the dev team screaming that his team couldn’t compile certain programs with 1 gig of ram and it was ridiculous he had been asking for more ram for 6 months and still nothing. So I then used my security access to run an enterprise host query to find the average ram of the machines + a vlookup() function to map user and department to machine. I saw the IT department had machines averaging 32 gigs of ram and even some machines with 64 gigs and one with 192 gigs. These were individual workstations and not some server. While everyone else was running anywhere from 1 to 4 gigs. To verify my suspicions, I then used my access to remotely run a script run for a month on every machine which would check every hour the % of RAM used and report back. Many of these IT machines were barely using 10%.\nSo I printed out the evidence of my findings and went to the following procurement meeting the next month and suggested we redistribute the RAM based on role function and need.\nThe meeting basically went south very quickly and abruptly ended with no outcome.\nSo next month when they suddenly laid off a team next to us, we just ripped the ram out of those computers and put them in ours before IT could come to collect them. \nSo I guess I am saying blame your IT team.')
