Item(by='csharptwdec19', descendants=None, kids=[25347735, 25347861], score=None, time=1607445677, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25347373, text='&gt; Seems weird that retailers are complaining over a $100 cost (very generous estimate) spread over 100+ packages<p>Some counterpoints:<p>- 100 as a cost for a truck run sounds like it could be a little low; you&#x27;ve got to load&#x2F;unload them, and I&#x27;m not certain what the drop-off process looks like if you have more than a couple packages. I know from experience, loading up a van full of 50 PCs and monitors, driving to a location, and unloading, then driving back is a 1-2ish hour job for two people. (And in that case, the Van was already owned.) Yes that&#x27;s a bit more of an &#x27;extreme&#x27; example but since Newegg was one of the impacted retailers it felt like a relevant example.<p>- Online retail&#x27;s &#x27;Race to the bottom&#x27; has eliminated for many industries the ability to buffer for cost shifts like this. By that I mean, 100$ over 100 packages would still be an extra dollar per package. But if you&#x27;re selling 5-10$ gloves, that 1$ may be cutting your profits in half.')
