The SAN&#x2F;NAS&#x2F;whatever it was was pretty slow, provisioning VMs was slow, and as much as we argued that we didn’t need redundancy for a lot of our VMs (they were semi-disposable), the IT department refused to give us a fast non-redundant machine.<p>And then one day the SAN blew up. Some kind of highly unlikely situation where more disks failed in a 24h period than it could handle, and we lost the entire array. Most of the stuff was available on tapes, but rebuilding the whole thing resulted in a significant period of downtime for everyone.<p>It ended up being a huge win for my team, since we had been in the process of setting up Ansible scripts to provision our whole system. We grabbed an old machine and had our stuff back up and running in about 20 minutes, while everyone else was manually reinstalling and reconfiguring their stuff for days.')
