Top reasons I <i>do</i> want people to say hello to me first over IM:<p>* Other people looking at my screen. Common when working out designs, in person or remote<p>* I&#x27;m presenting my screen publicly and might have forgotten to turn off notifications<p>* I might be busy and want you to email me instead so that I&#x27;ll get to your request on my own time<p>* I don&#x27;t want you to think that I got your message if I haven&#x27;t especially if it&#x27;s set to be deleted on some timer<p>That said I recognize that some people who don&#x27;t have these problems have a &quot;nohello&quot; preference.
