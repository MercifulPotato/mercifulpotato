None of my local grocery stores have chargers. The posh stores are too expensive for me to shop at continually - I can&#x27;t&#x2F;won&#x27;t afford to shop at whole foods for my normal food... but they have chargers.<p>Even if they were provided, I (and most others here) don&#x27;t park on the street - but in the lot attached to my apartment (built in the late 80&#x27;s). I&#x27;m also lucky I don&#x27;t pay for parking (or rather it&#x27;s part of my inexpensive rent).')
