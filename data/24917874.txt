What happens after a decade when some or all of the desktops are way out of date? Are the doctors diligent about patching them? All of the doctors?<p>Likely the situation they’ll end up in is a bunch of old computers running outdated software  that all ends up being a massive security threat. Let’s say in 2005 one of the doctors wanted to video chat with their kid, and the kid tells them to download teamviewer. Chances are, 15 years later in 2020, that 2005 version of teamviewer is still going to be on that computer. I know this because I work in a psychiatric research institute (though not in IT) and this kind of stuff happens all the time. It’s not everyone, but in this case the weakest link breaks the chain.')
