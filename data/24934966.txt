(Source: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;ErikWemple&#x2F;status&#x2F;1321896097099489283" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;ErikWemple&#x2F;status&#x2F;1321896097099489283</a>)<p>I&#x27;ve copied it below to the best of my ability.<p>===============<p>Glenn Greenwald&#x27;s decision to resign from The Intercept stems from a fundamental disagreement over the role of editors in the production of journalism and the nature of censorship. Glenn demands the absolute right to determine what he will publish. He believes that anyone who disagrees with him is corrupt, and anyone who presumes to edit his words is a censor. Thus the preposterous charge that The Intercept&#x27;s editors and reporters, with the lone noble exception of Glenn Greenwald, have betrayed our mission to engage in fearless investigative journalism because we have been seduced by the lure of a Joe Biden presidency. A brief glance at the stories The Intercept has published on Joe Biden will suffice to refute those claims.<p>The narrative he presents about his departure is teeming with distortions and inaccuracies - all of the mdesigned to make him appear a victim, rather than a grown person throwing a tantrum. It would take too long to point them all out here, but we intend to correct the record in time. For now, it is important to make clear that our goal in editing his work was to ensure that it would be accurate and fair. While he accuses us of political bias, it was he who was attempting to recycle a political campaign&#x27;s - the Trump campaign&#x27;s - dubious claims and launder them as journalism.<p>We have the greatest respect for the journalist Glenn Greenwald used to be, and we remain proud of much of the work we did with him over the past six years. It is Glenn who has strayed from his original journalistic roots, not The Intercept.<p>The defining feature of The Intercept&#x27;s work in recent years has been the investigative journalism that came out of painstaking work by our staffers in Washington D.C., New York, and across the rest of the country. It is the staff of The Intercept that has been carrying out our investigative mission - a mission that involved a collaborative editing process.<p>We have no doubt that Glenn will go on to launch a new media venture where he will face no collaboration with editors-- such is the era of Substack and Patreon. In that context, it makes good business sense for Glenn to position himself as the last true guardian of investigative journalism and to smear his longtime colleagues and friends as partisan hacks. We get it. But facts are facts and The Intercept record of fearless, rigorous, independent journalism speaks for itself.<p>===============')
