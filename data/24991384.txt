When I was in sixth grade, I dropped out of school. I wasn&#x27;t a dumb kid by any means, I dropped out of an expensive gifted and talented program. So my parents educated me for the next two years, and then I went back to high school and college and I was fine. You know what I missed from two years of &quot;education&quot;. NOTHING. My dad&#x27;s most important things were, you&#x27;re going to be good at writing and math. And when I actually went back to school I was so much better at that shit that I ended up teaching a class in 9th grade. (The teacher and sub were out that day and they were like, who knows these things, and everyone pointed at me)<p>I just think our current school system is vastly ineffective and borderline cruel. But it frees up everyone for 8 hours a day so fuck it!<p>And look nobody is denying the world used to be a way worse place. But if you look at the history of school systems, it was created by oil tycoons that were angry that the working class was a little too opinionated. This has all been normal for 100 years, but it doesn&#x27;t make it actually normal.')
