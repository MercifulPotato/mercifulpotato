Everybody gets $12,000&#x2F;year in both cases.</i><p>Does a negative income tax not tell that high earners pay money to the state, while low earners receive money from the state? If everyone receives money from the state, even if high earners have to pay it back at tax time, that does not meet the definition of negative income tax as I know it. That is UBI. A more concrete example would be useful.')
