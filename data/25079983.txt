Windows and most Linux desktop environments are years ahead of macOS in terms of managing window placement. It doesn’t feel like macOS has advanced much in that department since it’s initial release in 2000 yet Windows has snapping, easier tiling, less glitchy multi monitor support....and this is coming from someone who <i>hates</i> using Windows!<p>I really wish Apple would give their core OS a little TLC. These days Apple feels more like 90s&#x2F;00s Microsoft with the continuous chasing of shiny new things rather than fixing any of their existing tech.')
