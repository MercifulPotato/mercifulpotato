And I do have a fair amount of experience in a variety of areas.  I’ve made a lot of mistakes, and I do try to provide the value of my experience in helping others to avoid those same mistakes.  I do also value economy and effectiveness of communication, even though I also realize that I can tend to be very verbose.<p>I try very, very hard not to be the grumpy old man. But I have seen some stuff, and it’s a hard balancing act to maintain.<p>If I have been acting as the grumpy old man, then I would actually really appreciate someone telling me that, because that is not who I want to be.  And I do want to connect with younger engineers and developers.<p>I am actively interested in being a mentor to younger co-workers, and I find that they help me to become a better version of myself, through their questions and their perspective.  If nothing else, I have found that the only way to truly and deeply learn some subject is to try to teach it to someone else.<p>So, I would encourage you to talk to the guy.  Maybe he could become a mentor of yours and you could learn how to understand him better and communicate with him better, and he might appreciate that.<p>Or maybe not.  But you won’t know unless you try to talk to him.')
