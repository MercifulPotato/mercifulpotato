I always hear about the aggressive spam filters that these providers have which makes it hard to set up your own server. Not saying it&#x27;s not possible, but I am assuming it is somewhat difficult to set up and their is probably some maintenance that goes along with it. So much so that paying for a provider makes sense. As long as my subscription is the only revenue stream, I see no issue with using a &quot;cloud service&quot; to run email for my custom domain.<p>I&#x27;m willing to be the other services have similar situations where you might as well just pay someone to do it for you. $160 to not have to maintain a server room seems like a nice deal to me.')
