And while my moral compass does allow for a very small subset of ways to be rich that I don&#x27;t consider bad, as I grew up, I&#x27;ve learned this about innovation in tech: 90% of time it&#x27;s just marketing bullshit, plain and simple.<p>I&#x27;ve grown a cynical perception of the startup scene not because I hate innovation, or want to preserve status quo - it&#x27;s because I love innovation, but all I keep seeing is startups arbitraging whatever random potential gradient they can find on the market. For every true innovation like people shipping medical supplies via UAVs in developing countries, there&#x27;s many more startups that just try to suck on the sweet flow of adtech money, or to make cash arbitraging laws and social trust.<p>The way I feel about both entrepreneurship and corporations these days: we&#x27;ve refined the ways of making money down to science, but in the process, we&#x27;ve got self-referential. We&#x27;ve lost sight of the big picture: that all that activity is meant to do something useful in the real world. And what&#x27;s less hackery than self-serving innovation, where the actual thing being done is the free variable, and the only goal is to redirect the flow of dollars?')
