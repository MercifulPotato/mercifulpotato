You can have a light blinking in a few minutes on an arduino, but not much more without add components. A pi can obviously do tons of stuff without any additional hardware, but you have to boot a full OS to get there. A micro::bit gets you up &amp; running about as fast as an arduino but you can code more meaningful projects without any additional hardware.')
