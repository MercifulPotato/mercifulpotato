I&#x27;m sure there will be many other tools which can talk with Dropbox but not with my server.<p>- Collaboration: I bet that not so many people would install another client and remember a username, password, URL triplet to just work with me (e.g. academic research, side project, etc.). They&#x27;ll either force me to use other tool or things will just break down (just experienced a similar thing at work).<p>- Maintenance: OS, service, add-on updates, licenses, security, monitoring, etc. will be additional time consuming obligations.<p>- Pricing: If I use a VPS, excessive network traffic or resource usage will result in a price hike.<p>- Price&#x2F;Performance: You cannot beat the competition at the price&#x2F;performance ratio. I will pay more, spend more time and get less. Why bother?<p>- Environmental: In my case, self-hosting at home is impossible. I neither have the bandwidth, nor the space required to store another system and keep it quiet at the same time. Additional power bill and heat is not welcome, either.<p>These are just the issues coming from top of my head, and can be expanded further.')
