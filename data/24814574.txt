So, if your salary is $100K, then you would be taxed not at the 24% rate on the entire $100k, but rather in progressive steps:<p>e.g. for $100K\n10% on 9,875 (987.5)\n12% on $40,125 - $9,875 (i.e. 12% of 30,250 -&gt; 4,235)\n22% on $85,525 - $40,125 (i.e. 22% of 45,400 -&gt; 9,988)\n24% on $100,000 - $85,525 (e.e 24% of 14,475 -&gt; 3,474)<p>This example did not account for the standard deduction of $12,000.  So, your taxable income would be reduced by that amount.<p>so the tax you owe (without accounting for deductions) would be closer to $18,684.50).  This excludes FICA which is going to be an additional 7.65% on the example $100k as well as any state and local taxes.')
