How do I take my illegal gained cash and convert it into enough clean money to buy a house? And why can&#x27;t anti-money-laundering laws and agencies stop that?<p>&gt; The vast majority of money laundering is for victimless crimes, including the consensual adult sales of drugs, gambling, porn, and prostitution<p>There&#x27;s two things here. There is not believing that these crimes should be crimes- and in that, you and I likely agree. But the other thing is whether criminals should be allowed to make money for doing things that are against the law. And I don&#x27;t agree.<p>If you think the laws should be changed, vote for that, fight for that, protest for that. But don&#x27;t tell me that all criminals should be allowed to clean their money because <i>some</i> laws aren&#x27;t just.')
