I don&#x27;t buy the Russian authorities insistence that it&#x27;s an oil spill, I&#x27;ve worked many oil spills and see no sign, in the Kamchatka images i&#x27;ve accessed, of any oil pollution. I had already come to the conclusion that it must be chemical and the info shared on this site has hardened that view, you get a lot of pheonols in &quot;cides&quot; and often various forms&#x2F;types of hydrocarbons are involved in the &quot;carriers&quot; for cides. Like others on this site, I&#x27;d already fixed on the river and followed it&#x27;s course up into the highlands where I&#x27;d deduce, from the mapping of Siberian wildfires, that there&#x27;s been a lot of wildfire over recent years. This would generate major loss of tree cover, which in turn (in the evnt of heavy rainfall or snow melt) would lead to major erosion and infrastructure damage.. including the destruction of bunded or buried chemical waste repositories and subsequent leaks... would be great to know if any one&#x27;s doing autopsy on dead marine life or has attempted sampling and analysis on the water.')
