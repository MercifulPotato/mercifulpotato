These are sales contracts in which the price is paid for goods to be delivered at a later time.<p>&gt; The Prophet (ﷺ) came to Medina and the people used to pay in advance the price of dates to be delivered within two or three years. He said (to them), &quot;Whoever pays in advance the price of a thing to be delivered later should pay it for a specified measure at specified weight for a specified period.&quot;<p>Does that sale describe future contracts (without any other stipulations or clauses, e.g. no shorting, no leverage, etc.)?<p>Note that Islam places restrictions on certain sales. Currencies are to be traded hand by hand, on the spot. For example, it&#x27;s impermissible to purchase gold using a credit card because the settlement does not take place immediately. So things are a bit more nuanced there, as gold and currencies cannot be bought using Salam sales for example.')
