Most people only need one dishwasher, so as you soon as you buy a dishwasher from that company, you&#x27;re out of the dishwasher market. At that point, the company no longer will get revenue from you, so they might as well sell you a dishwasher that doesn&#x27;t last and breaks down. And yet, we see that some dishwashers are actually fairly functional and long-lasting. Why is this? It&#x27;s because (a) you might need another dishwasher in a few years, so it&#x27;s good to give you a good experience, (b) if you have a good experience you&#x27;ll recommend this dishwasher to other potential customers, (c) you might be the type of customer who buys many dishwashers in volume and this good experience will cause you to buy more here. All three mechanisms incentivize selling a quality dishwasher.<p>Similarly, a dating app that achieves good outcomes for its users may, in the short-term, deplete its pool of users. But in the long-term, those satisfied users may (a) come back, (b) tell others the app is good, or (c) continue using the app.')
