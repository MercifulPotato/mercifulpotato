If you’re a good engineer, why work for the government? The compensation is extremely poor compared to industry, especially in tech. The lazy&#x2F;incompetent people at the top have remained there because they’re too lazy&#x2F;incompetent to leave for much greener pastures. If you fired them, their replacements will be at least as bad (on average, there are some passionate and competent people), since now the pay is poor and evidently there isn’t even job security.<p>We’ve built a system where we refuse to pay public servants. We shouldn’t be surprised when a system designed to attract below average people leads to projects with below average results.')
