But if that is true, why not simply implement a library with functions equivalent to the individual rectangles, and replace the code with five function calls?<p>Instead, when doing anything nontrivial, we get pictures with thousand rectangles connected by arrows, for pretty much the same reason we previously had thousand lines of code. It&#x27;s because we want to implement functionality that is not trivially expressed by the provided primitives, duh.')
