My job mostly consisted of responding to support tickets that came into our system. Around 90% of these requests required me to initiate a remote desktop connection with the client. Never in a million years could I simply understand the problem that the user was experiencing by their explanation.<p>So why on earth are there so many systems in place that don&#x27;t offer a user-perspective view of the data? I&#x27;m not just scoping this problem to the world of IT - I&#x27;ve experienced this problem from both the support technician and end-user standpoint in sales, support, and education.')
