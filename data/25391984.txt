They pay more because they might be getting outbid by someone.<p>I don&#x27;t see the purpose of characterizing that as &quot;California exporting higher costs of living&quot;.<p>People with more money outbid people with less money all over the world all the time.  You can say &quot;Americans are exporting higher cost of living&quot; by purchasing avocados from Mexico, or factory capacity in China, etc. and depriving the locals who can&#x27;t afford to pay the same.<p>I&#x27;m sure the people in the poorer neighborhoods of Dallas and Austin are complaining about the richer neighborhoods exporting a higher cost of living.')
