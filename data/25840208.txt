Software eating itself. Big OSS will need to shift if their value is in providing licensed commercial versions.<p>This is like a new modern evolution of internet. Cloud, data, apps, etc all becoming utilities in a highly-automated&#x2F;converged platform.<p>For the platform providers, it looks like a new oracle lock-in era, but instead of dotcom boom for the rest, its a net-negative because developer jobs and integrators will find most of their work automated (not necessarily a bad thing, just, whats next?).<p>--- tangent ---<p>AI becoming a commodity should really open our eyes.
