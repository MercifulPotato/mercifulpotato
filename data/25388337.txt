My understanding is that the heading of each complaint is a summary, and the sections form a progression of supporting allegations.<p>For example if you read into the next complaint, 142 is strictly factual (which can still be rebutted, but probably won&#x27;t be), while 145&#x2F;149 argue <i>why</i> those (factual) actions were unlawful, in support of the complaint&#x27;s title (the rest are somewhere in the middle, or more handwavey). If you read 142-149, you come away seeing a coherent argument backing up the claim.<p>But for the previous complaint - it&#x27;s a claim the law was violated, a citation of the law, and then no supporting argument or evidence detailing how or why the law has been violated. I&#x27;m guessing it can be amended or argued verbally, but as it stands it&#x27;s an unsupported claim.')
