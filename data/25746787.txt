Item(by='oops', descendants=None, kids=[25746836], score=None, time=1610459291, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25743032, text='&gt; The SOC (system on chip) controller seems to be connected to the flip flop resets, which makes sense as the product powers on with the microphone enabled as default....<p>It sounds like you could press mute, walk away and it could reset unmuting itself in the process without you realizing.  You would need to constantly monitor that LED for assurance it is still muted. It’s not clear to me from the article how the SOC is connected to the flipflop reset. i.e. can the flipflop reset be initiated via software?<p>A mechanical switch that can’t so easily and unexpectedly lose its state would be preferable. There are probably good reasons they didn’t do that (aesthetics, cost, reliability?)')
