Item(by='gok', descendants=None, kids=[24703078], score=None, time=1602022235, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24702750, text='&gt; Canada, a country 1&#x2F;10th the size of the US, brings in 300,000 new immigrants each year. The US brings in 140,000.<p>I don&#x27;t know what definition of &quot;brings in&quot; you are using, but around 1.1 million people obtain permanent legal resident status per year in the US. By this metric your Canada numbers are about right (a bit low, around 340,000 in 2019).<p>Perhaps you&#x27;re looking at purely comparing Canada&#x27;s Temporary Foreign Worker Program with just H-1Bs? If so those numbers are still a bit off -- there were around 190,000 H-1Bs issued in 2019 -- but also that&#x27;s only a small sliver of all temporary foreign work visas issued in the US (there are again over a million per year).<p>Canada does admit many more immigrants per capita and generally has a much better immigration system but the numerical difference is not quite as huge as you say.')
