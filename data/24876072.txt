You go to YouTube, and you find a link, and you stick it in your unit tests.<p>The fact YouTube&#x27;s server replies is neither here nor there <i>in the eyes of the law</i> (ironically Youtube <i>does</i> actually return 402 &quot;payment required&quot; and 429 &quot;too many requests&quot; of they figure out what you&#x27;re doing)<p>You&#x27;re free to make whatever esoteric argument you want, but after realizing they did something as silly as put copyrighted videos in the unit tests, there&#x27;s not much of a leg to stand on.<p>Especially when there are literally dozens of YT downloader type projects of Github still up right now that didn&#x27;t do that...')
