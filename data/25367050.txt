People in abusive relationships often bounce from one abusive relationship to another, not to mention the potential trauma of a break up.<p>It&#x27;s hard for outsiders who have no insight in to the relationship to judge its worth.  Yeah, maybe this couple you speak of is homeless, but that doesn&#x27;t mean they&#x27;re not happy.  Not everything is about money, financial or material security.  And maybe there are things about their relationship that make it all worth while.
