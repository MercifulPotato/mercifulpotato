And then clicked on your nickname. Of course you would, people like you is people dang likes to please for whatever reason, maybe it&#x27;s a YC policy, I don&#x27;t know.<p>In reality many of us came here because of other programmers, not for dang or his shitty moderation, moderation was always an obstacle to discussions here, a censorship system where moderators invent fake excuses to shut down discussions of something. And it&#x27;s a miracle some of the programmers are still around after being constantly pushed out for ideological misalignment reasons by mods.')
