Looks interesting.<p>I found some of your comments a bit strange though... are you suggesting that any of those other tools host your secrets in plain text? I never used EnvKey, but what&#x27;s crazy about their desktop GUI?<p>I&#x27;m obviously biased, but for our own use, I created a small open-source wrapper called envwarden[0] that uses Bitwarden to manage our server secrets. I trust Bitwarden already with plenty sensitive stuff and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s not stored in plaintext anywhere. The GUIs aren&#x27;t crazy but rather simple. They have browser add-ons, mobile apps, desktop apps, plus CLI that envwarden interfaces with...<p>Not affiliated with Bitwarden in any way.
