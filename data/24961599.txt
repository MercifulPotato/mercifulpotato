There are millions if not billions of people using iPhones. There are millions of apps in the App store. If for example, Ubuntu made a phone that was handed out to billion+ people, I expect worse if not complete catastrophe.<p>Indeed. I do think that Linux based phones are definitely not there yet for the average user. I would feel confident setting up and using something on the PinePhone for myself, but would not trust millions&#x2F;billions of people to do so, with the current software options.<p>&gt; I know it is weird to say a closed door&#x27;s company is more trustworthy than an open one, I support out-in-open development of things like OpenSSH and cryptolibs; I just don&#x27;t see it in a relative sense. All other options IMO are worse. Pine64 and Ubuntu would sell out instantly if I had a few million dollars to throw at them.<p>Ubuntu for sure I agree with. I do still use an Ubuntu derivative, but only because System76 has shown themselves to be willing to make changes from base Ubuntu where necessary.<p>I&#x27;ve participated a small amount in the Pine64 community, and honestly get the sense that they are in the business to push for better&#x2F;more open hardware.<p>&gt; Instead of harping on the negatives, if Pine64 guys can get huge amounts of funding (and employ smart people), have bounties for security bugs, and can win my trust with custom silicon and hardware encryption, prove themselves to be against Ad-tech industry, put customer privacy first, etc; I am onboard!<p>Here&#x27;s hoping. I think it is a possibility, and quite likely the best possible outcome for consumer electronics.')
