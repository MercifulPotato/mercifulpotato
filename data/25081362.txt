My high-level functional programming etc etc is all there but I love emacs and (rather against my instincts) Visual Studio has some very nice features; for example not having to request a compile to get errors.    This can be a huge timesaver.    I therefore flip back and forwards between emacs and VS pretty freely. VS to get instant mistake-feedback and fix them, emacs to do most anything else.<p>You can be a maven for both, but I don&#x27;t think you can be a complete language expert for multiple languages.    Then again, perhaps you don&#x27;t have to be, just a solid grasp without knowing the dark corners is quite sufficient to get real work done.<p>Edit: emacs has omnisharp which provides some instant feedback and some refactoring, but it&#x27;s a lot better in VS.')
