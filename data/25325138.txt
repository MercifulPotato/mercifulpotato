I think we should make it a lot less risky to start businesses. You shouldn&#x27;t have to risk give up earning years or career building years, to say nothing of the financial burden of raising money (or competing with people who are able to raise money while you have to bootstrap instead). I think we should do this both generally, but also specifically for women, people of color, and other groups who are underrepresented in the universe of small business owners.<p>Overall I think it would actually be really cool if we could get to where we think we are, where I can essentially pick from a menu of career options based on a risk&#x2F;reward profile (OK not literally a menu but, yeah). But we&#x27;re pretty far away from that right now; very few people are making these decisions based on that kind of calculus.')
