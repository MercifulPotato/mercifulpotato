There&#x27;s a really good account of what followed here [3].<p>Essentially, the AMA engaged in a mass-marketing scheme to paint universal healthcare as part of a communist agenda and therefore un-American.<p>This advertising, coupled with the ironically-government-induced rise of employer-subsidized insurance, decimated what had been broad public support for universal healthcare.<p>So, yeah. There&#x27;s a pretty proximate alternate history where we&#x27;ve had universal healthcare since 1947.
