Or that there is some massive web that at every turn explains why it&#x27;s never the alt right&#x27;s fault? Remember the 75 year old that was pushed down by the police in Buffalo, NY and cracked his skull on the pavement? Well if you believe some, he was wearing a blood sac in his mouth and there was a little tube you can kinda see in the video that allowed him to squirt the blood out and make it look like he was hurt. Someone legitimately tried to argue this with me, in an in-person discussion. And let&#x27;s break it down:<p>1. Police officers that pushed him were either in on it, I guess with some ulterior motive to make themselves look bad, or were comically bad at showing any evidence or giving testimony that there was a blood sac.<p>2. The first responders that came didn&#x27;t notice the lack of wound or the fake blood, or were also all in on it.<p>3. The bystanders did the same as above.<p>4. The probably at least a dozen hospital staff that interacted with the man in the multiple days that followed when he stayed in the hospital all ignored the fact that we wasn&#x27;t actually hurt.<p>5. The hospital had him stay there for multiple days for no reason because, you know, our hospitals here are really awesome about letting people just stay if they aren&#x27;t sick&#x2F;hurt.<p>6. The multiple reporting crews that came to see him all failed to notice that he wasn&#x27;t hurt.<p>7. The entire video is a deep fake or filmed in a controlled environment and none of it was real.<p>How hard do you have to squint to believe that any of the above is possible? And that&#x27;s one story of thousands, each of which has an explanation as simple as &quot;crisis actors&quot; or &quot;antifa staged it&quot; or &quot;false flag&quot;.<p>And back to the original assertion, what about the woman whose daughter tipped off the FBI? What about the siblings? Does everyone have a conflict of interest and we should dismiss all these cases because of them <i>despite</i> the photo and video evidence we have?<p>Sort yourself out.<p>Edit: video of the 75 year old man in Buffalo.
