Surprised not to see this suggestion here.<p>I’ve been a C*O many times in my career. Now I’m a IC. I have a strong salary and the directors in the last few companies I worked suffered more, and had more volatile continuity in their positions. The ICs can stick around forever. Not sure why I’d want to go higher in the kind of orgs I’m doing well in now. Someday it’ll be different, but for now... no promotions, thank you.')
