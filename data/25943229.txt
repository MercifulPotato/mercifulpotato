That’s tiny especially if the internalizers have pulled out.<p>My guess is that the book is actually showing some gigantic spread where the lowest sell price with any size is tens of dollars off the highest buy orders. But that’s speculation on my part.<p>[edit] later: just saw a 70k lot clear at $375. Guessing that’s some stops getting hit and clearing that level. The price immediately jumped up over $410. All of this lends credence to my belief that the GME book is crazy one sided and hard to execute into.')
