Which is fine, it&#x27;s a legitimate position, to believe that you have knowledge that others don&#x27;t, and others should be protected from themselves.  And the Law can step in to enforce this protection.  You can apply that to stocks, &quot;gambling&quot;, drugs, sex, porn, hate speech, misinformation, and everything else.<p>And there are a number of countries that have that philosophy in legal form.  I&#x27;m glad to have a choice NOT to live in those countries and I suspect most on HN are similar.')
