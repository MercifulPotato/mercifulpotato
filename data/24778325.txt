If a show only has 2-4 seasons, that&#x27;s a selling point for me. Usually, around season 5, you can see the quality seriously drop as the writers have exhausted all their best ideas. Or else, new events must ever-escalate in intensity, and so the old seasons were sort of grounded and realistic, and the new seasons are zany adventures that don&#x27;t fit at all.')
