Consoles have been doing upscaling without it for years, and one has to assume they&#x27;re still going to be innovating on that front on RDNA 2.0 with the new generation, too.<p>The DLSS 2.0 mode where it&#x27;s used as a super-sampling replacement is kinda interesting, but realistically TXAA in most engines is also pretty solid. It seems like a fairly minor extra feature at the end of the day as a result... Cool, but not game changing at all.<p>EDIT: although AMD did make mention of something called &quot;super resolution&quot; as part of their fidelity fx suite which sounds like a DLSS competitor but there&#x27;s no real details. And of course the actual image results here are far more important')
