I don&#x27;t think 3 companies should control half the internet content (I&#x27;m sure my measurements are way off).<p>I just see it as inconvenient. Firefox has been well known to underperform Chrome in many areas. The GUI feels dated and clunky. Something about the experience feels very obviously backed by only software political activists, developers, and people who simply haven&#x27;t moved to Chrome.<p>I also don&#x27;t see how using Chromium based browser distros is non-Google. I thought part of the problem was that even with those browsers, Google can still blacklist sites it chooses to.')
