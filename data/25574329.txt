(Well, unless they were violent to begin with and lost a game of pong, and were prone to violence when they lost various games!  But those people are the exception, not the rule! &lt;g&gt;)<p>You see, that video games cause violence<p><i>was a lie back then</i>,<p>and<p><i>it&#x27;s still a lie today</i>! &lt;g&gt;')
