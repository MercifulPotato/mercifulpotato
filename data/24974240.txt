Item(by='kcolford', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604356135, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24972509, text='&gt; Canadian federal governments are generally comprised of whichever party received the largest share of votes nationally. This is not always the case in the US.<p>I&#x27;m going to disagree with you on this. In Canada, the general votes usually result in 1&#x2F;3-1&#x2F;3-1&#x2F;3 split between the Conservatives, Liberals, and NDP. It&#x27;s our first past the post system for MPs that results in the uneven split at the final tally. The only reason that the system hasn&#x27;t succumbed to gerrymandering as badly as elsewhere is that district changes must be prompted by a change in the number of provincial seats from the census. The changes themselves are proposed by an unelected third-party with members chosen by the judiciary of the province and the speaker of the house (who is chosen by the MPs through a secret ballot vote). Otherwise, it would be all too easy to gerrymander an election in Canada and end up in the same situation as the US.')
