Usually they are non-technical, anything from Michael Mauboussin to the Secret Life of Groceries.  I would appreciate a simple &quot;coreHN &#x2F; not-coreHN&quot; switch.  (CoreHN would be books about startups, technologies, etc.  I prefer the diverse topics, which are often buried in HN).<p>Also curious - are you parsing comments to identify books, or just submissions?')
