The law gives employees much better chances to follow through, because it&#x27;s now up to the employer to prove that part time is economically unfeasible for the employer. Before, if you wanted to go from full-time to part-time it was much more about hoping that your boss was understanding and having to argue etc. (although women with children usually had very good chances and usually in Tarif-Vertr√§gen it is included that they can do part-time, so in big industries&#x2F;companies it was easy for women already, at least those with children). I think in the Netherlands part-time is even more common; I&#x27;ve read somewhere that 50% of the people do part time - and most of them (unlike in the US) do it because they want to (80% of women there work part-time; 20% of men work part-time, so as a whole 50% do).')
