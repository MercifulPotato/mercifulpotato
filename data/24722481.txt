It&#x27;s easy to look at Microsoft and say Ballmer dropped the ball on mobile, but then again they still don&#x27;t have a competitive product to iOS or Android and are doing well. Was Ballmer wrong&#x2F;right? Is Nadella wrong&#x2F;right? It was hard to say in 2007 and it&#x27;s still difficult to say in 2020.<p>The Audi example is only a good example in that management is listening to a group of employees who are advocating for a position in which the market is already trending (which also happens to have substantial environmental benefits). We wouldn&#x27;t applaud BP if they opted to do more drilling at the request of their oil rig workers.<p>For whatever reason, who ever was responsible for putting your manager in place trusts that person; you can appeal to your manager if you think they are making a bad decision or you can appeal to their manager that you think they are ill suited to their position. After that, you&#x27;ve exhausted your options at that company and aren&#x27;t owed anything further. I would strongly suggest to any job seekers that if having a seat at the table is important to you, assess that when you are interviewing. Find or start a company in which that is the culture.<p>Now I do have to caveat all this with that I am 30, no kids, and live in decently sized market for tech. I may be more cavalier with my &quot;if you don&#x27;t like it, then leave&quot; attitude. I find the ombudsman position interesting and was unaware of the history around it and HR. I will have to look into that more, thank you for the knowledge.')
