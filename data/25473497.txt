It&#x27;s hard to describe what it felt like back then, the promises that these techniques were making, how exciting it was and how differently software development practices have evolved. That&#x27;s what I love about writing software, even after 30 years in the trenches. There&#x27;s always something new to discover and then draw conclusions about how it&#x27;s different from what you thought 5 or 10 years before.<p>I don&#x27;t know if I would recommend these books today but they are undeniable classics.')
