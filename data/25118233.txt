There is no workaround.<p>When I reported the bug, it was labeled &quot;Working as intended,&quot; again with no communication from Google as to why this breaking change was made, or even confirmation that it was something that Google changed at all. We spent days trying to figure out why we could reproduce it in some databases but not others, including diving into the MySQL source code.<p>I don&#x27;t have experience with their Postgres product, but pushing breaking changes to a database with no notice or communication (either before or after doing it) simply isn&#x27;t acceptable.')
