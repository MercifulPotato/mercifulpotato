And, let&#x27;s be honest, smartphones don&#x27;t require repairs often, if at all. Most common issue is probably shattered screen and that is already replaceable everywhere.<p>&gt; <i>and people arenâ€™t really upgrading fridges or stowes because a new model is available.</i><p>Indeed, but they may replace an appliance (which already tend to be quite repairable) that is 5-10 years old and that has broken down because the cost of repairing it (parts plus labour) is in the same ball-park as the cost of a new one. Making appliances even more repairable won&#x27;t change that.')
