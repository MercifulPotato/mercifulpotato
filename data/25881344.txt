I got my copy in 1992.<p>Basically C++ARM as per language standard, on a 386SX running at 20 MHz, 2 MB but 640 KB was more than enough, right? :)<p>Our high school teacher giving us C classes with Turbo C 2.0 also had it around, so as it were back in those days, I eventually got a copy.<p>My gateway drug to programming until then were Turbo Pascal 6.0 and TASM, and C++ was in the same ballpark of features and culture for safer systems programming.<p>Never had any issues using it in such kind of PCs, including with my own bounds checked string and array classes, hardware that most modern MCUs can easily outperform.')
