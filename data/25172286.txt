Why are you giving them a pass?<p>&quot;Biden&#x27;s lead in each of the states being challenged are around a few thousand, and fraud that large is very hard to hide. So far Team Total Landscaping has failed 30+ legal challenges because they could only bring trivial bullshit before the judges, and the judges have mostly thrown their cases out.&quot;<p>This may be true, but it needs to be sorted out.  They are most likely buying time while they put together the much bigger case that ties everything together.<p>I personally found dead people that voted in Multiple states that received a ballot. This was based on SSN, address, name, and birthday.  If I could find a dozen of these people without much effort, I can&#x27;t imagine the amount of dead people that actually cast a ballot.  How does this even happen?  Isn&#x27;t anyone the least bit curious??<p>&quot;See above. Giuliani is apparently charging the campaign $20,000 a day [0] (ok he&#x27;s since issued a denial[1]) and he&#x27;s the one whispering to Trump that there was fraud. Well done Rudy you scumbag, you&#x27;re scamming the scammer. But I doubt you&#x27;ll ever see the money, but maybe you&#x27;ll be able to go to some nice dinners and pay with IOUs saying &quot;Yeah the Trump 2020 campaign owes me a million dollars, when they pay me, I&#x27;ll pay you, we good here?&quot;.<p>For $20,000 a day, I&#x27;d go on stage and scream quotes from My Cousin Vinny as well, aren&#x27;t we all just prostitutes.&quot;<p>Now you lost me.  You&#x27;re high on emotions, low on facts.')
