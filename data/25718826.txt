If you are willing to use the C ABI, then you can use a combination of that repr and annotations on your functions and produce a shared object in Rust with a stable ABI.<p>What people <i>usually</i> mean here is that Rust would have its own stable ABI, that you would get “for free,” without needing to do that work. (It’s never actually free of course... but that’s yet another detail that is usually papered over when people talk about this.)')
