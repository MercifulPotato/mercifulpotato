Without being technically precise:<p>This article is arguing against monopolization of commercial exploitation because more value is created when tools are available freely. Cool. I have to read this article in the context of Elastics recent license change, which seems to be in response to “monopolistic” practices by amazon. I don’t know if the word “monopoly” is exactly the right one, but they seem to be using their size and market share to snowball competitive advantage in a way that doesn’t necessarily add value for humanity. I’d rather Elastic hoover up the cloud money than Amazon, precisely because I think we’re better off with less centralized power.<p>So maybe my objection is that this article seems to me to be dogmatically asserting some principles, and goring it’s own ox, ie harming the thing that those principles are attempting to protect.<p>Admittedly this might be a misread&#x2F;ignorance on my part, and maybe I’m triggered by the tone of the article, which reads quite strident to me. An important discussion, though, and glad that devault wrote it.')
