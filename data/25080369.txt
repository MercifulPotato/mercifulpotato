It was developed in the open wrt HN, by a then HN regular.<p>My recollection is they started by doing their own crawling.<p>(I want to say the username was Weinberg?? But honestly can&#x27;t recall if that&#x27;s right.)<p>TBH it&#x27;s probably also the thought that Google started on, as principally we had manual indexes back then.<p>Again IIRC, DDG got along way with private indexing and then realised it didn&#x27;t really gain them much and they instead wanted to focus on being a Google competitor. They did that by focusing on instant answers as a distributing feature and by buying results to get closer to the coverage they needed.<p>Lucky for them Google made their search a lot worse so DDG&#x27;s quality caught up.')
