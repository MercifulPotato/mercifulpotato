I have been using my pmOS edition as my daily driver since the day i gott it.<p>&gt; Just curious if this phone is actually competitive with android devices in the same price class.<p>That depends on your needs. It is not going to have any of the proprietary app that are on Android. So, what works?<p>- Camera: stills only<p>- Phone calls: Yes. Sometimes calls don&#x27;t come through but it usualy works.<p>- Messaging: SMS works, unless you need MMS. If people send you group SMS or picture messages, these are MMS. MMS not only don&#x27;t work but disable the ability to receive SMS. The user must use command line tools to fix this.<p>- GPS works. However the default pmOS maps app only works with an active internet connection. Further it does not do navigation. You can get directions but you cannot do turn-by-turn navigation on the road. There is an app that works for this called PureMaps. It works as expected.<p>- Web browsing works great with desktop firefox even on mobile.<p>- Convergence. The phone advertises that you can plug in a monitor. This is technically true, however it only works while the phone is running from battery power. Further using the dock drains battery extremely quickly and is therefore only recommended on wallpower. So this is still a work in progress.<p>- Bluetooth. Bluetooth headphones work for music but not for phone calls.<p>If you have any questions, ask and i&#x27;ll try to answer. Whether its &quot;competitive&quot; with Android phones is opinion. For me, its way better and i am glad to have it.')
