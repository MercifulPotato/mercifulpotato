Item(by='didibus', descendants=None, kids=[25031172], score=None, time=1604875335, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25029205, text='&gt; After all, in a normal decade the majority political party changes at least once<p>Ya, but that&#x27;s because the majority of who votes changes over time, or changes who they vote for over time.<p>That means for any given elections, if you don&#x27;t vote, you&#x27;re voting for whoever the majority of voters will vote for.<p>This is still a clear choice in some sense. Just imagine a scenario, I&#x27;m going to order pizza and ask you what toppings you want, you say: &quot;I&#x27;ll have whatever you&#x27;ll have.&quot; This is you casting your support for my choice of toppings, even though you do not know what toppings you&#x27;re supporting. I can make it more complicated too, imagine there&#x27;s two other persons and you say: &quot;I&#x27;ll have whatever you three decide to have.&quot; Now you&#x27;re supporting whatever means me and the other two persons have for deciding, if that&#x27;s a majority&#x27;s vote, then that will be what you&#x27;re siding with.<p>So not voting is the act of siding with the winner of the vote, in the sense it isn&#x27;t a neutral position. Sure not voting does not actually require any physical action, like you don&#x27;t have to deregister yourself or anything, you could just stay still until it&#x27;s done. But it is an act in the sense of having it influence the outcome of the elections.<p>The only way to be neutral would be to vote, but pick at random the choice. That would still impact a given election, but over the aggregate of elections over time it should approximate neutrality.')
