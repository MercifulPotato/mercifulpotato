There&#x27;s probably a tradeoff at play here between &#x27;easy to input&#x27; and &#x27;easy to read&#x27;.<p>As nothing more than a random guess, I believe a lisp could be appropriate here. Highly flexible syntax means it&#x27;s easy to make a custom way to input code that works for a phone (you could imagine that touching a form makes a dialog appear or something like that. I&#x27;m terrible at UIs), and homoiconicity helps reconciling the input UI and code as it&#x27;s written.<p>Plus, lisps are fun! :)')
