Item(by='mam2', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604176976, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24954949, text='&gt; and he is quite obviously not talking about slapping in response being verbally abused, not at all.<p>Well maybe we have not seen the same video then. i quote:<p>&quot;Some women wont leave it alone. They want to have the last word and wheb you give them the last word their are not happy with it and they want to say it again. And they will try to get you into a provocative situation.&quot;<p>Its the litteral definition of gaslighting your partner. Its a litteral case of verbal abuse.<p>Sure he talks about women but only because the interviewer asks  about the provocative idea of &quot;slapping a women&quot;, but its the same situation with a guy in a bar that tries to provoke you and it gets physical..<p>If anyone is sexist here its the interviewer framing the situation as &quot;omg man slapping a woman&quot; to make him look bad, when its just &quot;person who is verbally abused slapping the abuser to make it stop&quot;.<p>Once again i wouldnt personally react like he advocated but he is kilometers away from a spousal abuser. If anything the video ends by saying he never had any trouble with his wife..')
