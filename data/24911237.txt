This must be the root cause, since it is unfathomable that a complex neurodegenerative disease could have complex causes. Now that we have identified [insert misfolded protein candidate here], we can finally create a mouse models with the protein broken, then fix the protein, and then announce a cure. &#x2F;s<p>Just so that this comment has something constructive in it - I&#x27;ll add that I think it&#x27;s important to understand that scientists are human and are also drawn by the allure of oversimple explanations for complex issues. For alzheimers, of the cause was a single protein or gene or something we already understand, we would have found it already. This isn&#x27;t some ultra rare disease where nobody is looking. Its hard to say &quot;I dont know,&quot; but that&#x27;s the truth. The answer to this is going to come out of some obscure basic research that doesn&#x27;t even seem obviously tied to neurology yet - and whatever team is working on it is going to have no idea how important their work is and is still going to get a great &quot;I told you so!&quot; moment out of it with regards to all the people asking them if their research has any practical purpose right now.')
