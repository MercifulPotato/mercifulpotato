Item(by='daftponk', descendants=None, kids=[25406444], score=None, time=1607865470, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25406086, text='&gt; <i>Hong Kong was coerced and forced into this &quot;nation&quot; (China is not a nation nor a nation-state) using false promises, threats and lies about ethnical and cultural similarity.</i><p>This statement is full of factual inaccuracies, and historically incorrect lies. No, HK was not &quot;coerced and forced&quot; to return to China, it returned because of a joint agreement between China and UK. Yes, China is a nation and nation state. No there was no false promises, threats nor lies. Everything was said in advance, in the Joint Declaration before 1997, and further elaborated in the Basic Law. Both of these documents you can read online in Chinese and English and see this is the case. The lack of knowledge about the legal basis of HK is one of the ways people are tricked into believing crazy stuff like in this comment. But it seems nobody is content to argue about the actual factual historical legal documents. They want to make up crazy ideologies and fight as if that&#x27;s true. No wonder there is so much nonsense about this issue.<p>The statement also invokes some crazy nonsense about Chinese &quot;ethnic and racial purity&quot;. China has quite a bit of diversity of ethnic groups, and southern Chinese from Pearl River Delta region, and HK and Macau look a bit different, and talk differently to peoples from the North, at least &quot;in general&quot;. But there are many regional dialects and customs in China, having such does not make HKers or Canton people more unique than, say, Sichuan or Shanghai people. But that has no relevance to the question of national borders. And these statements sounds scarily like they take the idea of racial purity as some sort of geographic organizing principle. Would sort of be like Bostonian Irish wanting to secede to create a racially pure enclave in the Hamptons.<p>It&#x27;s odd how backward this comment is...there is racism, and forcing and coercion in HK&#x27;s past, but from Brits who coerced China into giving up this region, using guns, in (what is literally called) &quot;The Unequal Treaty&quot; (of Nanking), and forced HKers to accept British rule, and often to work and live like slaves. Without any other info, these sorts of nonsense statements sound like guilty Brits trying to whitewash their colonial history with this ridiculous (and basically racist) claptrap, like in this comment. Even after 170+ years, are Westerns are still trying to meddle and tell Chinese people what is what? If that is so...it&#x27;s path-etic.<p>Surely the opposing arguments to the case laid out in the article are better than this? If you&#x27;re reading this please don&#x27;t embarrass yourself by being duped into supporting ahistorical (and frankly racist) nonsense like this. If you are opposed to HK and China shared trajectory, at least have the respect to think critically and thoughtfully about it, and have the courage to face the facts.')
