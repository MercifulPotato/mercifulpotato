Item(by='mastre_', descendants=None, kids=[25457893], score=None, time=1608225008, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25457152, text='&gt; I guess this article sums up why we&#x27;ve had a rather bad experience with stripe so far: the API constantly changes, and the documentation or even Googling for a solution seems to be more confusing than ever since most articles you&#x27;ll find are about some older API.<p>Just a note, one of the things they got right with their API is versioning.  Until you decide to upgrade to a newer version of their API, nothing changes for you, and you can test out compatibility in dev&#x2F;staging by simply specifying a flag on each API call (which is easy to do if they all go thru a central class that handles the Stripe API calls for your app).  Their changelog also takes a &quot;from -&gt; to&quot; flag which will show you the exact changes that are between the version you&#x27;re on and the latest (or any other).  All in all, for this specific part of it, I wish more places handled evolving APIs the way Stripe does.')
