My bad!<p>Meant to say that I didn’t get an update on fixes (nor did I expect &#x2F; need one). Great to hear you’re addressing some of the systemic issues though. Makes me feel good that using Stripe will get back to being  a joy to use.<p>And btw I know <i>you</i> care. The fact that you’re here anytime there’s a Stripe thread and that we engaged on Twitter shows that.  The hard part seems to be ensuring others in your org care the way you do as you scale.  Happy to see that still is the case at Stripe.')
