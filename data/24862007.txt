What does this actually improve besides just getting the badge number and reporting it? The data makes it so anyone can anonymously threaten law enforcement even if law enforcement was acting entirely within the law.<p>This place is turning into a reddit pigstie. People from around the country and world claiming to know the &quot;best way to enforce the law&quot; unilaterally. Every state has their own way of doing it. If a cop makes a mistake they&#x27;re fearing for their literal life because some social justice terrorist somewhere in the country, under a different set of laws, has it out for the officer and can go and threaten or firebomb their house or family (this isn&#x27;t a strawman).<p>I think this hatred is so misplaced on cops, it needs to be on the politicians who wrote the law not the ones enforcing the law. Did it occur to anyone that the politicians are the ones vilifying them, the same ones who wrote the laws that the cops use to enforce said laws?')
