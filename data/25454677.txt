Item(by='bryanrasmussen', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608205285, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25452056, text='&gt;The Umbrella Academy one of the characters dances to &quot;I Think We&#x27;re Alone Now&quot; by Tiffany. It is entirely superfluous. It&#x27;s not a new technique. I recently watched Love Actually for the first time and it had at least 3 of these types of scenes<p>The Umbrella Academy Tiffany scene was clever, because the characters although physically grown up are known as the Umbrella Academy children, they are in their childhood rooms and dancing alone, but together. So some character development involved in sort of underlining their estrangement from each other but given it is a love song also their love for each other. I could go on as there were several other clever touches in the scene.<p>The one I remember from Love Actually is the Pointer Sisters Jump, for my Love, which was not clever and sucked.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth I dislike both of these songs quite a bit.')
