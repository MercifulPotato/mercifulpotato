Keeping k8s and friends up to date is at least one full time job (ideally a half-pizza team).<p>This also heavily influenced our choice of OS away from ones that emphasized LTS package management and towards  more recent kernels with better BPF and kTLS support.<p>(We also intentionally used short-lived TLS certificates to prevent anyone from running a cluster longer than several months without updates. Worked great. There are workarounds of course but anyone aware of them is the kind of person who updates anyway.)')
