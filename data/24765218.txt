If you take a program and you don&#x27;t know anything about it and it has infinite amount of memory and you have to tell whether it executes or not, in general, it is not possible.<p>On the other hand knowing a little bit about the program already can make this statement not apply. As a simple example, restricting amount of memory makes it possible to construct a very simple algorithm to tell whether the program terminates or repeats ad infinitum, in finite time and resources.<p>Real life programs are even easier to work with. Consider a CPU that increments a separate register for every executed instruction and terminates when the register overflows. We can easily tell that every program running on that CPU has to terminate.<p>As you see, it is rather silly to use general mathematical properties of programs and apply them to real life programs without considering for how real life programs are different from mathematical concepts. Real life programs are not spherical cows in vacuum, they don&#x27;t have infinite time and memory to execute and the CPUs executing them are not perfect Turing machines.')
