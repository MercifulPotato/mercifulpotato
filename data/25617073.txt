You can focus your writing just on one point at a time, committing to them when you tweet, and you can stop anytime. If you&#x27;re struggling with writing longer form pieces a tweet thread is a great on-ramp to get the outline together, which you can later expand into a post.<p>As a conversation medium, it&#x27;s also nice to be able to focus conversation specifically on a particular point, rather than get jumbled together with a bunch of unrelated comments in the comments section at the end of a post.')
