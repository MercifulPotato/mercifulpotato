The solution to the update problem is relatively simple. It doesn&#x27;t do a search again on update. Instead everytime it encounters an update in what it knows, it just changes the data stored in memory. All it is doing is updating its learned representation. After this it still knows what the other obstacles are without having to do DFS or BFS again. If the solution was a graph, it just deleted a edge it still knows what all the other edges are. If it encounters another change it updates the state of the graph again.<p>With regards to Neural Networks, if they are given a reward function, which can be dynamically evaluated (in this case did I reach the end or not) they are pretty good at learning without feedback.')
