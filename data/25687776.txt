Facebook or WhatsApp changing its TOS is irritating but it is not &quot;extremely evil&quot; I just realised that this is the same <i>absolute</i> language that incited the violence we saw on Wednesday. If something is &quot;extremely evil&quot; then there are very few constraints short of the Geneva convention and probably not that you should be bound by in your response. The point is language matters and so enough with calling everything we disagree with &quot;evil&quot;.')
