Deplatforming disrupts the feedback bubbles that radicalize these people.<p>I&#x27;m not too sure about that. For people who are already radicalized and believe that there&#x27;s a conspiracy of some kind working against them, wouldn&#x27;t that just &quot;prove&quot; that there is such a conspiracy?<p>I agree that deplatforming will prevent future people from being radicalized, but what about the people who already are? The whole pizzagate incident shows that there are definitely people who believe all kinds of conspiracy theories, and are convinced enough to act on them.<p>I wonder what the solution for that is, though.')
