Zoom has had so many incidents at this point where the client would compromise endpoint security that the only reasonable approach is to consider any computer that has ever had the client installed to be infected.<p>Yes, there are precautions you can take to reduce the risk (burner VMs, and so on), but as a security professional you have a responsibility to lead by example.
