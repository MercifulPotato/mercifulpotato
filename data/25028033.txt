Item(by='trynewideas', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604862320, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25026220, text='HitFilm is a home-targeting package with some built-in effects and pro-targeting paid addons, and Resolve is a pro suite that happens to be mostly free and more intuitive than other pro suites. Resolve&#x27;s color grading is its highest-profile feature and built-in on the free version, where most of HitFilm&#x27;s color-grading features are gated behind paid add-ons or the Pro version.<p>If you find yourself eventually hitting a ceiling with HitFilm (and for family&#x2F;fun&#x2F;hobby videos, you probably won&#x27;t), try doing the same things in Resolve before paying for HitFilm. Otherwise, stick with whatever works for you.<p>Oh, and if you ever get into buying high-end cameras and gear? The other big selling point in Resolve that it&#x27;s made by Blackmagic and integrates deeply with their gear.')
