For example, I have 2 GB of RAM right now (maybe 3 GB if I now decide to replace my mainboard). But what if Pine64 decides to put go the Raspberry Pi route, and suddenly add an option with 8 GB? Maybe you could use an LTE-enabled SIM card to build a cheap remote environmental monitoring node based on the PinePhone, since it&#x27;s already got a camera, GPS, and the data link built in, and could access peripherals through the Convergence functionality. Who knows? Optional higher specs only extends the range of possibilities.')
