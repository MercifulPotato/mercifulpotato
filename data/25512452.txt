Segwit has failed to reach even 50% adoption after all these years, future protocol upgrades are a decade away, and the lightning network is a centralized mess. Small blockers hijacked the network via block stream and ruined bitcoins scalability at the behest of their $400 mil investors. &#x2F;r&#x2F;Bitcoin is one of the most censored subreddits, ironic for a centralized platform. All you have now after years of stagnation is digital scarcity. Meanwhile ETH has shipped phase 0 of 2.0, is already 50% faster on 1.0, and is not slowing down any time soon. Your smug “we can&#x2F;have done nothing wrong” attitude literally caused the BCH&#x2F;BSV forks and have done nothing but hold crypto back.')
