I like seeing new perspectives and sometimes learning things. Although these two articles are critical of other liberals, he still portrays a lot of liberal positions that are actually interesting when they&#x27;re not framed with some variety of &quot;conservatives are fascists bent on installing a dictator&quot;.<p>I saw a book recently that was something like a Marxist Feminist interpretation of history, and I actually was pretty interested in reading it even though I might not agree with any of it. (I had already picked out five books, so I didn&#x27;t buy it). I can read those academic-style books because they are more focused on theory and less on hatred of me. But I had to cancel my Time subscription because after a certain point I couldn&#x27;t hear any more attacks on my demographics. Every single issue there would be something about how Texans are racist or similar. Usually at least one hateful attack, but often multiple.<p>The point is that there are definitely people like me who don&#x27;t want to consume solely conservative material but are practically forced to due to the unending Two Minutes Hate-style propaganda in mainstream institutions. The conservative material shows bias, but at least it doesn&#x27;t have hatred woven into every sentence.')
