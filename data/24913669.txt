Our current political environment is an aberration historically.<p>Historically, an inability to work with the other side usually resulted in localized armed conflicts, or civil war.<p>This has been true up until the middle of 20th century, when the relative abundance that was brought on by intense exploitation of fossil fuels (and globalization as a result) pacified political interests, as they were now beholden to global corporatism, rather than the support of the local militia or the army.<p>Unfortunately for everyone involved, as we get off the fossil fuel needle, the political climate is only going to get worse, not better, unless we also manage to decouple prosperity from CO2 emissions at the same time.')
