The statistics you&#x27;re referencing categorize age as a proxy for some real-world vulnerabilities that vary in significance by age.  That is, worse outcomes due to Covid exposure tend to be more prevalent as age advances.<p>But that says absolutely zero about any single individual.  Each individual, regardless of age group, can have more or less susceptibility than their age group.  It is an _individual&#x27;s_ health and other risk factors that decide the outcome for that individual -- not their membership in an age category.  Therefore, each individual must decide their own risk tolerance and remediation plan.')
