Item(by='COGlory', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606078064, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25170885, text='This article was clearly written primarily by the climatologists and not the microbiologist who is mentioned in the author list. Or perhaps, they are being knowingly irresponsible to further an agenda.<p>The climate threat is sufficient on its own. We don&#x27;t need to dilute it&#x27;s seriousness by inventing threats such as ancient arctic viruses and microbes. I&#x27;m not advocating that we don&#x27;t study these phenomenon, or that some complex phenomena don&#x27;t have the potential to be globe altering, but this article is just fearmongering.<p>There is no arctic virus or microbe that is going to terrorize the world. There is no gene that will suddenly be distributed and wreak havoc on mammalian populations, like the article is clearly insinuating.<p>&gt;Permafrost thaw in Siberia led to a 2018 anthrax outbreak and the death of 200,000 reindeer and a child.<p>Anthrax is not going to sporulate around the globe from the Arctic. <i>Bacillus anthracis</i> already live everywhere in the globe and only sporulate when they are stressed. The reason the ones in the permafrost were dangerous is because they were stressed from the cold. However, the flip side is no one lives there, making it a complete isolated incident. Additionally, the reindeer were culled, not directly killed by the anthrax toxin.<p>&gt;Organisms that co-evolved within now-extinct ecosystems from the Cenozoic to the Pleistocene may also emerge and interact with our modern environment in entirely novel ways. A potential example, the emerging Orthopoxvirus species Alaskapox causing skin lesions, has appeared and disappeared in Alaska twice in the last five years.<p>&quot;Alaskapox&quot; is an orthopoxvirus. These are not novel. They are perhaps the most widespread mammalian virus. They evolve rapidly and species jump from time to time. 33% of known orthoxpoxviridae were discovered in the last detect The reported human cases are thought to be from squirrel contact, and not humam-to-human transmissible. To date, there is zero evidence that &quot;alaskapox&quot; is from arctic&#x2F;frozen origin. Exactly no evidence, despite overwhelming evidence that orthopoxviruses do evolve to new hosts and jump species. Additionally, there are dozens of emergent viruses around the world that are nowhere near the Arctic. An emergency virus near the Arctic is about as correlated to global warming as a baseball bat is correlated to deep sea diving.<p>&gt;it is challenging to assess risks accurately without improved Arctic microbial datasets. We should pay attention to both known unknowns, such as antibiotic-resistant bacteria,and unknown unknowns, including the potential risks from the resurrection of ancient and poorly described viral genomes from Arctic ice by synthetic biologists.<p>This is just totally irresponsible fearmongering for a few reasons:<p>1) Humans did not and still don&#x27;t live in these regions in any quantity. Which means no intact, infectious virion that targets humans is going to be found there, and even if it somehow was, it&#x27;s not going to escape there. This is not Wuhan, this is the Arctic. Again, novel viruses emerge frequently, and are inherently limited, frequently, by their environments. Marburg, Ebola, Hantavirus, MERS, are all substantially greater threats than anything found in the Arctic because they have coevolved with their hosts for millions more years. These old, otherwise extinct arctic virus we haven&#x27;t seen in eons (if ever)? They died out because they couldn&#x27;t keep up with their hosts, or because their hosts disappeared and there was nothing left they were capable of infecting. Either scenario results in: not a direct threat.<p>2) Genome transfer. What if somehow SARS-CoV 2 picks up some gene that somehow wipes us out? This is extremely unlikely to be bad. Most genes are absolutely ancient already. Those that didn&#x27;t make it, didn&#x27;t make it for a reason. All of the genes a virus needs are already out there in the virome, and they recombine all the time. That&#x27;s why next year&#x27;s flu is an infinitely greater threat than anything buried in arctic ice. Also, if the genes were that much of an advantage, they wouldn&#x27;t have extincted in the first place, OR they will be entirely incompatible with modern hosts.<p>3) There&#x27;s a limit to viral lethality. If the virus kills quickly, it won&#x27;t spread. This is why super lethal viruses tend to be endemic to areas, and their reservoir is usually hosts like bats where the virus is non-lethal. Super lethal viruses don&#x27;t spread well, and it&#x27;s why something like CoV or the flu are much scarier and kill many more people than ebola.')
