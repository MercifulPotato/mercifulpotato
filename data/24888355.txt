This is kind of missing the point. Because, that sort of reverse lookup can&#x27;t scale, and in a very large number of cases it won&#x27;t be. [Edge case: only person in a village or a post code].<p>By removing the directly identifiable info, the damage done in a breach would be less. Where as now, a single breach contains all the data that could identify a person and every person in that breach, without having to do any&#x2F;much reverse look up.<p>Now, the orgs that collect this data does not have a certification standard and verification that they have to obtain before going operational. Even a restaurant kitchen has that.<p>On that note, I&#x27;d say that there should be a severity grading for the data items. Even Eggs have a grading system. Our personal data is a tad more valuable.')
