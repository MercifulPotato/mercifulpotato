Why would it be any different for their hardware?</i><p>Because hardware and software are very different. The M1 is the next stage of Apple’s A series of SoCs—and they&#x27;ve shipped over 1.5 billion of those. I’d like to think all of the R &amp; D and real world experience Apple has learned since the A4 in 2010 has lead to where we are today with the M1.<p>If anything, this simplifies things quite a bit compared to using an Intel processor, a Radeon GPU (on recent Macs with discrete graphics), Intel’s EFI, etc. This transition has been in the works for several years and Apple knows they only get one shot a making a first impression; I&#x27;m pretty sure they wouldn&#x27;t be shipping if they weren&#x27;t ready. I’m not concerned in the least about buggy hardware. They just reported <i>the best Mac quarter in the history of the company</i>; it&#x27;s not there&#x27;s pressure to ship the new hotness because the current models aren&#x27;t selling [1].<p>The release version of Big Sur for Intel Macs is 11.0.1 and I&#x27;ve been running it for 2 days now. It&#x27;s been the smoothest macOS upgrade I&#x27;ve done in a long time—and I&#x27;ve done all of them, going back to Mac OS X Public Beta 20 years ago.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theverge.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;29&#x2F;21540815&#x2F;apple-q4-2020-earnings-mac-services-records" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theverge.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;29&#x2F;21540815&#x2F;apple-q4-2020-e...</a>')
