I am sure a lot of responses will be about the defence of the German motor industry, or oppositional to Musk&#x2F;Tesla as goals in themselves. Musk, and Bezos seem to have remarkably clear goals regarding collective bargaining, and they are highly oppositional.<p>I don&#x27;t think we (the wider we, the societal we) can afford to have their view succeed. Either they are legislated into the room, or they are forced into the room by collective labour action. If they wind up succeeding in watering down unionisation of the workforce, we will all be the net losers.<p>IT workers need to think about this: The status we hold as individuals on professional rates of pay, individual contracts, are propping up the assumptions Bezos and Musk bring to the table negotiating with warehouse and factory floor workforce.<p>I truly believe we need to show some solidarity. There is a lot at stake here.')
