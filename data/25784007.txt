DDG and Ecosia appear to be relying on Microsoft Advertising, but not sure how to join that, especially when the website has a very limited user-base. Perhaps requiring a paid subscription for the general-purpose search is the best option for now.<p>The initial plan is to launch different categories, such as Podcast, Food, News, Job, Shop, Flight, Code, Sport, etc. since this will allow us to provide superior search results compared to any general-purpose search engine.<p>So far we have implemented support for the categories Search, Math, Currency, as well as the recently launched Domain name finder (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ask.moe&#x2F;domain" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ask.moe&#x2F;domain</a>).<p>If anyone is interested in working together to obtain and maintain high quality data for these categories then feel free to reach out (but I’m quite busy these days so expect a slow reply) :)<p>I’m also working on a gaming&#x2F;esports website (but not ready for launch), as well as the occasional weekend projects.')
