Item(by='rektide', descendants=None, kids=[25005746], score=None, time=1604630292, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25002399, text='Kilo is easier to set up and integrates with the pattern of how I want to set up &amp; run all my systems. I get WireGuard mesh &quot;for free&quot; because I run Kubernetes, thanks to Kilo. Your alternatives have no appeal, all involve manual work that I don&#x27;t have to set up myself, because I am moving towards a better managed, better automated form of existence. Setting up little one off systems is an old dark terrible world.<p>Same thing with monitoring. Yes, I can and do use ansible to go set up systemd daemons on my workstations, to run local prometheus &amp; node-exporters. Today. But this is one of many things I have to go re-run every time I bring up a new node, new laptop. And if I change configuration, update my ansible scripts, then I have to go update all my nodes, go find each laptop, turn it on, re-run the script on it.<p>If I want to add another admin to help me operate these systems, a sibling, a lover, they would have to go dig through my scripts to understand what I&#x27;ve done and how I&#x27;ve set things up in my environment.<p>Kubernetes makes all of this not bad. It provides a centralized top down control of all my systems. If I had kubernetes, I add a node-exporter daemonset, and it&#x27;d be running, in a consistent fashion, on every node. If I need to change the configuration latter, I change the daemonset, and it changes on all my laptops, whenever they do boot up. Because it&#x27;s Kubernetes, there&#x27;s a practice, a standard way that other operators can see &amp; understand &amp; expect for how I have these concerns managed, it&#x27;s easy for them to see what daemonsets are running, easy for them to see how they are configured, it&#x27;ll all look bog standard to any operator.<p>Nothing stops me from running statsd or whatever. But doing so is a pain in the ass to manage and maintain, and I can not bloody wait to be free of such rubbish unmanaged DIY computer-hugging. I want a better way of operating my pool of resources.')
