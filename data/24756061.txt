Its HD line is five years old.  Its Alien isn&#x27;t available on Amazon, even from UI&#x27;s own &quot;Buy at Amazon&quot; link, which makes me wonder about it.  I read nothing but bad news on HN about Linksys, Netgear, and Cisco, but am keeping an open mind.  I can find almost no objective information about TP-Link.<p>Are there brands or models I&#x27;m overlooking?')
