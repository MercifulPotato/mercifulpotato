My coach (my cofounder&#x27;s too, and now some of our leadership team) doesn&#x27;t have particular expertise in founding or leading companies, but works with many founders, and she&#x27;s not technical, but the things I think I have found hardest to learn are mostly around people management and leadership, which I think are underrated skills that require serious development (actually, whether one is in a position of leadership or not). When I think of all the books I have bought or conferences to which I have been, in terms of impact on my effectiveness as a manager and leader, coaching is wayyyyyyyy out in front.<p>EDIT: actually not just as a leader &#x2F; manager, but in all areas of my life.')
