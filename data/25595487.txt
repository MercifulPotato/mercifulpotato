I wouldn’t want to commute from the Antelope Valley to Los Angeles every day due to the legendary traffic there.  However, if I work remotely, then the commute to Los Angeles becomes less of a problem.  There’s also the Metrolink train, which I took whenever I wanted to explore the LA area (I didn’t have a car at the time of my internship).')
