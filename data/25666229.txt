You would be reducing human contact to the absolute bare minimum.<p>Now suppose people were told they could go about their business if they just put on masks. Simple cloth masks. Not proper KN95 masks, because those are rationed. People would go about their business as usual, with their cloth masks somewhat covering their faces.<p>The stronger the message that &quot;masks work&quot;, the more human contact there is, there more infections there are. Humans have trouble processing mixed messages, they want to think in binaries, they want to believe things are going to be fine if they follow the rules.<p>I think the WHO had it right all along. They considered the all implications of mask usage, not just the physics of viral particles.')
