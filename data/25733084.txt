It&#x27;s tough to not go on a rant about the order of magnitude of violence, uncertainty, fear, etc. between what happened with the violent nuts at the capital and a coup.<p>Not to say that the safety and&#x2F;or lives of some political leaders weren&#x27;t at risk, but once you&#x27;ve huddled in a dark apartment while a true overthrow is in play, you&#x27;ll have no problem distinguishing between the two.')
