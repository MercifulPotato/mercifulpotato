Item(by='ardy42', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603001564, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24814977, text='&gt;&gt; Lies can be carefully crafted to exploit the way human brains work,<p>&gt; Well, sure. But the problem is the censors are also human. If crafty lies can deceive the average person, why do we believe that the authorities are any less immune?<p>&gt; I feel like so many times anti-libertarian arguments follow this formula. &quot;Regular people keep making this mistake. So let&#x27;s just have the government, helpfully stop them from making the mistake. Except of wait... the government is also made up of people who make mistakes.&quot; In other words, who watches the watchmen?<p>If you can&#x27;t design and build an iPhone from scratch, yourself, then why can Apple?  If you personally can&#x27;t write code that&#x27;s nearly bug-free, then how can NASA?<p>Institutions are made up of people that make the same mistakes as the rest of us, but they can also have institutional practices that compensate and correct those mistakes.  It&#x27;s never perfect, but it&#x27;s something an individual can&#x27;t really do.<p>Society needs institutions whose job is to figure out what the truth is, and information dissemination channels that filter out lies and disinformation.  Otherwise it&#x27;ll be blinded.  This work can&#x27;t be mainly put on the shoulders of each individual, because they just don&#x27;t have the bandwidth.<p>&gt; But when millions have access to open information, it&#x27;s virtually guaranteed that at least some non-neglible subset will figure out the truth.<p>That may not matter when the millions are robustly deceived by the lies.<p>The truth will probably win out, <i>in the end</i>, but the end might be one, ten, or a hundred years from now.  If we&#x27;re talking about election-influencing disinformation, that&#x27;s too little, too late.')
