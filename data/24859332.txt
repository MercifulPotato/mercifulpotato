For people like me, born after the seatbelt laws came into effect, wearing them is totally normalized, because they&#x27;ve always been around. I never felt like something was taken away from me.<p>I bet that kids born today will not consider wearing a mask when you&#x27;re sick to be this outrageous affront to freedom, since they&#x27;ll be used to it by the time they grow up.')
