I&#x27;m free to pay:<p>* My IT guy $200 per hour. If maintaining a technology takes a day a month -- which is wildly optimistic -- that&#x27;s $1600 per month<p>* The organization which developed the tool e.g. $50-$200 per month<p>* A random outsourcing organization $10-$50 per month<p>By making your software free software, I will still pay you, but I know that:<p>1. If you do decide to spike prices, I can go to the off-brand company or to my IT guy. You better provide better service than the off-brand at lower prices than my IT guy.<p>2. If you do go out of business, I can go to my IT guy.<p>It&#x27;s all about power dynamics. You don&#x27;t have the option to f- me, and by having taken away that option, you&#x27;ve made it more likely I&#x27;ll buy from you. It&#x27;s often just simple good business.<p>Oracle&#x27;s business model is largely about buying up companies with large locked-in entrenched bases, spiking prices while lowering costs, and milking cash cows as the cows gradually die. They did that to Java and a few others. Free software means I can&#x27;t get Oracled too badly.<p>Some companies take a middle ground by e.g using open APIs. For example, AWS has services which have better price&#x2F;performance than free software, but maintain compatibility. I&#x27;ll be more likely to use those than proprietary alternatives because if AWS decided to Oracle me, I can switch to the free software version. There are systems like git, where essential business value is free software, so I can move my code out and around if Microsoft decides to oracle me, but where there is a significant proprietary value-add.<p>Your value to customer goes up with:<p>100% free &gt; hybrid models &gt; proprietary<p>Your barriers to competitors go the other way.<p>This isn&#x27;t just signaling. It&#x27;s power dynamics. Companies send out false signals all the time. This is a hard barrier.<p>The right business model depends on your market and technology. I&#x27;ve mostly done free software, and that&#x27;s mostly a matter of choice -- I&#x27;ve picked businesses where 100% free makes business sense.')
