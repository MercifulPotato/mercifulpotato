Also, we lack the knowledge to be self-sustaining.<p>Why are pre-industrial cities not a good model, i.e. why didn&#x27;t pre-industrial cities provide the protection we have knowadays?<p>Exactly because we were able to leave out pre-industrial cities in times of turmoil. Since we cannot rely on our self-sufficiency to survive, we need to maintain infrastructure to keep us alive. Maintaining infrastructure is cheapest when the infrastructure is used by as many people as possible. Having a widely distributed population requiring well maintained, widely distributed infrastructure  will not be possible.')
