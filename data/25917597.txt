Item(by='corobo', descendants=None, kids=[25918269, 25918133], score=None, time=1611678068, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25915614, text='&gt; and any solution that tries to deal with those just ends up being equivalent to what already exists: Delete and repost.<p>I&#x27;d love this honestly. Even if it was just a delete and repost under the hood, generally I find I want an edit button just after posting and noticing all the typos.<p>As long as the interface interacted like an edit form rather than have me copy and then rebuild the tweet I&#x27;d be good to go.')
