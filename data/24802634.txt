Why do I like X and not Y? Why do some people like hot peppers and other people do not?<p>When we are children, we don&#x27;t have much innate fear. We don&#x27;t fear falling down too much, but we can learn to fear it if we get hurt. As a kid, you can learn how to fall down without getting hurt; your head isn&#x27;t so far off the ground, your bones are not brittle yet. As an adult if you fear falling down, you will almost certainly hurt yourself when you fall. If you didn&#x27;t go down that path as a kid, you may never take up skiing, or mountain biking, or other sports.')
