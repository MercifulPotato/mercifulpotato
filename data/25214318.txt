It&#x27;s not the product they are acquiring, it&#x27;s the business and more importantly their financials. Salesforce&#x27;s market cap is primarily driven by its ability to keep growth rates high. That&#x27;s hard to do for a 25 year old company with a mature product. The easiest way to prop your growth rate up is find a fast growing company with a somewhat related product and absorb their growth rate. Who better than slack growing in the 40% range with revenues that aren&#x27;t insignificant for Salesforce. The challenge with that strategy (apart from the awful customer experience of cobbling those products together) is that the next year you have to keep doing these large acquisitions to maintain that growth rate.')
