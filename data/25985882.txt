I was going to do the same but spoke to my father, he told me selling off at 18K does nothing but guarantee my losses. I decided to take his advice and am up 115K on the year.<p>I don&#x27;t think the gamestop story is over and just because these hedge funds are showing a loss right now, they still have the opportunity to milk that stock all the way down to zero, and they will.<p>What is really unfair (but good for me) is from my investments and house value increase, I have made more in one year doing nothing than I did the 1st 15 years of my post school employment.<p>I don&#x27;t know how a young person can make it in these late stages of capatlism let alone support a family, maybe that&#x27;s why there are so many riots.')
