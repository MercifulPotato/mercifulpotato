Think Like RH,Centos. Can be used as a VM os or for anything else.<p>MicroOS it&#x27;s a cloud OS linux, more like: CoreOS, RancherOS, AtomicOS. I think it&#x27;s a default choose for Kubernetes environments.<p>I&#x27;ve been using JeOS for k8s hosts of Rancher environments since RancherOS was deprecated and I&#x27;m glad that they finally released a cloud OS like MicroOS. In case of k8s upgrades, rollbacks and upgrades need to me minimised as much as possible. This OS allow to have all of that in a breeze since it&#x27;s all based on static images.')
