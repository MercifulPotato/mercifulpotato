Most departments don&#x27;t even use the &quot;teams&quot; part, all conversations happen 1:1 or in meetings.<p>I work in the IT dept, so technically we should be at the forefront of this, and yet I&#x27;m only in 2 channels and they&#x27;re both silent 360 days a year. every couple months someone will ask a question in one, no one will answer and that it&#x27;s until the next time.')
