There&#x27;s also no mention of &quot;root access&quot;, the paper is just about replaying audio-converted-to-light rather than having any kind of interactive &quot;root&quot; shell prompt. The only feedback to know whether the exploit succeeded would be sending commands (e.g. unlock a door), which the victim might notice.')
