This should be obvious if you consider things like dividends. There needs to be a fixed number of shares, each with a clear owner for that to work.<p>The reason it&#x27;s a bit more complicated in practice, is because historically the technology wasn&#x27;t there to do realtime gross settlement. So to limit the number of transactions that the central database had to handle, layers of delayed net settlement were set up instead.')
