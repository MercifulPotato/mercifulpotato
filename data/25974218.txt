That&#x27;s really, really good for the population it works for.  Of course, it can also cause psychosis.<p>As someone who nearly got murdered in their sleep by someone on one such ketamine-caused psychosis, I think that caution is warranted when prescribing it.  Waking up to take a knife away from a crying person is <i>not</i> something I would recommend to others.<p>I&#x27;ve heard that there are studies on a metabolite of ketamine that&#x27;s supposed to avoid the psycosis.  I really hope that works so we get something this powerful without the downside.')
