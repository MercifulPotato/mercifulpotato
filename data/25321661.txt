The skill of philosophizing, and of carrying on a discourse with other philosophers, is very different from the skill of bringing a novice up to speed. Not everyone who&#x27;s great at one is great at the other. There&#x27;s also value in what the grandparent post mentioned about establishing historical and biographical context before jumping into primary sources. It helps you understand what you&#x27;re reading and what the community thinks is important about it.<p>That said, I definitely agree that primary sources are valuable to read, and to appreciate as works of art in their own right. Yes Wikipedia can give you the big ideas, but it&#x27;s just not the same. But hitting Wikipedia first can give you context to get more out of the primary.<p>&gt; The concept of &quot;state of the art&quot; exists for engineering not art<p>I don&#x27;t understand this. Yes philosophy is not a linear progression of ideas, but the iterative process of people building on one another&#x27;s ideas is definitely present, as it is in music or mathematics or poetry. Philosophy responds to current events, to art, to science, and to itself.<p>To put it another way, it&#x27;s totally valid to ask &quot;what was up with philosophy in X decade&quot;. You can look at the ideas that were floating around, how they interacted with each other, how they built on the past and led to future ideas. As I see it, that&#x27;s the &quot;state of the art&quot;. It&#x27;s more a question of &quot;what were top minds in the field working on&quot;, or maybe &quot;what ideas were most influential&quot;, than anything else, but that&#x27;s true if you ask that question of technology too.<p>&gt; Smartphones or cars change messaging methods and habbits, not philosophy.<p>Philosophy (or philosophers) respond to what&#x27;s around them. The conversation around whether the brain is a computer, for example, is very different today (and probably more interesting to most people) than it would have been 200 years ago.')
