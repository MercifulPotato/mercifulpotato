It’s fair to say you haven’t heard it, or that it’s uncommon today, but if you use it, it’s not wrong. And people will understand you, even if you do get a sideways glance from some people. You <i>can</i> use “else” without “or”, if you like.<p>The article was fascinating, especially the historical examples from different programming languages, and I buy the plausibility of a German speaker using “else” this way... I work with German speakers and they do it all the time. From the small amount of German I know, it feels like there might be some parallel with “als”. Another common one they use that’s less common with English speakers is starting a sentence with “Means”, as opposed to “It means” or “That means”. It’s not incorrect, but it does sound different.<p>I just don’t think the German speaker explanation is the only possible one, because there absolutely is precedence for the English use of ‘else’ as a conjunction. Usage of ‘else’ with ‘or’ also makes some plausible sense here too...')
