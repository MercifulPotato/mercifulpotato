There&#x27;s statistical learning theory, but arguably that&#x27;s a fairly small subfield, if not a separate field completely. ML has largely been an engineering enterprise so far, but in my experience the interest in developing underlying theory has ramped up in recent years.<p>What we should be careful about is to not be too strict when defining &quot;science&quot;. In my view the goal of any scientific field is to <i>build understanding</i> that is useful for <i>predicting outcomes of experiments</i>. Now, this understanding could be defined mathematically, but it doesn&#x27;t <i>have</i> to be. Don&#x27;t see why building heuristics can&#x27;t be a part of this, <i>assuming such heuristics reliably predict outcomes of experiments</i>.')
