Reddit admins banning a sub and reddit mods banning a user is the exact same thing, it&#x27;s just moderation of a private forum.  Forcing private companies to publish pro-genocide speech, for example, is anti-freedom, not pro.  If we&#x27;re going to force reddit to publish pro-holocaust speech then all moderation everywhere must be banned as well, including on this very forum, to be consistent.  I for one think this forum benefits greatly from active moderation, however.')
