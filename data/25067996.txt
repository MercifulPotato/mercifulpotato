Item(by='Cloudef', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605172653, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25067946, text='&gt;Researchers and popular media use the early 1980s as starting birth years and the mid-1990s to early 2000s as ending birth years, with 1981 to 1996 a widely accepted defining range for the generation.<p>Seems so. The original post saying &quot;anyone in their 20s&quot; confused me. I&#x27;m not really familiar with all this generation and millennial talk. But it does annoy me when people shoehorn generations into certain behavioral patterns stripping out their individuality.')
