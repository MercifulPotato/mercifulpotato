If the courts discover that there is something of interest in the duration of time that the camera is encrypting, they can compel the officer to turn over her encryption key or face a contempt charge.<p>This would allow either side (prosecution or defendant) to bring an argument forward and to have a judge decide if there&#x27;s enough merit to warrant a decryption of the recording.')
