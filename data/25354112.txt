It saved me a lot of time once when it showed that it was backing up files that I didn&#x27;t care about. Now there is no option to view the log during installation.<p>I&#x27;ve been fortunate to never run into any failed updates (and I&#x27;ve done many) but as they remove features like this and 32 bit support, I&#x27;m looking at other options for my next machine.')
