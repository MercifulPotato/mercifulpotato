Item(by='humbledrone', descendants=None, kids=[25524084], score=None, time=1608769201, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25523456, text='&gt; theories are fact based<p>Yes, but theories are not &#x2F;themselves&#x2F; facts. A theory is just one way to explain the facts, and though a given theory may explain the given facts well, a new theory may come along which explains the facts even better, or new facts may come along that the existing theory cannot explain. In either case, it&#x27;s obvious that the theory is not itself a fact, because we may eventually have to discard it as inadequate.<p>I think that often the arrogance that people perceive in scientists (or at least in scientific reporting) is from the fact that the best known theory is described as a fact when it&#x27;s not. It&#x27;s just a model. Like any model of reality, all theories are wrong, but some are useful.<p>So I don&#x27;t find it helpful to keep beating the dead horse about how the technical scientific term &quot;theory&quot; differs from the colloquial version. I think a more helpful approach is to try to educate people on how to skeptically evaluate the usefulness of any kind of claim&#x2F;model&#x2F;hypothesis&#x2F;theory for themselves. Even if people understand the technical term &quot;theory,&quot; it still doesn&#x27;t matter unless they can evaluate a theory&#x27;s usefulness.')
