Github is filled with countless &#x27;mistakes&#x27; (issues&#x2F;pr&#x27;s) people made in the code they published. Should there be some kind of way to make issues private?<p>Before I was into open source I was always afraid to show my code to anyone because of the critique I could expect. But some coworkers helped me get the confidence I needed to go open source (within the company, not public internet). Being completely open about everything and accepting critique publicly really helped me grow as a developer to also be open to others. I wonder if I would have made the same transformation if I was only critiqued in private.')
