I bought a top-of-the-line 21&quot; Trinitron in 1999 and after 4.99 years of the 5-year warranty something stopped working inside it so I shipped it back to Sony and they couldn&#x27;t or didn&#x27;t want to fix it and they didn&#x27;t have any more to replace it so they shipped me a new 24&quot; GDM-FW900 for free, which gave me years of trouble-free service.

Having a quality RAMDAC and a quality cable of minimal length made a visible difference in the resulting picture.')
