I can&#x27;t explain how this is supposed to work to every single person I want to stay in contact with, and I don&#x27;t check social media much so I tend to miss these posts.<p>if I lost my facebook account, it wouldn&#x27;t be a huge issue. I&#x27;d be able to track everyone down on other platforms. if all social media were shut down, there are at least a couple people I&#x27;d never be able to contact again.')
