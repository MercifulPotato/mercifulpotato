I <i>know</i> &#x27;I don&#x27;t have to use them then I can just use the git subcommands&#x27;, but that&#x27;s not the point, it&#x27;s a big signal (&#x27;90% of the time the above commands will have you covered.&#x27;) about the motivation&#x2F;angle&#x2F;philosophy of the project that doesn&#x27;t match my attitude towards git at all.<p>Which is a shame, because the autocomplete stuff looks really nice.')
