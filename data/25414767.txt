I once found myself writing something that wasn&#x27;t performance critical in C++ due to a library I needed, and just minutes later I caught myself reading up on move semantics for maximum efficiency. I couldn&#x27;t help myself getting sucked in by the language culture!<p>Java&#x27;s culture, in my opinion, is one of abstractions. There&#x27;s little in the language to force you down that path, other than decades of it being the prevalent way Java is written, which bleeds into the standard library, core frameworks, and becomes the Java Way of Thinking.')
