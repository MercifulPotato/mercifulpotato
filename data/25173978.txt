Along pretty much every meaningful metric of human development, access to health care, access to good foods, access to education, the Ghanaian is probably better off. At the same time though, there are nations like Nicaragua, Mali and Cameroon. A poor American is absolutely better off than a middle class Cameroonian, or a middle class person from Mali.<p>So you&#x27;re right that the old mantra about a poor American being in the top 10% of the world is no longer true. Having made that concession, we should also recognize that the poor in the US are still much better off than the poor in a lot of other countries. That group of countries has just been shrinking over the past 30 years.<p>Our main societal concern should be, &quot;How do we reverse that trend?&quot; Because more and more of the middle class are joining the ranks of the poor, and though it&#x27;s only my opinion, I don&#x27;t think that will end well for us.')
