Even the site doesn&#x27;t have a dedicated features page but simply a carousel that highlights &quot;Links&quot;, &quot;Lists&quot; and &quot;Feeds&quot; with very little details, and apart from Feeds, the other two don&#x27;t seem very interesting or unusual.<p>Oh and lack of tabs is probably not a selling point for the vast majority of users. And no mention of whether it is open source.')
