It was novel for the FBI to use computers at the time to detect irregularities.<p>In the states that Trump is currently contesting, the GOP controls either the legislature or the legislature and the Governorship. The GOP isn&#x27;t going to let any precincts go unwatched in these states.<p>Fraud isn&#x27;t impossible, it&#x27;s just impossible at a scale to change an election outcome and get away with it, especially the presidential election.<p>One thing I find interesting is that one of the measures the GOP regularly calls for, voter IDs, wouldn&#x27;t have prevented the fraud that occurred in Chicago in 1982. Meanwhile, the sorts of measures that would&#x27;ve prevented that fraud (bi-partisan administration of the voting process) don&#x27;t suppress the vote.')
