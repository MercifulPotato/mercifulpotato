Even if it is a very popular website.<p>If they make bad decisions, then people can go to competitors; it&#x27;s as easy as typing in a different URL. That&#x27;s how the Internet--and open societies in general--are supposed to work.<p>What it looks like to me--someone who has been on the Internet since before the turn of the century--is that a more recent generation of people grew up with these very popular websites as part of their lives, and they came to believe that these very popular websites are somehow inherent to the Internet and to society in general.<p>They&#x27;re not. The Internet is more available to entrepreneurs, startups, and new ideas today than it was when Twitter and Facebook were started. They&#x27;re not too big to fail.')
