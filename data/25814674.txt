It’s really hard to quantify the risk here but my priors are that if you are a normal business that is not doing anything illegal then the risk is vanishingly small, and that GCP is not worse than AWS.<p>I think that building on a cloud platform (or other SaaS like an Oracle DB) and getting your license cost increased is a much bigger business risk.<p>Either way building your system to be easy to lift and shift to another provider (or on prem) has merit to hedge against these risks, but it also slows you down.')
