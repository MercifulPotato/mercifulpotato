We are getting rid of bloat, while letting companies use the same marketing &#x2F; customer success &#x2F; analytics &#x2F; whatever tools they love. We raised our seed round after finishing YC W20 and we&#x27;re now expanding our team while going live with first customers.<p>We are using Cloudflare Workers extensively, and the whole stack is JS based. We currently have two open roles - a senior full stack JavaScript developer that could lead a team, and a front-end developer well-experienced with Vue.<p>Check out &quot;What you will get?&quot; at the PDF above for more info about our offering.
