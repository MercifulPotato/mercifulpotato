Item(by='triceratops', descendants=None, kids=[24803487], score=None, time=1602871093, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24798931, text='&gt; ISPs have to follow common carrier laws.<p>Firstly, you&#x27;re wrong about that. This same FCC voted to <i>remove</i> ISPs from common carrier classification.<p>Also, what do you think common carrier means? It doesn&#x27;t mean &quot;completely unmoderated&quot; as you appear to believe. As I already demonstrated, even common carriers perform network-layer moderation, since they provide the network layer. Social media provides the application layer, so why shouldn&#x27;t they be allowed to perform moderation at the application layer?')
