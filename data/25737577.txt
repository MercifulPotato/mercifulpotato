Here&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve decided on:<p>Replace the US-24-250W PoE switch with an Aruba Networks S2500-24P (gigabit and PoE, 4x 10gig ports, quiet).<p>Replace the Cloud Key Gen 2 with BlueIris for camera controller.  I expect this will be able to connect to the existing Ubiquiti cameras.<p>Possibly add one or more Ruckus R610 APs running in &quot;Unleashed&quot; mode to augment my Google WiFi.  I&#x27;m happy with the Google WiFi, and in particular it has good tools for managing kids access to WiFi.  But the Ruckus APs are quite good and so I may move parent and IoT access over to Ruckus,  separate out IoT devices to their own network.<p>This is the end of phase 1.  Then I plan to go on to:<p>Add an OPN-Sense router.  Currently not using Ubiquiti for routing, the Google WiFi is our main router.  Would like to gain additional capabilities like insight into what the kids are doing.<p>Replace the Ubiquiti Dome G3 with one of the less expensive 4K cameras if they seem to provide similar or better functionality.  Also trying out the Wyse Cam v3, which seems ok and the price sure is right, but is more of an augment camera than a main camera, I prefer wired and PoE.<p>I&#x27;ve been doing some research and those are the options that seem attractive.  In particular, going with old enterprise gear looks to be a huge win.  You do lose that handy &quot;single pane of glass&quot; management.  But considering the problems I&#x27;m having with Ubiquiti, and the upgrades I&#x27;ve already done to try to get past them, with only some success, I can&#x27;t bring myself to go further in on Ubiquiti.')
