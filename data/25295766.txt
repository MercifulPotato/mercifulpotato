I&#x27;m very sorry to see this drama happening and I have sympathy for both sides.<p>I routinely run into the issue that if I try to understand why people did something that went badly&#x2F;harmed people without looking to blame them per se, I get accused of being &quot;an apologist.&quot; But in practice trying to understand why things happen is essential to finding a real solution. Merely asserting that X person&#x27;s&#x2F;group&#x27;s needs matter and they are being harmed isn&#x27;t really enough to find a viable path forward.<p>Like I have seen people say that suburbia is &quot;White supremacist design&quot; because in practice it ended up being mostly Whites who got suburban housing when suburbia was born in the US. I have tried to make the distinction that suburbia was born in part because large swaths of greenfield development was quicker, easier and cheaper to create and that this choice wasn&#x27;t, per se, racist.<p>I am aware there was real racism happening and there were a lot of bylaws that intentionally excluded People of Color, but I&#x27;m sure those bylaws would have existed even if they had been building towers of condos in downtown areas instead. It wasn&#x27;t specific to the architectural form that was built.<p>I recently had an exchange with someone that reminded me how important trust and mutual respect is and how the lack of such tends to cause problems to escalate.<p>I asked this person about a thing they did. I had been having paranoid fears that they did that thing in reaction to me and stuff I was working on and when they replied to my inquiry they had a wholly unrelated reason.<p>I didn&#x27;t tell them that I was having paranoid fantasies that maybe this was some kind of negative reaction to me. I framed it neutrally.<p>Their reply was very reassuring to me. It was reassuring in part because I trust and respect this person. If you don&#x27;t have that piece, having a long list of negative experiences makes it difficult to believe they aren&#x27;t intentionally harming you and then lying about their real motives to cover it up and enable additional abuse.<p>It is, perhaps, a mistake to leave this remark. Like Timnit Gebru, I&#x27;m pretty tired and frustrated with a lot of things and feeling rubbed raw and exhausted.<p>But it seems to me it doesn&#x27;t get better by throwing in the towel and giving up on saying anything just because the entire world is touchy after a nearly year-long global pandemic.')
