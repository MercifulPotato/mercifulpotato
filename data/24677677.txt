I tried once and it seemed plausible, though I wanted contact lenses, and that wasn&#x27;t an option back then. \nSo there are 3 different photoreceptor cells in your retina, each responsible for one of RGB. Many &quot;colorblind&quot; people actually have just a lower numbers in one of the receptors and the more present receptors distort colors, like if you try to mix a color from RGB paint but don&#x27;t have enough from one of the ingredients. \nThese glasses correct the distortion.  Though they can not change color perception for people whose deficiency is caused by a complete absence of one of the photoreceptors.')
