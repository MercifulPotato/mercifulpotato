Good can be good. But if we are to police and shame bad, justice deserves more nuance than this. Downvotes hinder the discussion experience, and it limits participants to those with agendas or characters who can withstand that experience.<p>Downvotes help you avoid confrontation and discussion. You get to slap anyone on the wrist without them knowing it was you, or why. It&#x27;s self-policing by censorship that directly counteracts free speech and free thinking. It&#x27;s too convenient, too powerful, too disrespectful, too arbitrary, and too anonymous. Here comments literally fade out. You&#x27;re voting to &quot;cancel&quot; a comment.<p>Why respectfully reply when you run the risk of being downvoted yourself? Being wrong and downvoted is one thing, but what if you were not wrong? The votes are a measure of opinion and sentiment, not fact. And we can police comments, but we cannot police the downvotes. To then call this tally &quot;karma&quot; and equate this with your worth on a platform is a sure way to encourage thought alignment, not debate.')
