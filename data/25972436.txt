Do you have <i>expertise</i> that suggests that <i>they</i> are misreading?<p>Searching around on Twitter, I&#x27;ve not yet been able to find legal opinions that say the Commission is in the right. Since you are apparently french, what are legal experts saying there? Perhaps they see it differently. Can you show me these opinions?<p><pre><code>  &gt; But the real sinker for AstraZeneca is section 13.1.e.\n  &gt; \n  &gt; &quot;[AstraZeneca represents, warrants and covenants to\n  &gt;  the Commission and the Participating Member States \n  &gt; that: ] it is not under any obligation, contractual\n  &gt; or otherwise, to any Person or third party in respect\n  &gt; of the Initial Europe Doses or that conflicts with or\n  &gt; is inconsistent in any material respect with the terms\n  &gt; of this Agreement or that would impede the complete\n  &gt; fulfillment of its obligations under this Agreement;&quot;\n</code></pre>\nIt seems likely to me that (when taken in context of the rest of the contract) this actually proves the opposite of what you&#x27;re saying. The most bullet-proof way that AstraZeneca could comply with this section is by segregating production of vaccines by country. There can be no conflicts between countries if vaccine allocations of initial doses are from separate factories. (I think the EU reading this as saying &quot;there is no contract between AstraZeneca and the UK&quot; is absolutely nonsensical since the UK&#x27;s purchase order was widely publicised way before the EU signed.)<p>Even if they&#x27;re not letting on, I think it&#x27;s likely that the Commission understands that they have a different allocation. Their actions show this -- they recently raided AstraZeneca&#x27;s Belgian Vaccine Plant in an attempt to evidence the claim that AstraZeneca gave away EU doses to the UK. If AZ did this, that would have been an actual breach of 13.1.e of the contract.')
