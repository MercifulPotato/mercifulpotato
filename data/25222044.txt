I would say that technically Kythe is the open-source version of <i>part</i> of Google&#x27;s internal code search (specifically, the component that provides precise code navigation), but it doesn&#x27;t include the search index or the UI. So it&#x27;s not on its own an end-user product.<p>That having been said, I love Kythe, and we&#x27;ve actually considered using it as a semantic backend for Sourcegraph (and still might in the future). For the time, we&#x27;re using indexers that emit LSIF (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lsif.dev" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lsif.dev</a>). This allows us to build on top of the substantial body of work provided by the many open-source language servers (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;microsoft.github.io&#x2F;language-server-protocol" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;microsoft.github.io&#x2F;language-server-protocol</a>). But Kythe has a far richer schema that can capture all sorts of useful relationships in code. It&#x27;s awesome and I wish more people were building indexers for it.')
