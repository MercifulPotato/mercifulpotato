Item(by='monopoledance', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612045338, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25973369, text='This is over my head, sorry.<p>Tho, I think your scenario doesn&#x27;t exactly mean &quot;mathematically impossible&quot; but rather speculation about the short situation&#x27;s specifics. The whole situation only exists because the big fishes can deceive and manipulate the market mostly to their liking. I wouldn&#x27;t bet on them not playing dirty to distort analysis of what&#x27;s really going on.<p>Sadly, I didn&#x27;t get into a broker in time. I literally have no shares in this and just hope wallstreet burns over this one way or the other. Would have preferred to throw 50€ or 100€ into  the game just for the education. There will be another crisis for me :)')
