Item(by='waynesonfire', descendants=None, kids=[24778448], score=None, time=1602690356, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24776957, text='What does trivially reducible mean?<p>A PRNG is inherently complex and winners of <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ioccc.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ioccc.org&#x2F;</a> are a class of complexity you deem reducible. This competition involves building complexity and since there are winners it&#x27;s feasible to claim that to win it is &quot;hard&quot;. Since this straddles a form of art, placing a value judgement as easy vs hard seems invalid.<p>The reason I&#x27;m thinking about this is because I recognize that adding accidental complexity is far easier than removing it. In fact, I spend a significant amount of time &quot;trivially reducing&quot; such complexity.')
