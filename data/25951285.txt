It&#x27;s not like these were bots that brigaded the app for no reason.<p>Granted, I wouldn&#x27;t say what Google is doing is illegal. I think it&#x27;s good to keep this in mind to reinforce the &quot;reviews are fake&quot; rule of thumb that one should apply to things on the appstore in general. You can be certain less obvious manipulation of these kind happen on a daily basis based on who is giving google ad money.<p>I&#x27;d honestly not be surprised if this action was automatic, simply because Robinhood is a very large ad words customers, and the default policy of the algorithm is to mark negative reviews as &quot;fake&quot; for large customers. Which makes it worst, not better, mind you.')
