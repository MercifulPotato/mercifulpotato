They now have the data they need and it&#x27;s become a cost center. Given Android integration, that amount is substantial.<p>- the paid plans are underperforming, and this seemed like an easy way to catch up.<p>- the overall google &quot;fleet&quot; is facing capacity pressure across storage-intensive apps (e.g. gmail ?) and photos seemed like the easier solution, i.e. start charging and people will use less storage.<p>- mobile device camera resolution may be growing faster than storage costs are decreasing ?<p>- online photo hosting also requires serving the images (not just &quot;backup&quot;) and users can&#x27;t wrap their heads around a split charge for serving ?<p>- online storage costs are now dominated by the cost of power, real estate etc ?  but as drives double in capacity, their power&#x2F;etc costs should be halved as well...<p>thoughts?')
