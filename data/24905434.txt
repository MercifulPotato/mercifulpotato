Item(by='ojosilva', descendants=None, kids=[24905607], score=None, time=1603787410, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24899863, text='I&#x27;m concerned that the &quot;internet of videos&quot; is not being properly archived, like the hypertext one is. I use ytdl primarily to save valuable homemade videos that I&#x27;m afraid could disappear if that person, or Google, were to delete or block the account. I&#x27;d hope this could be a coordinated effort by libraries and institutions interested in preserving this invaluable and unprecedented corpus of daily life, culture, spoken word, music etc. that could be studied for generations to come.<p>And I couldn&#x27;t care less about VEVO and other copyrighted material, which, I wish, could find home in a completely different platform for all I care.')
