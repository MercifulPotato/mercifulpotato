Most Americans who voted voted against Trump in 2016. Trump might win in November as well but nobody, not even in Trump&#x27;s camp, thinks he will win the majority of the popular vote.<p>This isn&#x27;t quite on point, but all the collective guilt being slung about in these comments is problematic.
