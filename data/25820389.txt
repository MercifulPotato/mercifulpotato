I&#x27;m not sure that simply having the money is sufficient reason for an European country to give you a long-term visa (&gt; 1 year), depending on which country you come from.<p>Also, some countries have a &quot;negative privilege&quot; situation, where even if you try to get a low-wage job, you&#x27;ll have less priority than others, or your employer will need to pay an extra fee to be able to hire you. Many will resort to illegal employment to avoid that.<p>And do not forget issues about guarantors: some places are really strict about proving you have the money, and simply making a 1-year rent deposit in advance is not enough.<p>Overall, even when having the money, some people don&#x27;t have the &quot;privilege&quot; of being able to spend it as they please, in the country of their preference.')
