It’s still my main preference and I have no intention of switching. Wouldn’t run it on servers though, there it’s Debian&#x2F;Ubuntu&#x2F;CentOS. Apart from the systemd transition way back, which was a bit disruptive, the only breakages are the occasional kernel bug or window manager whatever which is typically solved by rolling back (pacman -U on your pkg cache) and waiting for a fix until upgrading that package again.<p>Also I’d recommend getting familiar with and picking a tool for PKGBUILDs and AUR. I like aur-sync and friends but there are options.')
