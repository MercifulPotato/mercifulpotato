For one, many enjoyable books or movies would be rather dull if authors didn&#x27;t have the liberty to beef up the story.<p>However, historians will pipe up when fiction is taken for a historical fact. That&#x27;s what historical research is all about: uncovering the facts and testing how those facts support different theses, narratives and perspectives.<p>This debate though, isn&#x27;t about misrepresenting history through fictionalized stories. This is about enhancing the quality of the footage itself and how that impacts our response and understanding of the past. Which is something else.<p>The issue here is the intent with which such enhanced footage gets purposed and repurposed later on. Today, it&#x27;s sights and sounds of cities, or a snowball fight. Tommorow, someone might apply those same techniques to reels of film which are culturally, socially and politically sensitive in order to elicit a specific, strong emotional response with their target audience.<p>If done subtly, an unsuspecting audience might never even realize that they are watching enhanced or re-touched footage, instead assuming or accepting that the footage was made during that era.<p>That&#x27;s what is pointed out here: by enhancing the footage - removing the artefacts that show it&#x27;s true age - you also remove barriers that create a gap between you and the past. For better or worst, that is.')
