The DMOZ directory system was a cannonical, list of sites by subject listed top-down. It was maintained by a community of volunteers in the fashion of Wikipeda. I believe it was used as one reference for Google and other search engines at one time. I don&#x27;t know if such an &quot;objective&quot; system could be rebuilt, however.<p>Still, it&#x27;s good to remember that it was once uncertain whether people should access the web using something a table of content (portal&#x2F;directory) or something like an index (search engine).
