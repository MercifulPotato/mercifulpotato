The person doing the work could of course say hey I don&#x27;t want to do this job I want to do something else instead but I want you to still pay me the same amount, or more. That wouldn&#x27;t really be about democracy would it?<p>Employee protection laws are a different matter and are possible because we live in a democratic society, if we do.<p>One huge step towards democracy would be universal healthcare, which would make it easier for people to quit the job they don&#x27;t think they should be doing.')
