A bigger difference in outcome than the one for &quot;maximize benefits and minimize harms&quot; i.e. preventing the largest amount of deaths.<p>Of course, the presentation doesn&#x27;t define how these two different things are supposed to be compared. But its recommendation is that &quot;Ethics&quot; outweighs &quot;Science&quot; (their terms, not mine), and therefore populations with larger ethnic minority and low income representation should be vaccinated ahead of those at higher risk from the disease.')
