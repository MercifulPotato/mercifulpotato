Item(by='soraminazuki', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602917622, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24803897, text='&gt; I find that binary packages are quite rare for free&#x2F;open source software.<p>Unfortunately this isn’t the case with some languages that have their own package managers, the prime example being Java as the parent commenter mentioned. It’s near impossible to build Java applications without fetching tons of binary jars from maven that Debian just gives up on providing their own package in many cases[1]. While Nix does build Java applications from source, the dependencies are fetched from maven in binary form.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.debian.org&#x2F;Hadoop" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.debian.org&#x2F;Hadoop</a>')
