If you are a white collar firm with generous benefit packages, it becomes comparatively expensive to hire blue collar workers yourself compared to outsourcing. Decent health insurance (~$20K&#x2F;year) is more than the federal minimum wage ($14.5K&#x2F;year).  I&#x27;m not suggesting this is moral, but it is reality.  At a factory, with many workers at similar pay levels, this won&#x27;t be as much of an expense.<p>Unfortunately, a second reason you see outsourcing are job functions where many of the workers in a geographic area are undocumented.  Companies can&#x27;t hire undocumented workers directly, but will allow a middleman to do so on their behalf.')
