I don&#x27;t care that these are private organizations. Payment processing is a fundamental utility service for society today. The fact that we&#x27;ve outsourced it to oligopolies that enjoy the lack of real competition from network effects is an indication that these companies must be broken up or heavily regulated. Payment processors should not get to deny clients except where the law is explicitly broken, and even then, only at the behest of the justice system.')
