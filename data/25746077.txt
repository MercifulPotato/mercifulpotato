In the documentary &quot;Internet&#x27;s Own Boy&quot; about Aaron( <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=M85UvH0TRPc" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=M85UvH0TRPc</a> ) some one made a insightful comment about Aaron. The insight is this, there are people who are highly technically capable and then there are people who live by high morals and sacrifice themselves for a political cause, but the intersection of the two in a same person is very very rare. And that very true. The only other person who fits in this category is probably Richard Stallman.')
