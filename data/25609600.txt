Item(by='mlyle', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609553731, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25609503, text='I think the current tradeoff is decent:<p>1A) healthcare workers (highest unavoidable exposure rate) &amp; LTCF (highest mortality rate)<p>1B) frontline workers (high unavoidable exposure rate, and may be crucial transmission links) &amp; the very old (high mortality rate).  If the vaccine lowers transmission, we&#x27;ll see a big effect from the frontline worker portion, which I suspect factored into the decision somewhat even if it is not acknowledged in the documents.<p>1C) This category is too big-- all essential workers and anyone with a health condition increasing risk or over age 65.  This phase is actually bigger than 2.  It needs to be split up some to prevent a mad rush for doses, and certainly we can benefit from further prioritization.  Hopefully this is addressed, but it&#x27;s tomorrow&#x27;s problem.<p>2) The remaining group is smaller and probably the least interest in getting vaccinated, so I assume when we get to phase 2 we&#x27;ll be facing different logistical concerns.<p>The really stupid thing we&#x27;re doing, IMO, is reserving 55% of doses to ensure everyone gets dose 2.  It should be a much smaller reserve (~25%): it&#x27;s unlikely that Pfizer&#x27;s production will stall entirely and even in that worst case scenario, most people would get a second dose, AND the data looks like 1 dose is likely effective.<p>This reserve is preventing many areas from having enough doses to enter phase 1B, and portions of phase 1B are parallel infrastructure (e.g. mass-vaccination clinics).  So, allocating those additional doses could be expected to significantly increase throughput by activating other channels through which the vaccine is distributed.')
