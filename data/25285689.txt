Let&#x27;s stop hand-wringing, this is a global public health issue, not a political issue, and China is working on it too.</i><p>&quot;If China’s COVID-19 vaccines work, manufacturers say they could turn out 1.5 billion doses in total next year. And countries that cannot access vaccines bankrolled by Warp Speed—especially those that hosted China’s efficacy trials—might have a more secure vaccine supply.&quot;<p>&quot;Yanzhong Huang, a global health specialist at both Seton Hall University and the Council on Foreign Relations, says the country is “actually using the vaccine to promote the diplomacy of foreign policy objectives.” This “vaccine diplomacy” he says, contrasts starkly with Warp Speed’s “vaccine nationalism” and aims to “fill in the void left by the United States.”<p>“It is a very carefully executed and carefully thought out strategy,” says Stephen Morrison, who directs the Global Health Policy Center at the Center for Strategic &amp; International Studies. “A strategic goal of the Chinese government is to achieve hegemonic influence in the bioeconomy within the next decade.”<p>&quot;At home, too, attitudes toward vaccines contrast with those in the United States and Europe, where mistrust is high, Morrison says. To the consternation of vaccine experts overseas, hundreds of thousands of people in China have already lined up to receive the experimental vaccines—even before their value and safety have been proved. “There has not been a collapse of faith and trust in science and in the state,” Morrison says. “There’s less fear about where this is all going.”<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencemag.org&#x2F;news&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;global-push-covid-19-vaccines-china-aims-win-friends-and-cut-deals" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencemag.org&#x2F;news&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;global-push-covid-19...</a><p><i>I&#x27;m not a huge fan of a lot of what the Chinese government does, but the U.S. is in the throes of some seriously crazy shit right now, and could take a lesson.</i>')
