I am banned from &#x2F;r&#x2F;conservative for posting conservative beliefs. Don&#x27;t be fooled by the labels being used. Being anti-left is not the same as being conservative. Fascism, just to give one example, is anti-left but it&#x27;s not conservative in any traditional American sense of the word.<p>Maybe you could more accurately say this is about the &quot;right wing&quot;? Actual dyed-in-the-wool conservatives seem to want nothing to do with Trump or Qanon or any of this stuff, which seems to have little to nothing to do with conservative values.<p>I see a lot of conservatives turning towards Biden and Harris, who to me appear to be actually very conservative. Harris is a literal cop, and Biden&#x27;s platform is basically &quot;let&#x27;s get back to normal&quot;. I&#x27;m not a fan, but I understand why conservatives would like them.')
