Item(by='cbsmith', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607145000, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25308861, text='I&#x27;m sorry, but that&#x27;s no more true than when the ultimatum is the other way around.<p>I think that statement presumes some degree of unreasonableness. Honestly, I value having employees that have principles and clear boundaries, if for no other reason than I can rest assured that when I&#x27;m not observing&#x2F;involved, those principles and clear boundaries are still there. Now, if those principles are, &quot;I won&#x27;t accept that paying me gives you any kind of authority over what I do&quot;, then you know that&#x27;s not going to work out for anyone involved. However, if it is something like, &quot;You can&#x27;t pay me enough to do X&quot;, and I have no desire for them to do X, I&#x27;m really okay with that.')
