My team is specific to the backend but we have equivalent &quot;infrastructure&quot; teams for the frontend platforms too.<p>If anyone feels like it&#x27;s hard to get your company to care about this stuff or even let you work on it, maybe it&#x27;s time to consider a move? :-) You can reach me at andyf@wealthfront.com if you prefer not to reply here.')
