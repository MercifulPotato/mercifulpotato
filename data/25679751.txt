Like when you have a fridge and turn the power off, it&#x27;ll get slower and slower towards environmental temperature, and they calculated this trend for thousands of years given CO2e already emitted rather than in the next, say, 50 years?<p>If yes, it sounds like something to keep in mind, i.e. it&#x27;s not like we still have much of a CO2e budget remaining or time to waste (we&#x27;ll have to take back out of the air what we put in from X years ago onwards), but at the same time it will also take many many years to get to dangerous warming levels (if we stopped emitting on an extremely optimistic schedule) and at some point between &quot;in a while&quot; and &quot;in a few centuries&quot; we have to suck those greenhouse gasses back out of the air to not have this effect run its full course. So this isn&#x27;t &quot;turns out we&#x27;re doomed after all&quot; as the headline suggests, just a further-into-the-future calculation that tells us what kinda already made sense (the long tail until settling on a new temperature average).')
