Most people I know own 2 belts; one for casual clothes, one for dress pants. Shoes is normally casual shoes, work boots&#x2F;dress shoes, hiking boots&#x2F;running shoes, plus flip-flops or slippers. I think I&#x27;ve only met one man who had that many shoes, and he was really into fashion and collecting sneakers, so he had probably 50 different pairs to make sure he always had some that matched his outfit.')
