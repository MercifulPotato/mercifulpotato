Item(by='joshuamorton', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609450893, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25597365, text='There&#x27;s a few things that vary from editorialization to simple inaccuracy.<p>&gt; This came up recently because NeurIPS (an AI conference) is going to require an &quot;impact statement&quot; for all submitted research papers, which has raised concerns about political bias at the conference<p>Is sort of true. It already did require these statements this year. And while there was some &quot;concern&quot;, I&#x27;d say that most of it was from, like, Domingos and random HN commenters. I don&#x27;t think there was any serious concern about this. But that&#x27;s mostly semantic I admit.<p>I also think that<p>&gt; Director of AI at nvidia, posted a list of people she blocked on Twitter, encouraging her followers to &quot;cancel&quot; them.<p>Is a mischaracterization. See the long thread here[0] in reply to this user, where I ask for the specific actions Anandkumar took that were problematic. Despite a long conversation with multiple people, the only concrete thing anyone brought up that was &quot;problematic&quot; appears to have been HN editorialization, and not actually a thing Anandkumar herself said.<p>The context about this being related to Domingos and Anandkumar&#x27;s disagreement is all almost certainly true. But for example, I don&#x27;t know what in particular GP means when they say &quot;Anandkumar (who tried to cancel him)&quot;. I doubt you do either, and if pressed, I&#x27;m not sure that GP could give a definition that should elicit concern. They had a disagreement on twitter. She&#x27;s since apologized for making anyone feel uncomfortable. He has not, despite calling people &quot;deranged&quot;, accusing Anandkumar of watching too much internet porn, and various other things.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25576053" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25576053</a>')
