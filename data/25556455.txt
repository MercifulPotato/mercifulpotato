Item(by='AnIdiotOnTheNet', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609126518, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25554209, text='&gt; I remember I didn&#x27;t even hear about sonic adventure until I got the sequel on the gamecube years later. Both of which are actually pretty great games.<p>Having played Sonic Adventure 2 about a year ago on the DC, I have to emphatically disagree. SA2 is hot garbage. Maybe the GC version was better, I don&#x27;t know, but I really couldn&#x27;t see what people liked about SA2.<p>I did really enjoy SA1, but since that is colored by nostalgia I can&#x27;t say for certain it isn&#x27;t exactly as bad (though I seriously doubt it).')
