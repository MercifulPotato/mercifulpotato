Calls to violence are unappealing to most people. This is the reason unmoderated platforms fail: people don&#x27;t enjoy spending time on them. To be palatable to normal people, the sites need moderation, which they do, to appeal to users.<p>&gt; Most of these same platforms pretty much had an anything goes unless it&#x27;s illegal attitude from the time they were started until a few years ago when they started getting a lot of political blowback and blame for &quot;helping Trump&quot; by not moderating more.<p>This is completely untrue. Here&#x27;s one of the first Trump related posts I can find: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fastcompany.com&#x2F;3054611&#x2F;when-does-hate-speech-cross-the-line-on-social-media" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fastcompany.com&#x2F;3054611&#x2F;when-does-hate-speech-cr...</a>, notably &quot;Though it apparently violated Facebook’s own internal guidelines, Trump’s video was not removed&quot;.<p>They&#x27;ve been, since the beginning, getting blowback for making exceptions for politicians instead of evenhandedly applying their policies. What you&#x27;ve seen over the past 5 years is simply the platforms growing in influence (and thus controversy).<p>The act of not moderating trump when he violated existing policies was an attempt to appear neutral to conservative users, while actually biasing to more loosely moderate a particular conservative. I can only hope platforms have learned from their mistakes.')
