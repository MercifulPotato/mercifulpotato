Also the political backers, including the new president-elect and many of the talking heads currently employed by the &quot;left&quot; side of the media spectrum. I know they&#x27;re considered good guys now, but they did much worse than the current crop of bad guys ever managed.<p>David Frum, Bill Kristol, Nicole Wallace, and General Michael Hayden are now MSNBC and #resist heroes. James Clapper and John Brennan are on CNN payroll as talking heads. At least the orange guy and his particular complicit press never passed a Patriot Act, didn&#x27;t start any warrantless kidnapping&#x2F;detainment&#x2F;torture&#x2F;execution programs, or mass surveillance programs against their own people, and didn&#x27;t start any wars. More than I can say for NYT, CNN, et al.<p>The &quot;official&quot; outlets are populated by former CIA&#x2F;NSA&#x2F;FBI, and similar people with a documented history of lying (even to Congress) to protect abuses of constitutional and even human rights. In that context it&#x27;s very hard to trust ANY information source, especially algorithmically. I don&#x27;t know how to write a program that recognizes these people who were liars yesterday are now the good guys.<p>So yes, please keep remembering and remind people. Large parts of the current problem rest on a bed of forgetfulness.')
