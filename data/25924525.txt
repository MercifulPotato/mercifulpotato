It&#x27;s genuinely fantastic, and I can&#x27;t ever see myself going back to either a non-split or a non-ortholinear board as my desktop&#x27;s input. It&#x27;s a huge improvement ergonomically -- (0) no hunched shoulders, with the halves at shoulder width (1) the ortholinear layout results in much more natural-feeling finger motions and (2) the ability to &quot;tent&quot; the individual halves is also wonderful, for not having to twist your wrist out of its natural somewhat-diagonal position. Beyond that, the ability to easily modify up to 32 layers of functionality [1], with macros, really is astonishingly useful once set up to your personal workflow. If I were to lose it, I&#x27;d order a replacement immediately. Highly recommend, for anyone who can justify the board&#x27;s price -- I&#x27;m normally fairly frugal, so the fact that I consider a $400 keyboard anything except an egregious waste of money really speaks to how much I like this device.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.zsa.io&#x2F;moonlander&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.zsa.io&#x2F;moonlander&#x2F;</a>\n[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.zsa.io&#x2F;oryx&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.zsa.io&#x2F;oryx&#x2F;</a>')
