It&#x27;s some dell laptop and I suppose it will fall apart at some point but so far I don&#x27;t see why I would replace it. I wouldn&#x27;t mind it lasting another 10 years.<p>Same for mice. I&#x27;d certainly use a mouse for 10+ years if it&#x27;s good enough. I&#x27;ve invested in a quite expensive ergonomic, mechanical keyboard and I have a very old mechanical cherry keyboard at work and I do expect them to last forever.<p>If you don&#x27;t need the latest sh*t (touch bars and what not) you&#x27;ll probably be fine with current characteristics of laptops for quite a few years.')
