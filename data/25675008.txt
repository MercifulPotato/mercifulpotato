In the U.S., the law is explicitly clear that censorship <i>by the government</i> is subject to strict limitations, but censorship by private parties is part of those parties&#x27; exercise of their own rights to free speech. Compelling one person to spread the speech of another person is a form of censorship that censors the former&#x27;s opposition to the latter&#x27;s speech.<p>There are only a handful of cases that compel private parties to tolerate speech they disagree with on their own property (basically, malls), and the scope has been narrowed over time. (See <i>Pruneyard</i> and subsequent cases.)')
