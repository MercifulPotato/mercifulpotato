Item(by='subsubzero', descendants=None, kids=[25458464, 25458384, 25458389], score=None, time=1608228457, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25455068, text='There has been some news lately regarding UFO&#x27;s that have been very strange, regarding government knowledge and disclosures.<p>Things started in 2017 with TTSA and the Pentagon&#x27;s acknowledgment of a series of videos regarding craft that showed strange movements of a unknown craft[1]. The fact is there is a pentagon program looking into this phenomenon, whether they are a psyops organization designed to deceive or mislead the public or a genuine org that is fact finding is yet to be revealed.<p>Couple that with the acknowledgement of a series of fantastic technology patents that show off technologies not known by mainstream science by a engineer in the Navy [2].<p>Even more interesting is some of the technology in the Navy patents(room temperature superconducting) has recently been shown to be feasible(although with strict environmental controls) by MIT [3].<p>I am uncertain what is going here, If these craft are indeed genuine my suspicion is the Govt has made a lightspeed advance in technology and these craft being seen are products from a unknown skunkworks, if that is not the case than possibly China has made the leap. If they are not genuine, then the US is running a brazenly deceptive misinformation campaign with the media(and China). The other alternatives which would be a truly unknown source, or a known extraterrestrial source. The last two being least probable.<p>[1] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2017&#x2F;12&#x2F;18&#x2F;insider&#x2F;secret-pentagon-ufo-program.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2017&#x2F;12&#x2F;18&#x2F;insider&#x2F;secret-pentagon-u...</a><p>[2] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;patents.google.com&#x2F;patent&#x2F;US10144532B2&#x2F;en" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;patents.google.com&#x2F;patent&#x2F;US10144532B2&#x2F;en</a>\n[2] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thedrive.com&#x2F;the-war-zone&#x2F;28729&#x2F;docs-show-navy-got-ufo-patent-granted-by-warning-of-similar-chinese-tech-advances" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thedrive.com&#x2F;the-war-zone&#x2F;28729&#x2F;docs-show-navy-g...</a><p>[3] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.technologyreview.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;14&#x2F;1010370&#x2F;room-temperature-superconductivity&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.technologyreview.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;14&#x2F;1010370&#x2F;room-tem...</a>')
