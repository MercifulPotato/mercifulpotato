However, Tcl had unfamiliar syntax, did not offer good support for data description, and ran only on Unix platforms. We did not consider LISP or Scheme because of their unfriendly syntax. Python was still in its infancy. In the free, do-it-yourself atmosphere that then reigned in Tecgraf, it was quite natural that we should try to develop our own scripting language ... Because many potential users of the language were not professional programmers, the language should avoid cryptic syntax and semantics. The implementation of the new language should be highly portable, because Tecgraf&#x27;s clients had a very diverse collection of computer platforms. Finally, since we expected that other Tecgraf products would also need to embed a scripting language, the new language should follow the example of SOL and be provided as a library with a C API.&quot;<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lua.org&#x2F;doc&#x2F;hopl.pdf" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lua.org&#x2F;doc&#x2F;hopl.pdf</a>')
