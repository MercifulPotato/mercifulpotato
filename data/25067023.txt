On Mars everything is very cold, but a floating cloud city on Venus would have some crazy thermal and chemical gradients to tap below it. I can imagine tons of engineering challenges in those conditions, but it seems like the analog of &quot;geothermal&quot; energy on Mars would be less useful than Earth&#x27;s, and could be considerably more useful on Venus.')
