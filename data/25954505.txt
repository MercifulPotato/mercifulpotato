I wanted a second opinion on an EEG, and after some hassle getting the original office to mail a disk (the only way they can transfer it), the new doctor said they can&#x27;t view it because they use different software at their hospital for EEGs. These are two well ranked US hospitals, and EEG is a fairly common procedure.<p>Perhaps this is not an inherent downside to the data security, but it&#x27;s a reality with the current medical system and regulation does play a part in how we got here. And there is no financial incentive for hospitals to fix these sort of issues, in fact there is a disincentive (I&#x27;m doing another EEG now...). So I just don&#x27;t see how it gets fixed without some outside disruption.<p>It may not be a popular opinion on HN but I&#x27;m much more concerned with having access to my own medical information than how secure it is.')
