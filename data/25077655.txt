I&#x27;m able to work around the problem (using Little Snitch, see other replies), and there are a ton of factors that go into my decision of which hardware&#x2F;OS to use, all of them involving tradeoffs. The only viable alternatives, Windows and Linux, have their downsides too. Some people prefer those over macs and that&#x27;s fine; it&#x27;s a choice people make based on their particular situation.')
