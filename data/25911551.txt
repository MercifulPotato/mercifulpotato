It&#x27;ll be fine.  They&#x27;re not tracking the minivan.<p>I know that every time something like this is posted everyone likes to swoop in and talk about how X or Y is unsafe and you need eye protection every time you pick up a screwdriver and fall protection every time you even glance sideways at a step ladder because that&#x27;s a way to score easy virtue points but it just comes across as tone deaf posturing.  They aren&#x27;t driving the van around like this 40hr a week for an entire career likewise it is not reasonable to expect them to implement a tie down solution that scales to that level.')
