The stock is still up from its initial listing price. If you&#x27;re talking relative to peak private value, virtually nothing has gone public anywhere near private valuations and Palantir&#x27;s public valuation is a bit more than a quarter lower. This has nothing to do with the &quot;middle class&quot; or &quot;ethical options&quot; and everything to do with public markets actually scrutinizing things vs private.')
