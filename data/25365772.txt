The problem really isn&#x27;t the law, it&#x27;s public opinion.  We&#x27;ve lost sight of how important freedom of speech is, and we are by and large cheering on censorship where it hurts those we disagree with.  It&#x27;s short sighted and will ultimately cost us a lot more than it gains us... but it feels good for now.')
