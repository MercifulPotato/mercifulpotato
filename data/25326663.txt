That&#x27;s their biggest &quot;buffer&quot;.<p>Yes, Apple has a strange cult appeal.  Their customers are happy even when they are being exploited.<p>&gt; Disc drives, legacy ports, headphone jacks, blinking lights, chargers...\nApple shows everyone when it&#x27;s time to take something out and leave it in the past.<p>There are plenty of manufacturers refusing to throw away headphone jacks, and customers are making buying decisions based on it.  It may yet turn out to be a poor decision for Apple. It certainly hasn&#x27;t resulted in them clawing back any market share from Android.<p>I believe Asus&#x27; EeePC was the first massively popular computer to omit a disc drive, not anything from Apple.  Ultrabooks were similarly an upmarket response to the popularity of netbooks.<p>Most of the legacy ports Apple has discarded were their own unpopular proprietary ones, adopting USB dug them out of their own hole and put them on an equal footing with PCs.<p>For years Apple was trying to push firewire and avoid USB2, to their customers&#x27; detriment, which was an obvious mistake to everyone at the time and proved to be a failure.<p>Apple&#x27;s record is mixed at best.')
