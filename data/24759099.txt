Item(by='davismwfl', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602534546, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24758328, text='I have many people applying for positions I have open that lack the listed years of experience.  If I review their resume and think their experience is still good enough to warrant a chat then I&#x27;ve already accepted they don&#x27;t meet that requirement but I am still interested.  I don&#x27;t need you to address the fact you only have 3 years (if I am asking for 5+) if that is all that is on your resume and I have still made the call.  What I need is the candidate to prove they are capable and have the knowledge and understanding to do the job relevant to at least their experience level they do have.<p>Part of the screening that helps me look at someone with lessor experience is if what they were doing closely matches the position details then I am likely to set them up for a chat, even with the difference in experience. I look at it this way, someone who has 5+ years of web dev experience in other industries and someone who has 3 years in our specific industry are nearly equivalent in many ways.  One might require less technical help, but need more industry help and vice-versa so kinda a wash in many ways. This isn&#x27;t always true of course, but is a good generalization.')
