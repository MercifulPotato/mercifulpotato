It gets more complex only when you reach for a larger set of static constraints you can express in ATS, that are unavailable in Rust: things like dependent types and complete formal proofs that you don&#x27;t need a separate language for. It feels esoteric only because those features in such low level languages are extremely rare. Also, consider the amount of effort you need to spend on learning a new toolchain (Rust), whereas ATS seems like a plugin&#x2F;extra compilation step on top of your regular and familiar C toolchain.')
