It&#x27;d be great if this post was a &quot;why XXX&quot; page in the documentation for a new platform which implements the said ideas.</i><p>That&#x27;s because these grandiose visions are just that – dreams. It&#x27;s one thing to imagine a user&#x27;s utopia of infinite possibilities and write a blog post, and a completely different thing to go and implement it. It typically falls apart when confronted with the messy reality of the real world and actual code. That&#x27;s why you see a lot of those posts, and never anything that goes significantly beyond some toy examples, if at all. Compare the author&#x27;s misconception that there&#x27;s little inherent complexity in summing a range of cells in a spreadsheet [1], an idea that won&#x27;t be entertained for long if you actually implement a general-purpose spreadsheet application.<p>@djrobstep: Sorry for the harsh words. I&#x27;ve heard too many of those visionary ideas (including my own), and have never seen them amount to anything (see also Alan Kay&#x27;s vision of software inspired by biological cells and systems – lots of talk, no non-trivial proofs of concept).<p>I would be delighted to be proven wrong, so please don&#x27;t let this post bring you down. Start building! If you succeed, feel free to rub it under my nose :-)<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25020363" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25020363</a>')
