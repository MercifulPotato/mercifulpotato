This is my genuine opinion, believe it or not. Nobody forces me, nobody pays me. I thought people are supposed to be &quot;against the CCP but support the Chinese people&quot;. Is your support limited to Chinese people who are against the CCP? Why do you not reflect for a while on why someone like me, who has grown up with western culture and has independently investigated China, is not as anti-China as you are? Why is it hard to accept that maybe some of of core assumptions you have about China is wrong?<p>And no, you don&#x27;t go to jail for <i>not toeing the party line</i>. That&#x27;s not how it works. They <i>censor</i> you if your views are stirring up social unrest or calling for overthrow. But they don&#x27;t force you to say things they want.<p>At least, that&#x27;s the case for average citizen. I suppose if you&#x27;re a high-level business executive with many ties to the government, then things become more complex. But that&#x27;s not very different from the west, is it? If you piss off a government customer, you won&#x27;t be jailed, but do you think they&#x27;d be happy to continue doing business with you?')
