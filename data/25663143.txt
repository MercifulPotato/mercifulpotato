They also know what I&#x27;m watching, what I&#x27;m buying etc<p>So my question is - do they call me out at some point and tell me to add a real name or prove my ID. Or do they let me carry on under my burner account because they can still profit from me both from my spend on apps&#x2F;games and by selling my real data?')
