Now I actually want to go a step farther, but I realize the president is a kind-hearted man and a good man.  I’d actually like to go back to the old times of Tudor England, I’d put the heads on pikes, right, I’d put them at the two corners of the White House as a warning to federal bureaucrats. You either get with the program or you’re gone – time to stop playing games.  Blow it all up, put Ric Grenell today as the interim head of the FBI, that’ll light them up, right.&quot;<p>&gt; Maxey: &quot;You know what, Steve, just yesterday there was the anniversary of the hanging of two Tories in Philadelphia, these were Quaker businessmen who had cohabitated, if you will, with the British while they were occupying Philadelphia.  These people were hung. This is what we used to do to traitors.&quot;<p>&gt; Bannon: &quot;That’s how you won the revolution. No one wants to talk about it.  The [American] revolution wasn’t some sort of garden party, right?  It was a civil war. It was a civil war.&quot;<p>This is clearly WAY beyond offhandedly using the phrase &quot;heads on pikes&quot; as a colloquialism, and veers into discussing the necessity and morality of executing political opponents.<p>Point 1: Firing isn&#x27;t good enough.  They are traitors and need to be punished with death.<p>Point 2: Clear evidence of their execution needs to be on display to intimidate everyone else into falling in line.<p>Point 3: These executions are justified when carried out on people who are seen as traitors in the midst of a war.<p>So when you come in here trying to whitewash everything as if the big bad fake news media put words into Bannon&#x27;s mouth, well, you can fuck right off.<p>---<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnbc.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;05&#x2F;steve-bannon-makes-beheading-comment-about-fauci-on-war-room-podcast-.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnbc.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;05&#x2F;steve-bannon-makes-beheading...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;FrankFigliuzzi1&#x2F;status&#x2F;1324485819042705408" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;FrankFigliuzzi1&#x2F;status&#x2F;13244858190427054...</a>')
