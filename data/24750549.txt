If I spend all day coding X widgets and then go home on the weekend and code more X widgets, I’m not gaining any diversity of experience. (I might be gaining depth of knowledge, which is oddly not valued in the way you’ve framed the issue.)<p>Additionally, doing things other than coding also provides diversity of experience which may be relevant and&#x2F;or offer a wider perspective.<p>So, I don’t think you’ve really made your case here.')
