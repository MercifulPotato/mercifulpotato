The road that you think is paid for is being used by different people for different reasons. Highway 1 in particular is very dangerous if you drive recklessly. I would rather prefer that minivan with 5 kids to home reach safely than to let me pass. The first time I drove it in my 20 year old Camry, I was scared <i></i><i></i>less. Today I cross it with breeze in my jeep.<p>&gt; You could have further refinements along the lines of once a month the road is restricted to people with &quot;very competent&quot; licenses, indicating that they intend to drive high-performance vehicles at high speed.<p>None of your ideas are bad, USA is a very large country and I think it should be possible to build private roads with the kind of system you discuss. Since the heart of innovation has not done so, something tells me that the economics will not work out.<p>* I am an off roader and the kind of market you describe exists for off roaders. Instead of &quot;competence&quot; it is about vehicle&#x27;s capability. Entire USA is full of back country and off roads which are open to different kind of vehicles and there is a super large community of people driving on them all the time. I think such a market for high performance fast cars does not exist.')
