Or rather it&#x27;s almost all solved problems. The proof is the number of 1-4 person indie teams making games that look like AAA games.<p>Two examples.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;store.steampowered.com&#x2F;app&#x2F;417290&#x2F;Ghost_of_a_Tale&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;store.steampowered.com&#x2F;app&#x2F;417290&#x2F;Ghost_of_a_Tale&#x2F;</a><p>Made almost entirely by one person<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;store.steampowered.com&#x2F;app&#x2F;242760&#x2F;The_Forest&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;store.steampowered.com&#x2F;app&#x2F;242760&#x2F;The_Forest&#x2F;</a><p>Small team<p>There are tons of others. Sure, someone had to solve those issues but they mostly packaged the solutions into Unreal, Unity, etc.<p>It&#x27;s like concentrating on making cameras instead of making movies. Sure there are new techniques that might give your movie some special edge (like when they invented bullet time for The Matrix) but a good story (or a well designed game) doesn&#x27;t really need the technical tricks. In fact some of the most famous games are designed around the limits of the tech (either the limits of the hardware or the limits of their particular engine).<p>Note I&#x27;ve written several AAA game engines and have friends that work on AAA engines for others. They are all admitting &#x2F; lamenting now that engines are basically a commodity and their skills are not needed. They&#x27;re turning into scripters for the artist and designers and management is pushing to just license the engines.')
