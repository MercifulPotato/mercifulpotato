Provide a lot of amps. Each device will take just as much as it needs. So err on the side of more watts - it will even help your batteries charge faster.<p>The only thing that can be diminished with fast charging is the number of battery cycles (the battery lifetime) so set a low charging engage (only charge if &lt;= 50%) and a high ceiling (stop charge if &gt;90%) in your bios: this will increase your battery life.<p>Source: all my devices use USB-C. They all share the same AC adapter with power delivery, and a Lenovo Dock also USB-C with PD.<p>No USB-C charging = I don&#x27;t buy.')
