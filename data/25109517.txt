Time means just as much to a single atom as it does to your entire hand, the speed limit and &quot;increase in drag&quot; (in the context of this analogy) is the same. The hand takes more energy to accelerate than a single atom does, but that&#x27;s not because of temporal dilation--it&#x27;s just the normal old classical inertia.')
