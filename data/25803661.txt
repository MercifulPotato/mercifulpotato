Scientific progress relies on stable societies and intellectual and social stasis.<p>When intellectuals progress, revolutions are often the result, and the same is true for when societies en masse evolve their ways of thinking about society itself.<p>There have been documented periods of technological stasis because humanity was engaged more in sociopolitical battles and problems and could not effectively support technological progress.<p>Technological and scientific progress are always going to be intertwined with social and intellectual changes. This is why so many scientists worked on the Atomic bomb project, this is why eugenics was popular and then profoundly unpopular. This is why you have scientists trying in vain to find a &quot;gay&quot; gene, etc. Etc. Science informs sociopolitics and vice versa. If one falls apart the other goes with it')
