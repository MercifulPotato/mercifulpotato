My quick look at income tax rates in the US is that there is a lot of progressiveness in the income ranges of the top 5% rather than through the income levels that the bell curve of Americans live in. I am not an expert or spent anytime I must say so I&#x27;m not arguing just my first look.<p>What income range do you define as middle class? And \nWhat&#x27;s lower class in the US income wise?<p>Also for a bit of context what government services do people receive welfare for in the US? What are the big sercices that are driving those net negative tax payments?')
