Base APIs object retrieval are excellent because tons of people use them so they received incremental improvements even after launch. More niche APIs like Communities or Chatter unfortunately don’t get as much love or attention.<p>Documentation, on average, is great. Light on practical examples, perhaps, but Salesforce has made huge investments into education materials for the tech side of their products. If you think THEIR docs are bad, I urge you to share what big company  (Netflix? FB?)  with regular users as the dominant customer has docs that do are think are better.')
