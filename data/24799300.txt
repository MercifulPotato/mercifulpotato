This is an Electron alternative. Is it common for companies to release modified versions of Electron? I admit I don&#x27;t work in this space, but I thought the point of Electron is to make it possible to distribute a web app as a &quot;native&quot; app. Why would a company dig into the source code and develop a modified version of Electron rather than simply use it as a tool to distribute their app?')
