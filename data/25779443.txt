This makes it quite likely that this is exactly the reaction the authors were hoping for, with the intention of keeping out the first group in the blog post&#x27;s trichotomy (&quot;Those who wonâ€™t use 9Front because of it, those whose choice is unaffected by it, and those feeling welcomed by it.&quot;).')
