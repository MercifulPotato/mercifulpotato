Compared with modern languages it completely deserves the bad rap.<p>C++ has come a long way, can you write cleaner code than you could 10 years ago? yes.\nAre there safer abstractions than there were? yes.<p>The amount of issues I have to deal with in C++ on a day to day basis which are just non-issues in Rust or Go, etc.<p>Without complaining too much dependency management and tooling are stuck in the stone age.<p>Every time I get to use Cargo going back to C++ is a nightmare, even Python which has pretty poor tooling around this is a million light years ahead.<p>Even simple things like having to carefully order headers or deal with obscure cross-platform incompatibility are mostly non-issues in newer languages and the baggage of C and C++ leads to a lot of unnecessary pain that doesn&#x27;t provide low-level control or performance advantages.')
