This is the second account I&#x27;ve ever created on HN. Second, you know what&#x27;s really bizarre? a new company in a stacked market of very big and reputable companies as well as countless FOSS projects doing the very same thing with a proprietary product offering nothing new and an open-source component that works behind paywall on github having barely 3k stars (mostly due to marketing) is systemically promoted on hacker news more than revolutionary technologies and FOSS projects with 50k stars that are used by millions of people. This post got completely weird upvote number by any HN standards within the first 5 minutes right after submission and went immediately to the homepage. The founders were surprisingly replying even though the post wasn&#x27;t submitted by them and the same accounts promoting for them also replied within the first minutes. You can check the upvotes timestamps and users and see for yourself.')
