As of yesterday, they had committed long term.<p>Thanks for pointing it out, I&#x27;m not an indycar fan and I just saw the announcement that they were building a new hybrid.  The point still stands, Honda isn&#x27;t leaving F1 to focus on green tech, it&#x27;s leaving because they&#x27;re burning money and not seeing any return.')
