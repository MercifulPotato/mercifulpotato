You have to put up with this, otherwise, might as well shut yourself out of the world.<p>edit: tyler109 - given that you&#x27;ve linked that site 11 times so far in this thread, I&#x27;m guessing you&#x27;re affiliated with or run that site? If so, might I ask that you edit the cookie text to not be so... bad? Or much better, add a button to it to let readers opt out of the pointless tracking? Also, if you are affiliated with it, could you maybe disclose it in some of the comments where you link to it?')
