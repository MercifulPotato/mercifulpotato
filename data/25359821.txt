Each person can decide for himself in his own heart what he believes. We reach consensus through discussion. There is never, not once, in any situation whatsoever a justification for <i>forcing</i> a particular perspective on the public instead of letting the marketplace of ideas function and find the truth organically.<p>This idea that certain ideas are dangerous and must be suppressed is the mark of every insecure tyranny. Secure beliefs don&#x27;t need to be propped up with censorship, and a belief isn&#x27;t secure, it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s just not adequately backed up by facts.')
