But if you have neither and are operating out of say AWS, then it becomes more expensive to rent space to put these Mac Mini&#x27;s into, especially if you don&#x27;t need it all the time. In that way it can actually be &quot;cheaper&quot;, because it&#x27;s compared to the cost of building out the infrastructure required to support your own hardware.')
