Instead of own goals we&#x27;d all be using &quot;Pence-d&quot; as an idiom.<p>If they&#x27;d taken Congresspeople hostage that would have been terrorism not a coup. The mob was totally unprepared, unimaginative, achieved no strategic outcomes and half of them are going to be in jail from now to forever. This is a coup in the same way that the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone was a succession. It is clueless protestors playing around.')
