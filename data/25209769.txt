Item(by='rbanffy', descendants=None, kids=[25213288], score=None, time=1606315757, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25207684, text='&gt; I think the high price of a workstation is not something specific to Apple.<p>A professional workstation, with support, services, guaranteed replacement components, guaranteed service-life, maintenance contracts and so on is very different from an enthusiast-built machine.<p>It&#x27;s like comparing a BMW M3 to a tricked out VW Golf. You can fit a bigger, badder engine under the VW&#x27;s hood, stiffen the suspension, replace the gearbox and so on but, in the end, you can get one straight from the dealer and not everyone is inclined to assemble a car from parts.<p>Did that once. It&#x27;s fun, educational and not very practical.')
