I could rather easily get $100 of company money to save a life.  You are going to have to set the cost much higher than $100 before it gets to the point that I couldn&#x27;t get that done myself or with the help of someone I already have a direct relationship with.<p>&gt;The system is often setup in such a way that the person who is setting the rules doesn&#x27;t see their impact and doesn&#x27;t even know you exist, and the person who sees your plight is powerless to help you. Cruel system can arise with no intention, just stupidity.<p>Those rules are often setup specifically to give the people who see your plight an out for acting without empathy.  That doesn&#x27;t mean there is never an opportunity for them to give in to their empathy and bend some rules.  It also doesn&#x27;t mean that the person who set the rules is innocent or ignorant of the harm they did.  They just absolve themselves of it through their own lack of empathy.  It is not them committing these acts, it is &quot;the company&quot;.')
