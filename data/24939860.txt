Different substances need different amounts of energy added to raise their temperature by 1 degree, a concept called heat capacity. The amount of energy currently being added (and not radiated back into space) to the planet is staggering, and far in excess of the ability of the oceans to absorb it: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.climate.gov&#x2F;news-features&#x2F;blogs&#x2F;enso&#x2F;role-ocean-tempering-global-warming" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.climate.gov&#x2F;news-features&#x2F;blogs&#x2F;enso&#x2F;role-ocean-...</a><p>I do not know why popular science reporting rarely mentions this.')
