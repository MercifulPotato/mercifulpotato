Item(by='julianlam', descendants=None, kids=[25578809], score=None, time=1609266144, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25572016, text='Yes, you&#x27;re right, it&#x27;s been aggravating me for years.<p>I vaguely recall reading about this on HN when it happened, and the consensus was that the logic for determining whether to print the street label had been changed for aesthetic reasons.<p>Peak form over function.<p>Anecdotally, I don&#x27;t see any rhyme nor reason for whether it decides to show the street name or not. Oftentimes, it will value a side-street over the main street, and in _some_ cases this makes sense (e.g. you are on the larger street, and want to see intersecting streets), but Maps doesn&#x27;t seem to read contextual clues... if I am not navigating, or zooming in from further away, showing larger streets first would be better.')
