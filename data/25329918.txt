I was in a similar situation where I wanted container orchestration but our use case wasn&#x27;t yet at the point where the complexity of kubernetes was justified. Nomad strikes a great balance. Its single binary and makes it easy to get a cluster up and running. You can run tasks other than docker containers as well.')
