Also browser.pipe.aria.microsoft.com, telemetry.microsoft.com, trafficmanager.net, hockeyapp.net, self.events.data.microsoft.com . And this is with uBlock origin also adding up blocked stuff constantly (so that&#x27;s not even reaching pihole).<p>Some of them (like trafficmanager.net) do seem needed for proper operation but most aren&#x27;t.<p>Even when I&#x27;m just working locally on a document... I really don&#x27;t like this either. Nor do I like those &#x27;helpful&#x27; O365 reports about my habits and how to spend my time.')
