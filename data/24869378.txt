I don&#x27;t know how to fix it. But there&#x27;s some very, very, very wrong stuff that happens when richer people move in. It shouldn&#x27;t be that way.<p>Definitely agree. I live in Salt Lake City, and we&#x27;re seeing the same thing here. A large part of it is failing to adapt to the local culture. I don&#x27;t think it is just a growth thing, since Utah&#x27;s population has been growing rapidly for a while due to the high Mormon population and it&#x27;s only been recently, when the composition of new residents has changed that problems have started to surface.')
