No other company could have done that, even though Imagination was pushing for RT hardware for ages before NVIDIA.<p>&gt; Do you follow the &#x27;Mill&#x27; architecture?<p>Yes. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@veedrac&#x2F;to-reinvent-the-processor-671139a4a034" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@veedrac&#x2F;to-reinvent-the-processor-671139...</a>')
