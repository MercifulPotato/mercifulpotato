Let the client configure it!<p>And apparently some developers as well, as I&#x27;m not a business manager :)<p>&gt; but B2B UIs almost always have to reflect very specific business rules<p>I agree that some B2B UIs have to reflect specific business constraints, but there also others that don&#x27;t, they just have to be a document storage. And others that don&#x27;t even need that. And others that for sure have to have very specific constraints, maybe outside of the business or maybe not.<p>I understand that you have a specific perspective on this, but I think your perspective is just considering one of many use cases of having an UI. There are others beyond that, especially when you talk about enterprise use cases, as many of those are hidden from the people not actively in enterprises, it&#x27;s really hard to know as those details&#x2F;workflows are often not public.<p>But they are there, and anyone making assumptions about what others needs, are bound to be wrong at one point or another.<p>I&#x27;m throwing my hands in the air and saying &quot;probably some UIs could be done by the users themselves, if they have the tools&quot; while also saying &quot;there are UIs that needs professionals to be done correctly&quot;. Basically that the whole area is a large gray zone of &quot;maybe this, maybe that&quot;, as there is no &quot;almost always should be like this&quot;. The use cases are so many, and so different, that it&#x27;s impossible for you to proclaim that someone is basically stupid for even thinking that users could implement their own UI.')
