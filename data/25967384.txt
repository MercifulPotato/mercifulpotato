Where does that term crank even come from?<p>I think science theories wrt to public belief have both high false positive and negative rates. A lot of people believe stuff to be true that isn&#x27;t (that climate changes are only due to us, are terrible, and that there&#x27;s something we can do about it that will help), and don&#x27;t believe true stuff that is (flat earthers... I&#x27;m pretty open minded but also quite sure we live on a fucking ball).<p>The obvious caveat is nobody fucking knows anything we&#x27;re all just fumbling around in the dark but consensus and a sense of certainty certainly does help. It&#x27;s surprising how shit a lot of the data that we have (even in this scientific age) is. And how easily manipulated the narratives can be.<p>So i think we should be giving more due, and less crank, to people like Hancock.. i know it&#x27;s a personal thing tho, how your feel about a particular person. I just don&#x27;t like to see a groupthink pile on, from any group.')
