It&#x27;s not impossible to go from &quot;rags to riches&quot;, but who ever goes from riches to rags? It&#x27;s not a true &quot;meritocracy&quot; unless the system reliably impoverishes the idiot children of the wealthy, but that almost never happens. The wealthy are protected, regardless of merit, and they take up space at or near the top of the system, reducing the number of positions open to more qualified candidates.')
