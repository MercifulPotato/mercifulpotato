His promises of securing the border have been entirely unfulfilled (he even promised more immigration than ever in the face of a rapidly declining and disenfranchised White population); his contributions to Israel from the predominantly-White taxpayer have been the most &#x27;generous&#x27; in spite of the nation state&#x27;s relative prosperity and security compared to that enjoyed by most Americans, even while jewish organisations such as the ADL routinely malign White Americans for displaying any ethnic identity or pride; thousands of black, jewish, and wild White insurgents have been free to loot, vandalise, riot and terrify American cities and suburbs (and he even promised $500bn to black Americans as a direct result) while little old White women are prohibited from attending church; open anti-White racism has been allowed to proliferate under his watch, including popularisation of &quot;Karen&quot; racist dialogue, criminalising Whites who defend themselves against aforementioned violence, etc; and his continuous references to the increase in non-White employment and socioeconomic outcomes have become a meme in the pro-White community (including in his recent 60 Minutes interview where he basically listed the benefits of his presidency to every group except Whites), a total betrayal of his voter base and his country&#x27;s narrow minority.<p>But somehow a woke activist can misconstrue the occasional Tweet into a thickly-veiled dog whistle and claim that he&#x27;s a White supremacist? He&#x27;s doing a very good impression of the polar opposite.')
