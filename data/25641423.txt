If you read that post, and still think warrantless mass-surveillance via KYC mandates is good, then you must view the author as necessary collateral damage, &quot;for the greater good&quot;. This is a cold, inhumane way to treat matters of justice. Anyway, to address your utiliarian logic: poverty is the biggest predictor of being trafficked, and KYC controls, as well as the various punitive and indiscriminate government measures they help enforce, contribute massively to poverty. They do relatively little meanwhile to stop crime, stopping less than 1% of it: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ledgerinsights.com&#x2F;anti-money-laundering-has-less-than-1-impact-on-crime-at-what-cost&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ledgerinsights.com&#x2F;anti-money-laundering-has-les...</a><p>3. That is also the argument the Chinese Communist Party makes for its various totalitarian surveillance&#x2F;control measures in Xinxiang. Anyone with a basic respect for liberal democratic principles like privacy and presumption-of-innocence&#x2F;due-process will reject warrantless mass-surveillance of financial transactions and the presumption of guilt inherent to disallowing individuals who haven&#x27;t proven their innocence, by disclosing private information, from conducting certain classes of financial transactions.<p>&gt;&gt;I encourage your example to work with his local government to pass the appropriate laws to join the world economy.<p>Uzbekistan is an authoritarian state.<p>And until he can transform Uzbekistan into, first, a democratic state, and second, a compliant organ of the global AML mass-surveillance regime, it&#x27;s okay for insiders like you that he is a global third class citizen. All of the poverty alleviation that being presumed innocent, instead treated like a suspect&#x2F;criminal by your discriminatory policies, would bring about, will be conveniently dismissed by you.')
