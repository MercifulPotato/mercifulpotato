Short of an exploit, you couldn&#x27;t hide your process without a kernel rootkit, but macOS has required user approval to load kernel extensions for several versions now.  I suppose you could go the low-tech way and just name your process &quot;WindowServer&quot; to confuse the user, but you&#x27;d still end up with two WindowServers.<p>The idea that Chrome&#x27;s auto-updater is doing this is ludicrous.')
