The theoretical basis for its value is the network of other people who have also bought in but if you&#x27;re using the credit card network to make transactions in USD you&#x27;re not giving merchants a reason to accept it directly or seeing any advantages from using Bitcoin.<p>If you enjoy speculation, that&#x27;s no more weird than keeping your money in a stamp collection but you don&#x27;t grow into a real part of the financial system by giving people fewer reasons to care.')
