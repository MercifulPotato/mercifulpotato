So it is possible :)&quot;<p>A lot, and I mean a LOT, of German industrial base is now located abroad, in Poland, Czechia, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania. These countries are rather close, but because they belonged to the Soviet Bloc, their economic development was retarded so much that local wages are 20-30 % of wages in Bavaria, but the workforce is qualified and the infrastructure adequate. This is a historic anomaly you do not have in the U.S.<p>Come here (I am in Czechia) and look around, the countryside around cities is absolutely dotted with German-owned factories that mostly produce parts. Those parts are then moved by trucks to Germany where the final product is assembled - and so the miracle of higher &quot;work productivity&quot; in BRD is created. Of course you have nominally higher productivity if you finalize products.<p>This is, by the way, how Viktor Orbán gets his political way. Hungary is absolutely vital part of German industrial base and German industry gets premium conditions on the ground. So for all the shouting about values and rule of law, German CDU&#x2F;CSU and Orbán always find a way to coexist.<p>And as for race to the bottom, look to former East Germany. There, people want German wages from German bosses. They do not get them, most of the industry moved abroad where cheaper workforce is. Former GDR is an economic periphery where anti-system parties command majority of the vote.')
