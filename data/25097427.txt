I watched her put the roast in a microwave and blast it. I was in shock but didn’t say anything. She used the oven and did up some Yorkshire puddings quickly and already had some mashed potatoes. Next thing I know dinner is done. I was certain leather was being served. But to my utter surprise the roast was cooked perfectly medium rare and was to this day the second best piece of meat I have tasted. I don’t have the guts to take a $23 piece of meat and risk trying it myself.')
