I believe that going for the cheapest is always the wrong way to conducting those projects. On the company side, bargain you first contract, install your proprietary program, lock everyone up in it and higher your fees when you have leverage on the next requirements.<p>Government, public offers, invitation to tender must not only play by the cheapest but also by the long term impact that changing contractor every 4, 5 years has on their own management and system. This is getting as absurd and stupid. Force contract to use standard&#x2F;boring technology and leverage a large market of companies for support. Being the cheapest never was a fair decision maker.')
