This is like arguing that computers are useless in 2020 because in the 70s they were not very powerful.<p>&gt; If batteries actually get cheap then we can do 2x wind+battery, but that isn&#x27;t here today<p>Battery storage costs have already dropped 75% over the last 6 years, and we&#x27;re pretty close to making that possible: \n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.greentechmedia.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;read&#x2F;report-levelized-cost-of-energy-for-lithium-ion-batteries-bnef" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.greentechmedia.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;read&#x2F;report-levelize...</a><p>In the field, people bidding on energy projects are doing mixed solar+storage and wind+storage at prices comparable to nuclear or lower.  Today.  With 2020 tech and 2020 pricing, not 2025, not 2030.  Granted, these aren&#x27;t including a lot of storage right now (1-4 hours generally) but as battery prices continue to drop that will increase.<p>Given how costs are dropping as the technologies scale up, in 2025 people won&#x27;t even think twice before choosing renewables+storage over nuclear, because it&#x27;ll be a no-brainer.<p>&gt; What we have today are nuke plants, just like we did 40 years ago.<p>Yes, that&#x27;s the problem.  Nuke plants plants have advanced technologically in the last 40 years, but in terms of cost they&#x27;re actually more expensive because we found more failure modes (and need to prevent them).<p>And this is disappointing because I worked in nuclear physics for a few years and really wanted to believe that nuclear energy was going to save us... and it catastrophically failed to deliver.')
