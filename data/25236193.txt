Some software is bad at getting rid of things that they&#x27;ve cached (eg Chrome). Theyend up taking more and more and more and more disk space. I don&#x27;t understand why my browser needs to take up 10-20 GB of disk space, if it can&#x27;t even retain 7 months of history.<p>But then you just hide your bad caching design from users by only &quot;showing&quot; what you&#x27;re doing wrong to those that understand SQL. And those users can still change it.<p>You should test your app for random cache permutations (user changes .dat file in the wrong way) and partial cache loss (user deletes random file). You have to assume that anything that can be broken will be broken.')
