This way the driver would see where the car is about to go and take control only when the predicted trajectory is wrong. This would solve the trust problem: the driver would know what&#x27;s going on inside the car&#x27;s &quot;brains&quot; and wouldn&#x27;t need to act like an instructor to a epileptic student that can collapse at any moment. This would mostly solve the liability problem as well. The downside is that such autopilot can&#x27;t leave truck drivers without a job.')
