A blogger is usually some person at a keyboard, typing. A journalist is the same.<p>The major difference is people going in to journalism tend not to be domain experts or leaders in their field.

Good intentions do not make good outcomes, and for most things I care about the formal media is more effective at silencing real concerns than amplifying them.
