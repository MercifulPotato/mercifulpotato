There is still some way to go for any one-car household that wants to be able to make longer trips a few times a year (and is not willing to rent for those occasions, which although possible is an option I doubt many will opt for).<p>Large family vehicles on the other hand, there are a few hybrids that fit the bill but none of them are stand-out and the additional mechanical complexity is (rightfully) giving folks pause. The early prius for example got it right and was quite reliable, later iterations unfortunately have not lived up to the reputation it built. But then there&#x27;s also rural car ownership where fewer, longer-range trips are the norm. Not much adoption to be seen there for very good reasons, neither the cars nor the charging infrastructure is suitable.<p>Depreciation is a kicker, also. Early adopters are finding that with the rapid progress on range&#x2F;features and manufacturers chasing lower RRPs to get more adoption, when they come to trade up to something newer the value of their early purchases is lower than a similarly-aged ICE.<p>All of this is still good progress, but I think we&#x27;re at least a decade if not several away from ICE being pushed into a niche. Plus without some breakthroughs in battery tech, there&#x27;s only so far into the market things can go. Fortunately some promising stuff seems to be on the horizon i.e. solid state.')
