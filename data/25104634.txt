People doing this still need to give the code to their users if they request it with the same rights, and will be incentivized to contribute back upstream if they need to adapt the code to provide their service because it is less costly than maintaining an ever diverging fork, which is great! Do sell commercial services around my GPL code!<p>A commercial license is only needed to allow building proprietary software based on the GPL code, but it is only possible to provide one if the project has no other contributors than the one selling the commercial license, or those contributors sign a CLA.')
