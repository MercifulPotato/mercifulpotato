Is this partial evidence that turing tapes are trash? Does that question even make sense?<p>&gt; I don&#x27;t expect this to be solved now (tooling, as per above), but mathematicians should learn more category theory now as that works just fine pencil paper and brain. When the type theoretic tooling is ready they will be ready.<p>The abstractions of category theory are useless in many areas of mathematics. Prime example: PDEs.<p>Laypeople think that category theory is the &#x27;ultimate math&#x27; because they hear that it provides bridges or analogies between different areas of math.\n Perhaps programmers are especially prone to this because category theory does have some applications to programming.<p>The thing is, almost all of pure math is itself is a bridge between different areas of math. Some of these areas are bridged by category theory, some are bridged by other kinds of math, which have less catchy names.')
