Previously I’ve worked as an engineer at Microsoft (both a- and fte, L59-61), an engineer (L5) at Amazon, a TPM (L5-L6) at Amazon, and an EPM (ICT4) at Apple.<p>Indeed is the best workplace I’ve ever had. The culture is seriously about helping - both each other and jobseekers. PTO is unlimited and strongly encouraged. When the office is open, we have the same free food as Google and Facebook (these used to be worse but improved dramatically a few months before Covid). People take the time to eat with each other, build relationships, make friends.<p>We discuss ways to ensure those with the least power are heard, and I think we listen to them - I’ve seen changes in the language we use to create inclusivity, and I’ve got two engineers on my team from the Ada bootcamp who I think are happy, and both getting promoted and recognized. I have leeway to trade revenue for, say, changes to our product that reduce unconscious bias in hiring. I also have leeway to target positive outcomes for people looking for work over revenue.<p>I am sure that like any company the mileage may vary. I make less than I did at Amazon or Apple, but I’m happy; I’d make the trade again in a second. If I think about work on a weekend it’s because I’ve got an exciting idea or solution I should write down, not because I’m anxious about next week.<p>I’d recommend Indeed to anyone.')
