House prices rise to the point where the down payment is essentially the price of the house. The house price itself becomes imaginary. What you are really worried about is the down payment.<p>Yes and no. This is also true in all markets. No one really buys a house based on the price. They buy it based on the monthly payment (price - down payment and interest rate). The price alone is mostly irrelevant for the buyer.<p>This means that for most people, the best time to buy a house is when interest rates are sky high since falling rates are easy to take advantage of in the future. High rates also mean the original principal is likely low.')
