I would also have trouble doing timesheets (have thankfully never had a job that required them) but not because of adhd, just because they seem pointless and like they bring no value to my life at all. Standard adulting things are only an issue in so far as they are often out of sight out of mind, and that&#x27;s a common struggle for people with ADHD (drawers are our enemy).<p>Mundane is probably not exactly the right word tbh, but it&#x27;s hard to find the right word. I think it would be more accurate to describe it as things with a lot of upfront planning involved. If I can basically react my way through something to completion I can get into hyperfocus and just blaze through it.<p>A lot of the time the way I&#x27;ve gotten around this is to force it to be an emergency so I <i>can&#x27;t</i> think about it too much. Either by leaving it to the last second or just convincing myself.<p>And that&#x27;s a really common pattern you see in people before they get ADHD diagnoses.')
