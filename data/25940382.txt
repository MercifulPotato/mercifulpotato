As in, produce enough to grab some headlines but only produce what you need to offset your emissions; hence even Ford plays this game with a 50k limit on Mach E production.<p>They were quite will to wait for government to build out the charging network or have others do so. Heck I am still surprised Tesla&#x27;s system hasn&#x27;t been forced open. Both New York and California have had politicians float that idea before by different means; one requiring all stations to accept credit cards and the other jacking up electricity rates for stations not support all brands.<p>Still think it may be in Tesla&#x27;s best interest to eventually sell off their charging network. As a Tesla owner it really getting to the point state side that buying one may be a negative as the only connector they offer is their own; they really should put one on both sides of each type or offer that.')
