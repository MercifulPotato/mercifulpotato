Use libraries that are small, focused, and do their one job well enough <i>right now</i>. Then it doesn&#x27;t matter if it stops being maintained: it still keeps doing its job well. If you do have to replace it,  it&#x27;s much easier, because it doesn&#x27;t do too much. Vue, Angular, React -- all of them are &quot;build your application around our framework&quot; libraries, not &quot;easily incorporate our library into your workflow&quot; libraries. That is enough for me to immediately reject all of them.')
