Item(by='onli', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609687011, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25621450, text='I would expect the build being official at least raises the chances of the maintainer being catched if he slips some nefarious code into the ROM?<p>&gt; <i>but maybe there can be a way for the users to upvote arbitrary links?</i><p>Maybe if the foundation would be a bit different :) But this is a completely static site. One ruby script per data source creates a central .yml file, another custom ruby script creates the HTML based on that data and some .erb files, netlify is then serving those HTML files (pulls them directly from a gitlab repo). And after the holidays my time will be too limited to change that, especially for a noncommercial project. But if there is serious interest to create a fork with more features and data I would open source this.<p><i>Edit</i>: As someone on Reddit was asking for a repo and this comment planted the idea to open source it anyway, here is the repo: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitlab.com&#x2F;onli&#x2F;sustaphones" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitlab.com&#x2F;onli&#x2F;sustaphones</a>')
