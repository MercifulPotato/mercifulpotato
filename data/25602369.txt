Item(by='viraptor', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609498765, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25600300, text='&gt; Nintendo does many things I personally find counterintuitive and even counterproductive.<p>I&#x27;m amazed at the number of times I heard about Nintendo basically shooting themselves in the foot just to retain more control. Like banning Psycrow from Mario maker. Using content identification to silence audio from streamers. Taking down fan-made Mario-related content. Every one of those bringing them free advertisement and more customers.<p>I&#x27;m surprised that smm rom-hacks still exist given the restrictions.')
