People assume that since it&#x27;s available without approval it must be pretty safe, so people take more than recommended.<p>The maximum safe dose for Tylenol is 4g per day. The low end of the toxicity range is a daily dose of 7.5g-10g for an adult, ~2.5X the maximum recommended dose - or just 12 grams spread over 2 days. The effects are exacerbated by alcohol use.  And worst of all, people take it for <i>hangovers</i>. [1]<p>So, the toxic dose of Tylenol is only 2.5X the active dose, whereas for ASA it&#x27;s 8X, for ibuprofen it&#x27;s roughly 10X, and naproxen is about the same. Tylenol is <i>much</i> more dangerous than Aspirin.<p>Tylenol leads to 50,000 ER visits per year and 25,000 hospitalizations. It would lead to way more deaths if left untreated.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.uspharmacist.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;acetaminophen-toxicity-what-pharmacists-need-to-know" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.uspharmacist.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;acetaminophen-toxicity-...</a>')
