Likewise, that was a good nudge for a lot of people to move off the &quot;easy&quot; platform and figure out something better.<p>I wonder why companies don&#x27;t use a boil-the-frog approach to try to avoid this &quot;nudge&quot;. Like, if they started off by charging, say, $1 a year I&#x27;m sure everyone would stay and just go &quot;OK&quot;. Then start increasing the price slowly until you find the sweet spot.')
