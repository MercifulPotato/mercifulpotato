App Engine <i>Flexible</i> is in fact very similar to Cloud Run, and my understanding is that it runs on the same infrastructure. In fact, App Engine Flexible &quot;Custom Runtime&quot;, which lets you load a docker container in App Engine, is very similar to Cloud Run.<p>FWIW, though, as a user of App Engine Flexible for Node, I&#x27;m very glad this Cloud Run option now exists.')
