Transforms are fast, but understanding where things are after they&#x27;ve been transformed is hard. JS layout is also somewhat prone to problems with things like browser zoom level, OS display scaling (although I&#x27;ve not seen that be an issue in a couple of years), differences between browsers and browser versions, and so on. Layouts with CSS, so long as you&#x27;re being reasonably conservative, do work quite well in 2020.')
