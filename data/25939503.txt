This is not a bubble. This is a high stakes market movement speculation game that billionaire vulture short sellers are playing.  They just got careless and lazy and got caught in money losing position.  Now, these billionaire vultures are crying and whining to the government to help them with bailouts and change the rules in the middle of the game.<p>WSB is playing the game fair and square.  It&#x27;s the billionaires that&#x27;s been short selling and manipulating the markets that got caught with their pants down.<p>WSB is squeezing the greed out of billionaire vulture short sellers, which has gotten so brazen that they have painted themselves into a corner.  Usually, they get away with these kind of shenanigans.  But this time, someone who knew the game saw the positions and realized that other player had the edge using a winning strategy. All they have to do is drive the price higher and short sellers have to buy at whatever price to cover their positions.<p>Think of it like this, someone has to buy an item that you have, at any price.
