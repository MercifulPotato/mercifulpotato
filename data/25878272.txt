But now our votes are more alike when our &quot;tribe&quot; is alike - e.g. professional, rural, urban poor.<p>But that stuff is still aligned with geography. A rural district is full of the rural poor. An urban district in San Francisco is full of professionals. You can draw the lines in a way that causes this not to happen, but if that&#x27;s your concern it&#x27;s easier to draw them a different way than change the whole system.<p>&gt; To get real minority interests some representation, and to solve the geography problem, I&#x27;d like to see a state say they&#x27;ve got 10 representative positions, and you&#x27;re all going to have a vote (or maybe 10). The top 10 vote-getters are then chosen.<p>This has all kinds of different terrible problems. Obvious example: If you&#x27;re still using first past the post then you still have vote splitting and then opponents can dump anyone they don&#x27;t like out of the legislature by convincing someone similar to run against them so that they both lose.<p>But if you switch to range voting then you can fix it without getting rid of districts:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25875275" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25875275</a>')
