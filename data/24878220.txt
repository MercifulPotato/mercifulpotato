If you&#x27;re interested in this you&#x27;ll probably also be interested in Peergos [1][2] (disclaimer: I&#x27;m a co-founder), which has stronger privacy properties.<p>Peergos is an E2EE P2P global filesystem built on top of IPFS, and we have a built in photo&#x2F;video&#x2F;audio gallery&#x2F;player (and other apps too). We don&#x27;t expose the social graph (who is sharing with who) to the server, and we also obscure things like the number of files, number of directories, size of individual files, even whether something is a directory or file. We are also designed to be resistant to exposure by a quantum computer (mainly we don&#x27;t rely on asymmetric encryption for privacy, only for sharing, and even for sharing we take measures to protect against a future quantum computer). We also don&#x27;t rely on DNS or the TLS certificate authorities for security (unless you choose to use the web interface to a public server). We do fine-grained server-less access control using a structure called cryptree [3].<p>It&#x27;s P2P so you can mirror your data as many times as you like or just self-host. It&#x27;s also 100% open source, both client side and server side.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;peergos.org" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;peergos.org</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;peergos&#x2F;peergos" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;peergos&#x2F;peergos</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;book.peergos.org&#x2F;security&#x2F;cryptree.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;book.peergos.org&#x2F;security&#x2F;cryptree.html</a>')
