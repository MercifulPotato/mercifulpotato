I have a relative who uses it habitually, and I can’t help but worry.<p>It seems safer than Tylenol, but I don’t understand why it would be safer.<p>They recently had a toothache, and they took 4 right away and more several hours later. When I expressed concern, they said the doctor told them to go ahead and take 4 immediately when in severe pain. But it feels like more and more studies and anecdata are casting suspicions on Tylenol, so I wanted to ask if anyone knew the central reason why ibuprofen might be safe in comparison.')
