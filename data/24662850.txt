On one hand it says &quot;THIS SOFTWARE MAY BE USED, MODIFIED, REDISTRIBUTED, DECOMPILED, DISASSEMBLED, REVERSE-ENGINEERED AND INCORPORATED INTO OTHER WORKS FREELY&quot;<p>So, it can be used and incorporated freely, but it also says &quot;YOU ARE NOT GRANTED LEGAL AUTHORITY OVER THE USAGE, PROTECTION, AND DISTRIBUTION OF THIS SOFTWARE.&quot; so you don&#x27;t have legal authority over its usage. IANAL, but that seems to limit one&#x27;s own authority over one&#x27;s own work based on this software. It&#x27;s very confusing.')
