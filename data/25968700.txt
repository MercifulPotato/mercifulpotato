Students and the like are usually the lowest value workforce and organizations would have little interest in paying extra to accommodate for them. If they want to attract more young talent, it&#x27;s easier to offer a higher salary instead. While perks do matter in hiring, I don&#x27;t see this outweighing other uses you could get out of the same money.<p>Of course, I could be completely wrong and godspeed to you if you see a market for it, simply offering my two cents of feedback.')
