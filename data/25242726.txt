Please read this with a light heart and don’t judge me.<p>I was introduced to Computers — as theories in school classes in the summer of 1992. By winter of 1993, my school got computers and I spent a lot of my time there, including many practices during the holidays.<p>I spend extra effort to learn things that were not taught in the school. I learnt QBasic and started writing tiny programs. My own trick was to use Graph Papers to match co-ordinates to plan game programs. One of them was a game where shapes are draw on the screen and you shoot it with an arrow. You have to hit spots on the shapes to do something - explode, write out names, etc.<p>I asked one of the girls to try it. She did and finally shoots a “heart” symbol and it burst with her name. I think I coded many things manually to make that happen and not very “programmatic”.<p>She became my first Girlfriend and we were for about a year. After that, we got drifted apart as we went to different schools in different states. No email, no phone.')
