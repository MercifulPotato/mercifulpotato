I could imagine this doubling shipping costs, which might be untenable for many ecommerce businesses.<p>In terms of the actual logistics, it&#x27;s a challenge, plus typically this would be automated – your software will do this all for you. Now your software needs to book and pre-advise a new provider? And track through them? But also track through the original one?<p>For most businesses it&#x27;s probably impractical to implement this, and for most that could they probably have contracts with the couriers that mean they won&#x27;t be hit by this or they do their own deliveries. I think the space in the middle is a pretty small subset of companies.')
