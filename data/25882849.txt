It has tradeoffs however.<p>- Extra space for every object to have a refcount<p>- Extra refcount bookkeeping every time you (re)assign a reference (possibly triggering cache thrashing&#x2F;false sharing in some multithreaded scenarios), xchgs instead of movs, etc.<p>- Pointless if you&#x27;re using bump allocators (they can&#x27;t reuse the &#x27;freed&#x27; memory until the next GC cycle compacts memory anyways), so you&#x27;re forced to use more complicated allocator designs if you&#x27;re to reuse said memory.<p>Cycles mean it still doesn&#x27;t give you 100% deterministic object destruction either, so you want extra mechanisms for disposing unmanaged resources at controlled times ala IDisposable anyways.')
