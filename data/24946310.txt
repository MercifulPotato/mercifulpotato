We replace this manual queue management with an actor class<p>[…]<p>Things to note about this example:<p>- Declaring a class to be an actor is similar to giving a class a private queue and synchronizing all access to its private state through that queue.<p>- Because this synchronization is now understood by the compiler, you cannot forget to use the queue to protect state: the compiler will ensure that you are running on the queue in the class&#x27;s methods, and it will prevent you from accessing the state outside those methods.<p>- Because the compiler is responsible for doing this, it can be smarter about optimizing away synchronization, like when a method starts by calling an async function on a different actor.”</i><p>The article also links to<p>- <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forums.swift.org&#x2F;t&#x2F;concurrency-actors-actor-isolation&#x2F;41613" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forums.swift.org&#x2F;t&#x2F;concurrency-actors-actor-isolatio...</a> (pitch for implementing actors)<p>- <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;DougGregor&#x2F;swift-evolution&#x2F;blob&#x2F;actors&#x2F;proposals&#x2F;nnnn-actors.md" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;DougGregor&#x2F;swift-evolution&#x2F;blob&#x2F;actors&#x2F;pr...</a>, which links to <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;DougGregor&#x2F;swift-evolution&#x2F;blob&#x2F;actors&#x2F;proposals&#x2F;nnnn-actors.md" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;DougGregor&#x2F;swift-evolution&#x2F;blob&#x2F;actors&#x2F;pr...</a> (proposal for implementing actors)<p>I don’t know Erlang well, but what’s missing?')
