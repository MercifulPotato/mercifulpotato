All I can say is when I place this badge in a GitHub repo&#x27;s README or in my email signature, it&#x27;s my way to wish well on the people who come in contact with that repo, or with my email, and it is sincere. The messages vary but they all support that same intention.<p>At times I&#x27;ve stumbled on graffiti in the street that were random messages of kindness from complete strangers, and they brightened my day. So I don&#x27;t think it needs to come from someone who knows you to mean something.')
