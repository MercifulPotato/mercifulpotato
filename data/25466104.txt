Take for example &quot;height: auto&quot;, a key component in vertical (absolute) positioning.<p>According to section 10.6.4 &quot;Absolutely positioned, non-replaced elements&quot;, &quot;height: auto&quot; is the height based on the content except when top and bottom are both auto and it suddenly changes to the the height of the containing&#x2F;parent element. This breaks vertical alignment based on content.<p>Also in the same section, if height is auto, then a top or bottom of auto is calculated, unless both are auto and then suddenly top is set to 0 instead of spreading evenly. For that you need to use margins, but they only work if top, height and bottom are all non-auto.<p>As a result millions of developer hours have been spent on frustrations, fixups and workarounds.')
