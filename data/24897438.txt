Money is power.<p>If the Proud Boys want to set up their own media outlet, nobody&#x27;s stopping them. They can do whatever they can to convince people that they&#x27;re good folks.<p>However taking and spending money, that&#x27;s not something anybody can do for any reason. We have lots of regulations on commerce, and unless there&#x27;s very good reason for it, we don&#x27;t force anyone to do business with anyone.<p>We force companies to hire and fire in non-discriminatory manners, again, because money is power, and discrimination is punching down, and we as a society don&#x27;t like that.<p>In order to do this, we use the force of <i>law</i>. Adding a protected group to the categories of people that we cannot discriminate against requires legislative action. There&#x27;s a public debate and legislators&#x27; votes go on record. We use legislation to regulate the aggregation and use of power.<p>The legal remedy for breaking that is a lawsuit. It&#x27;s a long, drawn out process whose primary deterrent mechanism is punitive damages. Being the company that has to pay that black person millions of dollars because you decided they weren&#x27;t worth hiring is not a fun time.<p>That&#x27;s the way the system works. If Epik feels they have standing for a discrimination lawsuit against PayPal, I&#x27;m sure their lawyers have already it drawn up. Something tells me they won&#x27;t.<p>The Proud Boys are just going to have to find someone else to handle their money.')
