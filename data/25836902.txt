Any new social network has fewer baby pictures, and therefore can be held to a higher standard, to the point that it will be obliterated before it has a real chance to compete.<p>Eh, not really.  You&#x27;re forgetting the other half of the equation: Parler&#x27;s niche was the stuff Facebook and Twitter had either banned or discouraged (like false claims of election fraud).<p>The real moral of the story is: don&#x27;t try build your social network from Facebook and Twitter&#x27;s concentrated dross.')
