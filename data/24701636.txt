We are seeing a new wave of newsletter creators starting their newsletter, picking a topic, growing their audience, and monetizing through subscription, ad sponsorship and affiliate marketing.<p>At some point they want to move on to another project and want to sell their newsletter. LetterXchange makes selling and buying newsletters easy and safe.<p>You may ask, why would anyone buy a newsletter? How do you value a newsletter? The answer is in the niche, the audience and the revenue. Peter Cooper, who runs 12 newsletters, commented about buying, &quot;I&#x27;d buy those on the right topics at the right price even if I could rip off the idea myself because there&#x27;s still value there.&quot;[2]<p>On LetterXchange, buyers and sellers can find each other and close deals.<p>When a seller creates a listing, in addition to the basic newsletter info, we ask for:<p>* detailed subscriber and revenue metrics;\n* a pitch to highlight the newsletter&#x27;s value;\n* proof of ownership to substantiate their claim on readership and revenue.<p>We integrate with secure escrow payment. When a buyer clicks the &quot;Buy&quot; button,<p>* the buyer is instructed to fund the transaction via escrow;\n* the seller will be notified once the payment is secured;\n* the seller then proceeds to transfer the assets;\n* the buyer receives and approves the assets;\n* the escrow service releases the payment to the seller.<p>Buyers can also make a bid on a listing. If a seller accepts a bid, the buyer is required to fund the transaction via escrow.<p>We believe the thriving community of newsletter entrepreneurs deserve a dynamic, competitive and safe marketplace. If you or someone you know are considering selling a newsletter, sign up now to create a listing, it&#x27;s free.<p>[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.letterxchange.com\n[2]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=6075955')
