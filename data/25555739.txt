In this case, it&#x27;s a 2D game where the player can &quot;transport&quot; humans and other animals like cats and dogs into the simulation.  The player can confine the humans and other animals by drawing walls and fences.<p>Each animal in the simulation is an actor with a base set of rules that apply to all actors and a species specific set of rules that extend the base actor.  For example, a dog will follow a human when they meet and return to the human when they are hungry.  If humans meet they will share where to find food if they know of a location.<p>I&#x27;m still working on getting the game to a point where I feel like I can share it.  The UI work was important for this because honestly my first attempt was not very good.  However, I have reworked it and am much happier with it even though it is still very basic in appearance.  At this point I am only using Godot&#x27;s built in UI tools and draw functions rather than building from assets.<p>EDIT: I should probably clarify that the game itself isn&#x27;t related to or inspired by Conway&#x27;s game of life.  It&#x27;s more like the Sims or Sim Ant.<p><pre><code>  Also do you eat the mushrooms?\n</code></pre>\nNo.  But I don&#x27;t necessarily look for edible mushrooms.  Usually what I do is go for hikes or even walks in my neighborhood and look for mushrooms along the way.  If I find one I have not found before I take a sample for a spore print.  Then I write up a bit of info on where I found it and if I was able to ID it.<p><pre><code>  (Could you be convinced to take up bird watching?)\n</code></pre>\nI hadn&#x27;t considered it but I can&#x27;t see why not.  My original motivation for mushroom identification was macro photography.  My interest in actually ID&#x27;ing the mushrooms came later.')
