People die in crushes when the people in back don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s happening in front. This allows density increases until the people in the back become victims themselves.<p>During the Station Fire[0] there was a choke point at the front door. People fell on their way to the exit and other evacuating people, unaware of the situation tried to get out of the building. Few people knew about an exit near the point of ignition.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;The_Station_nightclub_fire" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;The_Station_nightclub_fire</a>')
