Sorry if it&#x27;s out of place. On the discussions of opening large files, I grant emacs does tend to choke on long lines but when each line is moderate it can open pretty large files.<p>What I can&#x27;t see here is any mention of VLF mode (get via elpa&#x2F;melpa) in emacs which allows you to open very large files (per acronym) which are mem mapped.<p>I just opened a 3.3GB .mpg and it opened immediately. Seems to be editable but it gets verrrry slow (has to page huge amounts and create temp files if you edit) and I&#x27;ve not verified that, but in the rare case I need to browse a multi-GB file, it has worked for me.<p>Anyone used vlf mode in emacs more extensively, please chime in.<p>FYI, HTH')
