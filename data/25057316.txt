Replace the HN title&#x27;s &#x27;may&#x27; with &#x27;may not&#x27; and it is exactly the same thing.<p>2. Especially if you consider the original title is <i>How artificial intelligence may be making you buy things</i>. There is nothing concrete in there.<p>3. It you read that quote again it is a very carefully worded and cherrypicked piece of data, something that is very common in AI hype articles. Without the actual numbers it is also meaningless.<p>Again, it is only <i>my</i> interpretation that the article is disingenuous, feel free to disagree.')
