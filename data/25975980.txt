Obviously I could go in private viewing or something but why would I even bother with that? It&#x27;s so user-hostile.<p>But the marketing that I do remember that enticed me to check it out was that I thought that it was for streaming games. When I checked out the site they had this big list of games that it looked like I could stream. If I could only stream, say, 15 games as it appears to be why not just show those? Hmm.<p>I do think there&#x27;s a market for those (like myself) who have a few games they&#x27;d like to play. Cyberpunk 2077 looks cool - I&#x27;ll pay $10 or $15 or even $20&#x2F;month to stream that (among other games) because my alternative is buying it for $50 and not having it run at ultra-max settings on my MacBook Air. Not desirable.<p>To your point that this was a knock against it at launch, well, yea. They have all this marketing copy that makes it look so cool and then I have to pay retail price for a new game. Why wouldn&#x27;t I just buy a Playstation or use Xbox or Sony&#x27;s online services? Like what value is $9.99&#x2F;month for some lame games that I don&#x27;t care to play? Pass.<p>This service doesn&#x27;t address any market that I can see.')
