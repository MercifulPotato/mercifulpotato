I know there is a libertarian streak here around the access to content and information. I don&#x27;t share those values, and think unchecked distribution of manipulated content creates a worse outcome for our society; I&#x27;d argue it is more inherently dystopian than straight-up government censored speech, which of course is not what&#x27;s at stake here.<p>It doesn&#x27;t matter whether I trust them to vote because they have a right to vote no matter what I think. I definitely do not trust masses of people to identify real vs. manipulated content that is expertly designed to be misleading, and I think companies that directly facilitate the spread of information have <i>some</i> level of responsibility for the consequences of enabling manipulated media to infect their users. I don&#x27;t know what the balance is, I&#x27;m not dogmatic, but I think everyone needs to be a little less dogmatic on this issue.')
