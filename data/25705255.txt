The current fringe sites are worthless to me since currently they are mostly created and used by people who were kicked off the top sites.<p>However, as an example, if there was a tool that would post my video to youtube, dailymotion, and however other many video sites are out there I&#x27;d gladly do it. You could still maintain a preferred network to help consolidate likes and subscribers, but you are less beholden to any one company if your content has existed many places for years.<p>It could be difficult in mediums like twitter where there is a real two way interaction, perhaps a comment consolidator within the tool?<p>If it doesn&#x27;t exist I think government should atleast build the tool for themselves. There&#x27;s no reason for communication from the government to exist first on a private platform. It should be put out on a .gov platform that then goes to whatever popular platforms of the day exist.')
