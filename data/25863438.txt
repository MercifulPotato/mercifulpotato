That was a challenge. Only months before, my current university had suffered a cyberattack, and access to my back-up drive was prohibited at first.  ... I spent a week piecing together the necessary files and coding a pipeline to reproduce the original findings. To my horror, I also reproduced the problem that Susanne had found. The main issue was that I had used the same data for selection and comparison, a circularity that crops up again and again.<p>The proper solution would be to publish the code along with the paper so that others could directly review it. Ideally, the raw data would also be published, but there might be privacy issues with that. Peer review for journals is supposed to catch these type of workflow problems, but just throwing the code &amp; paper up onto GitHub would probably be more effective than publishing just the paper and waiting for others to catch the problem.')
