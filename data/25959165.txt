Item(by='boatsie', descendants=None, kids=[25959913, 25968080], score=None, time=1611938281, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25957264, text='There isn&#x27;t something &quot;magical&quot; about &gt; 100% short interest. It should be stated a ratio to be less confusing, rather than a percentage. It just means that if there were, say 100 shares of a company, and 120 shares sold short, it would be &quot;120%&quot; short. But all this means is that there are 220 shares &quot;owned&quot; by others. And thus, to cover, the &quot;shorts&quot; need only buy back 120 of those 220 shares, so there will certainly be bag holders at the end of this since the shorts don&#x27;t actually need to buy up &quot;all the shares&quot;, only 54% of them in this case.<p>Now, of course, some of those shares are locked up by funds tracking, say the Russell 2000 index, which cannot liquidate their holdings (and may even be required to buy more as GME climbs) in order to maintain it&#x27;s percentage in the fund. Other shares are held by other funds or institutions, and so on. So the reality is it is difficult for the shorts to cover quickly.<p>This isn&#x27;t a problem during &quot;normal times&quot; because the volatility of the stock is relatively low and thus the short margin interest that you have to pay to keep borrowing the stock is a small percentage. But as the price runs up, that interest and collateral requirements grow dramatically since the broker needs to be sure you can pay up if you have to buy the shares at the current market price.')
