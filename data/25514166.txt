They know something hurts but it&#x27;s not a reason to stop doing what they wanted. The ones I&#x27;ve known often overcompensated for that, once they figure it out in puppyhood, and were especially gentle and considerate.<p>I had a bluetick &#x2F; border collie hound that had the same oblivious reaction to pain; she got tangled in an electric fence once and chewed the wire through before i realized what was happening. Then went on to catch her rabbit.')
