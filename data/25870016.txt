If you write %s and pass an int, it will give you a warning. This also works if you are using a wrapper that ultimatively calls printf!<p>Constrast with cout, which will happily let you print out the wrong variable. It won&#x27;t print out garbage of course because it helpfully knows to print out the int differently, but it can&#x27;t give you a warning. Also, it&#x27;s difficult to do localization with it.')
