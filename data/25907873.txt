This product, which uses multifocal contact lens technology, \npassively stimulates the entire peripheral retina with light myopically defocused by the non-central power of the contact lens. Kubota \nGlasses technology leverages nanotechnology in its electronic glasses-based device and seeks to reduce the progression of myopia by \nactively stimulating the retina for shorter periods while maintaining high-quality central vision and not affecting daily activities.&quot;</i><p>Which seems to indicate the main beneficiaries will be children, to slow the progression of myopia.  As it mentions, there are already multi-focal contact lenses used for that purpose.<p>Since the contacts don&#x27;t seem to be marketed at adults, I suspect this will be similar.')
