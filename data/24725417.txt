However, we go a bit further where we have a visual dashboard that makes it much easier to manage secrets in different projects and environments as a whole. In Doppler you can easily edit them in a dashboard, inherit from other configs or reference other secrets. We also have permission control, audit logs, versioning and rollbacks.\nIn your case, no more need to run `chamber write ENV_NAME SECRET_NAME SECRET_VALUE` to sync each secret to each application&#x2F;region combination you have. \nWe also have a direct integration with AWS so that you can automatically sync all secrets to Parameter Store, should you want to continue pulling from it in production.')
