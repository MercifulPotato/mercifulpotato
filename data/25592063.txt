This is neither an extraordinary nor controversial claim.<p>Now, I believe that the claim about Italy was a bit tongue in cheek but at the same time it is reasonable based on facts and should be thought provoking:<p>We now know that there were cases of Covid-19 in Italy and France, and perhaps US iirc, at the same time, and perhaps before, the outbreak around that market in Wuhan, as early as November. (So, yes the virus did stealthily traverse continents, by the way)<p>Now, based on that why would the origin necessarily be Wuhan? Logically, the earlier the cases the closer they are from origin.<p>The origin of infectious diseases is always tricky to establish. After years we&#x27;re still not sure about the origin of MERS and possibly SARS. It took decades to pinpoint that HIV appeared in the 1920s, almost 60 years before it can to the world&#x27;s attention.<p>While it is still most likely that Covid-19 arose in China we do not know where and when.')
