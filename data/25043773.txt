There&#x27;s two big challenges for us there\n1) Many cloud environments are broken in various ways for rr recording - I spend way too much time guiding our users to the few that do work\n2) The GDB frontend really isn&#x27;t the best way to view all the underlying information<p>Pernosco is well on its way to address the second part of this. Its replayer is quite a bit nicer than the open source rr one and I have high hopes for the platform in general.<p>For the first one, all I can do is plead with the cloud vendors not to mess up the environment. Since this is HN, if you&#x27;re working for a cloud provider, please ask your engineering team not to break rr. Otherwise I&#x27;ll have to spend time migrating our users off your platform, which will be fun for neither of us.<p>Anyway, congrats to Robert and Kyle on the launch. Wish you all the best.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;julialang.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2020&#x2F;05&#x2F;rr&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;julialang.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2020&#x2F;05&#x2F;rr&#x2F;</a>')
