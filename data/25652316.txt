Compress it to liquefy it. Store this in some temporary storage tanks.<p>Then when you want to make electricity, pipe the hydrogen and oxygen into a fuel cell. Then electricity and pure drinking water comes out.<p>Then you can bottle the pure drinking water and sell it locally for an additional profit.<p>I havenâ€™t analyzed the cost for all the technology and infrastructure. But this idea seems mechanically simpler than the gravity brick idea. Additionally, you can transport the LH and LOX, to other areas if necessary.')
