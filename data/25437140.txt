(you misrepresent what I said about that).<p>So the article&#x27;s reporting fits within my expectation - also noting that a net change of 70,000 people is very small.<p>The voter rolls will significantly lag outside of election day and - again - is much less likely to include transient residents who won&#x27;t bother to register, so it&#x27;s no more likely to be a complete reflection of what has happened than the cellphone data source used here. Something like 40% of the NYC population is not registered to vote.')
