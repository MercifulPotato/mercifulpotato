The top 3 comments, as I write this, can be summarized as &quot;no, it&#x27;s your fault and you&#x27;re stupid for making the fault&quot;.</i><p>It seems that people annoyed mostly by &quot;complexity gremlins&quot;. They are so annoyed, that they miss previous sentence &quot;weâ€™re too tired to figure it out right now.&quot; Guys fucked up their system, they restored it the best they could, they tried to figure out what happened, but failed. So they decided to do PR right now, to explain what they know, and to continue the investigation later.<p>But people see just &quot;complexity gremlins&quot;. The lesson learned is do not try any humor in a postmortem. Be as serious, grave, and dull as you can.')
