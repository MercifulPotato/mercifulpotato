Republicans lost the popular vote in five of the last six presidential elections. In the next presidential election there will be many eligible voters who weren&#x27;t even born last time they won. The Senate gives a seven point advantage to Republicans. So please, explain to me where you get this idea that the right is &quot;treated unfairly,&quot; because it&#x27;s getting very hard to see how this argument is being made in good faith.')
