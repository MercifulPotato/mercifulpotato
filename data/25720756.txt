I read the Visa&#x2F;MC - Pornhub thing as more as a case of of Visa&#x2F;MC saying &quot;look, we think its clear that there&#x27;s illegal stuff happening on your platform; we&#x27;re not going to play detective here; we don&#x27;t want to run the risk of being complicit of processing payments for illegal stuff, so we&#x27;re cutting you off.&quot; That is, it&#x27;s a statement about their desire to (not) take legal risks. They are operating within a legal context where <i>others</i> may do what you are suggesting and then put them in legal jeopardy.')
