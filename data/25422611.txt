It was &quot;we need more data&quot; over and over and, <i>on each round</i>, I could watch other people&#x27;s riskier changes just fly by without a shred of evidence that they even did what they were claimed to (let alone that they were beneficial). &quot;Need more data&quot; is not always just inertia. It&#x27;s often a way of defending territory or enforcing hierarchy. Being &quot;data driven&quot; only really works when it&#x27;s done consistently, and abuses called out.')
