It&#x27;s not rational in most cases to try to run third party candidates given how the math works out currently, but we desperately need to make that viable. Perhaps if a single-issue voting reform party was created and it deliberately and rigorously avoided all wedge issues it could work. The second you tack on any other platform agenda it&#x27;ll be the same old story, though.')
