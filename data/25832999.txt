The kids had to be there before 7.30 or they will be hungry. Latest time non starving kid can be there is 7.30 not 9am.<p>It is &quot;oh btw classes start at 9 but your kid have to be before 7.30&quot;.<p>There are two possible latest times and it really cannot be answered until we know if kid ate or not. Is it possible to bring non fed kid at 9, sure but it&#x27;s not right. This is poorly stated question for a comprehension test.<p>Because it is not stated whether kid is fed or not, therefore latest possible time is 7.30<p><pre><code>    KidFed Arrival Outcome\n    True   7.30    Good\n    False  7.30    Good\n    True   9.00    Good\n    False  9.00    Bad\n</code></pre>\n9.00 is only time with possible bad outcome.<p>My point is that it is very poorly specified test and that&#x27;s causing poor results.')
