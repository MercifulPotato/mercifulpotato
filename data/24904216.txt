The languages are listed in descending order of text &gt; symbol.<p>Clojure:<p><pre><code>  (apply max numbers)\n</code></pre>\nJavaScript:<p><pre><code>  Math.max(...numbers);\n</code></pre>\nAPL (I couldn&#x27;t find how to apply this to an arbitrary array):<p><pre><code>   ⌈&#x2F; 4 3 2 7 5 1 3\n</code></pre>\nHere’s a guess:<p><pre><code>  ⌈ numbers\n</code></pre>\nThe most aymbol-focused is the least readable to me, and Clojure is the only one that returned good results from a Google search to figure out what was going on.  Both “JavaScript ...” and “APL ⌈” gave me irrelevant results.<p>Furthermore, how is this<p><pre><code>  (if a\n      true-cond\n      false-cond)\n</code></pre>\nharder to read than this, aside from familiarity?<p><pre><code>  if (a) {\n    trueCond\n  } else {\n    falseCond\n  }\n</code></pre>\nIn the latter case, the if&#x2F;else requires a special syntactical structure.  And since it cannot be used as an expression, the common desire to conditionally assign a result spawned the ternary operator: a whole separate syntax that only applies when you want to assign a result to something.  In lisps, you just use “if” wherever you need a binary conditional.')
