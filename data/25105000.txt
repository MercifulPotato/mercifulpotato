Item(by='OJFord', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605475335, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25104471, text='I replaced my built-in oven recently, and it said it could also be (approved for use I assume that means) &#x27;built-under&#x27;; I didn&#x27;t check but I assume you just get screw-in feet, slide it under the counter&#x2F;hob, then put the kickboard back. Or maybe no feet it just goes in a cabinet with the door off&#x2F;drawers out.<p>I suppose my point really was just that it&#x27;s all standard sizes, it&#x27;s not like fitted kitchens are custom built by electricians as well as cabinet makers with the guts hanging out of appliances, no enclosure to speak of.<p>It&#x27;s shocking what these things cost though, compared to BOM. Ovens from Â£100-400 are basically all the same just with different fascias.. but if your kitchen is exposed enough that you don&#x27;t want the oven fascia to look crap.. what can you do put stump up?')
