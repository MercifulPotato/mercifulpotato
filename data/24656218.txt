We certainly wish the original text be survived. But it won&#x27;t happen anyway. It was copied, modified thus increasing the value along the way.<p>It&#x27;s either valuable enough to be copied or not to be copied and lost. We have certain old text because it has been copied and modified.<p>If they have time and resource to complain it, they should rather start copying the original photo and films in order to preserve the historically important materials. The more copied, more change to survive.')
