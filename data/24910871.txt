I remember teaching myself VB6 in sixth grade and after realizing the reason &quot;No Code&quot; solutions are misleading are 1. There isn&#x27;t really such a thing and 2. The power of computers comes precisely from the ability to.. code them at a meaningful level of abstraction. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, &quot;No code&quot; may have a purpose, but I see that purpose being more in line with mock-ups and concept tests; not eliminating code.')
