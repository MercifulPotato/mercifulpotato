React just nailed it and I say that as a person who REALLY dislikes Facebook as a company.<p>The React team at Facebook has their act together and does a great job.  The new Facebook redesign with chunks is really amazing.<p>React hooks I think as they are currently designed is an anti-pattern because of the way they&#x27;re too &#x27;magic&#x27; and can bust the cache accidentally and cause performance bugs but conversely can cause data loss bugs because your code doesn&#x27;t properly use hooks.<p>Bad use of an API should yield compilation errors (in Typescript) NOT cause all sort of runtime errors with caching.')
