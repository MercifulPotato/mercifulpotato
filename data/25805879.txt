But i also don&#x27;t know what the Gradle authors could have done instead. Writing build scripts in Java 1.6 (the latest version at the time Gradle was written) would have been a showstopper. Kotlin didn&#x27;t exist. XML alone isn&#x27;t expressive enough, so you would have needed some sort of Ant-like crummy language expressed in XML.<p>Buildr, which i think predated Gradle, used Ruby. I&#x27;m not sure Ruby is any better than Groovy here.<p>Perhaps Jython would have been a good choice.')
