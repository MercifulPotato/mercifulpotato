This would change my opinion on this story.<p>I can vouch for this. My iPhone 6 was under 2 years old and had 82% battery health according to the Apple diagnostics when I experienced the unexpected shutdowns.<p>The shutdowns were frequent (at least once per day) and, because the phone had to be plugged in before it could be restarted, were incredibly frustrating.<p>I took it to an Apple Store. The Genius refused to acknowledge any fault. They ran the diagnostics which showed 82% and refused to replace the battery, even if I paid, as it was above their 80% threshold for replacement.<p>I spoke to the manager, and they stood firm. No replacement, even if I paid. I was extremely persistent and they simply would not budge.<p>The throttling resolved my shutdown problem.')
