It&#x27;s a very different beast with its own tradeoffs.<p>By colocating several different application specific processors under one roof and selling it as a CPU, Apple may have revitalized&#x2F;invented something new. It&#x27;s a bit like the iPhone - taking elements that were already there and catalyzing them into a new form. This new not-quite-a-CPU SoC likely has significant implications for the future of computing that should be discussed and detailed. \nBecause,<p>There Ain&#x27;t No Such Thing As A Free Lunch.')
