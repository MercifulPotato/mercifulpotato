Never used Nim before  but there are some great tutorials [1].<p>It&#x27;s a nice language with a great standard library. Implicit static typing is great after a bit of getting used to. Some things like tuples or &quot;Object Variants&quot; are fun to use.<p>The only thing I&#x27;m missing is strong debugging support. You can use GDB and there is even some basic support for debugging in VSCode (through gdb behind the scenes). But most of the time I had to fall back to simple &quot;echo&quot; debugging because names were sometimes mangled, variables were not displayed or lines in nim did not correspond with lines in the final output, making debugging a chore. Unfortunately someone once started to write an embedded debugger (ENDB) for all platforms, but development stopped.<p>What&#x27;s your opinion on this? In some way I would love to use Nim more in the future, but I&#x27;m afraid, that the larger the codebase gets, the more I&#x27;d suffer just because of debugging...<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nim-lang.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;tut1.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nim-lang.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;tut1.html</a>')
