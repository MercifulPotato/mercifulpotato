Described informally as &quot;an iPad in a Mac mini’s body,&quot;[2] the DTK carries a model number of A2330 and identifies itself as &quot;Apple Development Platform.&quot;[3][4] <i>It consists of an A12Z processor</i>, 16 GB RAM, 512 GB SSD, and a variety of common I&#x2F;O ports (USB-C, USB-A, HDMI 2.0, and Gigabit Ethernet) in a Mac mini case&quot;<p>&quot;..Even that DTK hardware, which is running on an existing iPad chip that we don’t intend to put in a Mac in the future – it’s just there for the transition – the Mac runs awfully nice on that system. It’s not a basis on which to judge future Macs ... but it gives you a sense of what our silicon team can do when they’re not even trying – and they’re going to be trying.&quot; - Apple SVP<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Developer_Transition_Kit_(2020)" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Developer_Transition_Kit_(2020...</a><p>&quot;The Apple A12Z Bionic is a 64-bit ARM-based system on a chip (SoC) designed by Apple Inc.The chip was unveiled on March 18, 2020, as part of a press release for the iPad Pro (2020), the first device to use it.[1] Apple officials touted the chip as faster than most Windows laptops of the time.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Apple_A12Z" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Apple_A12Z</a><p>HTH')
