In practice most of the time individuals overlook transgressions, but if there is a formal complaint they don&#x27;t. In this case the manager who hired the anti union org certainly got noticed about this since the notice popped up on their site, I&#x27;m pretty sure that person filed a formal complaint. And as Googles employee handbook says that doing things like this will get you fired she got fired, even though it was pretty innocent.<p>Similarly if someone made anti union messages pop up when you visit union sites I am 100% sure they would get fired as well, for the same reasons. You can talk about almost anything internally, (People like Damore aren&#x27;t uncommon at all, the outside world just got hung up on him for some reason), just take your job and company code seriously.')
