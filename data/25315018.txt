No friends, co-workers, doctors, mentors etc over 55 who you care about. And not caring about anyone over 55 in general, as fellow human persons.<p>And also not relying on anyone over 55 in an indirect sense - those working in and managing hospitals, legal systems, physical infrastructure, schools and universities, banking, agriculture, industry and so on.<p>If you truly are a person like that, for you there is nothing to be concerned about - and you are probably enjoying the reaction you are getting here.')
