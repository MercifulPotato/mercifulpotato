Which is an obvious and pointless statement, yes, of course github&#x27;s security team should make sure github&#x27;s code doesn&#x27;t have vulnerabilities. That&#x27;s the most important duty of their job.<p>The fact that the Gemfile has been leaked changes nothing about what the security team should be doing.<p>Your comment doesn&#x27;t really contribute to discussion because it&#x27;s not presenting novel information, and it&#x27;s misleading because, per the reasons above, their security team&#x27;s priorities goals&#x2F;responsibilities&#x2F;behaviors&#x2F;etc aren&#x27;t really impacted by this, and your comment sorta implies otherwise.')
