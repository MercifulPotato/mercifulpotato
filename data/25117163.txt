We&#x27;re going to switch to Sling. We had Sling back in 2016 with alright results, but weren&#x27;t impressed with app stability and the frequency of steaming issues. In practice, using any steaming provider login to the network-specific app gives good results.<p>Cutting the cord was a great proposition 5 years ago, but it has been so painful to get consistent service at a price that doesn&#x27;t make a basic cable package look competitive.')
