Item(by='toast0', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611944203, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25960157, text='&gt; It seems only natural to me that public schools should be handled by the municipality&#x27;s government, or maybe the provincial one directly.<p>At least in California, school districts are independent from cities, and while most are wholy within one county, some aren&#x27;t. The school district is the municipality. California municipal districts for the most part have elected boards, although the elections don&#x27;t have to be run if there aren&#x27;t more candidates than seats.<p>Pay attention when a California mayoral candidate says they&#x27;re going to fix the schools. That&#x27;s a sign that they either don&#x27;t understand how schools in California work, or they think you don&#x27;t. School districts aren&#x27;t subordinate to cities, so mayors have no power over them. With a slight caveat that because San Francisco is a unified city and county, the mayor of SF is also on the SF county board, and counties have some power over school districts, but not a whole lot.')
