The problem I encounter is having to specify which commit to fixup to when calling `--fixup`, which I think means having to look at my commit history. Instead, my process so far includes just describing the commit I want to fixup in my commit message, in a way that makes sense to me when I&#x27;m going through the interactive rebase.<p>Do you have a good way to deal with this?')
