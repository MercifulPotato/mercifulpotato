We want to create economic security for anyone who works for themselves. We offer an easy way for 1099 workers to apply for health&#x2F;dental&#x2F;vision coverage. We&#x27;re also expanding to other spaces like tax and financial management, so as to make it financially accessible for anybody who juggles multiple gigs, or is just pursuing a dream on their own.<p>As a business, we sit on a unique position and have partnerships with a ton of giant companies (think Doordash, Postmates, Instacart, and many more) who want to better serve their workforce. It&#x27;s rare that a startup has a good mission and a good business, but here we are.<p>On the engineering side we use Swift, Node, Typescript, GraphQL, Postgres, Python, Scala&#x2F;Akka and some cool machine learning models you&#x27;re going to love hearing about. Your work will be feature-heavy, and you&#x27;ll get to define the future of our app&#x27;s architecture and infrastructure. You will grow naturally into our iOS Tech Lead.<p>We have our beautiful headquarters located in SOMA (San Francisco) close to South Park, and will be opening a new office in Salt Lake City once the pandemic ends. That said, we are a remote-first company and nurture remote workers from all over the United States. We offer fantastic benefits (after all, it&#x27;s our product!) and you&#x27;ll be surrounded by the most driven, smartest people I know. We have a supportive, productive culture that&#x27;s respectful of your own personal time and well-being.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.stridehealth.com&#x2F;careers" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.stridehealth.com&#x2F;careers</a> but hit me up at pedro.tabio at stridehealth.com and let&#x27;s talk :)')
