I toured their facility the 90s.  If you read pretty much any magazine, Quad&#x2F;Graphics probably printed it.  They had a gigantic 10+ story warehouse full of everything they had ever worked on, and automatic fork lifts on wires to fetch or put away anything.  We met the founder Harry Quadracci, and it seemed to be the thing he was most proud of.  They had printing presses the size of a school, and the warehouse dwarfed them.<p>A fire destroyed everything in july, 2002... 1 person waiting in a car outside was killed when the building collapsed on them.  2 weeks later later, Harry was found dead in pine lake under the pier on his property.  It was deemed an accidental drowning, but if you could see how much he cared about that factory, you&#x27;d probably question the coroner.  I heard a rumor he had rocks in his pockets.')
