The choice isn&#x27;t between &quot;duct tape&quot; or &quot;oven-engineering.&quot; It&#x27;s between poor and good design.<p>A well designed solution doesn&#x27;t feel like duct tape, nor should it be &quot;too clever&quot; with a crazy multiple-inheritance architecture that no one but the author can understand.<p>In fact, it sounds like the extremes described in this article are <i>both</i> crap developers, with different flavors of crap on the menu.<p>I insist on solid engineering. Nothing that feels like duct tape, but nothing that approaches over-engineering either. Easy to understand and easy to extend to the point of &quot;OF COURSE this makes sense!&quot;<p>It&#x27;s not so much &quot;in the middle&quot; as &quot;robust design vs one or another flavor of garbage.&quot; A strong designer is needed to get to that point, and maybe duct tape is better for shipping product than over-engineering, so if you HAVE to choose, the duct tape end of the spectrum is better. But even better to have a solid software architect who can come up with a good solution that people can use and extend and understand.')
