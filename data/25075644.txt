Flyd[0] is my current library preference for JS. RxJS just has so many more abstractions than you need to do the job, and it doesn&#x27;t make it very easy to incorporate whatever your own functional paradigm might be even though you would expect it to excel at this...It forces RxJS conformity, instead of being &quot;just a function&quot; that can itself be easily composed.<p>(I also think async generator functions are a great tool for reactivity that are underused)<p>Anyway, there&#x27;s a huge amount of extra language that you need to develop around RxJS...at first I didn&#x27;t mind because I thought I was getting multi-language benefits: &quot;Oh! Reactive Extensions are available in a variety of different languages! Sweet!&quot; But the <i>specific</i> patterns and terms learned in one implementation tend to be vastly different than in others. Sure, you&#x27;re still working with the same patterns at a high level, but don&#x27;t expect any of the same methods to be present or even the same basic syntax, even if the languages are similar.<p>[0] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;paldepind&#x2F;flyd" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;paldepind&#x2F;flyd</a>')
