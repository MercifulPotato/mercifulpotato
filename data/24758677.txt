Let&#x27;s be frank: recruiters are bottom-of-the-totem pole, lowest-common-denominator bottom-feeders.<p>No matter how we feel, the process still goes through recruiters.<p>In a company I used to work for, we built a way where we removed the company and uni name to remove biases from recruiters. Most recruiters flat out refused to use it and trust us because they considered that a very important signal. The decision is not upto just developers.<p>&gt;  I heard a fun anecdote of Evan Spiegel attending an LA hackathon maybe 6 or 7 years ago. Some nerdy engineer showed him that he figured out how to get around Snapchat&#x27;s spam filter. Spiegel offered him a job on the spot.<p>I am sure we will all have our anecdotal examples like this and I am not against side projects. I agree with the post author that side projects are great, but don&#x27;t expect them to count towards your next job. If they do, then great.')
