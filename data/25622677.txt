I think that’s because I don’t really know the HS area that well, haven’t kept in touch with people there outside of immediate family, so I don’t feel like a local at all.<p>Honestly the only place that feels like “home” to me is where I went to college. But that’s one of those cultural things, you can be “from” the place you went off to college. And now that I’m coming up on two decades post-graduation, that feeling of familiarity is fading, though the nostalgia and “homey-ness” remains.<p>Why does everyone care so much about “where you’re from” anyway, sheesh :)')
