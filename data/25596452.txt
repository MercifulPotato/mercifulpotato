You have to manually allow it after you arrive.  But when you arrive to a completely blank content area, you may be left wondering if the page simply hasn&#x27;t completed loading.<p>Obviously once I realize it has loaded, but it&#x27;s blank, I assume it&#x27;s because it requires javascript.  So I enable it and reload, and it works as expected.')
