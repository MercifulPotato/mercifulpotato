The inside of these machines tends to be an elaborate, compact mesh of components, not well suited to accommodating much customization outside of the specs of perfectly compatible components.<p>I imagine a different keyboard would require space to accommodate both types in any chassis, otherwise making multiple processes for each chassis and keyboard. That gets expensive fast. It also increases surface area for problems, which is expensive in terms of customer support, preparing and fixing processes, reputation, etc.<p>Their limited options are partially to ensure quality, reduce price points, and decrease time to market. It’s a trade off. I’m personally content with their choice - it’s why I tend to stick with their hardware.<p>I could be wrong. This is just my uninformed take on it.')
