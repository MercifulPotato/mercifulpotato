Second, while a minor annoyance, the text is hard scroll and read, due to how constricted the reading area is. Hieroglyph gives you a huge blob, which isn&#x27;t super-fantastic either, but IMHO it&#x27;s slightly better than YouTube&#x27;s &quot;view transcript&quot; functionality, if nothing else, than for reasons of presentation.')
