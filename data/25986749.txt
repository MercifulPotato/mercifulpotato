They don&#x27;t listen to customer feedback or at least give any signs of hope or assurance. Their company image became too dominant and arrogant (I think it runs more than skin-deep).<p>Some of the nVidia&#x27;s huge market share is coming from the momentum they have. Linux users do not refresh their hardware too frequently generally.<p>I&#x27;m running a GTX680 on my primary Linux box, but it won&#x27;t be nVidia next time. I&#x27;ll be returning back to red team and I&#x27;d be a happy camper.')
