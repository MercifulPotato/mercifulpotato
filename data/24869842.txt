Especially if the precise level of energy is a free parameter of the theory, so the theory won&#x27;t change if the experiment fails.<p>&gt; And Hossenfelder is correct that in hindsight naturalness wasn&#x27;t a very good rule.<p>I believe that she is correct that naturalness wasn&#x27;t a very good rule at all, not just <i>in hindsight</i>. It&#x27;s as good a rule as it would have been to expect all numbers to be multiples of Pi.')
