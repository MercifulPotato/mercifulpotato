There&#x27;s definitely a lot of issues to overcome. Nice to get some perspectives.<p>I think there&#x27;s a decent space here for a sub internet that&#x27;s totally open to the public. Like a bootstrap internet. Right now in order to use The Internet you have to pay someone for access and use privately owned infrastructure.<p>There&#x27;s room for a layer below, on the community level. I imagine being able to buy or build a $5-$10 commodity item, press the ON switch, and be connected to a level of internet that&#x27;s lesser but still extremely useful, and can exist off the main internet if needed but doesn&#x27;t have to.<p>Not to mention uses in the event of emergencies.')
