Well, not in my case. I&#x27;m a very responsible and hard-working person. So, I usually work as hard as I can during the day. In the evening I&#x27;m too tired even to play with my children and spend time with my family. So I threw out any ideas about side projects...\nUntil I thought: if I can&#x27;t work for myself in the evenings, I should do it in the mornings. So, I tried to set up my alarm at 6 am and get up 2 hours before my usually day starts.\nAnd it changed everything to me. With these 2 extra hours I can do such a lot of things. I&#x27;m super-motivated and productive in the mornings. So, I&#x27;m working for my projects or hobby every morning (even weekends) and it really works for me.\nThe only thing you need to do this, is discipline to go to bed early in the evening. And it is way easier than to look for extra energy for a night work. \nI don&#x27;t know, if it will work for you. But in my case, it was the best decision I could make. Good luck, wish you to achieve all your goals.')
