Item(by='Proziam', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602688998, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24777356, text='&gt; Is it really possible we only have &lt;5 terror plots against our country in a given year<p>That depends on your definition. If you&#x27;re talking about organized 9&#x2F;11 style attacks, absolutely. It&#x27;s hard to bring plans like that together no matter how strong your convictions. If you&#x27;re talking &quot;random mentally ill person unleashes devastation on a group of US citizens&quot; then no, there&#x27;s certainly far more. That said, situations like that are best handled by local authorities. The Stoneman Douglas High School shooting is a prime example of that because as the story unraveled it became clear that the shooter had a history that was well known to the local police (and FBI if I recall?).')
