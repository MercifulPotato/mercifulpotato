The first one I saw that it was an infection and gave me antibiotics. That didn&#x27;t seem to do much.<p>Then as it persisted another urologist thought it might be urine backflowing down my vas deferens and I took beta blockers to improve my urinary flow.<p>Finally the urologist basically said that sometimes after you have an infection you can have idiopathic pain for a long time afterwards.<p>And maybe that was it. It pretty much went away on its own. I feel quite fortunate for that, because it really sucked. If it had persisted I suspect I would&#x27;ve seen quite a few more urologists!')
