I&#x27;ve bought an Apple Watch recently and I was mightily afraid it would increase my phone addiction even more. \nInstead, it got way better and I keep my phone&#x2F;watch in silent mode 99% of the time. \nSudden notifications won&#x27;t happen anymore and I definitely won&#x27;t be starting to type out text messages on the watch or start browsing the internet. \nImportant events, such as phone calls from &#x27;favorite&#x27; contacts will still get through though and I still have the option to make phone calls in case of emergency.')
