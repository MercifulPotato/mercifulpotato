I&#x27;m a big jazz fan and like to listen to complete albums of my favorite artists, but if I just want to relax in the evening, I turn to Spotify playlists without too exciting tracks (For example the playlists &quot;Coffe Table Jazz&quot; or &quot;Late Night Jazz&quot;).<p>Recently I noticed that in one playlist called &quot;Evening Jazz&quot;, the music seemed to be ... odd. The tracks sounded generic. As if played by proficient musicians, but without any intent or vision. When I tried to find out which artist the currently playing track was from, I didn&#x27;t find anything. No information about them in Spotify or elsewhere. The same for every other track in the playlist.<p>What kind of music is this? Has it been generated with some kind of GPT-3 for music? Look at the Album titles, artist names, cover artwork. Listen to the musical structure, everything seems generic, superficial.<p>Two other examples of Spotify playlists with this kind of ... &quot;music&quot;... I guess? are  &quot;Chilled Jazz&quot; and &quot;Peaceful Piano&quot;.<p>Does anybody know something about that?')
