Facebook will always act in Facebook&#x27;s interests, the hedge funds pointing at trolls and yelling (trolls they themselves seeded?). Makes Facebook&#x27;s interests align with the hedge funds and run counter to this particular group. Group is shutdown. Hedge funds outsmarted the group who had outsmarted them. It&#x27;s a blip on Facebook&#x27;s horizon at best other than balancing PR concerns. Will people hold it against Facebook or can you spin it as justified by &quot;hate&quot;? The hedge funds, their investors and political connections <i>will</i> hold it against Facebook should Facebook take the other side. Facebook will currently be concerned about a new approach to regulation with the dems now in power. Facing down that monopoly regulation to make it toothless will be Facebook&#x27;s number 1 concern right now unless they&#x27;ve already got it locked up, which is more than possible.<p>Are we ok with this? We talk about endemic corruption like it&#x27;s the most normal thing in the world. But it isn&#x27;t. Reform or perish.')
