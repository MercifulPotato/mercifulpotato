Item(by='triceratops', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610750455, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25797480, text='&gt; Basically everything youâ€™re saying is low-grade bullshit<p>I.e. &quot;I can&#x27;t argue with actual numbers so I&#x27;m just going to scoff at you instead.&quot;<p>Denial&#x27;s a powerful drug my friend.<p>&gt; anyone who dies with covid is reported to have died of covid (like most metrics in the US)<p>First off, Taiwan and South Korea have low cases, not just low deaths. So saying &quot;It&#x27;s impossible to stop the spread&quot; is clear nonsense. And you haven&#x27;t presented any evidence that other countries don&#x27;t report Covid deaths in this way.<p>Moreover, how many of those US deaths were completely asymptomatic Covid patients that died of something else entirely? And how do you explain ICUs being packed out and LA running out of mortuary space if all those people would have died anyway under normal circumstances? The fully asymptomatic deaths are the only ones you should discount. Everyone else rightly counts in the Covid mortality stats. Doesn&#x27;t matter if their obesity or cancer or old age or some other underlying issue made them more vulnerable; it was the Covid that killed them then rather than later.<p>I do agree that arguing numbers is a losing tactic - with someone who&#x27;s in deep denial because they decided early on this whole pandemic business was BS and no evidence was going to change their mind. Stay safe buddy.')
