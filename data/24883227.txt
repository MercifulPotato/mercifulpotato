Tense muscles will exert more force on the things they&#x27;re attached to like bones and organs, usually in opposing directions, which is what causes damage from otherwise trivial impacts. That&#x27;s why, all other things being equal, drunk drivers experience fewer injuries in auto accidents - slower reaction times mean they don&#x27;t react in time to tense up for the crash.<p>The human body is incredibly resilient under the right circumstances. The most striking incident in recent memory is Shayna Richardson [1]. She face planted (excuse the vernacular) into a parking lot on her first solo skydive and survived... to give birth to her son eight months later (both are alive and well today).<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Shayna_Richardson" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Shayna_Richardson</a>')
