That left me with 2 major options: Linuxes without systemd (Gentoo, in my case) or BSDs.</i><p><i>&gt; Since I run FreeBSD servers anyway, I just migrated to FreeBSD.</i><p>Basically because the author hates systemd (not an invalid point, but that ship has sailed) and has familiarity with FreeBSD. This isn’t really an article that’s trying to convince people to run FreeBSD. It’s trying to explain why they left macOS. Where they ended up is less consequential, IMO.')
