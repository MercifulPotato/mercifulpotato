So it&#x27;s obvious that EU demands to have the contract fulfilled no matter where vaccines are produced, why should the EU care about that?<p>The elephant in the room is that there might be indeed an export ban of vaccines manufactured in the UK, disguised as contract obligations.<p>Yet when EU mentioned export ban it became some sort of &quot;hostility&quot;, while AZ doing it with UK isn&#x27;t hostility but contract obligations?<p>What if EU slapped in the contracts that all BioNTech production would be all for Europe first due to the contract obligations? As long as it&#x27;s hidden from public it&#x27;s not an export ban, right?<p>All of this does indeed sound like politics, smoke and mirrors. So I hope AZ gets squeezed to at least make it clear that some contracts are being privileged over others.')
