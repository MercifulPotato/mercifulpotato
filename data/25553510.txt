There&#x27;s also a lot of room at the utility scale for improved designs of the old Edison batteries. Nickel-Iron chemistries are heavy and initially expensive, but:<p>1. They can last effectively <i>forever</i> with periodic electrolyte topoff, proper charge control, decent thermal management, and good contaminant prevention policies.<p>2. They (and their electrolyte effluvia) aren&#x27;t terribly toxic.<p>Most other utility scale chemistries have limited lifespans and degrees of toxicity and disposal&#x2F;recycling difficulties.<p>Hell, this could even be a Long Now project: design and operate a 10,000 year utility-scale NiFe battery. There&#x27;s no theoretical reason why not.')
