Not saying such corruptions do not exist in Beijing, corruptions exist everywhere in places like Beijing, just pointing out that you won&#x27;t be able to notice them like the way how you described.<p>You are basically suggesting that the restaurant intentionally let a first time visitor (you) who they didn&#x27;t know &amp; trust to know the special relationship they have with the &quot;chief of police&quot;. Why would they do that? A revenge to get rid of the guy?<p>It is also pretty strange to have &quot;chief of police&quot; accepting such high risk and low value &quot;free meal&quot; as gift. As a corrupted official, will you feel comfortable walking into a restaurant fitted with security cameras to enjoy your &quot;free meal&quot;? Sounds like a failed IQ test to me.')
