Everything that doesn&#x27;t use apt is in there, so many of them just run &quot;pip install foo&quot; or &quot;npm install foo&quot;, at least this way I don&#x27;t have to remember which program uses which package manager.<p>I used to be very adamant that if something did not have an apt repository then I wouldn&#x27;t use it, but that&#x27;s become hard to do. Even the piece of software I use the most, my browser, is not managed by apt. Firefox (developer edition) lives in ~&#x2F;.local&#x2F;lib and updates itself.')
