An example would be that there are a couple of libraries that do &quot;generic collections&quot; in C using the preprocessor (instead of using templates). So, you could imagine something like this:<p><pre><code>    #define VEC_TYPE double\n    #include &lt;c-vector.h&gt;\n    #undef VEC_TYPE\n</code></pre>\nand that would provide you a type like &quot;vec_double&quot;, a vector specialized for the double type. You&#x27;d want to import that once for each vector type you wanted.<p>It&#x27;s not the most common use-case (and you can argue if it&#x27;s a good idea at all), but it is at least a reasonable reason why you&#x27;d want a header file without #pragma once.')
