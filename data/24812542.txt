English orthography is practically irregular (although it&#x27;s vaguely, chaotically regular if you subject each word to an analysis based on most probable language origin.) Figuring out how to pronounce a word you haven&#x27;t seen before in English is only slightly easier than trying to figure out how to pronounce a word you haven&#x27;t seen before in Mandarin.<p>&gt; Isn&#x27;t that the point? IIRC, English was originally about 50&#x2F;50 Saxon and French - most of the fancy &#x2F; unintuitive &#x2F; rule-breaking words are French loan words (e.g., &quot;rendezvous&quot; &amp; &quot;accomplice&quot; are French, &quot;loan&quot; is old Norse).<p>Also, it&#x27;s far worse than this. The Normans changed the spelling of English words that were unpronounceable to them by adding a bunch of letters. One I remember is that the reason the &quot;-shire&quot; suffix is confusing is because before the Normans it was just &quot;-scr&quot;.<p>Also, British English tends to Anglicize French pronunciations, like &quot;herb,&quot; &quot;valet,&quot; etc. French borrows aren&#x27;t the major thing making English difficult to read and write. French orthography is also pretty bad (and Portuguese.)<p>obligatory: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;zompist.com&#x2F;spell.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;zompist.com&#x2F;spell.html</a>')
