That&#x27;s that whole ceremony with inspecting the bottle and sniffing the cork (to check for cork taint). And cork taint is a lot more likely on a 30-year-old bottle with a natural cork.<p>That ceremony seems officious and silly on an ordinary bottle of wine, but it&#x27;s there for a reason. It&#x27;s weird that a restaurant like Balthazar would dispense with it.')
