Item(by='cmroanirgo', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605483930, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25105487, text='There is a vast diversity of differences in these countries, from gdp to population density and cost of living. Every time my Australian government has signed &quot;free trade&quot; agreements it has meant massive sector decline in different clusters of industry, ranging from steel production to primary industry (food and veggies).<p>Eg. My family&#x27;s orchard no longer grows oranges, nor kiwi fruit, nor other exotic fruit due to &quot;free trade&quot;. The local supermarket chains (coles and woolworths) both decimated these industries by forcing farmers to suddenly sell at Asian market cost. My whole area used to be renowned for oranges... But there are all but a small handful of tiny orchards now.<p>Because of fruit fly, the other owners, including my family, had to destroy the trees. So, there&#x27;s no chance of ever returning the property to it&#x27;s former orchard status.<p>A secondary effect of &quot;free trade&quot; is that the above mentioned supermarkets started buying the land of the farmers they&#x27;d driven to the wall, and put in &quot;manager farmers&quot; who do not look after the land near as much as a family owned property does. Eg. Excessive use of pesticides, ignoring noxious weeds (a cost saving), use of temporary &amp; often overseas workers. All profits that used to go to local industries (eg hardware stores &amp; other shops) are now sent out from centralised warehouses.<p>To compound the problem, these &quot;free trade&quot; partners now also purchase the land, so even the profits now go overseas. China is now a very large landowner of Australia, and have long term 99yr leases on the ports of Melbourne and Darwin.<p>So, personally, I&#x27;m not a fan of anything &quot;free trade&quot;.')
