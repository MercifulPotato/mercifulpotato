The screen... okay, maybe a couple more milliseconds to draw the extra pixels, a bit more data for the hi-res textures&#x2F;whatever, but given the CPU speed and dedicated GPU (no more rendering all graphics directly from the main CPU) that shouldn&#x27;t matter. The camera isn&#x27;t even on during the boot process, much less in use. On my phone at least, the system takes a few seconds after boot to connect to network, and I <i>get</i> that. But beyond that, it&#x27;s not like the system needs to load every app into memory as it boots up, so why should the extra capabilities matter?')
