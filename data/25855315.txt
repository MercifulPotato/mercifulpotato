I have very nice friends who are antivax, does not mean I endorse their views from infowars. FLG is no different. They&#x27;re the one dissident group where human right lawyers in China, who risk their necks for a variety of causes, still could not corroborate their fantastic claims. Sometimes friends&#x2F;acquaintances&#x2F;family believe fake things, which is even less wild if said belief stems from being in a cult.<p>Black market organ trading is real problem but also stop gap solution in China, a country with abysmally low organ donation rates that&#x27;s improving since reforms. Reference per capita transplant rate, China is 1&#x2F;4 of west, however large the market, it isn&#x27;t enough to provide even parity availability, not to mention large numbers goes towards transplant tourism for western customers who never seem to get appropriate denouncement from FLG despite their massive discourse power. It takes two to tango.<p>At the end of the day, there are irreconcilable priorities and moral calculus due to differences in culture and development. CN transplant system is moving in the right direction - FLG didn&#x27;t convince west to stop getting transplants in China, CCP had to legislate against when the time was right. Things improve incrementally, otherwise FLG would need to resurrect long debunked accusations to suit their agenda.')
