Consider doing at least some research before commenting.<p>&gt; Orch OR was harshly criticized from its inception, as the brain was considered too &quot;warm, wet, and noisy&quot; for seemingly delicate quantum processes. However, evidence has now shown warm quantum coherence in plant photosynthesis, bird brain navigation, our sense of smell, and brain microtubules. The recent discovery of warm temperature quantum vibrations in microtubules inside brain neurons by the research group led by Anirban Bandyopadhyay, PhD, at the National Institute of Material Sciences in Tsukuba, Japan (and now at MIT), corroborates the pair&#x27;s theory and suggests that EEG rhythms also derive from deeper level microtubule vibrations. In addition, work from the laboratory of Roderick G. Eckenhoff, MD, at the University of Pennsylvania, suggests that anesthesia, which selectively erases consciousness while sparing non-conscious brain activities, acts via microtubules in brain neurons.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.elsevier.com&#x2F;about&#x2F;press-releases&#x2F;research-and-journals&#x2F;discovery-of-quantum-vibrations-in-microtubules-inside-brain-neurons-corroborates-controversial-20-year-old-theory-of-consciousness" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.elsevier.com&#x2F;about&#x2F;press-releases&#x2F;research-and-j...</a>')
