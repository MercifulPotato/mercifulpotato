I&#x27;m not distributing any GPLd code.<p>I think its a bit more complicated if Debian&#x2F;Red Hat are distributing my non GPLd app that links against a GPLd library that they also distribute, but aren&#x27;t really distributing them together.  The reason I say this, is because even though they are &quot;distributing&quot; both &quot;together&quot;, we wouldn&#x27;t say that GPLd code and BSD code that they &quot;distribute&quot; &quot;together&quot; infects the BSD code.<p>I might also agree that its not exactly the same issue, but I do think it should make one think about it.')
