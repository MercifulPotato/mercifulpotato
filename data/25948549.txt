Just to give some examples off the top of my head: large groups of III%ers participated in both the Capitol Attack and Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, and the BLM counter-protests were arguably part of the same phenomenon (and one of them shot three people in Kenosha).<p>&gt; 2) So you seriously believe all violence at BLM riots was solely because of false flag white supremacists? Really?<p>That&#x27;s a sloppy reading of what I said.  I merely pointed out a fact that makes attribution of violence that occurred at the protests difficult.<p>&gt; 3) Bullshit. Riots are not &quot;democratic process&quot; either - it&#x27;s people rejecting the established laws (like property rights) and proceeding to do their own thing. I mean they installed an &quot;autonomous zone&quot;, how is that not an attack on democracy?<p>It&#x27;s pretty obvious that it wasn&#x27;t an &quot;attack on democracy&quot; because they made reform demands to elected officials and were cooperating with the government:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;06&#x2F;11&#x2F;us&#x2F;seattle-autonomous-zone.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;06&#x2F;11&#x2F;us&#x2F;seattle-autonomous-zon...</a><p>&gt; The protest zone has increasingly functioned with the tacit blessing of the city. Harold Scoggins, the fire chief, was there on Wednesday, chatting with protesters, helping set up a call with the Police Department and making sure the area had portable toilets and sanitation services....<p>&gt; The demonstrators have also been trying to figure it out, with various factions voicing different priorities. A list of three demands was posted prominently on a wall: one, defund the Police Department; two, fund community health; and three, drop all criminal charges against protesters.<p>In comparison, the capitol attackers setup a gallows and were chanting things like &quot;Hang Mike Pence,&quot; because he wouldn&#x27;t unconstitutionally override the election (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.snopes.com&#x2F;fact-check&#x2F;hang-mike-pence-chant-capitol-riot&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.snopes.com&#x2F;fact-check&#x2F;hang-mike-pence-chant-capi...</a>, <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnn.com&#x2F;videos&#x2F;politics&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;15&#x2F;mike-pence-close-call-capitol-riot-foreman-vpx.cnn" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnn.com&#x2F;videos&#x2F;politics&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;15&#x2F;mike-pence-cl...</a>).  The sloppy false equivalences to deflect away from that are getting old.')
