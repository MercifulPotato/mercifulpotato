We remember that we were constantly told they were about to be overwhelmed back in April and they never were. Sweden has the lowest ICU capacity in Europe by far, yet never had overwhelmed hospitals despite very visibly turning its back on the policies supposedly required to avoid it. How can this be reconciled with there being genuine risk?<p>It&#x27;s apparent when you look at what happened back then that there was no actual risk of anything except running out of ventilators, a problem that was in turn caused by the panic - doctors were told this was a very deadly disease so were putting people on ventilators unnecessarily, partly because ventilation ensures all the air a patient breathes out is filtered, so they thought it was a way to keep hospitals clean. Once doctors realised ventilation was doing more harm than good and the age skews of the patients started to become publicly known, they backed off the ventilator use and there was never any shortage, of either ventilators nor beds.')
