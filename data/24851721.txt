There are extensions for Firefox that generate a new &quot;fingerprint&quot; periodically, e.g. 5 mins, for canvas, fonts, audio. Technically they don&#x27;t generate the actual fingerprint, they add noise to the information that trackers use to generate the fingerprint.<p>So even if your fingerprint is unique, it would be a new unique fingerprint every 5 minutes. Maybe there&#x27;s a logical fault with this plan, but, so far, I&#x27;m not seeing it.')
