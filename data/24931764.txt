So far, all of my jobs started out as me being hired as a freelancer and the company later approaching me to re-negotiate to become an employee.<p>I&#x27;ve had only one regular job interview, but it didn&#x27;t go well because they were not willing to guarantee me a room with a window and space to bring my collection of potted plants. My opinion is that the problem there was that we negotiated the employment contract too soon, before they knew why they should value my work.<p>Also, learn related topics. I&#x27;ve done documentation writing for patents and bookkeeping, which greatly helps when you&#x27;re hired to solve an actual business problem.')
