Like between words in sentences or between tokens in a line of code.<p>Spaces are better than mixing tabs and spaces, especially with &quot;modern&quot; (newer than 30 years old) tools. Especially if you use these editors enough that you are never indenting manually with backspace or tab&#x2F;spacebar.<p>So the options are tabs+spaces mixed together or just spaces unless you are dealing with tab delimited files with no spaces in them, which is rare.<p>The tradeoff is you lose the ability for different people working on the same thing to see different indentation levels. In exchange you don&#x27;t regularly get your formatting confusing messed up because of some kind of invisible control character confusion.')
