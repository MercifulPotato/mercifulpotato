How about we just hash the Java API names and then let the compiler automatically apply a mapping from hash to google name.<p>In the worst case Google is probably still allowed to ship a tool that renames uses of the java api directly in the source code and switches it over to whatever Google&#x27;s naming scheme is. If this wasn&#x27;t allowed it would be equivalent to making it illegal to not use the Java api because doing the same chance by hand would is not meaningfully different.')
