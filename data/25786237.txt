I think the reason they often devolve into &quot;discussions&quot; of sub-par quality is that much of politics can&#x27;t be explained by reason, and so is it with most of our values. We might attempt to do so, and philosophers and logicians have, but in the end that feels hollow. So then we might devolve to social pressure (i.e. resenting those who do not agree with us). When that fails, there are insults and after that violence.<p>It does not look like there will be any underpinning of all values and morals that a majority of us will accept or understand. So that leaves us the question: how should we disagree? I think the current way is fine, perhaps we could all strive to be less enflamed by views contrary to our own held beliefs, but do not think that the situation couldn&#x27;t be way, way worse.')
