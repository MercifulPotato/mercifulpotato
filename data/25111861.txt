I have always wanted to learn chess, beyond the basic rules, but never dedicated to it. I think I had some version of Chessmaster, but didn&#x27;t really do much with it. I just don&#x27;t know if it makes sense to really spend time on. I have, spent so much time on video games such as Starcraft 2, and other RTS games even. They sucked me in way more than chess.<p>But, with a new daughter, I wonder if it makes sense as maybe something I can teach her in the future. As a way of teaching those concepts. Especially slowing down, and being on a screen less (something I am already a horrible influence on). I would like to teach her &#x27;right&#x27; vs just some random horrible ideas I have (but also not crush her and discourage her)<p>Do you have any thoughts on that?')
