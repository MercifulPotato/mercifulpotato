Is that no different than saying &quot;It&#x27;s pointless to worry about climate change because the sun will explode and then there will be the heat death of the universe?&quot;<p>Surely there is some evidence that society and humanity is &quot;stabilizing&quot; to a certain plateau of morality and ethics not driven by religion but driven by humanism?<p>Lastly, &quot;Particularly if someone believes that it&#x27;s a religious issue dictated by a deity who takes an active interest in the world, then they&#x27;ll definitely believe they&#x27;re on the right side of history.&quot; is exactly why I ask!<p>Because the perspective of what is acceptable from these religious institutions is rapidly changing!<p>50 years ago a Christian church that is &quot;gay-friendly&quot; would be inconceivable. Today there are many. Of course there are those that would dismiss those out of hand, but by default the ethical positions of groups that supposedly represent eternal immortal deities is shifting - from evolution, to birth control, to homosexuality.<p>I&#x27;m genuinely wondering if people believe that transgender acceptance is somehow unique.')
