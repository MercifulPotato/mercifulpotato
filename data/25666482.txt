The votes are still <i>tallied</i> anonymously, and it&#x27;s impossible to post-hoc validate who you voted for, so it serves the anonymity purposes since you can&#x27;t check whether your investment in buying votes was successful.<p>Every state that does mail-in voting at all requires a signature. Alabama, South Carolina, North Carolina, and Missouri also require a witness -- Missisipi requires a notary.')
