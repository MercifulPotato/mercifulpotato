It would be much better if both sides were at least honest.<p>for example, the Democrats could say &quot;we understand some electoral college votes will be indirectly allocated to illegal immigrants, we also understand that because liberal states have more illegal immigrants it will help the left more than the right, but that&#x27;s the price to pay for counting every actual US citizen.&quot;<p>The republicans could say, &#x27;we want to make sure only US citizens count in terms of votes, and we will lose some actual US citizens plus we will undercount illegal immigrants (which is useful in other, non voting related ways) in order to ensure that.&#x27;<p>Then we can have a conversation.
