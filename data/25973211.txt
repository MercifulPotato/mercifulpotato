My rate is roughly .08 â‚¬&#x2F;kWh, for example, and I don&#x27;t get any subsidies to convert to solar, so I have no way to make it pay off for myself within 15 years (beyond the time most people expect to stay in a home here), while other states in the US subsidize so heavily or rates for electricity are so high most people have solar panels at least (see: Hawaii with among the highest costs for electricity in the US).<p>Regardless of electricity cost, all that electricity usage winds up with a lot of heat in a dwelling. To help offset the energy consumption in the future I plan to use a hybrid water heater that can act as a heat pump and dehumidifier and capture the excess heat as a way to reduce energy consumption for hot water.')
