Currently the conversions between String and &amp;str are really ugly to look at. In general the conversion between types don&#x27;t seem all that great with developers having to either use crates or write their own code. They need to take more inspiration from C# which continues to be the benchmark of elegance (obviously personal opinion). That said, rust is still better than C++ - namely its package management is great. I just wish the compiler doesn&#x27;t keep second guessing me :D')
