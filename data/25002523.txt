Then you just run a single instance of Nginx with the cert directory mounted as a volume. You will have to do a little extra work to maintain the nginx configuration to point to all your other containers, but it&#x27;s generally just copy&#x2F;pasting a block and changing the port to add a new service.<p>Kubernetes is cool but the only reason to run it on a single instance is because you want to.<p>Also docker-compose isn&#x27;t used to host stuff in production very often but it is used to manage running local instances quite a bit. I wouldn&#x27;t write it off as not worth learning.')
