I think Mark Zuckerberg may have discovered how to play &quot;Good cop, bad cop&quot; this year.<p>First, he played good cop trying to protect free speech while his employees played bad cop trying to censor. That was just a test to see how people reacted. To see if people perceived Mark Zuckerberg better after this.<p>Now Facebook is playing bad cop so that Trump can be the good cop and win the election.<p>Facebook is benefiting from inflationary monetary policy and Trump being eyeballs deep in debt will ensure that inflationary policy continues. Trump is not going to let the economy tank on his watch.<p>If Biden wins, he will let the economy tank early in his term and blame it on Trump.<p>BTW, Spotify also played &quot;Good cop, bad cop&quot; with its employees this year related to Joe Rogan. Again, Spotify management playing good cop letting Joe Rogan express himself and Spotify employees playing bad cop wanting him censored.')
