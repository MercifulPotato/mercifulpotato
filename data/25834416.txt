He couldn&#x27;t get into med school due to very average MCAT scores and so he started working in research making pennies. After some odd years of that and racking up a ton of credit card debt, he had a go at a coding bootcamp and found a job as a senior engineer making over 130K almost quadrupling his salary. Not sure whether that speaks more to his intelligence or to our industry. I&#x27;m happy for him that he doesn&#x27;t need to worry about next months rent anymore, though')
