As they say no model is perfect, some models are useful.<p>Historically good works of fiction provide a catalyst for social commentary, no need to be perfect, and they can focus on the specific issues they want.<p>For example I wouldn’t call “Paradise Lost” in any way accurate, but it had a profound effect on society, arguable for the better, when it was published.<p>If we’re expected to view works of art from the context of their time, and not associate modern sensibilities to them, the I would guess modern works should also be viewed through the modern lens too. I’m personally happy with that, as long as we’re engaging and talking about the missing pieces.')
