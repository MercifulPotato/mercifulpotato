They aim to simulate reality for a given piece of hardware. It seems as hardware gets better game engines implement something closer to the physics equations that describe the universe. With some AI as shortcuts for biological formations, we&#x27;ll soon have to reinvent the wheel less and take less algorithmic shortcuts whenever we need a basic simulation with gravity, lighting, materials etc.')
