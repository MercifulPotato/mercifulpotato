We&#x27;re renovating our kitchen in the next year and are planning on doing this, but haven&#x27;t had any luck finding a natural gas stove which is made to vent outdoors.<p>I don&#x27;t have counter evidence on hand but assuming the oven is vented outdoors, my understanding is that a hood should be relatively low-powered, not high, in order to then capture emissions from the stove top. It should be a function of size, height from the stove top, noise constraints, etc.')
