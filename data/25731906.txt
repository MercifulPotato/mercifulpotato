It was stopped due to perceived risks while coal was allowed to continue to be used at known high death toll of millions of people per year.<p>You cannot legally build a nuclear reactor in a normal way. You have to design it completely and then get it approved before you build it. This costs around $500 million dollars, as NuPower has shown. If you change the design much at all you have to get it approved all over again. Thus only one new reactor design in the US has been approved for 50 years and it still has not been built yet.')
