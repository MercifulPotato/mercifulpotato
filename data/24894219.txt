Perhaps that is the solution? Use the tool until one is comfortable with it? It seems to me the alternative is a bunch of ad-hoc, half-baked procedures that are going to cause a lot more pain down the line.<p>Or, of course, sitting down and writing a better tool than git (or svn, mercurial, etc). Personally, that&#x27;s too much hassle given that someone has already done the work and all I have to do is learn how to use the program, which is much easier and much less time consuming.<p>In general, that&#x27;s why I use other peoples&#x27; software, even when I disagree with the logic behind them and I would do a better job if I had a go at it (which is, of course, always).')
