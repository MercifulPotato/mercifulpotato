It&#x27;s an interesting language and environment. Reminds me of Smalltalk the way the platform works (or Pharo for a modern Smalltalk environment), except you absolutely can create more &quot;native&quot; binaries for your environment with it.<p>ActiveOberon might be one of the first places async&#x2F;.await style concurrency was implemented. It definitely predates Rust by a bit.<p>The Fox compiler is an interesting beast too! They&#x27;re still working on the language. The tip of their SVN tree has enhancements over the language report that was published in 2019\n<a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;cas.inf.ethz.ch&#x2F;news&#x2F;2" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;cas.inf.ethz.ch&#x2F;news&#x2F;2</a><p>Now there&#x27;s ternary conditionals, functors (per C++, not Category Theory) etc.<p>Last update to the repo was 11 days ago. It&#x27;s very much alive it seems :-)')
