The referenced document is about &quot;stepping up of cross-border cooperation, particularly in combating terrorism and \ncross-border crime&quot; which goes down to details like XML format of the exchanged data and which parts of DNA are used to identify people across Europe. It&#x27;s not something that UK can change on its own and definitely not something that should give anyone a pause before accepting the document as was already implemented - just because an old browser is listed in examples.<p>It can easily be debated as &quot;do we have any issues with the technical details of the international exchange of forensic information or should we continue with what we have right now?&quot;')
