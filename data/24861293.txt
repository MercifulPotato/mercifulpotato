People in most countries (even most rich countries) live happily in multi-family buildings with much less space than the average American home. Most of those who believe their family needs 2000 square feet to be comfortable are simply mistaken - and we could build much higher-quality neighborhoods without the degree of suburban sprawl that mistake causes.')
