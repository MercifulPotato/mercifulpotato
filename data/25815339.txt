FWIW I&#x27;m that kind of person :-). But I certainly understand it isn&#x27;t for everyone.<p>The platform I&#x27;ve been using to explore stuff like this is an Ultra96 board with a LimeSDR as the receiver. The Ultra96 has the Zynq Ultrascale FPGA on it. Given that USB3 latency is &lt; 10 uSec I am guessing (hoping?) I can implement it in the Ultrascale fabric which is fed IQ data from the USB 3.1 port.')
