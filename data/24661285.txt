Which of these sources, <i>concretely</i>, should one read to evaluate the claim that &quot;Modern C++ generally doesnâ€™t use OOP all that much anyways.&quot;, which is what you seemed to criticise in this subthread?<p>Again: Does one really, <i>concretely</i>, have to read The Art of the Metaobject Protocol, a book about Lisp, to evaluate this claim about C++? Having read the book, I would say no. Which is why I say that you are evading a real discussion.<p>(And for that matter, it would be interesting if you fleshed out your counter-claim -- &quot;Other than the classes used to implement all those STL concepts.&quot; -- in a bit more detail. Are you saying that all uses of C++ classes are OOP? Or that only certain uses are, but that the way classes are used to implement the STL fall into this category? Will I find the answer to these concrete questions in The Art of the Metaobject Protocol?)')
