Where, in God&#x27;s name, on my above comment I even hinted at that? All I am saying is if you go the trouble to create something that has different color scheme than your underlying operating system, then be smart enough to create settings to let users select their own colors.<p>You either create your app with default coloring and you let the operating system set your colors according to the user&#x27;s theme preference OR add these in settings. I hate programmers who think their color preference should be the only one, and not just that, but also state it proudly with a &quot;it doesn&#x27;t burn your eyes&quot;.')
