The US Government civilian pay scale is a good example. If you are a GS-12 step 1, your base pay is $66,167, but that goes up with locality pay. A GS-12&#x2F;1 in New York earns $88,651 but a GS-12&#x2F;1 in Tucson earns $77,541. It seems like a big difference, but based on cost of living, the GS-12&#x2F;1 in Tucson probably has a bigger house and fewer expenses. You could argue whether those numbers are right, but at least it&#x27;s fully transparent. Companies that are moving towards this model should make transparency a priority. Perhaps you can negotiate for base pay and know that it will be adjusted by a certain percentage based on where you decide to live.')
