I have also had upgrades break things on Windows. With Ubuntu, while I have had some surprises they are never random and I can fix them. With Windows it&#x27;s just like... stuff just randomly stops working several times a day with no rhyme or reason to why. It&#x27;s an organic, nondeterministic, unpredictable system.<p>That&#x27;s not to say Windows doesn&#x27;t fail in repeatable ways, it does that too. I&#x27;ve totally had OS, browser, Slack upgrades break things in really basic ways. But that&#x27;s something that comes from updating software, the instability... that&#x27;s a Windows problem that I don&#x27;t have on Ubuntu.')
