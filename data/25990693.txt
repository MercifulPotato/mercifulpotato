To an extent, real and reality is the same and one with its interpretation. You get into these weird spots where two people could experience the same event, interpret it in different ways, leading up to two different &quot;realities&quot; of the event. I don&#x27;t know enough to know how this would be reconciled within hermeneutic epistemology, but that&#x27;s something interesting to keep in mind.')
