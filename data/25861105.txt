Ironically if you get away with doing good science as a grad student there may even be an inverse correlation.  Less time networking = more time at the bench.<p>While I appreciate that self-promotion is a valuable skill, I believed (possibly flawed) understanding? narrative? that part of the reason why YC &#x2F; tech incubation &#x2F; tech can be effective is that it provides a structure where folks who are highly technically minded and historically preferred to spend time leveling up on that can be given easy access to networks with a builtin trust biased to some relatively technical merit, and resources to help level up on networking at all stages (whether that&#x27;s PG&#x27;s imprimatur that gives you access to VC offices for late stage companies or resources to help you find networkers in early stage companies).<p>If YC doesn&#x27;t acknowledge the structural barriers that make identifying technically meritorious biotech founders (vs biotech founders that have focused on buzzwords and networking) difficult then it&#x27;s going to have a rough time meeting the success expectation it has for software, on biotech.  It&#x27;s nice to say you want biotech portfolio, but the proof is in the pudding what are you <i>actually</i> doing differently to get it done?')
