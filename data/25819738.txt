It&#x27;s not what real planes do, but it&#x27;s a safety mechanism, alright. But instead of using a simple servo that would actuate the control column and wrestle with the pilot a little, what they&#x27;re doing is they&#x27;re actually trimming the plane nose-heavy so that actual real forces wrestle with the pilot.<p>Instead of a servo pulling on the control column slightly to enhance the natural pitch-up moment of an overspeeding aircraft they trim the plane nose-up and again, let the pilot push against an aerodynamic-yet-artificial force.')
