The feeling of easy accomplishment and unhindered flow is not something you get from every language out there, and not all languages explicitly advertise themselves as &quot;maximizing developer happiness&quot;. I&#x27;ve never focused on lisp or emacs, but I am neutral towards their claims that god wrote the universe in lisp. Same with a perl user&#x27;s claims of succinctness. I don&#x27;t judge or envy them. Won&#x27;t know until I learn the language and its tooling. And you won&#x27;t really know until you try chaining a few map&#x2F;reduce&#x2F;select operations and have them compute lazily in ruby.')
