However, at least in the United States[0], the law does not require an entity to be a monopoly to engage in behavior that is anticompetitive and&#x2F;or violates anti-trust laws.<p>In fact, the topic at hand (Visa&#x27;s proposed acquisition of Plaid) doesn&#x27;t have a &quot;monopoly&quot; component at all.<p>Rather, IIUC the DOJ is arguing that it runs afoul of section 7 of the Clayton Antitrust Act[1] which addresses mergers and acquisitions that limit competition.<p>I don&#x27;t disagree with your assessment of the situation, but I do think that existing law (and jurisprudence expanding on that law) address the vast majority of the issues impact competition today.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;United_States_antitrust_law" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;United_States_antitrust_law</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Clayton_Act_of_1914#Section_7" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Clayton_Act_of_1914#Section_7</a>')
