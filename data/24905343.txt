I have no idea what debian&#x27;s Qt was build with or libssl or SDL etc were built with but we can link to them all the same.<p>&gt; How often are you changing major compiler versions and breaking standard library versions that you would have this expectation?<p>You don&#x27;t configure Jenkins to build against multiple compilers&#x2F;versions of compiler?
