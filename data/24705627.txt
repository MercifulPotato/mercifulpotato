It&#x27;s like an era of powerful browsing  ended. I use the mentioned Vimium addon, but it&#x27;s not even close to what we had with VimFX.<p>Does the keyboard shortcuts in Vimium work when the page is loading? No. How nice is it to have keyboard shortcuts that work sometimes? Extremely frustrating.<p>How about using &quot;o&quot; to get to the address bar (CMD&#x2F;CTRL+L)? It opens some overlay on the page where I can&#x27;t access my bookmarks.<p>I could go on. VimFX is still somewhat maintained, but you have to run an unsecure browser to use it (like WaterFox).')
