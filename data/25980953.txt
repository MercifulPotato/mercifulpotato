For a general search on this topic I tend to get results about oneplus, for example, that say that relocking breaks it.<p>And samsung just won&#x27;t unlock US models.<p>And xiaomi factory resets the phone when relocking.<p>Searching for relock root android gives very unhelpful results in general.<p>I did learn there&#x27;s one specific model of motorola where the &quot;lock&quot; just doesn&#x27;t work, and that&#x27;s amusing but not very useful.<p>So I meant <i>your</i> phone specifically.  Not just rooting, but rooting <i>with a currently-locked bootloader</i>.  Please tell me a little bit about an example where this actually works.  And hopefully passes safetynet, and will keep passing safetynet with hardware attestation.')
