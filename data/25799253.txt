Plus, the build system is infinitely better than I&#x27;ve seen from any native-compiled language, period.<p>Those two factors make me think it&#x27;s close to the ideal language for newcomers to lower-level programming.  Even the syntax ain&#x27;t bad, as far as C-like syntax goes; it&#x27;d be interesting to see some alternative languages that put alternate syntaxes over Zig&#x27;s semantics, though (and one of my New Year&#x27;s Resolutions is to put together something to that effect, whether by transpiling to Zig or by (ab)using Zig&#x27;s compile-time programming).')
