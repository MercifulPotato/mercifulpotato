For example, I&#x27;ll work with someone and use their name every day for months but then after a few months of not working with them I can&#x27;t remember their name.<p>This makes it very difficult in organizations that are setup where you directly work with a small number of people but also socialize less regularly with a larger group. For example, at church I can remember the names of people in my Bible study but not people in the larger congregation. At work I can remember the names of people on my team but struggle with the names of people on any of the teams that we interact with.')
