I&#x27;m just pushing back on the frustrating meme that &quot;investing is literally gambling&quot;. there are definitions of &quot;investing&quot; and &quot;gambling&quot; that can make that sentence true, but they are not particularly useful outside of convincing laypeople not to put their life savings into $TSLA weeklies.<p>it&#x27;s certainly <i>possible</i> to gamble with stocks and derivatives, but in general, investing and even speculating are not necessarily gambling. imo the difference is in the strategy behind the trades. though wildly risky, speculation can be rational when backed by an advantage in information and&#x2F;or analysis. a retail investor watching daily prices and backfitting a narrative from news stories is not an example of a rational trading strategy.')
