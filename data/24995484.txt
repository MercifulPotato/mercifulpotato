I suspect 3 major factors are at play.<p>Voting by mail is higher risk as bad ballots don’t get resubmitted and it depends on the postal system to get it in on time.<p>Republican get out the vote message could mobilize people that thought they where behind while Democrats thought they had a comfortable lead.  That’s always dangerous.<p>COVID was outside the existing models and prompted unusual behavior by both voters and how states ran things.<p>Even with all of that, this election is well within projections.  Biden seems to have a strong lead in the popular vote and a weak one in the electoral college.  Florida and Georgia look unexpected, but not wildly so.')
