Item(by='hilbert42', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610377006, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25721804, text='This is a wonderful site and I would highly recommend it to anyone in TV or RF engineering.  By that, I mean the complete site not just the TV tuner history pages (i.e.:  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.maximus-randd.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.maximus-randd.com&#x2F;</a>).  This is how the internet <i>should</i> be used to convey information.  Not only is the information therein both comprehensive and very detailed but also the &#x27;cleanliness&#x27; and clear layout of the pages across the site is second to none.  It&#x27;s a long while since I&#x27;ve seen such a well presented and well laid out site <i>(even JavaScript is used sparingly and not abused as is usually the case across much of the web)</i>.  When I create my next website, I&#x27;ll certainly keep the presentation of this site in mind.<p>The information about tuners is remarkably comprehensive (it&#x27;s certainly the best I&#x27;ve seen in a single documented collection on the subject).  I don&#x27;t work with TV tuners on a day-to-day basis but I&#x27;ve had a lot to do with them in the past—and that goes back to the vacuum tube&#x2F;turret type well before we had varicap* tuning (so I feel competent to comment on the site).<p>That said, there are stacks of valuable information on this site about tuners and other stuff that I was either unaware of or not very familiar about.  There&#x27;s nothing more I can add as to do so would be superfluous—as the excellence of this site speaks for itself.<p>_<p>* <i>[I recall initially hating varicap tuning due to its propensity to suffer cross modulation (which meant that one had to ensure that TV channels had roughly the same RF input levels and that strong out-of-band services were kept out of such tuners by installing filters&#x2F;traps in the antenna line before the tuner input—lest herringbone patterns result).]</i>')
