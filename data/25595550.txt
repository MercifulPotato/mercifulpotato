Its just that they are only ever &quot;marked&quot; with a demographic identifier if they are for a non-dominant group. I.e., &quot;Comic Book Shops&quot; are geared towards (historically, typically) white boys, but &quot;Black comic book shops&quot; and &quot;Girl comic book shops&quot; also exist. We notice these, because they are marked as such, because they run counter the norm. What we don&#x27;t always notice is that the unmarked &quot;Comic Book Shop&quot; is already geared towards a particular demographicâ€”white men.<p>Basically, different safe spaces exist for different demographics, but are only marked for certain groups.')
