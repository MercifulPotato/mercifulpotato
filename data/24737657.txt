Item(by='h0p3', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602321251, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24737175, text='&gt; I&#x27;m curious. Is it just your way of mocking me? Just wanted to know.<p>No. I&#x27;m not mocking you. I am correcting you though (on a number of issues at this point). While I&#x27;m putting on a clinic here, I&#x27;m not trying to have fun at your expense. I&#x27;m quite serious. Your argument is not sound, and I&#x27;m trying to help you fix it (and your discourse), homie. Please pay attention.<p>If you really are curious and want to know: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;philosopher.life&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;philosopher.life&#x2F;</a> - I thought you might be inspired to think about my history given both how I thought about yours (and looking through your history, I see you&#x27;ve failed to learn from promoting your thesis more than once) and because you incorrectly presumed you knew what I didn&#x27;t recognize (surely you will take the opportunity to gain perspective and context in coming to understand who you are speaking with). In any case, even this conversation will be finding its way into my wiki.<p>&gt; I do not have any proof of account banning, but I have been completely blocked by Google recaptcha when adnauseam is installed because I looked like a bot. I have been blocked twice.<p>Okay, you&#x27;ll agree you are retracting one of your original claims then, right? (Normally, it&#x27;s polite to concede where you&#x27;ve lost in the argument. That&#x27;s part of arguing in [[good]] [[faith]].)<p>&gt; Every reason (mobile data consumption, privacy, and page speed) can be achieved through uBlock origin. The only &#x27;feature&#x27; adnauseam has over uBO is the automatic clicking.<p>Obviously, I argued that the automatic clicking is a reason to use it in at least some cases. uBlock Origin does not cover every use case for dealing with ads.<p>You forgot to mention one of the primary reasons I gave: it prevents the display of ads. Now, look at the exact words you wrote in your argument: &quot;If it contacts the adserver, what&#x27;s the point of an adblocker?&quot; So, are you agreeing that your counterpoint is nullified here, right? I demonstrated to you that there is still a reasonable point to using an adblocker that still contacts an adserver. That&#x27;s at least two claims you&#x27;ve trotted out that turned out to be unjustified.<p>Don&#x27;t you think a little humility on your part is in order here, my friend? Consider the possibility that you are wrong, please. We all make mistakes.<p>Also, since you continue to utter falsehoods as though they count as support for your thesis: that isn&#x27;t the only additional feature that AdNauseam provides, but I&#x27;ll agree it is far and away the primary one. Moreover, you have yet to demonstrate that the feature is conceptually and always stupid: the burden of proof is on you here. I&#x27;ve already given you the counterexample.<p>Lastly, don&#x27;t get me wrong: I&#x27;m a huge fan of uBlock Origin. When in doubt, that is what I recommend. There are people to whom I recommend AdNauseam though. There&#x27;s a time and a place for the tool.<p>&gt; The problem is not that people can use this in a stupid way. People are using this in a stupid way. They set it to full click through rate and feel proud of standing up against the advertising mafia and are like &#x27;Oh look at me, I&#x27;m faking my interests. I&#x27;m fooling Google and Facebook!!! So clever!&#x27;<p>Hrm. Look at your logic again. Here&#x27;s a substitution to show you why the argument doesn&#x27;t have the validity you hope:<p>&quot;The problem is not that people can use [a motorized vehicle] in a stupid way. People &#x2F;&#x2F;are&#x2F;&#x2F; using [motorized vehicles] in a stupid way.&quot; Note how my counterpoint clarifies how just because some people use a tool, be it a motorized vehicle or AdNauseam, in a way that is stupid doesn&#x27;t mean that all uses of the tool are stupid. Using a motorized vehicle is not stupid in at least some cases, and the same is true of AdNauseam. Your thesis is overcommitted (try stating it differently).<p>Perhaps you might try to argue about how the average use of the tool is harmful, but you&#x27;ve not given that argument either. I&#x27;m prepared to take you to task there too, of course.<p>Note that you&#x27;re ignoring multiple arguments I&#x27;ve made here. C&#x27;mon dude, do your due diligence, go ahead and walk through it line by line, charitably, please (just like I did for you). You might find your argument is substantially weaker when you actually try to address what I&#x27;ve said instead of sweeping it under the rug and repeating yourself.<p>Let us assume for the sake of argument that using &quot;full click through rate&quot; is stupid (and, problematically, you&#x27;ve not established even that, and I&#x27;ve already given you a reason that it isn&#x27;t necessarily stupid). There is at least one person who doesn&#x27;t use the &quot;full click through rate&quot; for the sake of costing advertisers money, and this counts as a non-stupid and non-trivially valuable function that uBlock Origin does not provide (note that this wasn&#x27;t the only reason I gave for the value of false clickthroughs). Thus, even if I granted that &quot;full click through rate&quot; use was stupid (and I obviously didn&#x27;t), your thesis does not stand. There is a counterexample.<p>You continue to offer an ad hominem attack on a strawmanned user, as though they represent all possible users and uses of this tool. Preference falsification is a weak aspect of the tool, and you&#x27;re ignoring the strength of it. Have the integrity to look at the other reasons I&#x27;ve shown you, please. You might still want to argue that the reasons I&#x27;ve given you are stupid, but you&#x27;ve conveniently ignored addressing them instead. So far, at best, your argument is really against some users of the tool rather than the tool itself.<p>Note, also, how using the tool stupidly (or even just ignorantly) to some degree does not imply it&#x27;s stupid to use the tool. You need to provide a reason for us to think the former implies the latter, and you haven&#x27;t. It feels like you&#x27;ve had more trouble with the tool than most people (maybe you should take other people&#x27;s anecdotal evidence into account if you expect them to take yours into account).<p>You may find it useful to at least attempt to reason out loud about how AdNauseam may function as both a protester&#x27;s tool and a proof-of-concept educational object.')
