It would be fair to boil a lot of the argument there down to &quot;People don&#x27;t act randomly. They have reasons for what they are doing. I think their reasons are bad&quot;.<p>I can&#x27;t argue with that, but the alternatives are worse. If you centralise power, sooner or later the advertising exec gets control of the powerful body, and now you can&#x27;t choose to resist even if you can see that what is happening is bad.<p>A key part of the free market is precisely that the world is actually quite predictable. The fact that people sometimes make predictably bad choices doesn&#x27;t especially undermine the free market. The market doesn&#x27;t require people make good choices, it just redirects resources to people who make better choices than the average.')
