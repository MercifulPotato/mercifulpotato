If one is seeking to meditate quietly or have some bigger than themselves spirituality it’s likely they have no connection to narcissism whatsoever. Howevet if they actively promote themselves as best meditators, gurus, most spiritual etc they might as well be narcissist. Narcissists seek to lift their ego by means of the world around them without which they collapse. Oh, and narcissists are quite easy to spot. Humble people cannot be narcissists though some narcissists fake ehumility, but they do it poorly and again it is quite easy to spot')
