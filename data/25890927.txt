I ported a few tens of thousand lines of Python 2 code to Python 3 and it was pretty trivial. In my experience the only thing that made porting code hard was when a package you depended on was not ported to Python 3 yet. But maybe my experience does not reflect some other cases. Can you eloborate on what was so hard about porting code from Python 2 to 3?')
