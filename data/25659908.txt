Or, to be fair, maybe they did and I missed it. I didn&#x27;t mention above that he refused to answer a couple of basic questions (what type of work is it? what language? where will the job be? can I be remote?) until he got through the script.  It was like talking to a machine.  And he was rude.  I got a negative impression.  I know, sometimes recruits are expected to put up with some rudeness or brusqueness to show how flexible they are, can put up with different personalities etc.  But this guy just came across as kind of immature and arrogant.  Sorry, but I&#x27;m quite glad I terminated the interview and he also seemed unwilling to push at all, just said &quot;okay!&quot; in a sing-song voice that implied &quot;yeah whatever, go die&quot;.  At least be polite and try to convey some professionalism or you&#x27;re going to turn off people who prefer to work around professionals.')
