Historically scientists have a reputation for writing relatively poor code. Code that runs really slowly due to things like unintended nested loops, or striding values (x,y vs y,x). And code that doesn&#x27;t handle non-happy path cases very well.<p>Are you saying that you trust the code more because the domain knowledge make it more likely to get the right answer then? Has general knowledge increased such that scientists&#x27; code isn&#x27;t as painful as it was 20 years ago?')
