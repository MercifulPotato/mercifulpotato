Item(by='cycloptic', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604710683, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25012318, text='That appears to be a completely out-of-context comment about GNOME made on a KDE blog for unclear reasons. But anyway, I looked through most of the links in that comment and I&#x27;m not entirely sure what you&#x27;re referring to. There are some heated arguments around technical issues in those mailing list posts, but there are also many positive comments such as this:<p>&gt;If anything, we have to turn the GNOME community around and make this community a tolerant community, and a community of love.   I have to say that I am surprised by how well the gnome-love mailing list has taken of, and surprised to see various newcomers to the platform actually writing code and becoming productive.<p>Also, that was quite a long time ago (some posts are from earlier than 2003) and most of those people involved in those threads don&#x27;t appear to be associated with the project anymore. It certainly seems like they were able to work out some of their process issues in the last 17 years seeing as how the bonobo&#x2F;orbit parts were dropped entirely.')
