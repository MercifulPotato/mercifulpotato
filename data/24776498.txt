This is not a long term solution. If they are lucky, they’ll be able to maintain it until an effective vaccine is widely available.<p>If one is never available then they will only be able to maintain it by total disconnection from the world, even if the rest of the world has herd immunity. Which would probably be much more harmful economically in the long term than the virus would.<p>What I am saying, is without cure or vaccine there is no long term feasible solution other than to get it, and that would only change distribution of disease outcomes over time (to first order)<p>Also the 70-90% is based on assumptions that do not bear out in practice, as they ignore T-cell and cross reactivity which are known to have an affect. (I do not know of a reliable estimation, but when one is figured out it can easily be in the 20%-50% range)')
