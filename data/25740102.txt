There were many royalists in France, but none in the National Assembly.<p>The Girondists were considered right only because Jacobins were super left and ended up killing thousands of priests, what few nobles they could still find, tens of thousands of suspected royalists in mass executions, and eventually the Girondists themselves too for being too soft. The Girondists went to the guillotine singing The Marseilles! Certainly not the royalists that lot.<p>I recommend the “Revolutions” podcast - about 30 hours worth of the French Revolution is better than any movie.<p>Also the history of revolutions is very educational in this day and age. I for one hope we will never experience anything like it.')
