It&#x27;d be more awkward to say &quot;average Joe or Xiùyīng&quot;.<p>* Both Chinese given names and surnames are usually &quot;real words&quot;. Just like how &quot;Joe&quot; is a descendant of the Hebrew &quot;Yohanan&quot; meaning &quot;Graced by God&quot;, or even the many English given names that are real words: Carol, Eve, Jade, etc. It&#x27;s just more common in Chinese names.<p>* Given names are rarely used by themselves (much less than in Latin languages).')
