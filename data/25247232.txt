Because Biden is truthful? Because he won&#x27;t be tweeting 10 times a day? Because the media will (effectively) do the tweeting for him? Because the media will simply not challenge him, and ignore his critics?<p>All politicians lie, or perhaps to put it more charitably, they promote a very one-sided point of view. It&#x27;s almost the definition of politics. The only reason anything will change under Biden is that many of the people with the biggest megaphones support him.')
