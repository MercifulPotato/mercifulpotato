And yet, software will randomly manage to trigger it and kick me off of the A2DP profile.<p>Microsoft Teams is the worst at this. It completely ignores my system audio preferences (which were painstakingly configured to use the expensive microphone as an input, <i>not</i> the wireless headphones) and tries to use the headphones, which switches the profile to headset and ruins the audio quality for the remainder of the call.<p>Bluetooth is far from OK for audio.')
