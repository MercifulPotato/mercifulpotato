The actual packet loss is intermittent and reasonably rare, and is I suspect a fault at the line level with BT&#x2F;OpenReach. A&amp;A didn’t provide me with the Vigor 130 btw, it’s my own device. In general I find DrayTek devices very solid and I’ve not had any issues so far when powercycling it over the past few years. It’s pretty much a stateless device, as the actual connection is established from the router on my side of it.')
