This allows readers to appreciate your comments rather than trying to remember what the original article said.  It is also possible for your response to get to some sites before the original article.<p>&gt;  Summarization is best done by including appropriate quotes from the original article.  Do not include the entire article since it will irritate the people who have already seen it.  Even if you are responding to the entire article, summarize only the major points you are discussing.<p>This particular point is essentially a lost art.')
