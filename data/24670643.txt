Mark Hadley [0][1] for example suggests that:<p>&quot;On spacetimes that are not time orientable we construct a U(1) bundle [model of a particle as an asymptotically flat spacetime manifold with a region of non trivial topology where time is not orientable] to measure the twisting of the time axis. This single assumption, and simple construction, gives rise to Maxwell’s equations of electromagnetism, the Lorentz force law and the Einstein-Maxwell equations for electromagnetism coupled to General relativity. The derivations follow the Kaluza Klein theory, but with the constraints required for connections on a U(1) bundle rather than five spacetime dimensions. The non time orientability is seen to justify and constrain Kaluza Klein theories exactly as required to unify gravitation with electromagnetism. Unlike any other schemes, apparent net electric charges arise naturally because the direction of the electric field reverses along a time reversing path.&quot;<p>&quot;Deriving the U(1) bundle as a measure of the twisting of the time axis is new, as is the application to manifolds that are not time orientable. Like Kaluza Klein theory, it is purely classical, but free of the complications and ad hoc assumptions required by full 5D Kaluza Klein theories. It is remarkable how so much is derived from such a simple construction without additional assumptions.&quot;<p>&quot;The connection with quantum theory is intriguing. Classical structures that are not time orientable have close links with quantum phenomena such as the logical structure [4], particle creation and annihilation [14] and spin half [7] The derivation of Maxwell’s equations and electric charge is just another result from the same premise of non time orientability.&quot;<p>Electric charges are a natural feature of the model, but quantisation only appears naturally for magnetic monopoles (which arise in pairs). However, adding elements of quantum theory to the monopole structures leads to quantisation of electric charge. The simplest such argument uses quantisation of angular momentum, but the argument fails when more than one monopole is introduced. The other approach uses a wavefunction for a charged particle [1, p262]. Uniqueness of the phase of the wavefunction leads to quantisation of charge. This is a tantalising link between the complex phase of the wavefunction and the orientability of spacetime.&quot;<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;warwick.ac.uk&#x2F;fac&#x2F;sci&#x2F;physics&#x2F;staff&#x2F;academic&#x2F;mhadley&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;warwick.ac.uk&#x2F;fac&#x2F;sci&#x2F;physics&#x2F;staff&#x2F;academic&#x2F;mhadley...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;doi.org&#x2F;10.1007&#x2F;s10773-017-3344-4" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;doi.org&#x2F;10.1007&#x2F;s10773-017-3344-4</a>')
