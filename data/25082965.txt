That black man can be the best person in the world and this set of population can still not accept him due to reptilian hatred.<p>You can&#x27;t generalize every supporter obviously but you can see it from which policies of Trump get the most support. It&#x27;s not like Trump actually improved quality of life for anyone but he sure did tickle the reptilian hatred.')
