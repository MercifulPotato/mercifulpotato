These are posts by YC startups directly, who choose to link to WaaS as the place people can read more about what they&#x27;re hiring for. Other startups choose to link to other sites or post their own text. It&#x27;s up to them.<p>YC startups getting to post job ads is one of the things that HN gives back to YC in exchange for funding it: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newsfaq.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newsfaq.html</a>. There shouldn&#x27;t ever be more than one on the front page at a time.<p>Btw, Launch HN threads (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;launches" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;launches</a>) are another thing HN gives back to YC, because they get placed on the front page. I try to keep those to 1 a day but as W21 Demo Day approaches you&#x27;ll probably see a few days with 2 at the same time. I spend a lot of time helping startups with their text in the hope of keeping them interesting for the communityâ€”on balance I think they&#x27;ve added quite a bit to HN too.<p>If you still have questions, let me know!')
