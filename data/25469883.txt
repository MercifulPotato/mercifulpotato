In reality, the effort for producing a deep investigative story can be equivalent to an a mid-size software engineering project in terms of person hours and expertise.<p>That&#x27;s not just an impression, it&#x27;s a fact.  More than once have I seen commenters suggest (with what I assume is a straight face) that amateur <i>bloggers</i> can effectively replace &quot;the media.&quot;  A similar position I&#x27;ve seen frequently is that science reporting is worthless, and individuals should just sift through the all raw papers instead (which not even actual scientists do).<p>The best bloggers can do is substitute for opinion writers, since having and expressing an opinion is really a solo endeavor, regardless of where you do it.  Pretty much everything else needs a bigger team and more support structure.')
