The culture is such that any Slack message not responded to promptly (even during lunch hours) is, at the very least, cause for concern. At no point would &quot;taking 2 hours at lunch to run errands&quot; be acceptable without prior approval, even if we routinely worked past 6pm (as I often do).<p>I expected this to be a bit extreme, but I&#x27;m beginning to wonder just how extreme is this culture right now in previously &quot;non-remote&quot; jobs?')
