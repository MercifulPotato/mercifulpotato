I would say she&#x27;s not one of the worst politicians - everyone with that length in public life has a few scandals. I haven&#x27;t forgiven her for her censorship laws, but the other &#x27;scandals&#x27; seem rather be a matter of hubris (often confused with &#x27;vision&#x27;). In other countries that&#x27;s a normal expectation - new policies such as on childcare will have some birthing problems - but in germany politicians usually have waited for a solid plan before they announce big measures.')
