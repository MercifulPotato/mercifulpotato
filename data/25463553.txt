Like any project of a similar size, it has a history of security vulnerabilities. OpenBSD removed it because it was too much code to audit. OpenBSD dodged several issues like this RCE (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;research.checkpoint.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;select-code_execution-from-using-sqlite&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;research.checkpoint.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;select-code_execution-f...</a>) as a result.<p>See <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cvedetails.com&#x2F;vulnerability-list&#x2F;vendor_id-9237&#x2F;Sqlite.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cvedetails.com&#x2F;vulnerability-list&#x2F;vendor_id-9237...</a><p>Hundreds of thousands of lines of code are simply going to have vulnerabilities and bugs. It&#x27;s unavoidable with that level of complexity.
