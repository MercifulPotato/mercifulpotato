PDF is very complex, and it’s easily possible that a generator could have a bug.<p>‘Generally the thing that changed is what broke’<p>This has been never been true in software engineering.  Changed code reveals bugs which need to be fixed elsewhere all the time.<p>2.  Yes, to the end user it looks like a problem with preview.<p>No, the fact that it opens at all doesn’t make it de facto “valid”.<p>Yes, handling questionable PDFs is part of writing PDFs handling software.<p>No, that doesn’t mean that all PDF handling software must or can feasibly handle <i>any and all</i> corruption.<p>The very fact that there are many kinds of questionably valid PDFs out there proves the point.  Handling the the intersection of all the <i>invalid</i> PDFs is impossible.<p>Rendering correctly has nothing to do with this.
