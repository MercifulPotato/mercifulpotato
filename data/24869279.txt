There is no &quot;trash can&quot;, it IS SPILLING EVERYWHERE. We even have a QAnon supporter most likely headed to Congress. People are dead because of these hate-filled groups. Shutting them down <i>saves lives</i>, not only in the US but throughout the world.<p>You can&#x27;t just &quot;leave these groups alone&quot; because the last thing they will ever do is keep to themselves. Hate groups only want two things: to spread their hate and to get rid of the people they hate. To let them be is to support their agenda, and in doing so, people die.')
