A lot of  &quot;amateur benchmarks&quot; float the net claiming HTTP&#x2F;2 speed superiority, but often the measurements are flawed (not taking TCP peculiarity like congestion control into account or even including it in the analysis; classic fault is failure to disable TCP initcwnd caching or flushing the cache when doing benchmarks).')
