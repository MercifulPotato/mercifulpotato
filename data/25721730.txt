So the commands might not make much sense.<p>1. A couple of examples I’ve been using for development:<p># Joe Smith\n  314 395 112<p>% why is the sky blue?<p>+¥:3\n Carrots\n Avocado\n Tomato\n Spaghetti<p>$Joe Smith \nLong time no talk\nHi Joe, it’s been a while. How are the kids?<p># - create contact\n% - research (will open browser with this search term when getting home)\n+ - add to list\n¥ - shopping\n: - denotes length of list. The above will ignore spaghetti.\n$ - send email<p>Regarding the separators, I’ve obviously been using new line for the different arguments, but could use anything. More so I was trying to make it so you could annotate any page from the past in glyphs. Just annotate a few glyphs on an existing page (or whiteboard) and it’d run operations.<p>I’ve tried lots of systems, but there’s always pros and cons. Open to suggestions!<p>2. More so I’d use them to remind me of dates or set wake up alarm. Reminders throughout the day doesn’t really help me (plus the phone isn’t with me). But there’s no reason you couldn’t do all of the options you mentioned.<p>3. I did a proof of concept as a desktop app. I’d just upload pictures I took to cloud, and pull down. Because desktop is much more powerful for the user, I could write custom scripts and run them from the notebook. But an app would be a good idea for those who don’t mind the hit in flexibility.<p>DEFINITELY have support for custom glyphs. Because I’m using Google OCR I don’t currently have support for custom glyphs (a little shape or squiggle), hence the glyphs are just symbol characters. But yes they can be created and assigned actions.<p>I’ve been using it on any old book. Just make sure the lighting is ok. Of course it’s not always perfect, but it’s close enough if you take effort to write clearly.')
