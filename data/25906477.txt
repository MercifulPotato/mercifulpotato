Before about 2015, I thought it was nice, but not a pressing crisis, but around then, I started to notice things like signs saying &quot;why does my insulin cost more than methadone?&quot; and &quot;why is medical marijuana cheaper than my heart disease medication?&quot;. These situations might have simple economic explanations in terms of supply-side dynamics, but they are morally infuriating to the same chunk of the electorate who <i>self-identify as conservative capitalists</i>. Not long after, Martin Shkreli appeared.<p>There seems to be a powerful, possibly instinctive, connection between A: being able to turn to someone for help when you&#x27;re in need and B: considering that someone to be trustworthy. In 2020, we saw this writ large, when the United States became the global epicenter of conspiracy theories about SARS-CoV-2. The general population&#x27;s trust in the medical system and the government is a huge unaccounted-for externality that can have serious effects on our economic and political stability.<p>Furthermore, one of the most lamented, supposedly idiosyncratic, problems with the US medical system is the sheer amount of <i>paperwork</i> required to do <i>almost anything</i>. It seems like an excellent example of this:<p>&gt;We need to trust the people around us in order to live happy, productive lives. If we donâ€™t trust them, we end up having to find costly ways to formalize our relationships.<p>(Opponents of guaranteed universal healthcare in the United States will generally agree that we do not have a <i>&quot;free&quot;</i> market in healthcare, but it is usually harder to convince them it will <i>never</i> be politically possible in light of the above.)')
