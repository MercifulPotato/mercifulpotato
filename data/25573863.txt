How long did it originally take time to write just this part? Now expand to whole document. It&#x27;s quite unrealistic to expect them in hurry to tear down and rewrite certain parts that don&#x27;t even need negotiation.<p>Wonder how many years would it be to search for all parts needing updating, then collect necessary personnel to rewrite those and then pass them through all parties involved. Likely very much longer than entire process has now taken time.')
