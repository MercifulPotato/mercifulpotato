That is not how anti-trust works. Amazon doesn&#x27;t need to rent servers to Walmart. Walmart doesn&#x27;t need to rent storage space or placement to Amazon. There&#x27;s nothing in anti-trust which compells companies to have to provide services to one another.<p>If people want to talk about these issues they need to frame it in terms of strengthening anti-discrimination laws for speech. If that&#x27;s something we want to talk about it&#x27;s valid - it&#x27;s just not the route most people getting angry about this want to take since it would run against many other opinions they&#x27;ve made previously (Masterpiece Cakeshop, et al.)')
