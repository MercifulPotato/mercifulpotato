There&#x27;s a goat behind both doors you&#x27;re allowed to choose from, which are the remaining two.<p>(Below I use <i>non-chosen</i>  to mean <i>non-chosen by the contestants initial choice</i>.)<p>Second point: If we are in the subset of all possible histories where Monty picked <i>randomly</i> revealed a goat, then we will have 50% of histories where both non-chosen doors contain 1 goat selected by our history subset, and 100% of histories where both non-chosen doors contain 2 goats selected by our history subset.<p>Since there are twice as many possible histories where the non-chosen doors contains 1 goat vs 2 goats, after selection, we have an equal number of histories in our sample where we have 1 goat or 2 goats behind the non-chosen doors. Or equivalently, we have a 50% chance that the non-chosen doors contain a car.<p>Therefore it is irrelevant whether you switch.<p>Monty needs to make an intelligent selection to change the game.')
