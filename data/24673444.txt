Taking Amphetamine daily for years in reasonable doses essentially has no long term negative effects. In that way, similar to coffee.<p>Wow, that is truly amazing. I&#x27;m glad to learn about that.<p>I notice a slight depression if I stop taking my ADHD meds for a few days (perhaps up to a week), but after that I&#x27;m back to my old (ADHD-driven) self. So in a sense, it&#x27;s not addictive at all. The depression can tempt one to get back on it, but that&#x27;s about it.<p>One side effect of Adderall though is ED, and it&#x27;s pretty bad. I guess it depends on the person, but for me, the ED was quite bad. The ED does go away after getting off of it.')
