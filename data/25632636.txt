We even had our own fair share of racist leaders - take a look at what Churchill had to say about Indian people for example. The timescales were different - Britain committed its crimes over the course of centuries rather than a decade or so - but it&#x27;s not accurate to say &quot;nothing in their history is even remotely comparable&quot; to Nazi Germany.<p>The main visible difference <i>nowadays</i> is that Germans of today are hyper-aware of the atrocities committed in the past by their ancestors. Britons are often either ignorant of theirs or are <i>proud</i> of them.')
