Especially when the norm is always about scaling out instead of scaling up. We can have 128 Core CPU, 2TB Memory, PCI-E 4.0 SSD, ( and soon PCI-E 5.0 ). We could even fit a <i>Petabyte</i> in 1U for SSD Storage.<p>I remember WhatsApp used to operate its <i>500M</i> user with only a dozen of large FreeBSD boxes. ( Only to be taken apart by Facebook )<p>So Thank you for raising awareness. Hopefully the pendulum is swinging back to conceptually simple design.<p>&gt;I also have a 380 GB Intel Optane 905P SSD for low latency writes<p>I would love to see that. Although I am waiting for someone to do a review on the Optane SSD P5800X [1]. Random 4K IOPS up to 1.5M with lower than 6<i>us</i> Latency.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.servethehome.com&#x2F;new-intel-optane-p5800x-100-dwpd-ssd-dominates-pcie-gen4&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.servethehome.com&#x2F;new-intel-optane-p5800x-100-dwp...</a>')
