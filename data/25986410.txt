Think of it as the cost of advancement. Chances are that most devices nowadays come with sufficient memory to handle these. And for cases where this would harm overall experience, there are always toggles.<p>Though not to underestimate the vulnerabilities some of these advancements bring. Some tech such as Bluetooth have been exposed to security bugs in the not so recent past. Am also partly concerned about how complex &amp; almost OS-like browsers have become today. Read ChromeOS etc. They also expose too much information at the hardware level to webpages.<p>Though as complex as the big browsers get. We&#x27;ll always have simple browsers such as Webkit-based Epiphany that still stay true to the traditional Web browser in essence.')
