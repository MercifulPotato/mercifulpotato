That it is, it&#x27;s fair to dismiss giving a part of your freedom towards a coercive state. But at the same time, you also forfait the future possibility that you might want to exert exclusive rights over your own intellectual work.<p>It totally works out if that&#x27;s a decision made on a personal level. But when you expand that towards a first principle that applies to everyone, you run into issues. After all, authors relinquish control over who gets to use their work and how it gets to be used. And not all contexts in which one&#x27;s creative work is consumed are equal.<p>This would range from opposing the use of one&#x27;s music during political manifestations, to opposing the use of one&#x27;s code in both private and public ventures which are ethically questionable.<p>When it comes to software, you can see this in efforts to create copyleft licenses with extra terms &amp; conditions that restrict the use of how software is used. For instance, the Hippocratic License.
