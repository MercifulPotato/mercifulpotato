Only Apple can revoke them. I know because I have a Developer ID certificate myself, and also because Apple says so in section 4.8 of their document: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;images.apple.com&#x2F;certificateauthority&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;Apple_Developer_ID_CPS_v3.0.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;images.apple.com&#x2F;certificateauthority&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;Apple_Deve...</a><p>&gt; Who says HP didn&#x27;t tell Apple the key was compromised?<p>Their key wasn&#x27;t compromised, so why would they say this?<p>&gt; Why wouldn&#x27;t Apple assume the private key was compromised if that&#x27;s the only reason a developer would request revocation?<p>Why would Apple assume anything? Apple can reply to the email, or call HP on the phone. (Apple has the phone # of all registered developers.)')
