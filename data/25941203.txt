It&#x27;s a very complicated system, grown organically and additively over the course of many hundreds of millions of years.<p>As any software maintainers will tell you, even with a system merely several years in existence, anytime you provide different inputs you have not tried before, e.g. taking mosquitoes out of the equation completely, you increase the chance of different, unexpected, output.<p>This is general theory, but I&#x27;ve come across quite a bit of research suggesting that all the parasites we&#x27;ve been living with for millenia are crucial to priming and functioning of our immune system.<p>I haven&#x27;t seen anything about mosquitoes specifically yet, but I&#x27;ve seen it for leeches, lice, and worms. Mosquitoes are even more prevalent in our biome, so even more likely to be essential.<p>We did not grow up in a sterile world, all these other beings have been growing up alongside us this whole time.')
