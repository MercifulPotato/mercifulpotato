Item(by='dheera', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611518688, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25895197, text='I got banned by WeChat last week for a while for using &quot;unauthorized plugins&quot;. They seem to also be adamant about not allowing people to run WeChat on virtual machines.<p>Seriously, WTF? It&#x27;s none of your business what device I use and whether it&#x27;s virtual or not.<p>I got a cease-and-desist from Facebook many years ago for trying to write a Perl interface to their messenger.<p>I own and control my devices, damnit. I hate these walled garden messaging apps that seem to actively thwart innovation. All I want is a protocol (which I&#x27;m even happy to pay for!) and <i>I</i> will decide how messages present themselves on my end.<p>Many years ago I used Pidgin to interface to MSN, ICQ, AIM, QQ, Gtalk, Yahoo, Zephyr, and a couple others. It was great -- I had E2E encryption (sorry Pichai and Whatsapp I had E2E encryption on ALL of my messengers before you all decided to wall-garden your apps and then do some stupid PR stunt about E2E encryption years later), automatic human language translation, automatic LaTeX rendering, and a bunch of other features, all of which I don&#x27;t have now because the messenger apps everyone uses now are anti-innovation. We&#x27;ve taken a huge step backward.')
