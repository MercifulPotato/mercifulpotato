For some classes, the students using MacOS or Windows actually had to jump through more hoops; one class required us to ssh into the school&#x27;s Linux server for some assignments, which required Windows users to download extra software due to not having an ssh client by default (at least, not back then; I&#x27;m not sure if powershell has one now), and in another, we had to use Xilinx, a proprietary IDE for writing Verilog to design circuits for FPGAs, which only had builds for Linux and Windows, not MacOS. For the latter one, the TAs literally distributed flash drives with an Ubuntu VirtualBox instance for the Mac users (who comprised the majority of CS students at my university).')
