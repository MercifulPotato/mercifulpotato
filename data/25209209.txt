Or rather, I see what Spencer is saying, but don&#x27;t agree. Selling consoles &quot;at a loss&quot; and earning the money back through subscriptions, games and other services sound like a pretty terrible business model, and it&#x27;s only relatively recently that this has become common practice.<p>Heck, we&#x27;re also only talking about the Game Pass and PS Plus here - this isn&#x27;t accounting for in-game subscriptions, season passes, battle passes, AND the price to buy the game in the first place.<p>Basically, I don&#x27;t believe that they need the money to recoup losses on console sales - it&#x27;s a move to squeeze as much out of consumers as possible.<p>If they DO need to recoup their losses... Well, that&#x27;s a failing business plan that consumers (and developers) shouldn&#x27;t have to cover for them. If it weren&#x27;t for the monopolies in the console market, they wouldn&#x27;t have to either...')
