To me this implies that we have done a bad job in creating an environment for ourselves. We replaced suffering caused by scarcity (something we historically had little control over) with suffering caused by deliberate choices.<p>The point isn&#x27;t that aligning our choices with biological and psychological needs will end all suffering. It&#x27;s that <i>not</i> doing so pretty much guarantees a lot of unnecessary suffering.')
