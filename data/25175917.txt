They do charge about $20&#x2F;year for a micro plan that lets you have any number of addresses and <i>domains</i> , with some throughput limits, and $90&#x2F;year for a full plan without those limits. Something similar to the micro plan was free until recently - personally, I&#x27;m on the $90 plan with a few domains and emails, which would have cost about 10 times on much on gsuite and fastmail.')
