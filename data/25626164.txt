And there&#x27;s also logic errors, for which neither Go&#x27;s or C#&#x27;s type system helps either, so maybe we&#x27;re at 50% error reductions with Go and C# compared to JS and Python. I don&#x27;t even think that Rust, with its really helpfull type system (ADT + Affine types) achieves 95% error reductions though.<p>[1]: for C#, at least last time I used it, which was 2011')
