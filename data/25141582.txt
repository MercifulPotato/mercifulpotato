I have gone full circle myself. From Dreamweaver (have to start somewhere), hand coding, Bootstrap classes and modifying them, then naturally started using utility classes. Finally made the switch to Tailwind (felt like cheating on a lover, because I loved Bootstrap so much). I then went full on utility classes and low and behold, discovered @apply with nested @screen media queries and went right back to writing clean HTML with named CSS classes that use utility classes in a SCSS file. Its so cool to me, I want to tell everyone about it.')
