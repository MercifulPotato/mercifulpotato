No sports game will allow you to simulate a celebration, or score your points in a manner lacking fair play, trying to replicate real life.<p>Allowing things like &quot;teabagging&quot; without instant ban for the user, even building dedicated humiliating moves in a game, or emphasizing some animations like slow motion kill cams when a certain score style was achieved are the reason I have a hard time respecting the gaming industry or taking e-sports seriously (purely because of games&#x27; design decisions, not the player).')
