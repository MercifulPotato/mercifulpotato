He&#x27;s arguing that it would be better, easier, and provide more value for more people if instead of things like Hyperloops we invested in high speed rail. If you&#x27;ve ever been to the US you&#x27;ll know the transport infrastructure is TERRIBLE. Compared to Europe (and from the reading the article, Japan too it seems) American public transport is embarrassing; rusty diesel locomotives and pot holed roads. Having a high speed rail network in America would most certainly not be keeping everything the same.')
