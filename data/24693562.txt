And do they actually rot that way? Seems suspect to me. Perhaps an experiment is in order.</i><p>From experience, chopping off the head can keep the rest fresh a bit longer (gutting the fish helps more, as the fish is really rotting from the inside out).<p>As for the <i>direction</i>, in a couple of other languages I&#x27;m familiar with the saying is more literally &quot;the fish rots from the head&quot; (Russian) or &quot;the fish stinks from the head&quot; (Hebrew), with directionality implied rather than explicit.<p>Sort of like &quot;burning the candle from both ends&quot; versus &quot;burning the candle from both ends inward&quot;, I guess.')
