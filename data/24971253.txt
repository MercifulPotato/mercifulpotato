Item(by='Traster', descendants=None, kids=[24972157, 24972260, 24972853], score=None, time=1604341322, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24971132, text='&gt;- For bidirectional attempts, how can you say that a car has a top speed of C mph when C = A+B&#x2F;2 mph and A&gt;B? That&#x27;s an invented figure.<p>I agree that (A+B)&#x2F;2 is an invented figure, but I think the logic of &quot;This is the maximum a car can do without external factors&quot; is a reasonable thing to agree on as a top-speed, and wind is an external factor. Otherwise a lot of cars can set their top speed by being dropped from a sky scraper, and the testing would get unreasonably expensive. (A+B)&#x2F;2 is probably a good first approximation to a wind-neutral value (and a gravity neutral value too).')
