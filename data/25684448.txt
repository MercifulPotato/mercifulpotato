This isn&#x27;t particularly unusual, since language implementations often have capabilities which aren&#x27;t part of the specifications (see the many extensions to C, for example. e.g. in standard C you can&#x27;t assume that type punning using a union will be defined, but almost all implementations explicitly allow for it). These are differences in the semantics of the language (namely in what is and isn&#x27;t allowed), not just optimisations.')
