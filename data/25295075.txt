The display part of TB3 is independent and is just DisplayPort. Both TB3 and USB-C alt-mode can do DisplayPort 1.4, assuming both sides support it of course. TB3 only actually requires DisplayPort 1.2.<p>There&#x27;s actually no difference here whatsoever on the display-only side of things.<p>(side note, USB 3.2 achieves up to 20Gb&#x2F;s, not 10Gb&#x2F;s, and TB3 is also realistically only 20Gb&#x2F;s as well unless you&#x27;re sticking to the super short 0.5m cables)')
