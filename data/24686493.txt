I’m getting the impression that you’re drawing false equivalencies and missing the broader point that it’s not a public vs private problem but a human psychology problem as evidenced by the fact it exists in both arenas. I’ve literally said from the onset that while it exists in both, each system is different in terms of scale and correction mechanism. In other words, I admit they are not equal in manifestation while thinking they share the same underlying cause rooted in human nature.')
