They work like hardware, which if you get serious, you often end up buying and using as well, which means studio musicians immediately know what they do, computer musicians get to learn how hardware units works, and the designs are nice and life-like.<p>The bad about skeuomorphism is not looking like a hardware unit, but being restricted to interacting like it&#x27;s a hardware unit.<p>Which is not the case in most skeuomorphic VSTs - you have all kinds of computer-only interactions to make your life easier (double-click to reset knobs, preset search, A&#x2F;B comparison, draw curves, etc).<p>Skeuomorphism there is just the cherry on top, not a rotten core, like the skeuomorphic DVD player programs of yore.')
