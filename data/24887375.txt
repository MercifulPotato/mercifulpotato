Are none of them capable of having a conversation and reach a middle ground from where they can communicate effectively?<p>Is this VR solution for cases that severe?<p>I didn&#x27;t find answers to the questions above.<p>But CBT works, to an extent. This (Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy (VRET)) might work too, but the article needs to tone down the condescension.')
