I do my work (programming), game, etc, etc on this one PC. It&#x27;s been honestly great.<p>I&#x27;ve had to change some things I do normally, but for me they weren&#x27;t a big deal.<p>Games I play that work well on Linux:<p>- Overwatch<p>- League of Legends (not so much anymore because URF is gone)<p>- Hades<p>- Frostpunk (highly recommend)<p>I use an Xbox controller for Hades, and I use it in wired mode (one of the things I needed to change about how I use my computer). Bluetooth has some issues I didn&#x27;t want to bother fixing.<p>I am using Xanmod because the regular Linux scheduler is just trash in my opinion for desktop use. It doesn&#x27;t prioritize UI threads which just makes the linux experience so much worse for me.')
