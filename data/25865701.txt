Oh let me guess, this is the old &quot;Democrats are actually right-wing&quot;, right?<p>&gt; As for the news media, as an example, Fox News has the highest viewership in the US.<p>Yes <i>one</i> channel is different than every other, of course viewership is concentrated there -- all the lefty viewers are spread out over the remaining channels.<p>If the other news channels aren&#x27;t &quot;left-wing&quot; then Fox isn&#x27;t &quot;right-wing&quot;, and everything is meaningless. There isn&#x27;t a large population of commies or nazis in the US, despite what the media would have you believe. Both parties are pretty near the center, with some individual outliers.')
