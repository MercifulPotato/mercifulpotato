The one I use [1] was $8 on Amazon back in 2019, and I wouldn&#x27;t trust it with a high-current load, or leave it unattended while charging - it gets pretty warm charging the Chromebook, enough so that I&#x27;m glad I only got it for occasional emergency use with the big 26Ah USB pack that lives on the side of my backpack.<p>I fully expect it to let the smoke out some day, but with a supply voltage less than half what it&#x27;s delivering, I don&#x27;t think it can fail in a way that&#x27;ll hurt the Chromebook, and until it does I&#x27;m happy to have it as an option. And I bet those dinky little un-heat-sinked boost converters from the article likewise get pretty warm, too.<p>(Also, passive USB-C to USB-A female converters are trivially inexpensive, enough so that I just got a big bag of them so I don&#x27;t have to care if they disappear on account of being tiny. For a new-build project, it makes sense to go straight to the connector, but for back compat purposes I can definitely recommend having a good supply of them on hand - USB-C cables seem in general to be either expensive or unreliable still, so being able to adapt old cables to new sockets saves a lot of headache. Especially when the old cables are permanently mounted to devices!)<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;gp&#x2F;product&#x2F;B01ID90K4A" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;gp&#x2F;product&#x2F;B01ID90K4A</a> - no longer available, but plenty of similar ones are. Don&#x27;t trust any of &#x27;em, would be my advice')
