A repl is a read, eval, print, loop.<p>That means the code you enter at the prompt is converted from a String into literal data that can be evaluated (read). The data is then evaluated to produce a result (eval), and the result is then printed (print).<p>If that&#x27;s not what your REPL is doing then it&#x27;s not a repl.<p>That is not what&#x27;s going on in e.g. python or ruby &quot;repls&quot;. There is no &quot;read&quot; step here converting the text of the program to data. The program text is simply passed to an &quot;eval&quot; function that produces the result directly.')
