I guess it&#x27;s worth mentioning that the 64-core chips have much lower clock rate than 16&#x2F;32 core ones though. And with some expensive software that&#x27;s licensed by CPU core (Oracle), you&#x27;d want faster cores, but possibly pay a higher NUMA price when going with a single 4 or 8 sockets machine for your &quot;sacred monolith&quot;.')
