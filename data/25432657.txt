Cut down on saturated fats and tilt your balance of unsaturated fat more towards omega-3.<p>The reason why fast food is unhealthy is not because of the specific oils used (and all of the ones you mentioned are much better than the trans fat nightmares we used to deep fry in). It&#x27;s unhealthy because it&#x27;s super heavy in calories, and because they&#x27;re almost entirely carbs and fats and low-quality protein, and almost completely bereft of vitamins and minerals and fiber. The fat+salt+carbs combo keeps you from being satiated until you&#x27;re stuffed full.<p>Focusing solely on the fats used during cooking is myopic. You have to look at the whole picture.')
