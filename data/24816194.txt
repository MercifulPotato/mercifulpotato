Rhetorical question; if they did you wouldn&#x27;t need <i>more more more</i>.<p>A minority is rich and comfortable. This elite uses propaganda rhetoric such as polarisation by a platform such as Fox News to manipulate people into a political candidate which, ultimately, does not serve in their benefit but in the benefit of the elite majority.<p>Then there&#x27;s the other party who are only marginally better. The poor get to pick the best option of two terrible options, and they could have achieved so much more in their life with just a minor bit of compassion from said elite. If greed is one of the seven sins, none of these elites are the devout Christians they claim to be.<p>I normally don&#x27;t speak out about this; thanks for the inspirational post.')
