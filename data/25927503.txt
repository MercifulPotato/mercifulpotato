The important first step is axes selection (head-tail, left-right). The left-right axes is selected in a really interesting way, cells in the middle have a little flagella that tends to rotate in a specific direction. (If my memory is right, the condition where someones internals are all mirror images of “normal” is caused by some problem with these) Now secreted signal molecules will be concentrated on one side, and this selects the given side.<p>But the big picture is that each cell has a decision tree, and local signal molecule concentration is the criteria on which they decide. And later each cell has the ability to express yet another signal molecule and so on. If we were to imagine a 2d plane and you could symmetrically place a secretion center of A and B signal in a left and right region respectively, than you can have a new type of cell in the middle if it changes based on “signal A and B is on”.')
