They used to harp on it. It was in their Interface Guidelines in the 80s. Now every time they do a major OS update I get greeted by a bunch of setup screens like to enable Siri or iCloud etc and clicking on Ok or Cancel there is often no response for 2-5 seconds. No idea if I did it correctly or anything. I expect that from bad ATMs or Gas Pumps but not from Apple.')
