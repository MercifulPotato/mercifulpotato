First, something more similar to Red Hat Kickstart.  The Debian equivalent (Preseed) doesn&#x27;t quite cut it (effectively it is an &quot;answer&quot; file for the Debian installation, so when the questions in the installation evolve you need to regenerate the preseed config (this is my understanding, everything I&#x27;ve read says that it would be really difficult to make a preseed configuration by hand).<p>Second, it would be nice if the package manager had an actual database behind it capturing everything that the rpmdb does.  Instead you have a flat file with some of the data in it, and log files with other data (where the log files can be rotated out eventually).  I want to be able to do things like &quot;rpm -qa --last&quot; on Debian.  Or &quot;yum history&quot;.<p>How difficult would it be to write a version of the apt suite of tools that uses an sqlite db?  Would that break other items in Debian?  It sounds like an interesting project to take on.')
