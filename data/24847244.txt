But we did compromise. What we ended up doing was using an ORM for CRUD operations, which were mostly user-facing (&#x27;row&#x27; operations); and SQL for reports &#x2F; data monitoring (&#x27;column&#x27;, bulky operations). And doing our most to avoid procstocs (limit them to executing REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW and COPY operations to the best of our ability), and trigger processing.<p>We do manage the SQL code (view definitions, mviews, and the remaining procstocs) right next to the application code with Flyway [1]. We also have SQL-ORM integration tests, spinning a database container with testcontainers [2].<p>We&#x27;ve had some issues with business rule duplication (updating the ORM and forgetting to do the same in SQL), but so far I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s successful.<p>This being said, I&#x27;m on the SQL boat; and I remain convinced that the CRUD could be done comfortably with an SQL query builder such as jOOQ [3]; and that it would help solving the business rule duplication issue. But hey it&#x27;s working right now and everybody is happy about it, so why change it?<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;flywaydb.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;flywaydb.org&#x2F;</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.testcontainers.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.testcontainers.org&#x2F;</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jooq.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jooq.org&#x2F;</a>')
