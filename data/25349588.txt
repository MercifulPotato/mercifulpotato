Works without assigned ownership cannot practically be re-licensed, as you&#x27;d have to get individual consent from all owning parties.<p>This came up a lot when GPLv3 was introduced â€” many projects <i>wanted</i> to migrate from GPLv2 to GPLv3, but couldn&#x27;t, because they never acquired legal ownership of contributed code, and so didn&#x27;t have the right to re-license the contributors&#x27; code.')
