While I oppose this, and absolutely oppose the use the fenced in cages.  Lets not pretend that Trump&#x27;s administration created this from thin air,  these policies and these buildings &#x2F; cages where in place before Trump took office, and while you should and can criticize him for not only failing to stop the policy, and by all accounts allowed immigration to ramp up the use of it before outlawing it completely due to public backlash...  These policies where not started by Trump.<p>If you want to proclaim some kind of moral superiority, do you really want to point to Drug warriors Biden and Harris as people of moral fortitude.<p>The War on Drugs has cost the lives, directly and indirectly, of many many millions of people, upended families, put millions people of all races (disproportionate number of minorities) in cages, and separated them from their children, created orphans, etc..<p>Biden and Harris where right there not only cheering that on from the side lines but where ACTIVE participants in this process,  they personally sent people to those cages.<p>Where is your moral outrage for those children? for those parents? for those victims?<p>To be clear,  I am not a Trump supporter,  but I am also not a Biden supporter. Though I would have preferred Trump over Biden for about 11 Trillion Reasons... My politics are libertarian,  I am Anti-War,  Pro-Gun, Pro-Free Markets, Pro-Free Trade, Open Borders, Anti-Social Welfare and Pro-Legalize Drugs...  Biden is bad on all them,  Trump is bad only a few of them.<p>I am sure we are going to disagree on most public policy, including COVID Response which I do not believe can or should be a Federal responsibility but should continue to be a State level response, with at most Federal Resources (aka money &#x2F; supplies &#x2F; personnel) when needed &#x2F; requested.  I also believe when the final accounting is done a LARGE part of our covid death rate was down to several irresponsible governors mandating COVID positive people be sent to Elder Care Facilities,  this was something unheard of in other nations (and not something Trump was responsible for, or could have prevented)  and I am still grappling with the logic of that, even in the early days where information was limited<p>However none of that was the point of my comment,  the claim was that only Republicans &#x2F; Trump Supporters are &quot;completely unable and often unwilling to consider any argument or information that conflicts with their views&quot;<p>That further devolved into claims that Trump supporters want to kill Biden supports,  with a link to some wack job.<p>Now you have charged that is false equivalency the point that many democrats also are &quot;completely unable and often unwilling to consider any argument or information that conflicts with their views&quot; to the point where they are creating lists of Trump supporter<p>I do not believe this to be a false equivalency at all, and the fact that you attempt to justify it either by being willfully ignorant of history, or attempting to spread incomplete or outright false information further proves my point')
