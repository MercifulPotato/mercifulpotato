But increasingly I find it embarrassing, and am worried about the future. Particularly with the shift to remote first becoming commonplace now. What exactly is there to keep salaries from a race to the bottom at this point? With the number of young CS grads exploding, I can see it becoming a hard requirement in the next 10 years. And beyond that, the career trajectory for a mediocre IC with no degree is looking... bleak. Will I really be able to keep this up into my 50s? Probably not. I love software development but it simply doesn&#x27;t seem sustainable. And the management path seems almost unimaginable for someone without even a high school degree. At the senior level, there&#x27;s really nowhere to go from here. It seems like you either hit the startup equity lotto, or burn out by 40.')
