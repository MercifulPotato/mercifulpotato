The American company just needs to set up its legal presence in Canada since only Canadian companies can sponsor immigrants. That would still be a barrier to small companies so I expect the PEO (Professional Employment Organization) industry to come up with a way to make this possible at any scale. And that&#x27;s before Canada changes IRCC regs to help this use case, which they could very well do.')
