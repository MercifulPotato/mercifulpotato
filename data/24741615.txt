It is clearly objectively worse in several ways (cargo capacity, max speed, environmental conditions) but better in ways that the others don&#x27;t even try for (no emissions, gives exercise to the operator, negligible road wear). They fundamentally aren&#x27;t even trying for a monolith but to become &#x27;independent&#x27; as possible.  Less charitably it could be called sophistry to self-justify their flaws and failings.<p>A hypothetical &#x27;outsource everything&#x27; company would be perfectly agile because everything else is fungible replaced with whoever is doing the outsourcing regardless of what is going on everywhere else. The downsides are not only that they are the reverse ofvertically intergrated in that they give up margins to everyone else in the chain and that they have no differentiator other than what they can provide as &#x27;middleware&#x27; and outsourcing everything to stay that agile means that it is shrank by design. They would have to provide real value margin as a middleman in order to exist long term vs the clients &#x27;just putting all of the pieces themselves&#x27;.')
