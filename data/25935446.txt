Yet time and time again you see these funds blow up.<p>That being said its amusing how people just ran with the caricature of a fresh out of high school, blue collar upbringing, degenerate CBOE options pit trader who you would find smoking weed during trading hours and coked out pounding drinks at Ceres after hours with an autistic antisocial 4chan twist(heard stories from people who knew floor traders like this).<p>It seems like a lot of the professionals can&#x27;t see past the tongue in cheek self deprecating humor to realize its an act that people play up.')
