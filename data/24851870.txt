In terms of base assumptions, running AGI on computers also puts us at a disadvantage due to multiple layers of abstraction. That is to say, AGI is what organic brains <i>are</i> as opposed to what we&#x27;re asking computers to <i>do</i>.  It&#x27;s like a complexity difference between building a machine to throw a ball and building one to accurately simulate the physics of throwing a soft rubber ball through turbulent air onto grass.  A dragonfly uses just sixteen neurons to take visual input from thousands of ommatidia and use it to track prey in 3D space.  How many transistors would we have to use to accomplish the same task?  Now scale that up to 86 billion neurons in a human brain.  That&#x27;s the scale of the problem we&#x27;re looking at <i>after</i> we figure out how to program it.')
