When I was a university student staying at the campus dorms, I&#x27;d park my car outside my dorm building for most weekdays until I&#x27;d use it on the weekends to drive home, run errands across town, etc. Once when I came back to my car after a week of it being parked it was totally dead and reeked of gasoline - someone had snuck under my car, drilled into my gas tank, and drained the fuel into a gas can below. Getting the gas tank replaced was about USD$1,200 worth of damages and I doubt the campus police ever tracked down the person that did it.<p>However, the circumstances were probably different than most gas thefts. This took place during the winter in a place known for brutally cold winters, so if you&#x27;re living in your car then having gas is the difference between freezing to death or not. Apparently it was not that uncommon, the campus police seemed like they were dealing with a pattern of these kinds of thefts.')
