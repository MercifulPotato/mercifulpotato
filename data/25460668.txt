They have an expected uptake, and they have a model for how the reviews translate to more sales. I agree that it&#x27;s likely that at least some of this marketing is priced into the price and there&#x27;s some inflation, but I suspect the overall uptake of stuff like this is &lt;20% and it generates non-zero additional sales, so I would guess the margin is more like $2-4 or so.')
