Item(by='floatingatoll', descendants=None, kids=[24655940, 24655328], score=None, time=1601574817, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24653508, text='It matters <i>if</i> it short circuits, yes. (Electricians, I hope I got this right <i>enough</i> to convey the &#x27;why&#x27;; I know it won&#x27;t be perfect.)<p>The outlet plugs specify the circuit breaker limit. Most consumer electronics in the US use a 15amp plug, which can be plugged into a 15amp outlet or a 20amp outlet â€” but no higher, due to physical incompatibilities in the outlet design.<p>The electronics that use the 15amp or 20amp plugs are therefore built not only to draw <i>no more</i> than the amps rated by their plugs, but also to self-destruct <i>relatively safely</i> if they draw the maximum amps available from the circuit breaker backing that plug.<p>So if a cheap device <i>correctly</i> assumes as part of its &quot;don&#x27;t explode&quot; protections that it will never receive more than 20amps due to using a 15-or-20 amp plug, and then it short circuits while plugged into a 25 amp circuit using an adapter, it could very well explode, because the basic guarantees of electrical safety were violated. The plug used guaranteed it would never receive more than 20amp, and now it&#x27;s receiving 25!<p>This is especially relevant when you&#x27;re considering how to make use of an idle 30A dryer outlet in a garage. If you just plug an adapter into it, and your device short circuits, it will explode even more violently. Risk of harm increases with outlet power.<p>There exist fancy &quot;breaker box&quot; adapters that have a 30A plug on one side, a fuse box with a 15A or 20A fuse in the middle, and a 15A outlet on the other side for you to use. It&#x27;s not really an adapter at that point, but the presence of that 15A&#x2F;20A fuse provides the missing piece of protection for your 15A&#x2F;20A device that a plain adapter wouldn&#x27;t have.<p>So in summary, the only way to safely use a 15amp device on an outlet that delivers power higher than 15-20A is to somehow inline a 15-20A breaker between the device and the outlet (or, to rewire the outlet and its power feed to 15-20A).<p>TL;DR: Hire a licensed electrician to tell you what your options are and decide how much you care to spend and whether you want to make permanent modifications to get the job done.')
