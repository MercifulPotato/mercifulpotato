I contend that it would be wrong, i.e. immoral. If you disagree with that, we can try to have an argument about that. If you agree or don&#x27;t care, I don&#x27;t see the point in this mental exercise.<p>It is of zero interest in any discussion ever that there are hypothetical people who disagree with opinion X, because I&#x27;m not arguing with hypothetical people. I&#x27;m having an argument with specific individuals with specific beliefs.')
