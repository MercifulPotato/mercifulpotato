In the latter, it&#x27;s something that still requires a little knowledge, but IMO a lot less to get started.<p>Something like <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;showmewebcam&#x2F;showmewebcam" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;showmewebcam&#x2F;showmewebcam</a> takes it a step further, but obfuscates some of the code more (IMO) by bundling it in an image that is generated with some build scripts (though that might be the direction I move my project eventually... people don&#x27;t seem to care as much about trust and auditability nowadays).')
