In Docker&#x27;s case, it was indeed non-proprietary, built on existing standards, and has now got to the stage where you can now swap Docker out for competing alternatives to avoid lock-in entirely.<p>On the other hand, while that model went great for Docker the technology, it has not gone well for Docker the business. I imagine Dark might see Docker as a cautionary tale of why _not_ to go down that road.')
