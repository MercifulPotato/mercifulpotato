That&#x27;s the issue!<p>If you only have peer-to-peer encryption with communications still passing through servers unencrypted then, sure, you can get a warrant to force disclosure.<p>With end to end encryption, however you can show up with a warrant all you want it makes no difference because they physically cannot hand you clear-text communications.<p>Same for encryption at rest. The strength of the encryption algorithms we have today makes it near impossible to recover the clear-text data.')
