Item(by='steerablesafe', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611142939, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25844802, text='I think a stopwatch is a different beast from 0-based or 1-based indexing. A stopwatch is used to measure the time interval between two events. If stopwatches could somehow magically measure and display time in infinite precision we wouldn&#x27;t have this discussion. But if they do rounding to the nearest displayable number then they display 0 for half of the time-step interval, then display the subsequent numbers for the full time-step interval each.<p>I vaguely remember that the original minesweeper started counting time from 1, which is certainly odd. I could be wrong here though.')
