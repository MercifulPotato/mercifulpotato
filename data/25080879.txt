I&#x27;ve not been able to run my azure functions on Linux at all. Even on windows, I have to start the azure storage emulator directly and then start func (using the full path). On Linux, azurite is not the same thing as azure storage emulator.<p>So I must use windows for dotnet development. Even after four years of dot net core. That being said, Linux isn&#x27;t the problem. Gnome 3 isn&#x27;t the  problem either. Flatpak works great.<p>There are a few regressions once in a while though. For example, I&#x27;m unable to use my lenovo flex 14 (and ryzen 3500U) built in mic since I upgraded to Fedora 33. Looks  the issue well be fixed in kernel 5.9 but for the moment I&#x27;m on 5.8. But it has been great mostly. If I could use it for work, that&#x27;d be great.')
