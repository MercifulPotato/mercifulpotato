I have hardware trigger signal, a bank of cameras, and a gps&#x2F;ins unit which emits an exact time&#x2F;space stamp, all off the trigger. It is a very ROS-esque app, with camera and gps &quot;drivers&quot; which parse the data into ROS messages which are published. Occasionally, the tiny gps packet gets delayed way longer than the image buffering, which throws everything out of whack.<p>Then I discovered the TCP_NODELAY flag, which made this occurence go from 1&#x2F;100 to 1&#x2F;+10,000. Had to do some digging to understand &quot;why would anyone want to <i>delay</i> packets ever?&quot; the answer of course being naive code writing one byte at a time to sockets.')
