You can launch the daemon by running `pulseeffects --gapplication-service`.  In the GUI, if you go upper-right-hamburger-menuâ†’General, there&#x27;s a toggle for &quot;Start Service at Login&quot;, which will write a ~&#x2F;.config&#x2F;autostart&#x2F;pulseeffects-service.desktop file that runs that command.  Most desktop environments will do the correct thing with that.')
