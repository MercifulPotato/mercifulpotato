If the NY Times doesn&#x27;t publish your letter to the editor but you can post it on Facebook and have a reasonably proportionate number of people able to read it in practice, it&#x27;s not being effectively suppressed. If neither they nor anyone else with a similar reach will carry it, that&#x27;s censorship.<p>It has nothing to do with who does it and everything to do with whether the idea is being suppressed in practice.')
