As a techie guy the obvious choice would be to develop something for&#x2F;with a charity but I am having a hard time to find charities that could use this skill. Developing the next big app that will &#x27;improve&#x27; the world is something I do not believe in either. At this point the best (and most obvious) way to improve the world is to start with something small and hands-on like a homeless shelter, do grocery shopping for vulnerable people or like that. But, as a tech guy that is in high demand it feels like those aren&#x27;t my true places to shine.<p>Last year I decided to ditch working for an employer and started freelancing, despite the Covid crisis I am earning twice what I earned before and this is one of the reasons I think I should be improving the world. Many people won&#x27;t be in my extremely luxury position. I don&#x27;t really care if I&#x27;m helping by cutting down on my paid hours and do something myself, or by donating to good charities around the world. However, just donating does feel more of a waste and less rewarding. I don&#x27;t want to be one of those people that just donate money and that that will offset all the bad they do. Furthermore, as someone that lives in The Netherlands it feels somewhat of a waste to do a charity in a country with the best social safety net when there are so many other countries where people are having a much tougher time.<p>Although I don&#x27;t think it matters much, but I am located around Amsterdam&#x2F;The Netherlands but am able to travel wherever I want. I work fully remote and am not locked into a home anywhere. (But of course, traveling around is hard because of border restrictions and not something I would do unless it is worth it)<p>What are your thoughts on this?')
