I can spend all night reading Wikipedia, and it&#x27;s way more interesting than most content online. All they do is ask me  for $3 every once in a while, and while I&#x27;m actually really poor... I still gave &#x27;em $3 out of my cigarette money. I would&#x27;ve never had the confidence to go back to school if that resource wasn&#x27;t there (or even had the realization that I love learning), but I also wouldnt wake up in the afternoon to see stuff in my browser history like &quot;7:03 AM: Polar Bear Jail&quot;, so it&#x27;s a trade-off. Beats YouTube, though')
