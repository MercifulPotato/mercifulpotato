I sincerely do not understand why anyone would ever purchase an Apple computer, and yet here we are, again.<p>Especially confusing to me is how many of my fellow web developer peers I see choosing Apple devices over literally any other laptop with Windows or Linux which will run circles around a Macbook of the same price range.')
