Author said: &quot;It doesn&#x27;t really matter whether these platforms are biased towards liberals or conservatives, the real question is why have we given them this power in the first place.&quot;<p>That was well said. Too bad after Biden&#x27;s victory, CNN or no one on the democratic side cared about this anymore. Some surely do, but at least it&#x27;s not being discussed anymore as much as before.<p>Lots of people ask &quot;But Twitter is a private company, shouldn&#x27;t they be allowed to do whatever they want with their platform?&quot;<p>Well, unless we live in a complete anarcho-capitalism, no they should not. They need to follow the law and laws can be changed to match with the current situation.<p>The core issue is that Twitter, Facebook etc. are defacto information sources and platforms for most people on Earth. These companies are managed by radical leftists in Califonia and when they start to decide what information should be visible and what information should not be visible, they create an existential threat to democracies and societies all around the world as well as freedom of speech, politics, religion etc.<p>Government&#x2F;Union regulation is not the solution either, but better than this.')
