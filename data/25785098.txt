On one hand, every opportunity is taken to ridicule China&#x27;s system as being a dystopian hellscape because it is driven by the CCP. On the other hand, large mega-corps can introduce marketing and PR plans to justify social credit is good to have, and people will just accept it as part of their lives without much thought all the same.<p>It&#x27;s like staring at a fork in the road, where the US and China have selected different paths, but both lead to similar potentially bad destinations of some group controlling a larger group.<p>Just saying <i>&quot;but we&#x27;re the good guys&quot;</i> is a myopic view of a much grander, more nebulous discussion.')
