Almost no one, if anyone at all, argued for collectivism to undo the bad thing that happened to them.<p>You&#x27;re argument seems to be that now that something bad has happened to enough people, it&#x27;s time for collectivism. That is one massively bitter pill to swallow for all the people who have been left behind in the past and had to fend for themselves.<p>And why does it have to be all about what you want? Because you are part of a majority? Does that make it okay to steamroll other people, because you, as a member of the majority, have more value? Because more people agree with you, and you add all those people together, and you have more value than a minority? Do you not see how your argument has been used to justify all the terrible things that have been committed against minorities in the past?<p>All of this could be moot though if these vaccines are truly 95+% effective. Not everyone will need to get it for herd immunity. The most likely scenario seems to be a combination of natural immunity and vaccine immunity before we even have enough doses to give everyone.')
