There seems to be an obsession with the most challenging problems (which is fine), but it seems like there are much lower hanging fruit that is easier to grab like long distance travel. I would love to have vehicles that took care of long distance&#x2F;interstate driving situations.<p>One of the few rationales I can summon is that when you look at driving and travel as a whole, the total time&#x2F;mileage that falls in the distribution of long distance may be significantly lower than that of the total time&#x2F;miles spent in the more difficult inner city driving situations. Moreover, since we&#x27;re looking at businesses not trying to do humanity a favor but pursing a profit motive, the driving spent in inner city travel is deemed more profitable than the longer haul travel, likely because you have to compete with rail systems, air transit, and so forth. That&#x27;s all guesswork though, curious if data exists on this.')
