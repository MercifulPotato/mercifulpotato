But we understand how bird wings work, and we understand why we don&#x27;t design planes like bird wings.<p>We don&#x27;t have the same kind of understanding of how brains learn, so the comparison is not quite right.<p>When we understand how to build things that learn like brains, we&#x27;ll be in a better position to say things like &quot;Ok this is strictly worse than backprop, let&#x27;s stick with backprop&quot; or &quot;Actually, this is better than backprop because X&quot;, (or, more likely, there are things we can use from both). Until we have that understanding it&#x27;s silly to stop trying to understand how the brain does things.<p>That being said, nobody is going to stop working on backprop, and no one is going to stop working on understanding biological mechanisms . Research works by a bunch of people investigating different avenues simultaneously.')
