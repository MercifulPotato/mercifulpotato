There&#x27;s a standard API implemented by Linux for the firmware to communicate this to the kernel, also PCI works on ARM just like x86. No one bothers with this because all of the popular ARM SoCs tend to come from organizations that are extremely hostile to their users though.<p>Do you mean user space ABI? GlibC on arm7 and aarch64 has had a pretty stable ABI for a while now, I can personally share binaries between all my arm machines that share an architecture (not that flinging binaries around is a good thing.)')
