Depends on sync intervals. It&#x27;s unlikely it would even be legally possible to compel them to do this.<p>Individual ASNs can still choose to accept the invalid route anyway.<p>The RIR already has the power to revoke assignments, and IRRs would likely remove the route objects which most large networks use to generate filters. It was simply a slower process, and filtering according to IRR data is much more error-prone and open to abuse.<p>For example, here&#x27;s RIPE&#x27;s policy: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ripe.net&#x2F;publications&#x2F;docs&#x2F;ripe-541" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ripe.net&#x2F;publications&#x2F;docs&#x2F;ripe-541</a>')
