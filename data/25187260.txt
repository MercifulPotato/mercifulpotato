But because of the risk of long-term effects and&#x2F;or death when you&#x27;re infected with COVID19, people want a safer solution that provides immunity.<p>A vaccine provides immunity, but at a lesser rate than the actual virus. But 90% (or even 70%) effectiveness is a good thing: it means 90% to 70% people do NOT spread the virus anymore.<p>You&#x27;d think that means 90% or 70% fewer deaths, but that&#x27;s mistaken. That 70% is compounded over-and-over every generation. If everyone else is vaccinated: you infect 70% fewer people. Those people infect 70% fewer people, and those people infect 70% fewer people.<p>After 3 generations, a 70% vaccine would wipe out 97.3% of possible infections. And a &quot;generation&quot; in COVID19 terms is roughly 1-week.<p>---------<p>So yes, even a 70% vaccine (if everyone took it) is a very, very, very good thing. But the two vaccine trials that finished first were 90% effective, so I think people will prefer the higher-efficacy (at least, if they have access to Dry Ice &#x2F; -80C storage).')
