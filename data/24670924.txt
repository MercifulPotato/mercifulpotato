I guess your numbers add up. Nonetheless, I don&#x27;t think using inflation is enough as measuring stick. Upward mobility&#x2F;inequality is not really captured in it. Also, it appears public service in the US has suffered a lot in the last years. So my full picture of the US is not as bright as yours although your sources and arguments are fine in itself.')
