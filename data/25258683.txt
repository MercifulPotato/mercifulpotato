E.g. I&#x27;ve never got flu-tested before a concert&#x2F;the flu shot, even though it could pass to other people&#x2F;kill people.<p>I&#x27;m wondering where&#x27;s the line between freedom to one own&#x27;s body and other people&#x27;s well being. IMO it&#x27;s not as clear-cut as people make it out to be.')
