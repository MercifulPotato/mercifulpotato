We just closed our seed round (led by Sequoia and Lachy Groom) and are actively looking to round out our founding team.<p>Our product relies heavily on realtime music, voice, and video streaming so you can expect work that’s much more interesting than just a traditional CRUD app. Candidly, it’s also very fun to work on a consumer-facing product that we all use ourselves.<p>You’d be our first iOS engineer, so you’ll have a greenfield opportunity to bring our web experience to mobile. You’ll also have the opportunity to lead development of iOS-only features like integrations w&#x2F; HealthKit and Apple Watch.<p>On the fullstack side, you’d join two existing engineers building in TypeScript&#x2F;React on the frontend and TS&#x2F;Node on the backend.<p>We have a beautiful office in the Mission which you’ll be welcome to work from post-COVID, but are also open to candidates who’d like to be remote indefinitely.<p>Send me an email at im at alexarena.com or DM me on Twitter @alexarena if you’d like to talk!')
