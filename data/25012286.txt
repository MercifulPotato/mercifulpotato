The last time I touched ML was decades ago, so I don’t have a specific opinion here but consider “both more simple and more powerful” could be a contradiction. The <i>lack</i> of power and expressiveness can in fact be part of what makes things simpler, not strictly because of the language but because programmers are forced to do things in a “dumber” way.')
