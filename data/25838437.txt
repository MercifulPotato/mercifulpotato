Item(by='Lammy', descendants=None, kids=[25838825], score=None, time=1611088039, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25835744, text='&gt; These people are idiots.<p>It makes me uneasy to see how much commentary on recent events seems to focus on insulting these people instead of hearing how society has failed them and why they&#x27;re upset even if we tend to disagree with their suggested fixes. I think their presence in DC and that &quot;colorful&quot; person they elected are all symptoms of this behavior.')
