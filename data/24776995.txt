This intiative does define the latter to be data that the car collects and phones home, and which the car itself may not store at all (but the &quot;remote receiving point&quot;, as the law calls it, does store).<p>It seems to me that you can&#x27;t reasonably require access via the physical port on the car to data that is not actually present in the car&#x27;s systems.  Or am I missing something?')
