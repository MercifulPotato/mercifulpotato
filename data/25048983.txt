One of my short life lessons is that, in general, when I do business with evil, sketchy, or nasty organizations or people, I generally come out behind.<p>If the good guys have an inferior product and charge double, I&#x27;ll sometimes pick the bad guy. And more often than not, I get burned, costing me tenfold what it would have cost to just go with the high-integrity choice in the first place.<p>I&#x27;m not leaving github over this, but I&#x27;m mostly starting new project on gitlab instead.')
