Worse, some APIs don&#x27;t require you to set up sender addresses ahead of time, you can just set it in the &quot;send email&quot; API call, which makes it easy to unknowingly send emails that are blocked by your own policy.<p>DMARC would allow you to find out, but I&#x27;m not sure how many people have configured reports, apart from those whose whole business is email.')
