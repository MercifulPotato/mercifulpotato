I definitely don’t practice those, they’re honestly kinda boring to me. My musical goal is more about getting a decent understanding of practical playing and theory through a book that does a bit of both (the older beginner is what it’s called) as well as finding our own songs to work through and use to learn about theory. The teacher who swears by tedious exercise like Hanon would probably disagree, but I really like it, and I feel like it’s still very productive!')
