Item(by='mongol', descendants=None, kids=[25564515], score=None, time=1609196282, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25564110, text='I started with Ansible for automation, and still use it, but have abandoned it for setting up my personal environment. I still use it to set up services, such as sshd, webserver, printer, samba, smartd etc. I found it was more cumbersome for personal environment setup than my script method. My method of re-initializing my environment rests on three pillars:<p>Ansible, for server&#x2F;OS setup. Things run by init&#x2F;systemd, involving anything outside of $HOME basically<p>Backup, using borgmatic. I use this to restore most things in $HOME, except random dotfiles. My documents, my checked out git repos, etc.<p>Script &quot;setuplets&quot;. These I run on demand, to set up my environment piece by piece. Perhaps I do not want to restore my programming environment just because I want to have my custom prompt on a host, for example.<p>Finding the balance between these have been difficult. What bootstraps what, and especially, how to handle credentials. My backup is encrypted,  but how would I make sure I had the keys to restore it? I could restore it from my pass password store, but how would I get the gnupg keys in place first? I have not solved this completely satisfactorily yet')
