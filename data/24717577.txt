Item(by='leto_ii', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602151021, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24712285, text='&gt; Tech workers are in so much demand that they don&#x27;t really suffer such a disparity of negotiating power, like workers in other industries.<p>&gt; Many software companies offer equity, which makes employers the shareholders. What&#x27;s good for shareholders is also good for a lot of tech employees.<p>&gt; Also, barriers to entry in software are almost 0. If you can&#x27;t get someone to treat you well, you can have your own software company paying your bills in 6 months, or VCs funding your startup.<p>Points 1 and 3 apply, perhaps, to Silicon Valley, but not as much in the rest of the world. I currently work in the Netherlands - there are plenty of jobs and the pay can be good, but at the end of the day you&#x27;re just another worker. The disparity in negotiating power is still enormous.<p>Point 2 is mostly not that relevant (outside of SV). Even if you get some equity, it will be peanuts. I worked at a company that had a very successful IPO. We all got a few stock options, enough to make a few tens of thousands of euros if you sold them at the right time. The actual shareholders (the ones with decision power) made from tens of millions to billions. The disparity is enormous.')
