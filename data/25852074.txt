The “bathtub” curve is usually more associated with components with a constant failure rate (where the ideal place is after infant mortality but before wear out).<p>There are two types of uncertainties here and I think we’re talking about different ones. One is a design uncertainty that can be mitigated using a well-used and understood design. The other is a component failure uncertainty which increases as service life increases. So the ideal place to be is in a well-vetted design with new-ish components.')
