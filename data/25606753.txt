The last one (juniors calling the shots) really hit home; when I worked in &lt;automobile industry&gt;, I was ultimately standing on the shoulder of midgets.<p>The worse part?  As a CS grad, I knew how to do better, but: nobody with the power to change things understood how or why what I was suggesting was better(!).<p>I&#x27;ve long thought about this afterward, and concluded it&#x27;s that &#x27;my world&#x27; (which includes a lot of experience, and facility with Math) required me to study a lot and learn a lot; and these &#x27;coders&#x27; simply did not have the background to understand what I was trying to teach them.  I would have had to fill in several semesters in order to get my points across.   Yes, I left.   (And yes I tried simplifying - but that only goes so far.)')
