You speak of the CCP like they&#x27;re evil bastards waiting to leap at your throat, but in reality USA and China have a lot in common, at least in world politics.<p>Some Latin American countries tried to avoid giving even an inch to USA, and it didn&#x27;t end well. China has done the same in Asia. USA-China rivalry is not about good and bad, it&#x27;s more akin to thugs invading each other&#x27;s turfs.')
