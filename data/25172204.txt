It is a ridiculous use of public resources, but the FTC didn&#x27;t give any indication that is was a valid complaint. Facebook didn&#x27;t make an argument, only an observation that the feature would hurt their revenue. Kind of like &quot;by the way it would be nice if you found some impropriety in how they rolled this out, we aren&#x27;t aware of one, but would be adversely affected whether its all above board or not, okay thats all we got moving on&quot;.')
