First, it&#x27;s just a threat in disguise. Second, it&#x27;s a weak threat because it&#x27;s hard to realistically imagine Besos or Cook trying to start another Parler.<p>What&#x27;s happening is just morally wrong. Not because the situation may flip, but because there&#x27;s a higher moral law to things and what&#x27;s happening contradicts this law. Even if your side appears to be winning, it&#x27;s actually losing, because it&#x27;s losing its soul.')
