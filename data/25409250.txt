It was a thin operating system designed to only run one process, the JVM. So conceptually quite similar to this, but closed source. Then Oracle bought BEA, and then after a while (not straight away after the acquisition), Oracle killed it. Rumour has it that the Linux and Solaris teams were opposed to the idea of Oracle providing a third operating system with far less features than theirs did, which is part of why it was killed. I don&#x27;t think it was ever hugely popular with customers either.<p>(Disclaimer: Used to work for Oracle, but not directly on the products mentioned.)')
