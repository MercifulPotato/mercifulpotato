The first screen you see asks for a WiFi password, and I assume that it is going to start downloading updates in the background.  Instead, it prompts you to enter an email address for a Microsoft account.  The &quot;Learn More&quot; button says that you can make an offline account later, but right now they&#x27;d really like to have your personal information before letting you continue.<p>The only way to actually make a local account is to either (a) refuse to connect to WiFi until after an account is made or (b) disconnect the router while it is trying to talk to Microsoft.  Option (a) is inaccessible by the time you realize that there is a problem, and option (b) is ridiculous and needs to be found on third-party suggestions.  All so that Microsoft can pull in another email address.')
