Not in my (democratic) country, at least.<p>Instead, you need to announce a permit for a demonstration. If you don&#x27;t have one, the police will tell you to leave the premise. If you fail to comply, you might get arrested, even if you don&#x27;t use violence. But the part where protestors fail to comply with (reasonable and legal) instructions by the police is the part you omit.<p>Whereas I never got into trouble with the police. Partly because I got the popular skin colour, gender, etc but also because I know when to be obedient and sincere. I can only recommend the same. Pick your battles!')
