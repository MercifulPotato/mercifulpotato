Item(by='pedrosorio', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601980268, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24696170, text='&gt; Given this, it would be wrong to ascribe any over-arching superiority of Africans in sports<p>I don’t see anywhere in the parent comment where this was done. They specifically talk about (running) sprints and marathons.<p>The claim with respect to sprints does not seem too controversial. The fastest white man ever has a personal best that is tied for 49th in the 100m [1] - put another way, the top 50 fastest men ever, citizens of multiple countries, all have recent African ancestry.<p>A look at the fastest ever in the marathon [2] reveals a pattern of dominance by athletes of African ancestry as well. Very different ancestry (Kenyans and Ethiopians) and average phenotype from the ones who dominate the 100m as you’d expect but such confusion is inevitable when one talks about these topics in an American forum where “African ancestry” is supposed to mean some narrow and clearly defined thing...<p>&gt; This is a lie, and you know it. Many people of non-African origin do win such sprint and marathon contests<p>Are we following the same track and field events?<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.worldathletics.org&#x2F;records&#x2F;all-time-toplists&#x2F;sprints&#x2F;100-metres&#x2F;outdoor&#x2F;men&#x2F;senior" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.worldathletics.org&#x2F;records&#x2F;all-time-toplists&#x2F;spr...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.worldathletics.org&#x2F;records&#x2F;all-time-toplists&#x2F;road-running&#x2F;marathon&#x2F;outdoor&#x2F;men&#x2F;senior" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.worldathletics.org&#x2F;records&#x2F;all-time-toplists&#x2F;roa...</a>')
