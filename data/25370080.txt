We all know that QAnon isn&#x27;t literally illegal. I was asking you a series of moral questions, many of which can&#x27;t be answered with &quot;imminent lawless action&quot;.  For example, is it considered a &quot;thoughtcrime&quot; if the danger isn&#x27;t imminent?  If someone is working on detailed plans to kill the president, but the plan would take multiple years, should this person be stopped or should they be allowed to continue their plans until the danger is imminent?')
