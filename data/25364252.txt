So they felt that in order to protect the existence of the company, they really needed to be quiet about the floor mats at all costs. They probably rationalized it as &quot;well, how hard is it to check if your floor mat is curling up&quot; or something.<p>So that seems to be a structural issue.  When it comes to the existence of your job or your company, it&#x27;s too easy to rationalize unethical acts.  At least for most people.  Especially if their boss tells them to do it.')
