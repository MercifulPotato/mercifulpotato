Pretty much the only thing you couldn&#x27;t do was talk to other students. Even if you tried to contact other students by the internet (which they didn&#x27;t even try to police), there were several versions of each exam, so you were unlikely to find help.<p>They were still by far the hardest exams I took at University, because the questions were crafted such that you couldn&#x27;t easily find the answers. Trying to look up a question in the book or online was more likely to waste test time than get you the answer.')
