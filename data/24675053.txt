Lists can only contain strings, not other lists or dictionaries.<p>As for stringification, JSON&#x27;s data types are mismatched with pretty much everything that isn&#x27;t JavaScript to some degree.  If you need to serialize a 64-bit integer to JSON, you serialize it as a string because the parser on the other end is probably going to try to parse it as a double-precision floating point number.  Once you&#x27;ve started serializing numbers as strings anyway, it&#x27;s not too far to &quot;serialize every scalar as a string&quot;.')
