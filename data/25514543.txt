One can be aware of the problems faced in particular area so Media focuses on the right news, Politicians can see the problems, New entrepreneurs will be born to solve the problem they see&#x2F;face and there is awareness; life would be much easier. We can expect a solution to existing situation earlier. Time saver ! in terms of user acquisition and less marketing efforts.<p>If we talk about problems and when everyone keeps a follow-up definitely it will help the party to prioritise the work. Sometimes people have ideas but they are so busy in their life that they can’t give it enough time. Sharing is Caring... Many people can suggest solutions. Can you imagine thousands of people giving a thought to one problem?<p>Note: I did try using discourse.org official but burnt out of cash in just two months.')
