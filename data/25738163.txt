They will not be disrespected or treated unfairly in any way, shape or form!!!<p>&quot;To all of those who have asked, I will not be going to the Inauguration on January 20th.&quot;<p>I fail to see the issue with these tweets. He is not planning to attend an inauguration because he will not be inaugurated President? Is that such a huge problem? Is it even something that the incoming President was requesting? And what is the issue with the other tweet?<p>This is a bizarre hill that Twitter chose to spend 10% of their market cap on. It seems like there must have been something else that they could have picked that would have made more sense.')
