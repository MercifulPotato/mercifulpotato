Doesn&#x27;t the half-life of the enriched uranium reveal when it was enriched?<p>I am not an expert, but I believe Carbon dating is based on similar principles. Yet archeologists always give +-100 years variation in their estimates. Could IAEA really get to +-10 years or better? None of this would matter normally, except for the particular structure of the deal.<p>&gt;The US could have stayed party to the nuclear deal and coordinated any new negotiations with its European allies<p>Support from the EU isn&#x27;t the real question. We see the US can enforce unilaterally. Nor would Iran act differently if the EU had fully joined the pressure, or if the EU would also have torn up the deal. The question was whether to fix from inside or tear it up. Either way it would have to involve pressure.')
