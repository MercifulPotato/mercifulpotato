Janet is a Lisp-like language but in no way a lisp. Janet’s site now delibarely states that Janet is a Lisp-like language not a Lisp.<p>Janet can be parsed using a PEG parser, so I think that causes it to lose some expressivity of Lisp.<p>Janet is a cool language though, I like it. I wish there was a decent tutorial instead of just language reference docs. And the Core API documentation is a bit poor in my opinion. I’m trying to submit examples to Core API documentation, I’m hopeful it will get better in time.')
