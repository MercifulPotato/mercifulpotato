Item(by='devchris10', descendants=0, kids=None, score=2, time=1607718561, title='Ask HN: What Do You Think?', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='The problem (IMHO) around notes, scheduling, and productivity apps is that they have only subset of features that a given user needs. User workflows are very unique and diverse. Some may prefer calendar integration, some may not. Others may prefer inline image support while some only require text. The examples are endless. It seems inevitable that a note&#x2F;scheduling&#x2F;productivity app can only bloat user experience while being in the infinite race to onboard features their users&#x2F;competitors demand.<p>For the past few months, I have been designing an ecosystem of micro-apps that users can pick from to stitch together a workflow experience tailored to their needs. Users would obviously only pay for the apps they use. The idea is to eventually let developers contribute apps as long as they fit the goal of interoperability.<p>Some example micro-apps are browser extensions, spaced-repetition integration, email-able files, local only storage, encrypted cloud storage, calendar integration, vim support, reading queue, etc. Instead of dealing with the walled gardens of Notion, Evernote, Gsuite (despite their plugin support), do you think people will care for such an ecosystem?<p>Thanks for reading and any discussions&#x2F;feedback will be much appreciated.')
