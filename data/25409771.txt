One of the reasons I so very much wanted to join the company. And here I am still, nearly 11 years later.<p>I have done some fun stuff in 20% time. Some relatively serious projects that went somewhere; enough to keep me entertained. It’s true that if you have a demanding role it becomes more like 120% time. However it’s more the spirit of the thing that matters; the fact that you’re encouraged to pursue your interests on work time has led me to learn and experiment more than I would have otherwise.')
