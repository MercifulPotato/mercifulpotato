Proper use of this technique demands caution and care:<p>* All invariants must be made clear to maintainers of the trusted module...<p>* Every change to the trusted module must be carefully audited to ensure it does not somehow weaken the desired invariants.<p>* Discipline is needed to resist the temptation to add unsafe trapdoors that allow compromising the invariants if used incorrectly.<p>* Periodic refactoring may be needed to ensure the trusted surface area remains small...<p>In contrast, datatypes that are correct by construction suffer none of these problems.&quot;')
