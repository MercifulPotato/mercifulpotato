However, I&#x27;ve seen reports on the new voters in Texas voting to the right of the native Texans (e.g. from Ted Cruz&#x27;s campaign, might not be a good source for HN, but there is no evidence of the opposite) and since majority of these are from California it could be that California expats in Texas are far to the right of the average Texan. It could be that more conservatives than liberals are escaping California or it could be that liberals prefer to move to other states (like Washington?) or a combination of the two.')
