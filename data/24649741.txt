Item(by='sokoloff', descendants=None, kids=[24654730], score=None, time=1601552208, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24649332, text='SMDs with leads and 0603 or larger are quite easy to solder in my experience, at least on a factory-made PCB with solder mask. I can hand assemble SMD faster than thorough-hole, using a temp-controlled iron for both. (I have hot air rework station as well, but most of my SMD assembly is with a fairly inexpensive iron.)<p>SMD is a pain during prototyping and experimenting because theyâ€™re harder to use on breadboards (breakout boards are an additional step and possible point of failure). After the breadboarding stage, I think SMD is easier and faster.')
