But the Fed is just pumping it directly into the stock market. The result is sky high valuations and asset prices, but very little change in the actual day-to-day economy&#x27;s monetary supply. This is why inflation is still under 2%. And sure, people could sell out and take their cash to invest elsewhere, but with 0% interest rates there&#x27;s literally nowhere else to put it.')
