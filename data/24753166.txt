If you are trying to imply editors will accept GPT3 written papers somehow now or in the future, then that is completely false, disingenuous, and not based on reality at all. There is no need to &quot;imagine&quot; the acceptance of GPT3 text as it cannot produce anything remotely close to what editors and reviewers will accept. I am surprised this possibility is even being raised, and makes me doubt the extent of your actual involvement in the field.<p>SPIE has a different audience compared to basic research. There have been many highly cited papers from SPIE in my applied field. SPIE cooperates with OSA on the largest optics conferences for this very reason to cover applied and basic research.<p>If you are coming from the basic research side, then I would not make a comment such as &quot;being a PDF on a random website&quot; as it really discredits this avenue when it is an honest and serious journal in the applied side.<p>Aside from your reservations of industrial conflicts of the author of this paper, the journal is a fine avenue. Is it Nature? No, of course not. The editors themselves admit the very fact that its h-index cannot compete simply because it is a venue for applied research. But I would not go to the extreme of casting it as predatory or crank.')
