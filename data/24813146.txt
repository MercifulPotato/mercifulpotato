It&#x27;s suggesting that falsehoods and propaganda can flood the zone with so much shit that people are just tired of trying to sort though it to figure out what&#x27;s actually true and what isn&#x27;t. The modern (post-modern?) demagogue doesn&#x27;t bother with curtailing free speech, they just put out many false narratives like Putin does.\n &quot;The spewing of falsehoods isnâ€™t meant to win any battle of ideas. Its goal is to prevent the actual battle from being fought, by causing us to simply give up.&quot;')
