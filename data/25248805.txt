SV is one of the most diverse places in the US with HUGE representation from many many countries, backgrounds and social economic status. If you think about the fact that the overwhelming majority of Facebook and Google&#x27;s users are not based in the US at all, you might start to realize that the diversity problem is not about American black and latinos.<p>There IS a lack of women in tech and especially software engineering roles. This is bad but is something that will change now that computer science is such a popular major. There are plenty of women who are product managers and designers and those are the roles that make decisions about the product.<p>There is a lack of older people at startups but startups are a young person&#x27;s sport. I&#x27;m in my late 30s and I don&#x27;t want to be working for startups for the starting my 40s. It&#x27;s tiring as hell. There are plenty of older people in larger tech companies in SV.')
