At least in the Apple ecosystem, there are new technologies like SwiftUI and Mac Catalyst that should make this easier, particularly for the army of iOS developers looking to bring apps to the Mac.<p>Before starting my app, I did briefly consider going the cross-platform route, and I realize that it&#x27;s possible to build a decent app that way. But personally, I could always tell when I used one. Little things like swipe gestures and drag and drop didn&#x27;t quite work right. The extra polish, consistency, and speed of going native is so nice for things you use all day every day. With the shift to remote work, people might notice this extra 5-10% of polish more than they did a year ago.')
