When you start the chat with the bot it will answer with a standard message saying things like &quot;Hi, welcome to XXX&quot; and present you with a fixed menu of options like &quot;type 1 to create a new order&quot; or &quot;type 2 to inquire about an existing order&quot; and so on. At certain points the chat may be transferred to a human.<p>Some places might also try to use a more clever bot where you write down what you want and the bot gives a canned response if it thinks it understands what you meant (often just looking at keywords). These can be frustrating to use, just like those voice call bots that use voice recognition.')
