For a small local news site, they&#x27;d be super happy to get a $10 CPM on a local online ad.  So let&#x27;s just say for fun that we&#x27;d get the same rate for the hypothetical &#x27;Spotify for news&#x27; service.  Say a locally focused article about the latest city council meeting gets 20,000 views.  At a $10 CPM that only generates  $200 (or $0.01 per person).  Does that seem like enough revenue to cover the time it took the reporter to attend the meeting, write up the story, have it proofread&#x2F;edited, and then posted online and printed and still make a profit?  Probably not!<p>The sad part is that the $.01 per person rate is way, way higher than what Spotify apparently pays out (around $0.006 to $0.0084 from some Googling).<p>This starts to look better if you just go to something like $0.25 per read, but at that rate you&#x27;re likely charging much more than it would cost to buy a print copy, or a per-day subscription rate, so i&#x27;m not sure the economics would work out there either.')
