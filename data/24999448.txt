Here is a table with Carnot efficiencies calculated, assuming that the cool end of the cycle is something like a car radiator at just below the boiling point of water at 373 K (100 C or 212 F):<p>Material Temperature(Kelvin) Efficiency:<p>---<p>Coal 2250 83%<p>Iron 2073 82%<p>Propane 1533 76%<p>Wood 893 58%<p>Im having a hard time finding efficiencies for iron oxide electrolysis because all of the papers are behind paywalls. A big portion of the energy required is in heating the iron oxide in the first place, which could be done easily by solar collectors for free:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;newenergyandfuel.com&#x2F;http:&#x2F;newenergyandfuel&#x2F;com&#x2F;2010&#x2F;08&#x2F;31&#x2F;use-sunlight-to-smelt-iron-ore&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;newenergyandfuel.com&#x2F;http:&#x2F;newenergyandfuel&#x2F;com&#x2F;2010...</a><p>This claims about 85-96% efficiency for aluminum oxide electrolysis:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tms.org&#x2F;pubs&#x2F;journals&#x2F;JOM&#x2F;9905&#x2F;Welch-9905.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tms.org&#x2F;pubs&#x2F;journals&#x2F;JOM&#x2F;9905&#x2F;Welch-9905.html</a><p>I think a 95% efficiency might be reasonable for iron oxide if the temperature is raised by free solar thermal energy. So round trip efficiency is:<p>efficiency = 0.95 * 0.82 = 78%<p>This could be raised by a few percent by using a colder radiator (closer to room temperature at 300 K) and recapturing some of the waste heat with a Stirling engine. So I think that the article is accurate.<p>If someone has a table of electrolysis efficiencies for various compounds, that would be helpful.<p>Edit: after thinking about this for a moment, I realized that the Carnot efficiency should be calculated against room temperature if only the heat is being used and we aren&#x27;t generating electricity. It only increases the efficiencies in the table above by about 3-8% from hottest to coldest, respectively.<p>Edit 2: for anyone curious, capturing heat and converting it to electricity is usually about 70% efficient at a turbine, and 95% efficient at a generator, for about 65% total. That&#x27;s why a jet engine is limited to about 0.80 * 0.70 * 0.95 = 55% efficiency (40% in practice). Stirling engines are much closer to their ideal Carnot efficiency because their losses to turbulence (friction&#x2F;entropy) are much lower. If my numbers are a little off here, please correct me.')
