And selecting one part of that country is not going to work unless you match on all important factors.<p>The rigorous way to do this is: form a list of parameters that affect the pandemic, and then match on a large pool of countries to compare outcomes. Calibrate your system. You can&#x27;t just cherry pick either way. I can say - well, Sweden has similar pop densities to Germany, and Stockholm is denser than Berlin so Swedish should be worse. But that&#x27;s not rigorous, it&#x27;s just confirmation bias at work.<p>In truth, we&#x27;ll only know the outcomes when the pandemic is over - probably by 2022 for most countries - and then it&#x27;ll be an extended argument over whether it was worth say the economic damage, mental health consequences, etc. etc. for any actual reduction in excess deaths.<p>It&#x27;s complicated.')
