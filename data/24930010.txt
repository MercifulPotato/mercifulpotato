The title, &quot;Real-world SRE: What not FAANG companies are doing,&quot; implies that the series is going to look at how the majority of companies (as in, not startups) are implementing SRE. This is not the approach; rather, this specific article divides the world into either FAANG or SV-style startups, and ignores everything else. That&#x27;s not a microcosm I&#x27;m interested in.<p>Second, about the writing style. The stuttering caused by using sentence fragments everywhere is really jarring. It&#x27;s so bad that I couldn&#x27;t focus on the actual content. Normally I&#x27;m not much of a stickler for grammar, but in this case, it&#x27;s distracting.')
