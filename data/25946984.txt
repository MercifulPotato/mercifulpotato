No it wouldn&#x27;t.<p>Melvin faced cash calls. To raise cash fast they could (a) get it from their LPs (fat chance), (b) raise it from someone else or (c) sell other assets. The last option is a fire sale. You figure out what the fire sale discount would be, say it&#x27;s 50%, and then use that to get (b).<p>I don&#x27;t know what the terms of the bailout were. If I were structuring, I&#x27;d make it a loan with a super-high interest rate triply collateralized by their remaining assets. If they pay it back, I get the super high interest rate. If they default, I get the rest of their assets for 33Â¢ on the dollar. Between those two, the latter is frankly the higher-payoff scenario. (I would also require all short positions be closed out within N days, with the borrower&#x27;s investors bearing the losses.)')
