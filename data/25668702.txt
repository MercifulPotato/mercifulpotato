I don&#x27;t have a &#x27;Top List&#x27; at all, I just have access to google.<p>You seem to have a strongly held position on the subject, and I have no interest in trying to change your position. However, it would be beneficial for democracy if you would take the time to understand the position of those with different views than yourself. It helps a lot if you don&#x27;t actively admit (and condescendingly phrase) that you won&#x27;t spend your time to understand their concerns.<p>&gt; Not voting has an impact, so if the president that won starts a war, and you didn&#x27;t vote for the other guy (hypothetically) then you did actually effectively vote for the president. You don&#x27;t get to walk away from democracy like that.<p>Actually, not voting very specifically does <i>not</i> have an impact and reduces the thresholds required for recalls for elected officials. I&#x27;ll vote in every election once we have a voting system that doesn&#x27;t perpetuate the powers of the two most corrupt institutions in America.')
