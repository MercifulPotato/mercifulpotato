But that doesn&#x27;t mean they ban all US social media apps. If you follow their Internet laws (like Microsoft and Apple do) then you are allowed to operate.<p>&gt; US tries to ban 1 app that is being used to spread propaganda, farm user data, and is considered a national security threat.<p>This is an assumption. Proof please, because I haven&#x27;t seen any.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong. I am not against a ban on Tiktok. I&#x27;m against a <i>discriminatory</i> ban, based on unproven assumptions, solely targeting the origin of an app.<p>What would be much more fair would be to state: all foreign apps have to go through a security audit to certify that no data reaches any foreign governments. That way you don&#x27;t have to prove wrongdoing first, and you aren&#x27;t being discriminatory either.')
