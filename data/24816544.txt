But there are only two causes of economic collapse - external stressors, and internal mismanagement.<p>And the only situations in which they&#x27;re not the same are when physical disasters permanently destroy significant productive capacity. Everything else should be manageable.<p>Covid - and the Great Depression - both prove the economy is badly mismanaged. It <i>should</i> be possible to hit a pause button on non-essential activities, keep as many people as possible safe, fed, entertained and possibly even educated, and then hit restart when the threat is over.<p>&quot;Possible&quot; does not mean &quot;trivially easy.&quot; But it does mean &quot;Can be handled successfully with some adjustments and minimal attrition.&quot;<p>This culture just can&#x27;t do it. Its primary engine is debt-fuelled plutocracy and short-term profit-seeking, and it&#x27;s so inherently unstable it can&#x27;t cope rationally with a relatively minor and short-lived challenge like a nasty but not spectacularly deadly virus.')
