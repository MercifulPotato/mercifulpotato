This subverts that and makes it harder for Facebook to take further action in the future: shareholders will rightfully ask &quot;what if you lose even more users by banning &lt;socially negative thing&gt;&quot;.<p>Also, the bad thing about fb etc is that they just want to sell you advertising. But that&#x27;s also the good thing, Facebook don&#x27;t care about your politics, they don&#x27;t particularly want to influence you as a person, they just want you to click on ads for shit you don&#x27;t need.<p>I wonder about other social networks, eventually someone will weaponise one, and sell votes rather than clicks. Is this the start of that? An expressly Conservative social network is much better placed to sell souls than clicks...')
