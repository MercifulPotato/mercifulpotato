They should act like HBO in short.<p>I doubt they would, it&#x27;s seems opposite to their business model - try to beat the odds w&#x2F; lots of content and A&#x2F;B testing everything.<p>Netflix seems to be sitting in an awkward position between YouTube and HBO. They need to pick winners to compete w&#x2F; HBO, and production&#x2F;licensing costs have to be cheaper to compete w&#x2F; random YouTuber producing hours of content.')
