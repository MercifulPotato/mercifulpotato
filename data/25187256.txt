Oxford’s ChAdOx1 infects your cells to create RNA, then protein, then T-cell recognition&#x2F;apoptosis, then epitopes trigger B-cell antibody production. Moderna RNA skips the infection part. BioNTech epitopes go right to B-cells.<p>But, they also have deceasing stability and manufacturing scalability in that order.')
