If you have enough money they will literally do anything you want, as in this case. In my opinion, if they need to update their terms of service in order to make that easier they certainly will do so either after they take action or immediately before.<p>I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any reason to expect Twitter to honor the right to free speech as described in the US constitution as they aren&#x27;t associated with the US federal or any US state government. Any management of content on the site will be done only to the extent that it benefits Twitter monetarily.<p>In my opinion, there&#x27;s no good reason to expect anything different.')
