I&#x27;ve used something similar after file sharing mayhem in a startup of just 3 people. We finally created a few major folders and agreed to never change them.<p>Search today is still terrible. Nothing reaches across all content or platforms easily, and different scoring systems and operators in different interfaces means it&#x27;s just as big of a mess as the files it&#x27;s meant to find.<p>The ability to direct someone else to a location is also incredibly important, especially because &quot;where&quot; something is can be just as important as &quot;what&quot; is in it. Most systems seem to forget or abstract that away, to their own detriment.')
