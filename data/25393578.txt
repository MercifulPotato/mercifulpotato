They actually said that they don&#x27;t have time to check facts and counter narratives need to be spun quickly to combat Trump lies... regardless of facts. (Seth Abramson)<p>I really don&#x27;t blame people for being so twisted on this. It was 3 years of nonstop misinformation blaring from every major news outlet. The CIA&#x2F;FBI officials leaking to the media as anon sources should have been a clue, but not everyone is keen to this.<p>&quot;If you don&#x27;t read the newspaper, you&#x27;re uninformed.
