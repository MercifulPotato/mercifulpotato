But many reports that induced panic were just things that happen from time to time, only the population was not used to seeing it (no reporting). There were other aspects, too, like morgues closing out of fear or because of regulation (can&#x27;t handle the dead because of risk of infection).<p>Edit: HN doesn&#x27;t let me post more comments atm, so here is my reply to &quot;needs citations&quot;:<p>They &quot;need&quot; citations? Why do they need them, because it is my duty to convince you? Why?<p>If you are interested, you can ask if I have citations, or you can google yourself. But there is no &quot;need&quot; as such, because it is not my duty to convince you.<p>These things made the rounds at the high time early in the pandemic. Maybe if I have time I&#x27;ll google them later. Maybe you could google for &quot;Morgues closing corona&quot; or something like that.<p>New York especially afaik has a problem with Morgues, even in normal times there are not enough of them, and it is not easy to build more because of regulations.')
