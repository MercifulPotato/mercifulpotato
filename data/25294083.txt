People call that &quot;biting the hand that feeds you.&quot;  So even if you have a legitimate grievance or have witnessed clearly unethical behavior with your employer, maybe you decide to keep quiet because you need the money from your job.<p>Your employer just influenced what you write without having <i>any</i> editorial control over you.')
