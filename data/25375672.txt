I don&#x27;t have a link readily available but they should be easy enough to find if you look.<p>There have been a few witnesses in these hearings that have been debunked.  For example one lady testified that people were voting in MI without identification.  Which is perfectly legal.  A bit disconcerting, but legal.  Other witnesses have provided wild speculation (e.g. Smartmatic hacking) with indeed no evidence.<p>The vast majority of the witnesses at these hearings, however, do seem to be legitimate complaints.  It seems odd to me, that a reasonable person, after listening to their testimonies, would not at least have some doubts regarding the integrity of the election.<p>Whether it&#x27;s the constitutional issues regarding signature matching in PA, or the poll watchers being thrown out in MI, or the many other issues at hand, it seems that at least one of these reasons would be cause for concern.  And these aren&#x27;t small issues - they could potentially affect hundreds of thousands of ballots.<p>So when people say that there is &quot;no evidence&quot; - I am a little bit shocked, surprised, at how quickly these claims are dismissed.  Usually people point to the judges&#x27; casual dismissal, as justification for their own casual dismissal.  Very rarely have I seen much effort made in actually investigating the claims that have been made.  Actual investigation into these issues have been limited at best, and done with the strict intent of &quot;debunking&quot; rather than trying to get to the truth.<p>( Please be considerate with the downvotes.  I am a new user and the negative karma is causing rate limits, effectively censoring me from this discussion.  I am trying to have reasonable, constructive discourse. )')
