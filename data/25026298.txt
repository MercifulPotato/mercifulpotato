It kind of worked, but would not very well support configuring files in the users home directory for example. Also setting up services locally needed for development (RabbitMQ, Tomcat etc) became much easier with Docker. I switched to Docker for that purpose, and most of the chef scripts became unnecessary. What the nixos package manager can easily solve is managing configuration files in the users-home (using home-manager), as well as installing different versions of different tools at the same time. You can even go as far as using direnv to automatically provide the tools (jdk, nodejs, gradle etc) when entering a given project just checked out from git.<p>Therefore Chef (they other tools are equivalent in my view) is IMHO not a good enough tool to manage dev environments.')
