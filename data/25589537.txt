Item(by='KirillPanov', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609388270, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25582490, text='&gt; Look at a company like Anker.<p>Same with &quot;gl.inet&quot; (weird name, yes).<p>They operate in the most trashed-up market on earth: cheap internet-connected widgets.  But I will buy from them every single time because all their products run a modified OpenWRT and <i>all</i> of them let you replace it with vanilla upstream OpenWRT.  And all of their recent products have a physical &quot;unbrick this device&quot; button you hold down to boot to a slick reflash-the-firmware-over-the-network ROM.<p>I will not hesitate to pay twice as much for a gl.inet widget because of this.')
