I recommend them -- they are not merely boosterism. The author provides a thorough rebuttal of the hype around hydrogen for cars &amp; home heating. &#x27;Blue&#x27; and &#x27;grey&#x27; hydrogen (from fossil fuels with or without carbon capture) are addressed. The upshot is that carbon tax would be necessary to shut &#x27;grey&#x27; hydrogen out. After that, initially &#x27;blue&#x27; hydrogen would win on cost, but &#x27;green&#x27; hydrogen could eventually become cheaper.')
