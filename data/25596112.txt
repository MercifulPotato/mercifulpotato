This is still an early science. NLP research still hasn’t considered many important aspects of language learning that we have discovered in such a short period of time.<p>&gt; starting with an empirical result<p>What makes you think these benchmarks are empirical? They were hand constructed to fit some objective, assuming that being good at the said objective is required for NLP tasks. Where’s the empirical experiments to validate the notion that said objectives lead to language? Science hasn’t worked this way, datasets aren’t constructed, you do an experiment and MEASURE it. Then you make models, try to explain the phenomenon, and test new ideas and validate your models. Can your model extrapolate new information and suggest new experiments to validate? I used the word extrapolate over predict intentionally.')
