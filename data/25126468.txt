This is true for a lot of powerful tools. At the end of the day, what is intuitive is what you have used a lot. If you&#x27;re using a tool that fits an entirely different paradigm from what you are normally used to, it&#x27;s going to be unintuitive. It&#x27;s fair to say this frustrates everyone, especially in the beginning.<p>All that being said, this is not a reason to then take the next step and claim that basic competence in what is today an essential tool is optional. It is necessary and to work well you must know it well, otherwise the frustration you point out will be part of your life every day. As opposed to something that you live through and say goodbye to.<p>The fact that everyone is taking this as toxic or willfully oblivious is as far as I&#x27;m concerned infantile. It has nothing to do with &quot;being a real man&quot; (whatever that means to you), it has something to do with having the maturity to realise that you are making your own problems.<p>That is not to say we cannot build a better tool. Perhaps we can! Up until this point I have not seen it done without losing something else in turn.')
