So if you feed it &quot;74 + 129 = &quot; it will come up with 203, even if that specific math problem never occurred in any of the text it was trained on. That to me is the most impressive result so far - not only is it possible, but also more efficient, for the model to actually encode the rules of addition instead of just memorizing the results for specific math problems. This to me seems like the dawn of insight and understanding, and I&#x27;m super excited to see what comes next.')
