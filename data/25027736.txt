It doesn&#x27;t help that politicians bait people into getting outraged (Trump on the right, Sanders &amp; AOC likes on the left). Build enough outrage and people will protest, doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s justified or rational. It&#x27;s very easy to get brainwashed into believing that the inherent unfairness of life is somehow a product of &#x27;the system&#x27;.<p>Do you know who gets outraged and &#x27;protest&#x27; regularly?
