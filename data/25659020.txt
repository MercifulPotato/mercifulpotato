Besides if one has to have a clear conscience to match everyone&#x27;s standard here, one should stop working at FAANG, stop using FAANG products, maybe stop using big oil products, stop using big pharma products, is it ok to pay taxes to a govt if you don&#x27;t agree with something they did or should one pick up and move too? what else did I miss?<p>HN is so much of a echo chamber lately for some topics, there was a recent discussion about FB head of integrity leaving the company and the top comment and thread was a personal attack on the FB CEO&#x27;s integrity without even understanding what an integrity team&#x2F;dept does in these companies. I could just as well have been reading youtube comments. I see threads with some topics now and I can pretty much be sure to not expect to learn anything new or get a good discourse. Just people thinking they are better than others.')
