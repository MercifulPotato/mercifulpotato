During influenza season, the hospital I work at sometimes cancel elective procedures if it&#x27;s a particularly bad year for influenza. Luckily influenza season has an end date. With COVID, we hardly even had any capacity left for oncology, the last thing we might cancel. Luckily the lockdown effects happened just in time before we had to take drastic measures there. This was not just a local problem, as patients here are centrally spread over all hospitals in the country.<p>That&#x27;s the real problem with the disease, not only the fatality rate and long-term effects, but how quickly and severely it can bring a hospital system and all associated healthcare to its knees.')
