I find niche Youtubers catering to my interests to be a better use of my time -- recently, we&#x27;ve been binging on 3Blue1Brown.<p>I&#x27;m also finding very little relation between production budget (which mostly goes into things like SFX) and my enjoyment. Some of my favorite films were very low budget, from Dr. Horrible to some Bruce Campbell flicks.<p>Good writing makes a huge difference.<p>Decent acting and performance makes a bit of difference.<p>Replacing all the SFX with sixties-era Star Trek SFX wouldn&#x27;t make a wit of difference to my enjoyment.<p>There is a correlation between finding good writers and having big budgets -- if you&#x27;re dropping $300 million to make a film you might as well hire good writers -- but it&#x27;s not a super-strong correlation.')
