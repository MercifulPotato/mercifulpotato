If one has a monolith I would argue that &quot;splitting it up&quot;, in that case known as &#x27;improving coherence&#x27; and &#x27;reducing dependency&#x27; is much easier and falls under essential complexity.<p>Generally, I would say that tools are a very big part of it. One example. Why did we go from svn to git again? O yes, git can do so much more. But now you actually have to do all of these &#x27;so much more&#x27; things. This gives you a very beautiful commit history if you do it well but is a very beautiful commit history really that important? You tell me.... maybe it is and maybe it isn&#x27;t and maybe it depends on the nature of the project....')
