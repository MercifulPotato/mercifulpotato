Never was &quot;everything wrong&quot; with contemporary theories on any field. If existing (applied) theories were 100% wrong then people wouldn&#x27;t use them at all. New theories (even groundbreaking ones) usually build upon previous ones and&#x2F;or become a more complete version of them, a superset. Thinking one can erase 300 years of thought on a field is veeery small minded.')
