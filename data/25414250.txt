Example of a worse case: the attacker knows that + the first 2 characters of your password (real-life example).<p>The worst case would probably be something like &quot;attacker knows hash, passwd algorithm, full state of machine at passwd generation time incl. random seed and all characters of the password but one&quot;. It is clearly far worse than your case, though I find your case more relevant than this one.')
