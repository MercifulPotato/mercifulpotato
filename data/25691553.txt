I&#x27;m a Prime member, so it&#x27;s nice to get some extra value out of it.<p>Since I&#x27;m in effect paying for it, I also feel better that Amazon are going to keep unlimited (or at least, &quot;a lot&quot;) of storage available for Prime members, as it&#x27;s a good selling point, especially with Google dropping free unlimited storage.<p>Switching was easy - just download the app, login, and photos on my phone were uploaded to Amazon. I didn&#x27;t bother trying to migrate anything from Google to Amazon though. Feature-wise, the Amazon Photos app seems pretty comparable to Google Photos, at least as far as I use them. It also does the &quot;on this day 1..n years ago&quot; kind of thing, which is one of my favourite features of both Google and Amaon Photos!<p>I should add, Google&#x2F;Amazon are not the only backup target for my family photos: I also backup to a private Seafile instance, and to OneDrive (I get a lot of storage for having the Microsoft Action Pack).')
