Instead, it’s the color you get when you pump half the power of full white through your Cathod-Ray Tube (CRT).<p>While true, to avoid confusion, it might be better rephrased without bringing human color perception or even colors into the mix.<p>sRGB uses non-linear (gamma) values, which are good for 8-bit representation. However, operating on them as normal (linear) numbers using average (expecting blur) or addition, multiplication (expecting addition, multiplication of corresponding light) - gives nonsensical, mathematically and physically inaccurate results, perceived by any sensor, human or animal as not what was expected.<p>RGB colorspace in it&#x27;s linear form is actually very good for calculations, it&#x27;s the gamma that messes things up.<p>In simplified monochrome sRGB&#x2F;gamma space, a value <i>v</i> means <i>k·v^g</i> units of light, for some <i>k</i> and gamma <i>g = 2.2</i>.\nAttempting to calculate an average like below is simply incorrect - you need to degamma¹ (remove the ^g), calculate and then re-gamma (reapply ^g).<p><pre><code>  (k*v1^g + k*v2^g)&#x2F;2 = k*(v1^g + v2^g)&#x2F;2 != k*((v1+v2)&#x2F;2)^g\n</code></pre>\n¹ gamma function in sRGB is a bit more complex than f(x) = x^2.2')
