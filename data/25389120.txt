You can implement S3 suspend using the same callbacks as your runtime_pm callbacks, but you don&#x27;t need to.<p>The runtime_pm framework is for when applications are still running but the device goes to sleep. In S3 suspend first every single user space application freezes, then the drivers go to sleep. S3 is much easier to implement.')
