Nope. Note that Elon Musk &#x2F; Tesla nor any other self driving car uses anything of the sort. It all needs to be running on the car. And they&#x27;re managing to do self driving already without any 5G. For uploads you can just wait til the car is home and use the wifi, or slowly (though not that slowly really) upload with 4G.')
