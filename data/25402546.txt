Indeed, the current educational system often does the exact opposite.  This becomes more apparent the farther you advance through the system.  Success in most post-grad programs is primarily about a student&#x27;s willingness and ability to absorb established dogma and conform to orthodoxy.  Those who are not willing or able to conform (culturally, socially, politically and educationally) will find their academic progress severely inhibited at every turn and eventually find themselves on the outside looking in.<p>The paradox is that those in power do not (and have never) want a necessarily skeptical, inquisitive and free-thinking population.  They want a docile population that is easy to control.  A population that uncritically absorbs and believes whatever messages are disseminated by those in power.  This system works well when you have a virtual monopoly on information, and all of the people get their information from ABC, CBS or NBC.  It stops working so well when a decentralized system of spreading information comes along, whether its referred to as &quot;the internet&quot; or &quot;social media&quot;, and suddenly you have a population that has been conditioned for generations to lack skepticism that is blasted with conflicting messages, ads and propaganda from all angles.<p>Those in power are now left with a problem that has two possible solutions.  Either start a massive campaign where every man, woman and child is taught to be necessarily skeptical, to think critically in all things and reject all established orthodoxies, or to try to put the information genie back in the bottle.  The former strategy (if successful) would lead to a population that is very difficult to control and govern.  A society filled with critical thinkers and those who question and scrutinize every policy and every assertion by those in power (and everyone else).  The latter strategy (the one that has been chosen) is to attempt to close down those decentralized systems of spreading information.  Regain control over the information narrative through a massive censorship campaign where those who are not actively working to push the establishment narrative are silenced.  Unfortunately, its clear which path our benevolent overlords have embarked on.  Whether the excuse is, &quot;hate speech&quot; or &quot;disinformation&quot; or &quot;foreign influence&quot;, the desired result is the same.  Silence dissenting voices, regain the information monopoly, and feed the gullible dullards you have cultivated the diet of information that you wish them to consume.  Fortunately (or unfortunately, depending on your point of view), its always very difficult to put the genie back in the bottle - which is why we are seeing the battles over free speech, censorship and information control play out before our very eyes.')
