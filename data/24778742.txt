The HTC Vive, non-pro version only costs $599 with base stations. Where are you getting $900 from?<p>I agree with the high total cost though. Most people pushing PC VR, will forget about how much a real VR ready PC will cost. It&#x27;s easy to spend close to $3000 even when people loathed to admit it.')
