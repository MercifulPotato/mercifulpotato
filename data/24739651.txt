But in 6 hours from sleeping almost like clockwork I will be awake- and quite wide awake. It ususally takes another hour to fall back asleep, or sometimes I just decide to be awake.<p>So personally, moving towards the no-supplement tact is appealing even if it is much harder in artificial environments.')
