I honestly don’t think committing is any more work than stashing at all, not even more typing. It’s really not more difficult to commit what you have temporarily, go to another branch to work, then come back and continue working, compared to stash. But I don’t doubt that it <i>feels</i> more difficult for some reason. Is it the need to make a commit message that causes the mental friction? Does git reset somehow seem tricker than git stash pop? Think about how you typically rebase when you’re done anyway, so that means when you come back to a branch with a temporary commit, you don’t have to stash pop, you can just add more changes and squash or rebase it all later. With the stash workflow you have to keep the stashes in your head, and manually pop them. They get harder to manage than branches when you have multiple stashes, since they’re disconnected from their context. Personally I think if you examine what it really takes to use commits &amp; branches, and practice using them more, you may find it’s just as easy as the stash workflow, if not easier, and it comes with a wider safety net and is easier to manage when you have a lot of different changes in flight at once. I also think it helps to realize that a branch is nothing more than a named SHA, they are incredibly lightweight, and using them ought to reflect that.')
