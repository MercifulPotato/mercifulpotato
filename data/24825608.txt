For example, the idea of a strong centralized state power speak to communists (left) as well as nationalists (right). As well, the idea of equality of every citizen of jacobinism can be closer to centrist than extremist.<p>Fun remark : only the English Wikipedia article emphasis so much on a link Jacobin-left (for the languages i can read). On the other hand, the french article is much more careful and emphasis more on the difficulty and evolution of interpretation.')
