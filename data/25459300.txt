That looks more like a different type of letter, sent to a wider audience than just Timnit to her manager(s).<p>I&#x27;ve seen referenced that there was a timeframe for when she was going to quit that she mentioned.  I see no such reference in that letter.<p>Maybe there&#x27;s a real copy of the letter floating around.  My guess is that people pretend that they&#x27;ve seen &quot;the letter&quot; but only read this other one I referenced above.<p>I&#x27;m happy to be proved wrong, though.  I have no dog in this fight except to understand the truth of the situation.  If you&#x27;ve seen a different letter than shows her ultimatum and time frame, please share.')
