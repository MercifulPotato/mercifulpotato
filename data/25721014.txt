Item(by='Natsu', descendants=None, kids=[25722628], score=None, time=1610318630, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25720213, text='&gt; If everyone else is talking about violent action January 18th, and then you talk about people you&#x27;d like killed in the same general conversation, you don&#x27;t walk just because you never specified the specific time yourself.<p>And where, precisely, is that proposition found to be found in law or precedent?<p>&gt; We have constitutional lawyers on the other side arguing the bar set in Brandenburg is met by Trump&#x27;s comments alone<p>And now you switch subjects again to <i>Trump&#x27;s</i> comments when we were discussing Lynn&#x27;s.<p>You&#x27;re trying to gesture at an article you haven&#x27;t even properly cited to blame a <i>different person entirely</i> which does nothing to establish that the authority gestured at even agrees with you in the first place.<p>Now, if you have, say, a link to a proper legal analysis saying here are these specific statements by Lynn and this is why we think they meet the tests based on these and these precedents, then go ahead and present that.  But if you&#x27;re just going to continue to switch topics instead of trying to make your claims more precise, then I see no reason to engage further.<p>Here, I&#x27;ll even help you:<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;userwww.sfsu.edu&#x2F;dlegates&#x2F;URBS513&#x2F;howtodoa.htm" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;userwww.sfsu.edu&#x2F;dlegates&#x2F;URBS513&#x2F;howtodoa.htm</a><p>The issue, so that we don&#x27;t keep changing topics, should be:<p>Whether Lynn Wood&#x27;s January 7th statement &quot;Get the firing squads ready. Pence goes FIRST.&quot; meets the test for imminent lawless action.')
