Item(by='raphlinus', descendants=None, kids=[25471410], score=None, time=1608322064, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25470500, text='I agree that support for VoiceOver (and other assistive technology) and full support for keyboard shortcuts is essential for a production GUI toolkit. We certainly don&#x27;t do those yet, but I do think we can get there.<p>Rust makes it easier to bind platform capabilities at a low level than most other languages. As an example, we do cut&#x27;n&#x27;paste cross-platform, supporting complex media types, not just plain text, so we can round-trip a vector glyph from Runebender to other font editors. I think that&#x27;s a taste of being able to take on these more ambitious challenges.<p>Also, &quot;native&quot; UI toolkits are a lot less actually native than they used to be. On Windows, the old HWND-per-control and GDI drawing model (long considered the standard for &quot;native&quot; Windows UI) is long obsolete, and there are actually a whole bunch of toolkits that people use, with UWP the most actively supported. Apple has a stronger story, but even there you have AppKit + SwiftUI, and technically Catalyst is officially supported, though nobody would argue it&#x27;s actually a good experience.<p>And the fact is, a lot of people are using Electron, because it actually solves the business problem of delivering good-enough UI. I think we have a good shot at competing against that niche, and also that building it on Rust is a more solid foundation than any other language ecosystem.')
