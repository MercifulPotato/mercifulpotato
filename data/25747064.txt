Item(by='curryst', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610460559, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25740881, text='&gt; Note that the person who buys the 1-year devices every year pays 10x the &quot;externality fees&quot; as the person who buys the 10-year device.<p>That may not be clear at time of purchase though. You could express this as an estimated rate per year, though. Both devices have a $50 externality fee. One has a 1 year warranty, 1 has a 10 year warranty, so the first has a $50&#x2F;year externality and the second has a $5&#x2F;year externality. Doing it by warranty period also helps prevent claiming a device should last much longer than it does.')
