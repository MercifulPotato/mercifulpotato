Item(by='adamsea', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606117185, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25181803, text='&gt; I get that these things are all because women are underrepresented in tech and surely there are challenges for women and sexism against women. However, the examples above still feel like sexism to me.<p>These two sentences contradict each other.<p>You also say &quot;I am not all men&quot;, but, sadly, the issue with <i>systemic</i> biases (racism, sexism, etc), is that it&#x27;s not about individuals.<p>You seem smart enough to be able to theorize about ways in which, as a man, you may have unknowningly benefited from systemic biases over the course of your education &#x2F; career.<p>For one thing you don&#x27;t have to worry about being sexually harassed or raped by a friend&#x2F;coworker - the numbers are pretty bad.<p>We&#x27;re supposed to be rational, work with numbers, etc - so even if we can&#x27;t <i>prove</i> the effect of a systemic bias on an individual, our knowledge of the <i>data</i> and basic statistics should lead us to be able to make reasonable <i>inferences</i> about general cases, etc.<p>I guess what I&#x27;m saying is, be the bigger man, in both ways in which that phrase can be read. It&#x27;s not all about you.')
