Item(by='soraminazuki', descendants=None, kids=[25382575], score=None, time=1607653246, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25379693, text='&gt; no epic store, no steam, no GOG etc<p>The current situation sucks, but it&#x27;s worth mentioning that this alternative sucks equally as well. Specifically, games from these distributors often install dodgy kernel drivers rendering computers useless for purposes other than gaming for anyone who are conscious about security and privacy.<p>Furthermore, advertising, entertainment, and gaming industries are known to be hostile towards users when they&#x27;re given control over user devices. They would most certainly force users onto their own app stores when given the chance and proceed to install whatever invasive piece of software they seem fit.<p>So while I&#x27;d love to have an easy way to install community-run  app stores for free and open source software, I&#x27;d be wary of any attempts by user-hostile industries to create their own app store. I&#x27;d really like to be proven wrong, but it seems we currently have a choice between two evils.<p>&gt; no music besides iTunes store (no spotify)<p>FYI you can install the Spotify app from the App Store at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;app&#x2F;spotify-music-and-podcasts&#x2F;id324684580" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;app&#x2F;spotify-music-and-podcasts&#x2F;id3...</a>')
