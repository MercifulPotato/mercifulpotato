Item(by='smsm42', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603180456, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24833544, text='&gt; is an educated population easier to be manipulated than an illiterate one<p>Good question. Depends on how the education is done. If the education is done to instill the idea that one must &quot;believe in science&quot;, instead of learning the facts and questioning them skeptically, if one is convinced that expressing dissent is harmful and akin to violence, if questioning the dominating framework is actively discouraged and dissenters are viciously attacked, if people are taught that there can be no honest disagreement, and any different of opinion is nothing but a power move in an oppression framework, if everybody is assigned their places and recommended opinions in advance, if they are instructed that any non-conforming opinion must be silenced and suppressed - then such &quot;educated&quot; people are much easier to manipulated than the illiterate ones.<p>An illiterate person knows they are illiterate - there&#x27;s no way to hide that fact from themselves. They know there are places they must tread carefully for their knowledge has obvious limits. A mal-educated person thinks they know all the answers, and learned The Truth, and thus hold the keys to the universe. Moreover, they feel a moral duty to lord over lesser creatures and guide them to The Truth, for their own benefit. This is an ideal human brick for building the totalitarian barracks.')
