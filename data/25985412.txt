The tapioca pearls even look a little like bubbles.<p>Often bubble and boba are used interchangeably now, but I think they originally referred to two different types of tea-based drink, as the Chinese-language names still do. The same shop often sells both types of drink, so this inevitably adds to the confusion.<p>Google image search 泡沫紅茶 and 珍珠奶茶 to see the difference')
