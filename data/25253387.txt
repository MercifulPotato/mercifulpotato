And a lot of things like animations are very straightforward to do.<p>The downside is whenever you want to do something quite standard in UIKit that doesn&#x27;t exist yet in SiwftUI. The &quot;carousel&quot; that we have at the start of the app is a UIPageViewController in UIKit, but we had to re-implement it ourselves in SwiftUI.<p>Also there are weird bugs and crashes. A lot. I think in the end, the productivity gain from SiwftUI evens out to the same productivity as UIKit due to the time spend on those bugs&#x2F;limitations.<p>We also planned to build widgets very soon, and having the same code base (they are SwiftUI only) is definitely going to be a plus.')
