From the Wikipedia article on those [1]:<p>&gt; In the language of materials science, nanoscale semiconductor materials tightly confine either electrons or electron holes. Quantum dots are sometimes referred to as artificial atoms, emphasizing their singularity, having bound, discrete electronic states, like naturally occurring atoms or molecules. It was shown that the electronic wave functions in quantum dots resembles the ones in real atoms. By coupling two or more such quantum dots an artificial molecule can be made, exhibiting hybridization even at room temperature.<p>There is a comment in the &quot;Talk&quot; section for that Wikipedia article that expands on this:<p>&gt; Artificial atoms refer to a whole class of systems that behave like atoms in the sense of discrete energy levels, not just quantum dots. Large metal objects that respond in peculiar ways to microwave radiation, for example, are called artificial atoms as well. Anyway, I must sound like a loony without any references, but if I have time I&#x27;ll come back with some.<p>and there is a response to that:<p>&gt; I can link this YouTube video by Andrea Morello explaining artificial atoms and quantum dots: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=BUKKwyQLG2c" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=BUKKwyQLG2c</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Quantum_dot" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Quantum_dot</a>')
