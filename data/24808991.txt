It might influence the desires of users at the time.<p>- economy trying to leverage internet as a new phase in customer access and higher business profits (never good.). Old economy was also not in the best shape and now everybody thinks or wants to make it&#x27;s own little place on the web game. People are not here to chill they&#x27;re here to win something. Vastly different mindset.<p>- a false assumption that connecting everything with computers would make our lives lean, instead of separate programs, computers and persons.. you have one cloud thing where everything can be shared. Obvious idea in retrospect .. but releasing friction is also letting weird unplanned stuff happen without control. Look at how much things now have limits (smartphone time etc).<p>- naivety regarding &#x27;spaces&#x27;.. internet was a hippie thing kinda, but whenever systems grow they start to influence the whole thing (facebook,..)')
