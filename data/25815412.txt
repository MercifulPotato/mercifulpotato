Item(by='robin21', descendants=None, kids=[25817442], score=None, time=1610920387, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25812407, text='&gt; nationalism of any kind is one of the most pernicious scourges on humanity...That&#x27;s not nationalism.<p>I would suggest instead of using an `-ism` just say what you mean. It just leads to needless arguments otherwise.<p>X are Ys. Ys believe Z. Therefore Xs believe Z.<p>The fallacy is that not all X&#x27;s believe Z, but painting everyone with the same brush is a much easier way to channel one&#x27;s anger.<p>You inflame the discussion when you say &quot;whatever the flavor&quot; and &quot;of any kind&quot;, because there are clearly many kinds and different interpretations as exemplified in this discussion.<p>Also try the definition from Wikipedia:<p>&gt; Nationalism is an idea and movement that promotes the interests of a particular nation (as in a group of people), especially with the aim of gaining and maintaining the nation&#x27;s sovereignty (self-governance) over its homeland.<p>Seems to counter your definition quite extensively, which is why I direct you back to my original suggestion.')
