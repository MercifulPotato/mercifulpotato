He is a much better organ player than I could ever hope to be!  Naturally the score was designed to reflect the book of revelation, so you could see elements of music that keyed off that text but it&#x27;s sort of conventional and unconventional at the same time.  It was fun to read as the music is sort of witty, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d enjoy listening to the whole thing.<p>I&#x27;ve only known two people who had organs at home, Alan Kay and Don Knuth.  Steve Jobs bought a house in Woodside that had an organ in it, but I heard he removed it.  I never heard that he played music himself.')
