Mainly the amount of thinking required, and where that thinking involves thinking about the code, what was intended by the legacy code, who do I talk to, are they an asshole, should I bother talking to them or just do something to get the job done, what don&#x27;t I know, do I refactor, or not, etc. etc. None of the stuff you do at work is simple. It&#x27;s either complicated, or if you are lucky just complex. Making code and UI&#x27;s simple seem to be low down on priority lists, and a lot of developers like making coding fun at the expense of making it easy to understand. So yeah I&#x27;m a bit over it all.')
