Individuals who were Ad5 seropositive had an immune response to subsequent Ad5-based treatments. They developed an immunity to Ad5 which is just a delivery vector for the viral protein you&#x27;re trying to introduce.<p>The CanSino vaccine also uses Ad5 as it&#x27;s viral vector. An immunity to Ad5 from say Sputnik V would apparently prevent you from being able to get the CanSino one should Sputnik V prove ineffective for you. You&#x27;d also not be able to get a booster of Sputnik V later.<p>There&#x27;s lots of adenovirus strains and a few other vaccines are using them for their delivery vectors. Ad5 is an edited adenovirus that has it&#x27;s replication system retarded&#x2F;removed. There&#x27;s other articles I&#x27;ve seen but can&#x27;t find now lamenting the use of Ad5 specifically. There was also the STEP study that showed  increased HIV susceptibility in people that had received Ad5 vaccines.<p>I am not a medical professional but I do understand immunology is extremely complex. Effective vaccines in vitro aren&#x27;t necessarily effective in vivo. There&#x27;s also complex issues around dosing which is part of human trials. Even if a vaccine is &quot;effective&quot; it&#x27;s not necessarily obvious or known what sort of dosing is appropriate for wide deployment in the general population. A completely &quot;effective&quot; vaccine at the wrong dose can end up being ineffective.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC2756115&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC2756115&#x2F;</a>')
