Let&#x27;s say then that we can&#x27;t make determinations, but can tell when something is just definitely not true, like 90% of gun owners definitely do not support ending private sales.<p>&gt;If you ask if a gun owner should give their guns to a trusted friend of family member for safekeeping if they feel depressed or suicidal, most people would also say that was a good idea. Of course they wouldnâ€™t realize they had just criminalized it.<p>Man, whole separate topic right there!
