Do your research before writing these blog posts.<p>I don&#x27;t want to put down anyone for writing these blog posts. The idea is nice <i>from a distance</i>, but the reality doesn&#x27;t work like that.<p>It&#x27;s shoehorning something not suitable for this situation. There&#x27;s singularity which runs on non-root environments, however it&#x27;s not for desktop systems, but multi-tenant clusters.<p>I really get frustrated when people advocate expensive abstractions for minimal gains.

Docker already makes debugging very hard by being immutable and impenetrable as is.')
