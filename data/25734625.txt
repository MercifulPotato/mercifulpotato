It does, however, contain a link.  What the link is to doesn&#x27;t matter, but accounts that post links in their first comments are likely to be automatically tagged as spam, which I&#x27;m guessing is what happened to you.  It doesn&#x27;t happen to all HN accounts, as you can see by all the brand-new green accounts posting in political threads lately.')
