It has plenty of mass to dissipate that heat now (the whole metal plate behind the screen), earlier revisions had much worse thermals. This week I&#x27;ve played games on it for almost an hour attached to external 1080p screen and it was pretty warm in touch, but not hot at all; the CPU sensor showed 55°C and quickly cooled down when it went idle.<p>Of course Reform is going to perform much better at sustained high loads, that&#x27;s obvious, but Librem 5&#x27;s thermals really aren&#x27;t bad. If anything, its thermals have the opposite problem - the lower bound of its temperature is rather high (around 30°C) as it doesn&#x27;t suspend. Regarding the upper bound, I really don&#x27;t think about it at all during my regular usage.')
