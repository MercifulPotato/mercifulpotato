Item(by='Fwirt', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610658557, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25779347, text='I recently started learning Tcl for the heck of it and am surprised by what a nice little language it is and that it doesn&#x27;t get more publicity. It&#x27;s true that it&#x27;s not great for working with numbers or complex data structures, but it&#x27;s a really nice language for &quot;plumbing&quot;, and is still in active development. The last few releases have added support for tail-call recursion, &quot;coroutines&quot;, and native dictionaries. It&#x27;s had a bytecode compiler for like 20 years, so it&#x27;s not as slow as it used to be.<p>As far as complaints about the syntax being weird: It&#x27;s far more consistent than Algol descendants in that everything is a string, much like everything in Lisp is a list. You don&#x27;t have to learn a bunch of different syntactic constructs, everything is a string, and every string is a space-delimited list, and can be interpreted as a command. The hardest part of the language is the quoting rules, which the documentation affectionately refers to as &quot;quoting hell&quot;. Once you wrap your head around that, everything becomes clear. The standard library is pretty easy to learn, and the documentation is good.<p>Check it out.')
