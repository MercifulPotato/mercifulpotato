Both Uber and Bolt charge like normal taxi companies in Stockholm and can therefore afford to pay their drivers at the same time as making a profit. And as far as I know Bolt is basically already profitable, they just copied Uber&#x27;s business but reduced the administration costs and did not blow a ton of cash on self driving cars. Having their HQ in Tallinn rather than SF also helps.<p>There is definitely a market for a modern taxi company, but it won&#x27;t be as cheap as Uber is in the US. And Uber has too large overhead.')
