That it was more of a case of white neighborhoods being able to defend themselves ... but not a maliciously-chosen routing in the first place.<p>I think your claim here is more false than true.<p>This is a pretty well-known story in American history, as you point out.  Most people who spend time in major American cities know of some very specific examples where one or more Black neighborhoods were torn down or split to put a freeway through.  These choices were made deliberately.<p>For just one review of these deliberate choices, see pages 14 and 15 of:   <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nashville.gov&#x2F;Portals&#x2F;0&#x2F;SiteContent&#x2F;Planning&#x2F;docs&#x2F;trans&#x2F;EveryPlaceCounts&#x2F;1_Highway%20to%20Inequity.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nashville.gov&#x2F;Portals&#x2F;0&#x2F;SiteContent&#x2F;Planning&#x2F;doc...</a><p>From the conclusion:<p>“The highway construction process was essentially used by some planners both as a step towards enhanced national infrastructure and connectivity, as well as a tool to achieve discriminatory objectives along the lines of race and class.”<p>Please note the focus on deliberate intent in the last clause.')
