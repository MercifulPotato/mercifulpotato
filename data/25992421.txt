We help renters save time during the application process and offer operators highly vetted applications with verified financials.<p>The rental process is broken - paperwork, delays, wasted time. We make it easier for everyone by moving the rental process online, standardizing rental applications, and eliminating paperwork by retrieving users&#x27; bank data automatically. Once someone applies to one apartment, they can apply to others with a single click. They can also easily qualify for other financial products (renters&#x27; insurance, credit cards, etc.) using their Savvy application.<p>We&#x27;re looking for an engineer with previous early stage experience who wants to join an ambitious company.<p>Remote OK in USA and Canada.<p>Tech stack: GCP, Postgres, TypeScript, Node.js, React<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;angel.co&#x2F;company&#x2F;savvyscreen&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;886044-senior-software-engineer" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;angel.co&#x2F;company&#x2F;savvyscreen&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;886044-senior-soft...</a><p>Mention HN in your application.')
