Item(by='jinzo', descendants=None, kids=[24677581, 24677541], score=None, time=1601803746, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24677069, text='Almost exactly a year ago I got a brand new Mac Book Pro 13&quot; from my company (everyone else has it, so why not). It&#x27;s unix, so better to use that than Windows (Linux was not really an option). For the price, performance and reliability are laughable. It was already in repair for the peeling keys issue - the warranty process was nothing to gloat about (no Apple Stores around here, just some official repair partners it seems). Not what I expected from an expensive piece of hardware, thank god I did not pay for it.<p>Regarding the general software experience, even after a year of constant use, I can say that for me personally, a half-decent Linux distro has a lot better usability. I still don&#x27;t exactly get how Finder works (when does it show me the list view, when the broken folder view with a unnecessary scrollbar - as there is enough space to show all of the icons), the whole app ecosystem is a shock, where it&#x27;s normal that basic tools (like FTP Client) cost 50EUR or come crippled (Like FileZilla). It&#x27;s a horrible feeling coming from OSS world.<p>One UX example I like to show to people is, that on my Ubuntu based home laptop, after connecting Logitech mouse, I get it&#x27;s battery indicator automatically integrated in the same place with my laptop (and other) batteries. Smooth, no-frills. Something that &quot;the most user friendly system in the world&quot; lacks. And I could go on and on and on... At first I was thinking that it&#x27;s just the change and I will get used to OS X, but looks like this ain&#x27;t happening.<p>I like the touchpad and screen, but I mostly use external screen and mouse anyway.')
