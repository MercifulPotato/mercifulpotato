Instead they chose to rely on businesses that were largely operated by &quot;progressives&quot; whatever it means today. They had an opportunity to create conservative social networks, they didn&#x27;t. This isn&#x27;t a good reason why section 230 should be revoked. Yes, Twitter is biased against conservatives, but that&#x27;s OK, conservatives should go create their own Twitter, that&#x27;s the point of the web anybody can create their own thing, the more competition the better.')
