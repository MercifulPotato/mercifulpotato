Item(by='shakna', descendants=None, kids=[25988306], score=None, time=1612173928, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25986483, text='&quot;substantially&quot; is the keyword that should have been emphasised there, and is actually in my post in the above and the wording that was used.<p>This is because when it comes to copyright law there _is_ such a thing as something being too insubstantial to be considered copyright infringement. &quot;de minimis&quot; falls under fair use.<p>&gt; You seem to be claiming that modified copies and partial copies are not copies for the purpose of copyright law.<p>Lets break it down a little bit more clearly:<p>&gt; Permission to use, copy, modify, and&#x2F;or distribute this work for any purpose is hereby granted, provided this notice appears in all copies.<p>+ You are granted the permission to modify.<p>+ You must provide the notice in all copies.<p>If a work is substantially modified from the original, such that it constitutes a new work, it would no longer be considered a copy of the original, which is why you are now granted copyright on the new work at all:<p>&gt; &quot;Unless sufficient of the pre-existing work is contained in the later work so as to constitute the latter an infringement of the former, the latter by definition is not a derivative work.&quot; 2  Nimmer  on  Copyright  ยง  8.09[A],  p.  8-138  (2004);  see  Litchfield  v.Spielberg<p>If you arrive at this point, where you are no longer a derivative because of the substantial divergence from the original work, it may no longer be considered a copy under copyright law.<p>For a random example from software, the source code for &quot;alpine&quot; the mail client, and &quot;nano&quot; the text editor have an undisputed shared origin, but arguing that they share substantial similarities today would actually be a difficult case to present.<p>The permission to modify has allowed you to create this new work, but you are no longer required to show the notice, because what you have is no longer a copy.<p>Whereas the wording in license such as the 3-Clause BSD license:<p>&gt; 1.
