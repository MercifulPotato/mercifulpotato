It&#x27;d be a ton of work to root out vendor code incompatible with OSS licensing, remove internal dependencies etc. That&#x27;s not worth it unless we have big plans for Windows to stay relevant, which I have no knowledge of but suspect that we don&#x27;t.<p>Probably we&#x27;ll see the most relevant pieces be opened up, like the driver model awhile back.')
