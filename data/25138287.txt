Item(by='rossdavidh', descendants=None, kids=[25138376], score=None, time=1605715248, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25138029, text='So, I am 53 years old, a white guy with two engineering degrees, who&#x27;s been programming for a while now.  I still get imposter syndrome, whenever I am on a new project where we&#x27;re using a new technology.  So don&#x27;t get too hung up on the idea that you&#x27;re going to get rid of it.<p>BUT, now that you know (intellectually) that it&#x27;s a normal mental illusion, it can be disregarded.  This doesn&#x27;t make it stop happening, any more than knowing about the blind spot makes it stop being a blind spot.  But, you know not to listen to it, like you know that something disappearing in your blind spot doesn&#x27;t really mean it&#x27;s not there.<p>In fact, I now use it as a metric of whether or not I&#x27;m learning enough new tech,  or if I&#x27;m staying with what I&#x27;m comfortable in too much (which is a path towards obsolescence when you&#x27;re a programmer).  When I get feelings that I recognize as Imposter Syndrome, I know (intellectually) that it means I&#x27;m working on new knowledge, and that&#x27;s a good thing.  It doesn&#x27;t make the feelings go away; learning more about the new thing will eventually help with that (temporarily).  But intellectually I know I&#x27;ve worked on enough projects to not be an imposter, more or less by definition, and I know that the feelings of &quot;I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m doing maybe I&#x27;m not cut out for this&quot; are normal, and not an accurate guide to whether or not I am able to do this.  They are, of course, an indication that I need to keep working on learning whatever the new thing is.')
