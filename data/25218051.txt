But an exact estimate isn’t a necessary experience. I contend that the ultimate <i>UX</i> is going for a walk and doing something else afc with some confidence that you’ll be ping’ed when it’s time to return. Beyond that, predicting time-to-complete becomes an opportunity to create trust in a brand. I’d much prefer a text message when the install is done than checking my TeamViewer every few minutes while on the go. If a software can provide that, I’d value that more than a data driven estimate that still might be wildly off')
