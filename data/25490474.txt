As ambitious as flutter but without corporate support.   Unfortunately the project is quite under-resourced, can anyone help?<p>For example, stick to the basics and it works well.  But do something off the beaten track like write a background service for Android and hit a bug and you&#x27;re completely on your own, even if you offer to pay a core dev.  I once hit another bug where Unicode couldn&#x27;t be used in .kv files, was a one line fix but there were 70 unread pull requests and more even more issues untouched.  Two or three heros try to help on the mailing list.  I gave up but would like to try one more time with 2.0.')
