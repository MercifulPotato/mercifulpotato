Better to compare Apple&#x27;s price against the cost of top-of-the-line RAM available for other laptops. I checked around and it looks like you can get 8GB 3200MHz DDR4 from a highly respected brand for 56 USD, while Apple will sell you some mystery RAM for 200 USD. It&#x27;s not an (ahem) apples-to-apples comparison because the Apple RAM is closely integrated with the SOC, but I think it&#x27;s fair to say they&#x27;re making a comfortable margin.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;HyperX-HX424S14IB2-2400MHz-Unbuffered-Internal&#x2F;dp&#x2F;B07BGLYTVG" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;HyperX-HX424S14IB2-2400MHz-Unbuffered...</a>')
