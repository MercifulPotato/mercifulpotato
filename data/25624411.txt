Turns out it’s not at all that trivial to detect.<p>From the paper:<p>&gt; Perhaps most importantly, Pan et al. were not able to rule out the scenario of apps transforming audio recordings into less detectable text transcripts or audio fingerprints before sending the information out. This would be a very realistic attack scenario. In fact, various popular apps are known to compress recorded audio in such a way [10, 33]. While all the choices that Pan et al. made regarding their experimental setup and methodology are completely understandable and were communicated transparently, the limitations do limit the significance of their findings. All in all, their approach would only uncover highly unsophisticated eavesdropping attempts. …<p>&gt; Therefore, the fact that no evidence for large-scale mobile eavesdropping has been found so far should not be interpreted as an all-clear. It could only mean that it is difficult – under current circumstances perhaps even impossible – to detect such attacks effectively.<p>(Apparently, noticing relevant content being obviously suggested is the only way of detecting it at this time, and of course it comes with its own caveats.)<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;link.springer.com&#x2F;chapter&#x2F;10.1007&#x2F;978-3-030-22479-0_6#Sec16" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;link.springer.com&#x2F;chapter&#x2F;10.1007&#x2F;978-3-030-22479-0_...</a>')
