I wrote following on Reddit which still holds true:<p><i>After 2 days of testing, I chose this stack:</i><p><i>Tachyons as primary CSS-in-JS and media-queries method in my React components; why: it&#x27;s slick, easy and complete and brings you quite far</i><p><i>configuration is super; eg, creating your own color or default font is just putting them in your App.css and they override Tachyons; creating other breakpoints is possible (just change and recompile, this takes 1sec and a tachyons-cli is there, no need to touch webpack or eject CRA)</i><p><i>however, configuring Tachyons is not required at all, I tested it in and out and it&#x27;s all perfect at the moment, it&#x27;s really turn-key and absolutely the right approach to our problem; Tachyons does just one thing and it does is right</i><p><i>I preferred it very much over others like Tailwind because Tailwind has cumbersome and long CSS naming; Tailwind&#x27;s philosophy and strategy is inconsistent; on the one hand, it wants to be atomic CSS, on the other hand, it bloats and pollutes your components almost like real CSS, wth? either I do minimal atomic CSS (it&#x27;s called &#x27;atomic&#x27;!) like Tachyons or I put real CSS in my component; Tailwind doesn&#x27;t know what it wants to be while Tachyons has a clear strategy which is perfectly executed =&gt; an ultra atomic mapping to CSS, Tailwinds bobs up and down with some short names and then some long ones...; also setting Tailwind up or configuring is unnecessary complex and bloated; doc is comprehensive and complete but also because of its own complications and disunity; atomic css doesn&#x27;t need to be science; compared to Tailwind, Tachyons is a dream</i><p><i>I also checked styled-system but found the DX not close to Tachyons and couldn&#x27;t see any benefit over Tachyons; it&#x27;s too cumbersome but in a different way than Tailwind</i><p><i>Tachyons is just 13kb gzipped while fully featured (Tailwind is 36kb)</i><p><i>while small Tachyons has the biggest ecosystem (related libs, cheatsheets, blog posts), at the end of the day, you don&#x27;t need more, again it&#x27;s just a mapper and more advanced stuff should be done with eg Emotion anyway</i>[1]<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;reactjs&#x2F;comments&#x2F;a6qhbr&#x2F;checked_21_react_ui_kits_briefly_im_done&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;reactjs&#x2F;comments&#x2F;a6qhbr&#x2F;checked_21_...</a>')
