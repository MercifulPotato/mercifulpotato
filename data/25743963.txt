But as a founder, I think this may be a blind spot for you.<p>Most SV tech employees also don&#x27;t have to worry about healthcare costs in any meaningful way. At every company I&#x27;ve worked at in the Bay Area, I&#x27;ve only done more than the standard 40 hours&#x2F;week when I was chasing a big promotion. Or doing something I was especially excited about. And I&#x27;ve done OK in my career so far - I&#x27;m quite satisfied.<p>Whereas the salaries at most startup-y tech companies are laughable in Toronto or Vancouver compared to the housing costs (one Vancouver company seriously quoted me CAD 80k for a frontend role slinging React code 2 years ago).<p>The big companies in the Bay Area pay 3x the average Toronto startup. I promise you they aren&#x27;t working 120 hour weeks, and I&#x27;m sure your employees aren&#x27;t working 13 hour weeks.')
