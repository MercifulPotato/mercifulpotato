That&#x27;d include base salary plus a mandatory employer contribution of 9.5% to a tax advantaged retirement fund (Australia&#x27;s &quot;superannuation&quot; scheme).<p>Excluding retirement fund contribution, equivalent base salary would be around 155k AUD. That&#x27;d be subject to roughly 29% total income tax. There are no additional state level income taxes . So you&#x27;d end up with around 110k AUD cash. A single person who rents &amp; shares a place can cover all baseline living expenses on a quarter of that.')
