It&#x27;s a game engine with a dedicated IDE for building games. The IDE is built mostly with Clojure and JavaFX.<p>Of course I&#x27;m biased, because I helped build the IDE, but I think it looks and feels great. It has a 3d modeling view that does pan, rotate, dolly, all at somewhere between 30 and 60 fps.')
