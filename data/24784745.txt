Hunter Biden&#x27;s receipts from the computer repair shop are public for this too. I think bias might be clouding your judgement.<p>EDIT: Because HN isn&#x27;t even allowing me to reply to the comment by user heartbreak, I will just edit this here:<p>He was NOT impeached for bribing Ukraine into fabricating exactly this sort of story. He was impeached because the democrats didn&#x27;t want Biden&#x27;s crimes exposed. “When exposing a crime is treated as committing a crime you’re being ruled by criminals”  - Edward Snowden<p>The emails came from Hunter Biden’s laptop that he dropped off to get fixed. He never came back to get it therefore it became property of the shop. They spent money fixing it, waited for him to pick it up, he didn’t so by the terms of the agreement the shop owned it. All Hunter had to do is pay $85 and pick up his laptop. The NYT published illegally obtained tax returns of Trump. Why weren’t they censored?')
