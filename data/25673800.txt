I still think it&#x27;s a lot better than Twitter, but it&#x27;s difficult to compare, because the default-public behavior of Twitter content makes it far more toxic; to find the same stuff on FB you either have to be in a private group, or read public comments on a public article. It doesn&#x27;t come to you in the same way it does on Twitter.<p>Most of the horribly content on Facebook is fake accounts, which you can usually identify because their entire profile is around a theme. Facebook tried to make fake accounts impossible for awhile, but apparently they&#x27;ve given up.<p>Twitter doesn&#x27;t try.')
