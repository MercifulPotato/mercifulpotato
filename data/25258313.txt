(on reflection, comparing a quince and a pear to an apple, I suppose that makes sense).<p>&gt; It needs to take well to grafting.<p>Interesting - some don&#x27;t? I&#x27;d not have guessed that, I just unthinkingly assumed they&#x27;d all be about the same. (I knew a guy who told me his dad had grafted a pineapple to an orange tree. He was very young).<p>&gt; It needs to be resistant to pests and diseases,<p>Very good point. Hadn&#x27;t considered it. If it managed in hedgerows there&#x27;s hope though.<p>&gt; thrive well on the kinds of fertilizers readily available to farmers.<p>I just assumed (again) that all fertilisers were much the same, P, N, Ph etc with a few trace elements added so what kinds of fertilisers? or are you distinguishing that from what I&#x27;d call manures-types?<p>&gt; It needs to grow well in orchards.<p>Some don&#x27;t??<p>&gt; It needs to be easy for pickers to pick.<p>Excellent point.<p>&gt; It needs to grow fairly regular shapes and not look too ugly.<p>Sigh. Thank you, supermarkets, for this silliness.')
