Also, there is never a single solution that will fix everything, but if we got behind half a dozen of the best options, we could probably avoid the worst effects, but that would require actually making a global plan and sticking with it through various administrations.<p>The one good thing if civilization does collapse, is that doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean the end of humanity. It just means thousands to hundreds of thousands of years to get back to normal temperature wise. In that time frame I&#x27;m sure we will evolve to handle those tempatures, but of course not without all the tradedgy and loss of life.')
