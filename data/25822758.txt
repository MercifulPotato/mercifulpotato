A stale-bot sweeps most problems under the rug and, as we see in the discussion here, discourages reporting in the first place. The numbers look better, the devs get to feel like things are under control, and they get to rush on to the next shiny thing.<p>And perhaps it works one layer deeper, too. Their website&#x27;s all about &quot;fast, fast, fast&quot;! They advertise the ability to &quot;create a complete website in the time it usually takes to build a prototype&quot;. I would read a claim like that suspiciously: when I build prototypes, I leave out things that are important for sustainability. But the things I think are &quot;finishing the job right&quot; seem to others as tedious and uninteresting things to be skipped if possible. So perhaps the devs have found themselves an audience like themselves that are fine with a high level of brokenness as long as they get the feeling of moving forward quickly?')
