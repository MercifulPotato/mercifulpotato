I am calling it a public sound art project. My goal was to create something playful yet responsive to the often overwhelming feelings of anger, fear, resentment, frustration, and helplessness that many people are experiencing right now. I am an elementary school teacher but have been coding for my own amusement since third grade.<p>I hope you can find a moment of joy in this ridiculous project. Please take a moment to let me know what you think. (And if you find any bugs or areas for improvement, I&#x27;d love to know that as well!)')
