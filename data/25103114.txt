It&#x27;s a toolkit rather than a ready-to-deploy service but has some solid pretrained models and recipes for training your own. You can use various existing projects for deployment, e.g. vosk-server (also for on-device) which comes with models for various languages and accents and has an excellent support channel via telegram. Quite frankly, despite not being &quot;end-to-end&quot;, you&#x27;ll get much much better results in practice.')
