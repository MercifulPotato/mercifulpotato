Signal figured out that you probably have a list of contacts that you want to talk to. If they use mobile numbers as identifiers then they don&#x27;t have to keep the contact list - it&#x27;s already there on your phone. IMHO it&#x27;s a good compromise.<p>I&#x27;m not an advocate for Signal, but I totally get this approach.')
