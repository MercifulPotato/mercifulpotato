Item(by='nrmitchi', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612020029, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25966763, text='I think that the IB CEO really fucked up there by not, and I apologize if this sounds offensive, dumbing his explanation down more and being a bit more clear. As someone who spends a lot of time as an expert in a topic, it is <i>very</i> difficult to have a good calibration about how intracate topics in your domain will be understood by outsiders.<p>&gt; <i>the financial viability of intermediaries and the clearing house</i><p>These are not the &quot;big players&quot; that WSB seems to think they are screweing. IB doesn&#x27;t give a shit about a couple of hedge funds (who most likely are not in the game any more anyways). They likely don&#x27;t care much about any market makers who have found themselves in a bind (I doubt many of these exist though).<p>Intermediaries and clearing houses are the people who&#x27;s job it is to ensure smooth operations in the market and make sure that trades eventually settle. Ie, if I sell you something (lets say, 1 GME) for $400, that doesn&#x27;t happen instantaneously, even though we like to pretend it does. If GME goes to $20, it&#x27;s possible that the person who bought the thing from me just... never shows up with that $400 (maybe their broker went insolvent, who knows, it doesn&#x27;t really matter). But it&#x27;s still owed to me, and now someone in the middle is on the hook. And really, this is a correlated risk. <i>If</i> it happens with 1 share of GME, it&#x27;s much more likely to happen for millions of GME. So now your clearing house is out hundreds of millions -&gt; billions of dollars[0], and are left holding a couple M in GME stock that they can&#x27;t sell.<p>There is a difference between trying to protect <i>a specific player or group of players in the game</i>, and making an attempt to <i>protect the infrastructure that makes the game possible</i>.<p>[0] And if the clearing house can&#x27;t handle this, then it falls to your broker, who <i>also</i> probably can&#x27;t handle it[1]. So then <i>if you don&#x27;t get the money for what you sold</i>, any sort of faith in the financial system evaporates. Which triggers a bank run. Which triggers a financial crisis way beyond anything seen in 2008 because all of the infrastructure was totally destroyed and now we have to start from scratch.<p>[1] This is especially true in the case of Robinhood, who <i>I am certain (without evidence)</i> has an extremely disproprotional and correlated exposure to specific high risk tickers (GME, AMC, BB, NAKD, etc)')
