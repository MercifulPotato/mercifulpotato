Item(by='ogogmad', descendants=None, kids=[25753315, 25752853, 25752585], score=None, time=1610481221, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25752397, text='&gt; I have been led to believe that the Phoenician writing system was a syllabary, and that the Greeks made an alphabet out of it.<p>My understanding is that it was an abjad, not a syllabary. An abjad has only consonants, not vowels. When a word is written, only its consonants get written, and the vowels are only implied. Hebrew and Arabic are abjads.<p>The Phoenician alphabet was preceded by the Ugaritic &quot;alphabet&quot;, which was also an abjad.<p>A syllabary usually has many more symbols than an abjad or alphabet. If n denotes the number of phonemes in a language, then a syllabary has O(n^2) or O(n^3) symbols. In contrast, the Phoenician abjad has fewer symbols than even the English alphabet.')
