Sure, if you compare yields of stocks against bonds, they look relatively more attractive, but that&#x27;s a strictly relative comparison. Even if bonds yield 0%, if you buy a stock that goes down 50%, as many did in the dotcom bubble, you&#x27;ve done much worse.<p>Can stocks continue their historical run up? Sure. But we&#x27;re pretty clearly one catalyst away from a major correction. Will that catalyst arise in the next year? Impossible to say, but it will come eventually.<p>In an effort to save the economy, the Federal Reserve and Government have created a much bigger long-term problem. They&#x27;ve shown a willingness to prop up the stock market and removed all downside risk. Wealth inequality is ballooning to an all-time high due to large inflation of asset prices.  Homes are less affordable than ever due to extraordinarily low interest rates.<p>And when the Fed attempted to raise rates (2018 dip) and stocks dipped a few percent, they backed off totally. Years of asset price growth is happening in a few months, which is basically a wealth transfer from the investors of tomorrow to the asset holders of today.<p>While government intervention has helped the real economy in the short-run, we&#x27;re setting ourselves up for much bigger problems down the line.')
