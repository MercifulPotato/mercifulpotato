I got sick of accidentally pressing it.<p>Removal was super easy to do and reversible. When I opened the remote (like to replace the battery) it was simple to pop out the circuit board, remove the plastic button, and set it aside.<p>I can still stick my finger into the void and press on the membrane switch directly to activate it if I <i>really</i> need to, but it prevents me accidentally triggering it because something was pressing into my pocket.')
