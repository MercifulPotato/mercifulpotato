You&#x27;ve been able to do this for a long time.<p>That being said, it is not simple to say, take a binary Rust Cargo project and say &quot;please dynamically link all the crates it uses&quot; or something like that. But if you want a dynamic library to be used by something else? First-class support for that use case exists.')
