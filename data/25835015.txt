By far I am not an expect, but the Hall-effect is has something specifically to due with the movement of electrons creating a current in the thruster, which I believe causes the ionization. Others ionize the propellant by bombarding it with electrons to create the ionization.<p>And as another commenter pointed out, this is not the first ion thruster on a cubesat.')
