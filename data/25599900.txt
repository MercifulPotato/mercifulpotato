It is arrogance to assume that we are somehow the frontier and limitation of what intelligence is.<p>It is far likely that we are the fish in the koi pond. Absolute in our belief that there is no up or down, only forward, backwards and sideways.<p>So many weird things that we see in our dimension that doesn&#x27;t make sense. Imagine if you picked up a fish and dropped it behind another fish. It is pure magic, teleporation, act of god to the occupants of the koi pond. It would never understand what is outside the pond and why.<p>Simlarily, it is the common belief that we humans are also those fish in the koi ponds, desperate to explain away and make sense of the unknowable.')
