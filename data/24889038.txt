I solved it in two <i>different</i> ways:<p>- An unofficial Teams app (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;IsmaelMartinez&#x2F;teams-for-linux" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;IsmaelMartinez&#x2F;teams-for-linux</a>) which works great - screen sharing works without problems, no crashing, <i>and native notifications!</i>.<p>- Use teams in qutebrowser: the dev (The-Compiler) added support for screensharing and it works great. Just like the unofficial app above, it also has <i>native</i> notifications, not the weird popup notifications of the official app.')
