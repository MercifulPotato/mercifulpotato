To a business person, the things they do are more important than data structures. If you try to talk to a subject matter expert, they&#x27;re going to talk about how their portion of a business works, not list all of the data within their system. The only caveat is if you&#x27;re talking to a person that&#x27;s focused on reporting and analytics...then they will be more data focused. But businesses react to analytics, they don&#x27;t run on it. Operationally, there are a set of events that happen logically from start to finish. You could do all of the data governance you want and if you miss those events and their sequence and impact, you wouldn&#x27;t know what business you&#x27;re in.<p>Data accuracy is critical. Data storage is critical. Analytics and warehousing are critical. But none of these things reflect the nature of a business, which are the behaviors of its domain and sub-domains.')
