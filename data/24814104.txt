And I&#x27;ve had shingles in my 20s as well, so I&#x27;m certainly pro-vaccine.<p>There may have been a vaccine 35 years ago (I&#x27;ll take your word for it), but it was not the standard of care even ~25 years ago.<p>(And to be clear, I&#x27;m not advocating for exposing people to COVID, at all.  You asked a very broad question upthread with an easy counter-example — chickenpox — and I provided the counterexample.)')
