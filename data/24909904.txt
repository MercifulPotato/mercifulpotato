Eg. calling people &quot;bitches&quot; much to laughter in the workplace isn&#x27;t acceptable. If it ever got out to the media, a glassdoor review, etc. that the company did nothing to a whole department laughing and calling people &quot;bitches&quot; the company would be in major, expensive shit.<p>Trying to take it further (&quot;report days&quot;?) seems like a slippery slope fallacy to me.')
