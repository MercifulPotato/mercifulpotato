There&#x27;s a list of servers that are not federated into many servers [1] because of hateful or plain illegal content.<p>I think Matrix is more akin to email than it is to Twitter and Facebook like Mastodon is, though. If you wish to contact someone on another server then that&#x27;s an active decision by you. If someone wants to force themselves into your server, the most they can do is spam chat invites. There&#x27;s no illegal content or filtering policy on the server that can prevent that from happening in most cases. The fact that Matrix is e2ee helps; server moderators cannot see what you&#x27;re discussing, let alone censor you.<p>The core problem is that one of the ways we as a species prevent bad behaviour from spreading is ostracising groups of people who exhibit such behaviour. I strongly believe that any chat client that is used by humans will eventually exhibit similar behaviour, splitting and ostracising groups that exhibit behaviour other groups of people object to.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Gargron&#x2F;mastodon.social-misc" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Gargron&#x2F;mastodon.social-misc</a>')
