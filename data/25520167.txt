Less so the past year that we&#x27;ve been in the same house at all times, but I generally chat with my SO all day long about everything on my messaging app. It&#x27;s _not_ okay to have years of that history stored on a Russian app server based in Dubai. A security audit doesn&#x27;t matter. I&#x27;ll take for granted that the chats get to the server securely before being stored in plain text forever. Even if I could trust the current company to be 100% altruistic, I can&#x27;t trust that data to be safe with them forever. Through state-sponsored attacks, company sales, new CEOs, new boards, etc.')
