Is it not the case that people learn better when they are adequately stimulated and engaged? Even if not, how far should we go in making kids miserable to force them to learn more? Do we need to make them miserable or is there an alternative? This is what I mean by <i>asking</i> why, and it&#x27;s not clear to me what all the answers are (it&#x27;s a very complex question).')
