A few connections per minute hardly classify as abuse in any reasonable sense of the word.<p>The owner of the source network, on the other hand, (compared to the destination server), I think have a more legitimate reason to raise flags. Most cloud providers for example do not allow port scanning from their network (for various reasons). If you&#x27;re gonna send out millions of packages all over the place I think it&#x27;s good practice to inform your network provider first.')
