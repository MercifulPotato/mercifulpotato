Just from one example: you can tell when a specific issue requires attention based on how many comments the thread has.<p>So let&#x27;s say I wake up in the AM and there&#x27;s a thread that says &quot;how do I use the API for companyservice.example-api.com&quot; and the thread has 50 comments.<p>Let&#x27;s say it&#x27;s a service I support. First, I know there&#x27;s an issue because a customer required attention to begin with. This is then confirmed by the fact that the thread has 50 comments in it so there are probably documentation and usability issues with this service.<p>The company I work for and the services I am responsible for deals with internal customers and we use these two absurdly simple metrics to optimize support regularly.<p>When we first started with certain services that my team is responsible for, we used Slack metrics A LOT. As in, we had spreadsheets with this data and we&#x27;d go over them every week. Nowadays, our services are almost 100% self-service and we rarely, if ever, get pinged on Slack for those services because the documentation is optimized and the usability has been specifically designed so that our engineers don&#x27;t get in the way of our customer&#x27;s needs.')
