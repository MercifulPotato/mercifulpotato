The &quot;rent discount&quot; is what you&#x27;d put in the stock market for the purposes of these comparisons.<p>This varies by location, no doubt.  My mortgage was the same monthly cost of my rent, when I bought my first house.  After the tax benefits, it was less expensive, though a wash once you factored in maintenance.  And it was a fixed payment, whereas the rent was increasing every year.')
