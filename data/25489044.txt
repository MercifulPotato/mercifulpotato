Today&#x27;s deep learning is essentially brute force, burning thousands of watts for anything more complicated which a single human brain can often do in ~15Watts.<p>The advanced models like GPT-3 are burning millions of watts in the cloud but they&#x27;re not that much better than what a brain can do (and in many ways worse, as in often requiring supervised learning)<p>That&#x27;s the key point. The algorithms need to become more energy efficient to make significant leaps, thus become more like brains.')
