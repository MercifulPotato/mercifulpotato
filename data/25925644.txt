(Legal reasons and &quot;not-invented-here&quot; syndrome notwithstanding.) This is a <i>huge</i> different from how the &quot;real&quot; world works, where almost all of the work involved in building, say, a car, is actually just the work of assembling identical copies of that product so that it can be physically sold to more than one person.<p>The insane amounts of repeated effort involved in building any physical product at scale have a silver lining, in that the repetition enables a very good and stable estimate of how long another repetition will take. Software is the opposite situation --- we only need to build anything once, but not having built that thing before, we don&#x27;t really know how long it will take.')
