Three of them are completely OK (water, hydrogen sulfide and dinitrogen), because they must have been abundant before the origin of life. Ammonia is also OK, even if should have been less abundant. However, methane and especially hydrogen cyanide should have been several orders of magnitude less abundant than the others, so it is much less likely that they played any significant role. On the other hand they ignored 2 other precursors that were certainly very abundant in early  volcanic&#x2F;vent gases and which likely provided the main source of energy for driving the organic syntheses: dihydrogen and carbon monoxide.')
