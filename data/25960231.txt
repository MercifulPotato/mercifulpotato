Item(by='munificent', descendants=None, kids=[25961656], score=None, time=1611943099, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25957137, text='Yes, I think Factorio&#x27;s engine is more complex and difficult to implement well than a typical AAA game with rich graphics and &quot;realistic&quot; physics.<p>In Factorio, you have a very large number of active objects with very dense, complex, time-critical and deterministic interactions. In most other games, you have relatively few active entities. The game gives you the <i>illusion</i> of a rich living world, but a lot of the graphical bits floating around can&#x27;t actually be interacted with. The physics system is a complex bit of math but is fairly isolated from the rest of the engine and has relatively few entities to process. If it gets things &quot;wrong&quot; in minor ways, the player is unlikely to tell.<p>Also, many AAA game physics and graphics engines work the same enough that engines can even be reused. There&#x27;s a relatively small amount of bespoke system design. It&#x27;s just following the same well-tread paths. Factorio&#x27;s gameplay has enough novelty that the engine has to solve challenging somewhat unique problems.<p><i>Source: Senior software engineer at EA for eight years and wrote a best-selling book on software architecture for games.</i>')
