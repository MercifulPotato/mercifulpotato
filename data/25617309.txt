I can&#x27;t help but think that it will be hard to keep a plane flying at mach 1 hidden in the face of fast scanning and networked phased array radars with modern deep learning based detection algorithms.<p>My understanding is that if you take away the stealth aspect the F-35 is a sluggish fighter bomber that would be outperformed by most 4th gens.  Considering an F-35 is nearly the price of 10 4th gen fighters the choice to &quot;upgrade&quot; becomes pretty suspect for a lot of Nato partners.')
