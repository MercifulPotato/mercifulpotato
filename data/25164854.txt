Item(by='toast0', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605905904, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25163671, text='&gt;&gt;  we suggest a pharmaceutical-specific reform that begins the effective market exclusivity period for new drugs at the time of approval for sale in the United States, rather than at the time of patent filing.<p>While this idea has common sense appeal, it would seem to be a way to return to submarine patents. If the patent was filed for a specific drug which is pending approval for many years (or many decades), use of that technique by others would be infringing and subject to licensing, should the patent ever issue.<p>Having a expiration from filing date, combined with a filing deadline of one year from invention is simpler and sets a fixed bound on exclusivity.')
