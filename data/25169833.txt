Each installed application package is mounted and connected to the core image. This way the system is refreshed to the defined state on each boot.<p>I wanted to set up a minimalistic pocket environment on a USB flash stick, but eventually stumbled on the need to re-package some of additional applications.<p>For example, I needed to add Maxima, yet it was not in their prepackaged repo. Trying to recompile it manually threw some dependency-related errors, well, familiar story...<p>But the idea is still great, it works well on older boxes. Will probably revisit it at some point.')
