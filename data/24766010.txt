Things like no state income tax and lower sales tax are major attractions, add to that the dirt cheap prices of property in comparison to CA. There are other things that are cheaper that just make day-to-day life easier. Fuel prices are much cheaper in TX. Auto registration fees are cheaper. In TX, my Corolla was &lt;$75 per year while in CA it was &gt;$400. When I registered my car in CA, I was required to pay taxes on something purchased in another state. (Why CA limits this tax&#x2F;ransom to cars is a real question. Why not any large ticket purchases like computers,washer&#x2F;dryer,fridges,etc.)<p>TL;DR - It&#x27;s pretty widespread. TX population is rapidly increasing')
