The table radio in it works on 110V, 12V or batteries inside the device.<p>I have (dangerous) gas lighting in that unit as well as electric.<p>Power isn&#x27;t a given and the devices from the era are designed to operate under that state of things.<p>This all seems very early.  We lack foresight because people are pioneering.  Users of this tech are also pioneering.  Someone is gonna do it.  Let&#x27;s hope they do it increasingly well and sooner.<p>One day, this will all be real infrastructure, with all the girls along with:  regulation standards the usual.<p>Until then it&#x27;s kind of a wild west.<p>Play hard, but play eyes wide open too.  Or pass and watch as it all forms to be more robust just like people did with electricity.')
