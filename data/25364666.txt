The monetisation of your data in exchange for adverts can be seen as the cost of the platforms. By aggressively increasing advertising on Instagram and attempting to take steps to monetize WhatsApp, Facebook are raising prices. As far as I understand the question is whether it is their abuse of monopoly power that allows them to do this.<p>For a time people had few alternatives to Instagram or Facebook, which were effectively in competition with each other. This meant that has Facebook monetised  your data more, ie increase prices, users were forced to pay if they wanted to stay on a popular social network.<p>TikTok is a recent phenomenon. Secondly it is not enough to consider the UX cost of switching to another platform but also the network effect. Is Mewe&#x2F;Parker&#x2F;Gab really a substitute for me if I don’t enjoy the network effects I have on Facebook or Instagram?')
