This may be a coincidence of course, but I suspect you only stop hating meetings when you understand the benefits of collaboration and develop a willingness to accept other people&#x27;s input on whatever you&#x27;re working on as a constructive and positive thing instead of a negative force designed to hold your brilliance back.<p>As a first step I would recommend to anyone who hates meetings should ask themselves why they hate them, and if it&#x27;s really <i>the meeting</i> that&#x27;s the problem.<p>That&#x27;s not to say there&#x27;s no such thing as a bad meeting. Never have a meeting that doesn&#x27;t have an agenda and a goal. If you&#x27;re leading, keep it focused and on track. Leaving a meeting without a resolution shouldn&#x27;t happen.')
