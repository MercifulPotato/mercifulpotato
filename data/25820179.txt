Gas is cheaper than electricity in Poland, but then again, electricity also isn&#x27;t <i>that</i> expensive for preboiling in a kettle to make a big difference.<p>On a related note, I was surprised when I did calculations on how much it actually costs us to bake our own bread. We started doing that a lot during this pandemic. It turns out, the cost of ingredients + electricity adds to slightly less than what it would cost to buy the same products from a bakery. This doesn&#x27;t price in time spent on preparing and baking, but it&#x27;s not like we could actually use that time to make money, we&#x27;re having fun, and going to a store also takes time (and&#x2F;or fuel). Electricity is <i>cheap</i>.')
