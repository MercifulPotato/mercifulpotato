There are three basic levels of engineering management.<p>Team level - Supporting individual engineers working collectively to solve a relatively narrow set of business and technical problems. Lots of short term focus.<p>Org level - Supporting multiple teams of engineers solve bigger, hairier problems and learn to both identify and solve their own problems. More long term focus.<p>Exec level - Represent the needs and capabilities of the every engineer at the company, and be a strong advocate for them. Support the needs of the larger business and strategy. Super long term focus.<p>Depending on the company, there are some half steps in between each level, and you may have responsibilities that span multiple levels.<p>The most important thing to evaluate (and constantly re-evaluate) is at what level you are currently working at and what level you need to be working at for the good of the company. Hire accordingly.<p>If you find yourself working at all three levels, it won’t be sustainable and the payoff simply won’t be worth it in the end.')
