That&#x27;s a big one. You can&#x27;t be sloppy and hang a connection open with transactions running. This is bad for slow languages where every transaction takes 10+ms.<p>And it&#x27;s bad if your language doesn&#x27;t support connection pools&#x2F;threading.<p>In practice that means you can get full performance with fast threaded languages like Java, C#, Go, Rust that can use connection pooling. But performance will suffer if language is slow or doesn&#x27;t have good enough threading to do connection pooling.<p>So yeah, it&#x27;s a bad-ish design that works fine if you&#x27;re using a fast threaded language. If you&#x27;re trying to squeeze max performance out of Ruby or something you&#x27;re going to be disappointed in other ways anyway')
