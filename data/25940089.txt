You cannot use credit or debit cards or even cash. No. You have to sign up with a charging network that sends you a charging card for something between 5 and 25 EUR&#x2F;month. With that card you then have the privilege to get juice for somewhere between 30 (normal household price in .de) and 300 ct&#x2F;kWh. But not everywhere, just on the charging outlets in the network. Your chance to have the right card is about 1 in 5 or so. Oh, and billing is unreliable, sometimes&#x2F;often the card doesn&#x27;t work because the charger has connectivity problems. And there are even chargers where there is no proper energy meter involved, so they just bill by the minute...<p>It&#x27;s either Tesla or charging at home, the rest is nonviable in Germany.')
