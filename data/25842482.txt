Understanding the past so we know how we got to today. Does anyone &quot;need&quot; to read anything? No. Would you be enriched by it? Maybe. I persinally think its an interesting reading list.<p>More generally, this seems like an undergrad course. Isn&#x27;t the point of an undergrad degree to give broad foundational instruction that can be further built on? What better way then to see how we got to the present.<p>&gt; Does a roboticist need to understand lambda calculus?<p>Reading a single paper and understanding something is very different. Understanding it, is a bit much. Knowing the very vaugest of an  introduction to the subject by reading a single very foundational paper, they might benefit from that. At the very least, they should know how to read and understand a paper in an adjacent field to their own (this is an undergrad class after all)')
