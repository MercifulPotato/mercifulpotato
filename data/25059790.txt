Typically with a normal MIDI controller, you have values like key, volume etc on an event level, and then channel wide values like pitch bend.<p>With MPE, you can think of it as each note having its own channel, with added dimensions like pitch bend, vibrato, timbre and more all encoded into a note.<p>This allows you to interface with new kinds of controllers like the Roli Seaboard for example, which are much more expressive than your standard midi keyboard.<p>In terms of Live, MPE wasn&#x27;t supported until now and connecting an MPE controller to the DAW was a massive headache and super hacky.')
