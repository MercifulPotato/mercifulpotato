Maybe you&#x27;re just thinking of the file sharing aspect of Keybase?<p>Keybase as it&#x27;s core was that it&#x27;s a key directory that&#x27;s publicly auditable. Everyone could verify the chain of verification of each other in Keybase. On top of that infrastructure, files and chat was added.<p>Peergos doesn&#x27;t seem to show any chains or in fact auditable information at all. You can add&#x2F;remove friends that is supposedly cryptographically verified, but there is no information about it, nor is there any information about where the data is actually stored, how you can get it to your local machine, how to re-verify the claims, how to add devices that have access.')
