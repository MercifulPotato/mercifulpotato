I&#x27;m sorry if you&#x27;ve had any sort of negative interaction with Signal in the past. I would personally never dismiss anyone&#x27;s feedback on the grounds that this is a free app (the linked post was written by a very kind community member, not a Signal employee, but I also don&#x27;t believe they were being dismissive either). Given that Signal has no metrics, feedback provided online is one of the only tools we have to know if we&#x27;re working on the right things.<p>That being said, we <i>do</i> have a lot of feedback to comb through every day, so if you don&#x27;t get response (or get a short one), the intention is not malicious -- it&#x27;s sometimes just a result of having too much to read and too little time. But we truly do read nearly everything (particularly on Github), even if we don&#x27;t have a comment on everything. I hope you continue to provide feedback!')
