But it also means that you can type-pun stuff if you want; it just costs time.<p>FWIW, the best handling I know of JSON in Tcl is the rl_json package (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;RubyLane&#x2F;rl_json" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;RubyLane&#x2F;rl_json</a>) which essentially makes JSON into what works like a native Tcl value type.')
