It sounds like you&#x27;re just very used to thinking in USD.  People all over the world do hedges to control for exactly this risk.<p>If you want to tether wages to USD, you can use USDC instead of BTC.  Also you can pay those wages with such low transaction costs that you could pay by the day instead of by the week or month, using current technology.<p>Pretty soon the transaction costs will be low enough that you can pay those wages continuously.  Eliminating the idea of a &quot;pay day&quot; is a great social good IMO.<p>On the other side, the receiving party can spend their funds in &quot;USD&quot; with a crypto-backed credit card that draws against their USDC balance.')
