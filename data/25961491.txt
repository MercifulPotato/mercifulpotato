With your system, it&#x27;ll get a bigger number - probably 14 or 15 million 4KiB IO per second per core.<p>But while SPDK does have an fio plug-in, unfortunately you won&#x27;t see numbers like that with fio. There&#x27;s way too much overhead in the tool itself. We can&#x27;t get beyond 3 to 4 million with that. We rolled our own benchmarking tool in SPDK so we can actually measure the software we produce.<p>Since the core is CPU bound, 512B IO are going to net the same IO per second as 4k. The software overhead in SPDK is fixed per IO, regardless of size. You can also run more threads with SPDK than just one - it has no locks or cross thread communication so it scales linearly with additional threads. You can push systems to 80-100M IO per second if you have disks and bandwidth that can handle it.')
