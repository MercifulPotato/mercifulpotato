This is not about stuff that may or may not happen in the future.<p>Instead, you can look at real world situations, that happen right now, in existing countries all around the world, and you will see that the efforts to control the internet, have mostly failed.<p>Ex: Just look at china, which is the most famous example of internet control. .  Lots of people have VPNs and can get around these restrictions in china.<p>The evidence already proves you wrong.  There are multiple countries who have attempted to enact strict controls, over the internet, already, and they have mostly failed.')
