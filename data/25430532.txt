The other people can be unelected, unaccountable leaders, or leaders that are chosen by voters, and politics seems to be where cognitive biases are worst.<p>In general, I would rather suffer for my own cognitive biases than the biases of elected officials and voters, but that&#x27;s not to say I advocate for free markets in every scenario, because there is a lot more to consider than individual choice in that discussion.')
