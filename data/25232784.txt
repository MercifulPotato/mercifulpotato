So while this term became more prominent in the Trump-era, I don&#x27;t know if I would associate it with Trump directly (although you can argue that he contributed to the #metoo movement with his &quot;pussy grabbing&quot; and other comments.)<p>The related term I&#x27;m hearing more and more of recently is &quot;censorship&quot;. There are many prominent people on social media complaining about censorship, and almost all are related to how companies like Facebook, YouTube and Twitter are dealing with contrarian views on COVID-19, e.g. lockdowns, masks, vaccinations, etc. Personally, I don&#x27;t believe these companies are acting maliciously to needlessly censor contrarian views, I just think that everyone is trying to figure this stuff out in real-time, and we don&#x27;t really know what the right thing is.')
