It unloads a lot of mental tasks, and quickly feels essential.<p>With the cell phone, I didn’t have to remember peoples phone numbers anymore, and I could call or be called from anywhere. Eventually texting became a thing, but at first it was just that freedom to make much looser plans and adjust them on the fly, which was really difficult before cell phones.<p>With the watch, it feels the same, but about health. Knowing how much I walked around each day, how well I slept, what my heart rate was, etc. makes it a lot easier to understand what’s going on with my body and be more proactive about it.<p>It’s also becoming a replacement for the cell phone. I usually still keep my phone with me because I want the camera, but I increasingly don’t take my phone with me when I want peace and quiet. I know that if a family member urgently needed to reach me they could get through to my watch. Meanwhile the watch does not distract me from what’s going on in real life around me.<p>I suspect that if they do pull off the glasses, this is going to be the trifecta. Eventually the glasses can capture a visual record of whatever you saw, the AirPods potentially can capture whatever you heard, and the watch is capturing what’s going on with your body. It’s sort of a kindler, gentler Cybernetic future than I think earlier eras anticipated.')
