When docker started, everybody ran as root (and had to), but now you specify the user and group.<p>3) exactly how docker works differently on linux vs. mac os x, since mac is not native linux.<p>Basically if you can explain the above 3 things, you&#x27;re a docker user expert.<p>The 2 things to know when using docker in production are:<p>1) what to do with logs, which can fill the container fs<p>2) how to do security updates, preferably without downtime. Most companies are running with fossilized containers.<p>Basically if you can explain the above 2 things, you&#x27;re a docker devops expert.<p>Also, I&#x27;ve struggled with trying to do a minimal docker image with alpine, etc. but then had to blow up to a full centos or ubuntu image to get everything working later. So at larger companies I recommend having a bastard on staff who is available on-call to optimize containers.')
