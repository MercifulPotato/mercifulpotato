If so, where does this idea come from?<p>&gt; It is absolutely worth considering such things, which is why we (at least were I live) have laws against such things, and also why I am in favour of those laws.<p>To pursue something legally requires a formal legal process, evidence, lawyers, etc., and has strict penal consequences. Would you consider there is a need for a more informal process where the consequences is being kicked out of an event?<p>&gt; I&#x27;m absolutely fine with women feeling safe.<p>But you aren&#x27;t fine with an organization creating rules to help women feel safe. Why is it an abuse of power, acting as &quot;judge, jury and executioner,&quot; to remove someone from an event or organization who causes women to feel uncomfortable?')
