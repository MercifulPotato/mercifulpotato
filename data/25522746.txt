I got it working JUST like Vim but the biggest thing missing was a decent Git experience. I found a plugin that was a lot like Magit (the thing I liked most about Emacs). I used that until Atom got a good Git experience. Later I tried the same thing with VSCode. It&#x27;s Vim-ish experience is just not as good. I&#x27;d love to go back and try it with this though. VSC&#x27;s default Git experience leaves a LOT to be desired.')
