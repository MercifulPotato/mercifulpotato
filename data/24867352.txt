I&#x27;ve got tons of old images in it, from that era, I open it a couple of times a year to find stuff. I&#x27;ve moved on, I don&#x27;t do DSLR&#x2F;RAW images anymore.<p>This version doesn&#x27;t run on Catalina, and the only upgrade that would keep the develop settings is O(10)&#x2F;mo.   So I&#x27;m looking for something that can do the cataloging, and something that can do the processing should I ever do that again.<p>I have 0 hope that anything will take the develop settings in lightroom and use&#x2F;improve them, but that would be perfect. (I&#x27;ve got one image in particular that&#x27;s just at the edge of acceptable quality on LR3 that got dramatically better on LR5)')
