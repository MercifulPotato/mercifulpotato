Imagine if you needed a bank account to give someone $100 cash. Or to spend a few bucks at a street hotdog vendor.<p>Most people take it for granted that they need a bank to do anything, and they don&#x27;t really consider how powerless they are over their own money. Like how it&#x27;s illegal to carry too much cash (and it can simply be taken away). And how your bank can impose arbitrary restrictions against you like rejecting transactions and freezing your account. I&#x27;ve lost various bank accounts over the years as a permanent traveler. I&#x27;m banned from Paypal.<p>I want to be able to send $100 cash digitally with the operational minimalism of giving someone $100 cash in person. I want some control over my money even when I want to exchange it digitally.')
