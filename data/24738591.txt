You&#x27;d have to check whether the module was loaded already (with synchronization if your program is multithreaded). For single threaded programs, you could avoid this by hot-patching your machine code, but there&#x27;s no way around some synchronization barrier in multithreaded programs. In JavaScript (or any language where you want to avoid sending a large bundle over the network), you&#x27;d incur the latency of a network request for the first call to any function.<p>You&#x27;re right that people are already splitting apps into bundles, but that is usually done at the page level.')
