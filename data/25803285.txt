A lot of the work has more to do with efficiently storing, moving, and visualizing large datasets. Bonus here is that much of this knowledge is transferable to other (much higher paying) domains if you get burned out or want to sell out.<p>My current job could be described as bio-aware web development, with an emphasis in data visualization. I need to know a decent amount of biology, but I can almost always defer stats to others in the lab with more expertise.')
