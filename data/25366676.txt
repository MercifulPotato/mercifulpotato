It&#x27;s more expensive for the consumer with restaurants often raising prices and delivery fees etc; the restaurants make less money per order; and the delivery drivers are often making less than minimum wage and rapidly depreciating their cars. And on top of that, these companies themselves are mostly unprofitable!<p>So who is benefiting here? Where is the true value for society being created? Yes I can get any restaurant meal delivered to my home in 30-45 min, but is that one small benefit really enough to sustain a $60bn market cap?')
