In fact I haven&#x27;t heard the argument that it isn&#x27;t, if there is one at all. I&#x27;ve also seen nothing to suggest that the below is some kind of bold fabrication. If you&#x27;re not worried by it, you probably should be. Whenever you hear &quot;They can&#x27;t be trusted to analyse and come to the correct conclusion.&quot; Means _you_ can&#x27;t and won&#x27;t get the chance. Make up your own mind is difficult advice to follow when you&#x27;re not allowed the information on which to do so.<p>&gt;Even my blog has never been so systematically subject to shadowbanning from Twitter and Facebook as now. Normally about 50% of my blog readers arrive from Twitter and 40% from Facebook. During the trial it has been 3% from Twitter and 9% from Facebook. That is a fall from 90% to 12%. In the February hearings Facebook and Twitter were between them sending me over 200,000 readers a day. Now they are between them sending me 3,000 readers a day. To be plain that is very much less than my normal daily traffic from them just in ordinary times.

My own family have not been getting their notifications of my posts on either platform.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.craigmurray.org.uk&#x2F;archives&#x2F;2020&#x2F;09&#x2F;your-man-in-the-public-gallery-assange-hearing-day-16&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.craigmurray.org.uk&#x2F;archives&#x2F;2020&#x2F;09&#x2F;your-man-in-...</a>')
