Item(by='72deluxe', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611225499, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25857452, text='&#x27; Those who went in with &quot;I&#x27;ve heard there&#x27;s some good money there&quot; are getting disappointed&#x27;<p>This is true, but I think it&#x27;s also more of the &quot;I hear you can make SOME money there&quot; or &quot;I hear you can live on the money you make there&quot; which is the point. You can&#x27;t.<p>I am a musician and all of the guys I played with over 30+ years had main jobs alongside their gigging. There would be no way to afford it otherwise, and that was when CDs were being sold. The streaming issue has only made this worse, which is the point in question (is it a valid payout?), not whether every single artist can be a millionnaire.<p>It is also interesting about &quot;selling their soul&quot; because a lot of fans believe &quot;their&quot; band hasn&#x27;t sold out and is doing it solely for the love of music - they never are. They might enjoy what they&#x27;re doing (&quot;do something you love and you&#x27;ll never work a day in your life&quot;) but they would cease touring and recording if they were making Â£0.00. Even all the &quot;alternative&quot; bands were signed to labels and relied on distribution; they just promoted an image of not &quot;playing the game&quot; like everyone else, and being &quot;alternative&quot; even though they never were. It&#x27;s an odd mindset people get when looking at bands and somehow believing that the musicians somehow lived without money and did their art solely for the love of the art.')
