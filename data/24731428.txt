A lot of people will work 36 hours. But since &#x27;half days&#x27; means you have to commute anyway people usually just take every other Friday off. The only exception to this is Wednesday, when some people work half days because Dutch primary schools are often half-day as well on Wednesday.<p>But I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s the law, just what people prefer.<p>I know very few people who reduce theirs hours <i>per day</i> but still choose to commute 5 days a week.<p>But I guess that might very well change now that a lot of people don&#x27;t have a commute anymore.')
