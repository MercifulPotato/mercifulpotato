A friend of mine has Leukemia and takes Gleevec.  Thankfully he has a good job because it costs something like $14,000&#x2F;month.  Yep, you read that right, $14,000.  Yes it&#x27;s covered by insurance.  But that&#x27;s not some magical money tree paying for it, we&#x27;re collectively paying for it. My son&#x27;s a type 1 diabetic and we hit our out of pocket max of about $9,200 every single year to pay for his insulin pump &amp; glucose monitor supplies. An older family member of mine had cancer surgery - in the hospital for 5 days total and came out with a $150k bill.<p>America&#x27;s great as long as you&#x27;re not sick.<p>I lean left and right on many different issues, but holy shit America&#x27;s healthcare system is ass-backwards compared to the rest of the world, which has figured out how to keep people alive if some unfortunate event happens without making them worry about deciding to pay for groceries or pay for medicine&#x2F;healthcare. Anyone that thinks otherwise is brainwashed. Yes there are horror stories in other countries, but they don&#x27;t include bankrupting people who were grossly overcharged for their care, or people rationing their medication because they can&#x27;t pay for it.  Fuck the current US healthcare system.<p>A single-payer system makes sense and it works everywhere else on the planet.  The American people&#x27;s refusal to get it reminds me of the not-invented-here syndrome we see in tech everyday.')
