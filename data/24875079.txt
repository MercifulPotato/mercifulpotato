This isn&#x27;t a biased prediction, it&#x27;s based on national polling which has proven itself to be accurate to within a couple points. This makes sense, given the law of large numbers.<p>Biden is currently up +10, though this will drop before election day. Hillary ended up winning with 48.2% vs 46.1% - +2.1 points equaling 2.8 million votes more than Trump. Biden will most likely double that number, and yet still easily lose the election.<p>The system we have is amazingly broken.')
