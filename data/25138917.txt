Item(by='hedgedoops2', descendants=None, kids=[25139100], score=None, time=1605717767, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25138029, text='There are much better comments here (especially the one pointing out that &#x27;impostor syndrome&#x27; may be characterized as a misconception about the level of required competence), but I&#x27;d like to add this:<p>If I understand correctly, &quot;impostor syndrome&quot; is a term coined by ivy league university psych counsellors. It does not apply to the workplace. It refers to ivy league freshmen not thinking of themselves as geniuses and&#x2F;or mistakenly believing you have to be a genius to be admitted to the ivy league.<p>That doesn&#x27;t seem to be your problem though. It seems more like you feel that you&#x27;re not learning anything permanently. That seems unlikely but... maybe it&#x27;s true? Maybe your job is all about pointless details of framework X which you then promptly forget again.')
