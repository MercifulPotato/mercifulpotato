Item(by='dogma1138', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608075721, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25436912, text='The AI is super dumb and buggy, it can&#x27;t deal with sniper rifles and smart guns.<p>I&#x27;m playing on hard and other than the lucky shot when I&#x27;m doing content 10+ levels above mine (based on the level of the drops since you can&#x27;t see NPC levels easily) I feel pretty invincible.<p>The cyberware launchers are also dumb as fuck no cooldown and infinite ammo you can just sit there and spam rockets all day and as long as you take the perk that makes you immune to your own grenade damage you can use them in CQC also.<p>The game looks great, the story is pretty good and CDPR really nails voice acting and direction but the actual game mechanics are retarded as fuck, everything seems unbalanced there is no real difficulty because you can heal as much as you like (you won&#x27;t run out of meds) and hide behind cover without anyone rushing you and with smart guns that unlock way too early you can basically shoot at enemies without looking at them, aiming at them and when they are behind cover (that is if you get bored with 1 shoting enemies with the big bore sniper rilfes since they get 3-5 headshot damage multiplier which is enough to kill enemy of pretty much any level in this game with early level guns).<p>They really need to look at how Mass Effect solved combat...<p>A few hours in and I&#x27;m already invincible and I also found basically an infinite money trick, craft the blue incendiary grenades that cost 1 uncommon crafting item and 1 uncommon upgrade item and they disassemble into rare crafting items and money is no longer a problem either.<p>Oh and the driving which is supposed to be a big part of the game is so terrible I rather walk and use fast travel because the car handling makes driving painful it takes you like half a mile to stop and the cars start to drift if you as much as look sideways.<p>I don&#x27;t know how much time it would take them to fix it but there is no way that these issues haven&#x27;t been brought up in testing all previous CDPR games had balance issues but because all combat was essentially melee or within melee range you couldn&#x27;t cheese that easily (well unless you went into a quen spec in the TW3 early patches, then you had an invincibility bubble that would damage enemies and heal you...).<p>This game is like 3-6 months away from release on all platforms, it&#x27;s not just performance and technical issues the core game elements aren&#x27;t anywhere near ready.')
