I used to build new computers every year or two, so the idea of getting almost a decade out of the same box is wild and represents how much PC tech has plateaued.<p>However, I have a nice laptop from work and I really like my work setup, where I just connect a couple ports and instantly have a couple more big monitors, a good keyboard and mouse and other stuff.<p>So I&#x27;ve really been considering replacing my desktop with a decent laptop at home. I&#x27;ve also seen some benchmarks that are putting fairly commodity systems within spitting distance of what my old workhorse can do, meaning if I invested in a decent laptop I could probably keep about the level of performance I have today, but gain portability.<p>Then in the last few months we got the new Nvidia 3080 line (with AMD&#x27;s RDNA 2 coming soon), the AMD 5000 series processors, new classes of SSDs like the 970 Evo Plus which have performance that used to be what we saw with DRAM.<p>All of these combined in a new system are going to be an entirely new class of desktop performance that my old system won&#x27;t even come close to touching and portable machines won&#x27;t touch either.<p>So I&#x27;m thinking of going with a new desktop sometime next year once inventory and prices stabilize, and if I need it a rock bottom budget laptop for traveling. Target price &lt;$3k all-in.')
