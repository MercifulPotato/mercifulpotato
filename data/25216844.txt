Singapore always had an entirely dominant state, they just figured out how to brand themselves correctly. State owned businesses became &#x27;state-linked&#x27;, regulatory frameworks are &#x27;governmental disruption&#x27;, and so on. The government owns the housing market, pretty much controls every piece of equipment that any hospital buys, and controls what newspaper can be printed. Imagine if the US nationalised the entire housing market, created an investment fund of the size of a third of the economy, and banned a dozen newspapers, I doubt we&#x27;d call it nimble administration.<p>There is no tradition of &#x27;small government&#x27; in much of Asia. The centrality of public administration in the region, in China say, goes back thousands of years. Post-war Japan was basically the US if the New Deal had gone on for fourty more years, and South Korea developed for the most part under a military dictator.<p>In general &#x27;big government&#x27; isn&#x27;t a scary thing to most people outside of the US and England maybe. Not even in Europe does anyone actually complain about &#x27;big government&#x27;, so it&#x27;s an entirely weird discussion.')
