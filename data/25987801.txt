All the people who are short the share have to buy it back in the future. So the additional supply has exactly been matched by additional demand.<p>What you are saying is like saying that lending money to your friend creates inflation by expanding the money supply, because you still have $10 (that he&#x27;s holding for you), plus he also has $10. In fact, since he knows he owes you $10, he&#x27;s going to have to cut back on his spending at some point in the future, to pay you back. (Your mileage may vary with actual friends.)')
