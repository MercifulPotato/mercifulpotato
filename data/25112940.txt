Sure, the URL shortener project is open-source, but neither Github Pages nor Github Issues are free-as-in-libre open-source projects. What is being show-cased here is a neat idea, but ultimately the dependency on Github&#x27;s Pages and Issues will make it difficult to port to other systems, thus you are not really free to do with as you please.<p>So, while the URL shortener program itself is FOSS with all the right licenses, doesn&#x27;t the direction you are proposing lead to more capture by these non-free platforms, as the value they offer for free-as-in-beer becomes more and more difficult to ignore?')
