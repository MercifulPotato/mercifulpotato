Item(by='coldtea', descendants=None, kids=[25781197], score=None, time=1610651508, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25776266, text='&gt;<i>It&#x27;s incredibly tiresome when HN commenters try to &quot;Macsplain&quot; to me.</i><p>Isn&#x27;t it also tiresome when people on HN assume we know who they are from their handle, or that we are somehow obliged to have followed them outside HN, and remember&#x2F;know who they are?<p>I might recognize pg, or patio11, or tptacek, and a few more, but not everybody. And most handles, I just glaze over, they are not the important part in the discussion. I&#x27;m pretty sure most of us on HN have dozens of HN handles that we don&#x27;t otherwise know who they are, or even keep tabs on from one HN thread to another.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t try to &quot;Macpslain&quot; if your comment didn&#x27;t seem to me to imply that this is just some an isolated thing with ContentFilterExclusionList, that can just be reversed like that, or if it mentioned that this is part of an extensive change to how network filters &#x2F; kernel extensions work (or rather, don&#x27;t work anymore) in Big Sur.')
