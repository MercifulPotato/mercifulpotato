He thought the smartwatch could do this with a gentle vibration.<p>&gt; But the tricky part was to provide &quot;just enough stimulus to pull them out of the deep REM cycle and allow the sleep to continue unaffected,&quot; Tyler says<p>&gt; With constant fine-tuning as his dad slept in the next room, Tyler eventually perfected the algorithm. &quot;Having someone that close to you and knowing exactly when those nightmares happen was super important to training a model like that,&quot; Tyler says.<p>&gt; For Patrick, once they got the formula right, the watch was life changing. &quot;It was night and day when I put that watch on and it started working.&quot; The vibrations, he says, were &quot;little miracles.&quot;<p>&gt; An investor purchased the rights to the app and started a company called NightWare[1].<p>&gt; Last month, the Food and Drug Administration approved the app[2], which works with an Apple Watch, to treat PTSD-related nightmare disorders. It will soon be available by prescription through the VA.<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;night-ware.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;night-ware.com&#x2F;</a><p>2. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fda.gov&#x2F;news-events&#x2F;press-announcements&#x2F;fda-permits-marketing-new-device-designed-reduce-sleep-disturbance-related-nightmares-certain-adults" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fda.gov&#x2F;news-events&#x2F;press-announcements&#x2F;fda-perm...</a>')
