If we just look at minor things for now, you can find all sorts of unfounded opinions in every FB thread on Trump or on the virus. People on FB can now link an article that says whatever they want, and it&#x27;s not good for public discourse.<p>The tell-tale sign of political &quot;thinking&quot; is that you come across a lot of people who think all the evidence points one way. I always think twice when someone presents every decision as an obvious, here-are-10-reasons-and-no-rebuttals case. Such cases are actually a lot more fragile than here-are-some-pros-and-some-cons cases, where the author falls to one side or the other based on some valuation.<p>With Trump and the virus, this has gotten out of hand. It won&#x27;t take you long to find badly supported opinions either way on those topics.')
