But like any pattern ist should not be applied system-wide.<p>It&#x27;s not a fit, imo, as a system architecture. It&#x27;s more a subsystem design where you apply it to something which has many writes and a eventual consistent read-store, which can of course be built from the write-store. That doesn&#x27;t really matter.<p>This can aslo easily be done without adding event sourcing, and the two does not per se go hand in hand.<p>The key point being that you sometimes cannot build a view &quot;fast enough&quot;, based on data which is constantly entering the system. So the system with in the CQRS design, which handles a query is very important to design based on this.<p>I see it as a pattern that really helps you to perform on the read&#x2F;query load due to the almost impossibility to make a query perform over a massive amount of commands&#x2F;writes')
