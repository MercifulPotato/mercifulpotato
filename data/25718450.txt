Studies done at the time pointed out it would take something like 60 launches a year for a reusable system to beat the cost of expendable rockets with available (1970s) technology, and yet the project was pursued regardless. Because the real, actual, honest reason we went with the STS was simply -  the shuttle was a <i>space ship</i>, like in sci-fi, and was therefore cool and therefore a public darling. Even if it made no financial sense, people still loved it.<p>It&#x27;s similar to the  USS Missouri and USS Wisconsin serving in the Gulf War. Made absolutely no sense whatsoever, and was a total waste of money and time. But battle wagons are cool, and therefore people bent over backwards trying to justify it. They even invented &quot;armored&quot; pods for the tomahawks going on the Iowas:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Armored_Box_Launcher" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Armored_Box_Launcher</a><p>To try and pretend there was some kind of operational point to using thickly armored battleships instead of something more modern.<p>Rule of cool is strangely powerful in real life in turns out.')
