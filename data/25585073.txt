Mostly, I built it initially to scratch my own itch, and to go back to doing more django dev.<p>Basically, you can add a label to a PR in github and it will then queue it up to be merged once all the required checks pass, and it keeps queued PRs &quot;up-to-date&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s made a little money, but not much.<p>Github recently rolled out a feature at Github Universe that has overlap, so I&#x27;m guessing it won&#x27;t get much more traction.<p>A few lessons I learned:\n- Especially when building on a platform, make sure you have the right niche. In this case, it probably has a wide enough audience that Github decided it was worth it to build as part of the platform.\n- Like any engineer, I spent too long building and let scope creep delay me from launching.<p>All in all, it&#x27;s pretty cheap (read: basically free) to run, but I probably committed somewhere over 120 hours on it.')
