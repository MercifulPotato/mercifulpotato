My experiences agreed with most&#x2F;all of the article. Pros and cons of the new situation:<p>Pros: I feel much less like a cog in a big machine at the smaller organization. My pay went up significantly because they actually wanted some of my unique skill set, and just before the end of the year I got a project of importance from the R&amp;D director, with the VP of product development explaining the longer term importance of the project. My manager is pretty hands off, so I can totally get away with building my skills when he thinks I&#x27;m working on short term projects -WFH helps too ;)<p>Cons: more variation in people.  The megacorp had more standard cooperative folks, but I think some people I work with now are trying to protect their fiefs at the expense of my work. I&#x27;m slowly learning to do their jobs though hehehe...<p>At the megacorp (a big name you&#x27;ve heard of), I was in a huge side office. They made some nice sounding efforts to train me, but my time was billed by the hour (standard in the industry), so every hour learning something was an hour i had to make up later. I was moved between random projects with vacancies, so when I did learn something I&#x27;d have to shelve it for months or years until the funding situation or other variables aligned. My own ideas: there was a way to get funding, but it wasn&#x27;t much and nobody above the director level cared if my idea worked, even if it impressed the company&#x27;s anointed experts. I was an experienced engineering hire, was there for a few years.<p>I&#x27;m pretty happy with my new job! The industry is renewable energy, which makes me feel better than my old corporate jobs on the oil&#x2F;defense side of the moral spectrum. I got lucky! We&#x27;ll see how this goes. At the old job people came and went a lot, so I have reason to believe I can go back if the new thing flames out.<p>My two cents.')
