Stripe Billing&#x27;s pricing has been public since 2018.</i><p>But lots of us have been using Stripe for a lot longer than that, and don&#x27;t necessarily want or need all the extra things you&#x27;re now putting under the &quot;Billing&quot; brand.<p>We haven&#x27;t received any notification of a change from Stripe, but from the HN discussion, it looks like the option to just have a simple, automated recurring charge -- the key feature that attracted businesses like mine to Stripe in the first place -- is being removed. If that is the case then we&#x27;ll naturally view the change as a 0.5% increase in Stripe&#x27;s fees, pure and simple.')
