If I can pollute a lake for an extra buck to my stock price, I&#x27;m expected to do this.<p>* HR ethics focus on protecting the company. If they can lie to you as an employee to minimize legal risk, that&#x27;s what&#x27;s gonna happen.<p>* Legal ethics focusing on protecting your client (no matter how evil), while practice focuses on maximizing billable hours.<p>... and so on. It&#x27;s not good or bad. It just is. As a programmer, you&#x27;ll be off-putting to people from those groups for reasons just as valid or invalid.<p>And generalizations are often accurate. If you don&#x27;t show a certain modesty and humility in gift-receiving in China, you&#x27;ll be an outcast. If you don&#x27;t show a certain opulence and over-the-top gratitude in some parts of the Middle East and show the same, you&#x27;ll be an outcast just as much.<p>Guess what happens when the two cultures come together?<p>People are viewed as jerks.<p>A little cross-cultural training goes a long ways to avoid that. I&#x27;m sorry you don&#x27;t like the tone, but I viewed this as a fair guide for programmers managing corporate settings running into those barriers. This article appears to do a fine job explaining HR&#x27;s role to people coming from e.g. CS undergrad degrees which will prevent them from getting hurt. It&#x27;s no better or worse than a guide for e.g. American women as to what to expect if they marry someone from Saudi culture.<p>As a footnote, quotation marks suggest you&#x27;re quoting someone. Your claimed quote doesn&#x27;t exist in the source article. Your point would be stronger if you commented on what the author wrote than your (somewhat inaccurate) read-between-the-lines. That&#x27;s another place cultures differ a lot: how things are implied and subtexts. People misread subtexts, which I think you did here.')
