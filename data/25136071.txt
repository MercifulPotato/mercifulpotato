They end up wildly unpopular because they have all the bells and whistles people begrudgingly accept to get the one feature they want (continuity) but lack this one that they accept the others for. Continuity isn&#x27;t just for enterprise. Non-technical users abhor having to re-learn anything or give up the procedures they struggled so hard with adopting (there are probably still some who feel uneasy if they haven&#x27;t run defrag for more than two months, despite of having switched to NTFS more than a decade ago) and gamers and the like have lots of niche hardware and software solutions that easily puts the unsupportedness of vintage enterprise software to shame. Continuity is a key feature.<p>What I think could work, and would eventually lead to the same situation as &quot;Enterprise&#x2F;X&quot; would be the reverse: a &quot;regular&quot; Windows aiming to eventually build a Microsoft equivalent of the Apple walled garden and a  &quot;continuity subscription&quot; that&#x27;s more conservative than what Windows is now (trivial example: opt into Cortana instead of opt out, barely)<p>PS: I understand that you are talking about low level technological differences and I seem to be hung up with UX, but I believe that separating groups on the high level would be the only viable way to eventually follow different paths on the low level.')
