All hell breaks loose if we don&#x27;t, and I&#x27;ve thought about implementing cry-it-out but looking at her mode of crying I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s healthy. Anyway, I&#x27;m staying with her for 2 hours until she falls asleep (she does take that long) because my spouse already cares for her all day and is exhausted, besides, she has a part time job she has to do some work in the evening for. 11pm is not an exaggeration and it&#x27;s how it&#x27;s been in the past 6+ weeks. I have hopes that things will be different at 3~4 years old, but not right now.')
