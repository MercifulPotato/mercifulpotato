When I first played the game as a HS-er I didn&#x27;t really understand enough about boolean logic or computation to understand it.<p>During shelter-in-place I took another look at it and was totally sucked in. I absolutely love the cool thing the community has come up with. I really like the creative challenge of coming up with new designs for machines that automate away the problems that you have in the game.<p>Honestly, it&#x27;s a real shame the devs don&#x27;t encourage more automation directly. The real reason I stopped playing in the first place is that it quickly just turned into tedious _work_ to collect resources.<p>Another thought I had was that the spatial nature of the thinking that you are doing when you are constructing redstone circuits works really well for my brain. I wish I could leverage that side of my brain when doing programming work. I&#x27;m able to keep a lot more in my working memory when I can reference a component by it&#x27;s location relative to everything else. It&#x27;s hard to describe, but I really quite liked it.')
