The PDF is even often the deliverable sent to press.<p>I believe this is precisely what the GP finds appealing about PDFs. A PDF (usually) constitutes the original copy, reproduced faithfully.<p>It&#x27;s like the difference between buying a widescreen VHS versus one that uses pan-and-scan to fit the movie to your TV&#x27;s aspect ratio. Sure, the widescreen copy may not be ideal for your viewing environment, but it&#x27;s the version the director intended for you to see.<p>And for both eBooks and movies, you can work around the problem by using more appropriate hardware.')
