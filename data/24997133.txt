I&#x27;m just saying the following because I don&#x27;t like to see the kind of behavior in this community that I think is going on here (and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s intentional, fwiw).<p>Your criticism of me amounts to the fact that I asked for a citation of a statement I was skeptical about. I think that&#x27;s pretty plainly not a legitimate criticism.<p>I think that you are the one who is being passive aggressive here.<p>If you thought my comment was passive aggressive, you could have just said so. (It generally is not passive aggressive to ask for a citation, but I can see how someone could think that.)<p>If you wanted me to explain the rationale for <i>my</i> statement, you could have just <i>directly</i> asked, instead of criticizing me in the way you did, which seems indirect and unfair.')
