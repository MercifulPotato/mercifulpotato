Which will place a tremendous limit on 1440p gaming?<p>My suggestion over the included build is spending $10 more on the build and getting a 10600K.<p>Silicon Lottery has found 100% of 10600ks will do 4.7 Ghz <i>sustained all core</i>.<p>Even at that number it will easily out perform a 3600 in a meaningful way. Over 70% of them do 4.9 Ghz which where it starts to reach i9 levels of performance in gaming by the way...<p>-<p>And the cherry on top over the 3600 is <i>you can actually buy the i5 outside of Microcenter</i>. Microcenter is the only place carrying the 3600 for $180... but they also have 10600k on perma-sale for $250.<p>Meanwhile outside of Microcenter the 3600 is rarer than hen&#x27;s teeth while the 10600k is widely available at $270. I happen to have 5 microcenters within an hour or so of me, but most people don&#x27;t have that luxury.')
