A bog-standard AA Alkaline battery has 2500 mA-hr (from 1.5V to 1V, @100mA draw: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;data.energizer.com&#x2F;pdfs&#x2F;e91.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;data.energizer.com&#x2F;pdfs&#x2F;e91.pdf</a>), and have a ~3%&#x2F;year self discharge rate. That&#x27;s a leakage current of 75mA-hrs &#x2F; year, or ~10 uA if I did my math correctly. Lithium, and watch button batteries (Silver) leak even less!<p>ATTiny 1607 is specified at 6uA at 1.8V @ 32kHz active mode (though 5V barely is any more current). It looks like STM32G031J4 is ~20 uA at &quot;low-power mode&quot; @ 1.8V 32kHz (a special mode below 2MHz). Which is a lot better than I was expecting. (Note to others who may not know this: this is likely a Cortex-M0+ design only. Typical ARMs will not be able to reach this low level of power. Heck, larger STM32 Cortex-M4 processors probably have a much higher minimum clockrate)<p>Both chips are ~200 uA at 2MHz, Which gets you to ~500 days of continuous operation from 2500 mA-hr AA.<p>------<p>Yeah, there&#x27;s a bunch of batteries that self-discharge in just 3-months. But... alkaline AA exist for a reason! Low-self discharge, and they&#x27;re actually really good at these milliamp&#x2F;microamp levels of current. And again, its all about those silver-watch batteries or lithium-watch batteries if you really want the lowest self-discharge in the market. (~5 years per silver-watch battery, but you need to draw stupidly low amounts of current).<p>It seems like the ATTiny 1607 still has a superior sleep mode compared to STM32G031J4, so if you&#x27;re sleeping most of the time on a watch battery, maybe ATTiny wins.<p>I do agree with you though: it does seem like STM32 has really dropped their power down a lot. I don&#x27;t know if STM32 always supported 32kHz clock rates however, I seem to remember them having a higher minimum clock rate last time I checked this out. Lowering those clock speeds really helps at minimizing power. And I expect AA-batteries to be the typical size of most people&#x27;s hobby projects.<p>I dunno if &quot;full static&quot; is really needed, since 32kHz is still really, really low power. It seems nice that ATTiny &#x2F; ATMegas hve 0Hz as an option (maybe if an external temporary clock turns on only occasionally in a power-constrained environment).')
