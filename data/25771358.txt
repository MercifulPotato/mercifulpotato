Everything else is ruled by backwards compatibility and frenetic management scared to stay the course. (The vast majority of projects are killed if they don&#x27;t tape out in ~2 years.)<p>Intel will shift to a TSMC model. They have the best fabs on the planet, and the best fab engineers. I believe it is something like a 3 millions dollars lost per minute if they are idle. They have already started doing that a few years ago, I suspect this will be their final form.<p>IMHO: The only thing holding them back from the transition are the hundreds of small boondoggle-groups staffed by old-timers too scared to retire, and too scared to do something daring, yet still somehow hang on to their hidey-holes. They lost a ton of key architects to Apple a few years ago, which I also suspect was the reason why the M1 is so badass.<p>...and if you really want to get sentimental, here&#x27;s an AMD poster we had in our cubes back in ~1991:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;linustechtips.com&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;monthly_2016_03&#x2F;Szg2Ppo.jpg.50131cfba4af86263bc0f3ff2b0e5559.jpg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;linustechtips.com&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;monthly_2016_03&#x2F;Szg2Ppo.jp...</a><p>The Sanders-as-Indiana was both funny and infuriating....<p>(The Farrah Fawcett looking woman was Sander&#x27;s bombshell wife, compared to Grove at the time, who drove a beat up old car.)')
