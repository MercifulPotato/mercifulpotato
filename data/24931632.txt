My team may implement some design changes required (ex: for scaling) and I contribute code to this project.<p>* I have shallow knowledge of 2 other products, I&#x27;m trained at identifying a trigger that causes an outage and mitigate it (common mitigations are: move traffic, increase quota temporarily, rollback a release). If I can&#x27;t solve an incident without in-depth knowledge of these products, I escalate to the devteam, and they will be responsible for root-causing.<p>A mitigation that requires a patch, cherry pick and rollout would be a terrible (and risky) thing to do, so I&#x27;d rather find any alternative first.')
