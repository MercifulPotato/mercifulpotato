Item(by='ygjb', descendants=None, kids=[25233790], score=None, time=1606521088, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25233116, text='&gt; You&#x27;re arguing against a straw man here. [...] There&#x27;s nothing even like that.<p>And you are arguing in bad faith; there are several parts of the article that detail exactly what you are looing for.<p>In the second paragraph, the article indicates that 11 of the folks who left notified HR or their managers.<p>In the third paragraph one of the named victims states she made several reports.<p>In the sixth paragraph 5 on the record employees and 18 off the record employees, and internal documents and recordings are claimed as evidence.<p>Despite this, Coinbase only reports three official complaints in the year many of these folks left.<p>Coupled with the stream of hot garbage that Brian Armstrong has proposed trying to position as being &quot;Mission Focused&quot;, in the middle of a pandemic, massive, ongoing riots, and political instability just illustrates how utterly tone deaf the leadership at Coinbase is.<p>&gt; Susan Fowler blew up Uber with a single blog post.<p>Yes, you correct.  You also have to look at the facts; Susan is an excellent writer, and based on her book, she already had some measure of experience speaking truth to power.  Coupled with the fact that she was already recognized as a talented engineer and a published author, it&#x27;s not surprising her blog post was as well received as it was.<p>Susan also wrote about her experience with her own voice and had receipts to show how bad it was.  I certainly don&#x27;t want to down play the issues that women in tech face, but it&#x27;s also well known that people of color frequently have different social and economic circumstances than white or white-presenting folks (and it&#x27;s not me saying this -- she calls out in her book the casual anti-semitism she faced from folks who didn&#x27;t know she is Jewish).')
