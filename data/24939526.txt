It&#x27;s hard to blame the president when it is not equally bad across the board, for example if you have some cities like NYC which manage to contribute <i>10% of all COVID deaths in the US so far</i>.<p>When it comes to things that typically are the purview of the executive branch, I think I remember the US being the first country in the G20 to restrict travel from China, among other things, and then the POTUS was called xenophobic by various people for pointing the finger where it deserved to be pointed (China, who was the very first to downplay the virus and pretend everything was hunky dory while it really wasn&#x27;t).<p>I&#x27;m not a fan of Trump, but if you are placing the blame for coronavirus on him you are more than a little misguided. In all honesty, watching Democrats use people who died of COVID as political props by trying to pin their deaths on Trump is one of the shittiest things I&#x27;ve seen this year, and it&#x27;s been a crap year.')
