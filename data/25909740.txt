Anyone who has had an illicit mp3 collection has probably spent a ton of time doing just that. However, that&#x27;s less relevant today, and for documents and pictures, I can basically just chuck them in a folder then search by date, location, or even person in them without a ton of effort. Full text searches are fast at the &quot;these are my documents&quot; scale, and the price of storage is cheaper than a nice meal at a restaurant per year.<p>I&#x27;m able to keep almost everything, store it for pennies a week, find what I want instantly, and spend almost no time doing any of that. I feel like going through a decluttering would spark less joy than tossing everything into a folder and going on with my life.')
