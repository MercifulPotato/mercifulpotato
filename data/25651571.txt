Others working on the problem are ignored entirely or seen as a threat to their own solution.<p>Really hit the nail on the head for the non-profit industry (of which I am a part). A lot of non-profit leaders are totally insufferable because they take anything less than fawning over them to be an attack on their identity as savior.<p>You get some of these people everywhere, of course, but there&#x27;s a way higher concentration in non-profits.')
