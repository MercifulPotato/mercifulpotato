Linux, even Ubuntu, has over the years been a headache, however Pop!_OS is the best OS for software development today in my opinion. Regardless of distro, hardware support has greatly increased (as opposed to 2010, where getting a Wi-Fi driver or trackpad to work appropriately on Ubuntu was a chore.)<p>The primary way people interact with the internet today isn&#x27;t through a system running Windows, it is through an Android or iOS device. If I have a budget of $200 for a laptop for school, it seems improbable that I&#x27;m going to go for a Windows system over Chrome OS unless there is some custom software I can&#x27;t live without.<p>I&#x27;m sort of outta my lane here, but it seems to me that Microsoft&#x27;s cloud offerings are going to be far more lucrative and important than revenue earned from desktop OS licensing at some point. Tools like VS Code integrate well with Azure for a reason. Linux dominating the server space isn&#x27;t something Microsoft is ignoring either.')
