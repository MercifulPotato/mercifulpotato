There are no absolutes in security anyway.  Sorry, but I&#x27;m sublimely unparanoid at my national government reading my emails.  While I could probably be accused of being a member of the metropolitan elite (c.f. suburban-bourgeoise), I&#x27;ve never said in real life or written online anything to threaten anyone.<p>Instead, @Barrin92 argues that the concern is leakage to allow corporate use of that data.  I agree with the concern, but contend that regulation is the answer.  I don&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve received targeted ads based on the content of my inbox, yet my inbox arrives over unencrypted SMTP.  A special case can&#x27;t be claimed for messaging.  The problem isn&#x27;t weak regulation, the problem is that messaging apps are largely in the hands of few -- and not interoperable.<p>Jabber and SIP aren&#x27;t in the hands of a single company and for me, the direction of travel has to be federated across autonomous providers along the lines of interoperability.<p>I haven&#x27;t tackled any of my acquaintances about it but suspect that the remainers from the defection from WhatsApp that Facebook provoked include a fair number that take a &quot;out of the frying-pan and into the fire&quot; or &quot;better the devil you know&quot; stance moreso than inertia.<p>There isn&#x27;t money in it in the sense of the unwelcome TeleGuard HN spam.  But, rather than banging-on about encryption, espionage, and elites, what those with the resources need to do is to use them to help democratise messaging.')
