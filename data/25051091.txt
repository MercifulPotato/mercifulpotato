Its really easy in my experience to create sophisticated tools using it + some go functionality. The trick is learning what gen problems are best solved in text templates and whats best solved in go functions. A big advantage of using text&#x2F;template for codegen is you can just write the code you want to generate and it looks like real go code. Really easy to maintain compared to AST-style codegen.')
