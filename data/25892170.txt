That&#x27;s where I thought we&#x27;d get to. That&#x27;s what I was talking about above.<p>Let me surprise you: I don&#x27;t really disagree about the North getting a rough time. I&#x27;d argue about some definitions and whether that excuses crashing the rest of the country in revenge. But whatever.<p>Here is the thing though: why do you think that makes you special?<p>I am in Dagenham in East London. We were dock workers. Then the docks shut or went containerized and electric so there were no jobs and a lot of poverty.<p>Westminster, less than 50 miles away did nothing for us.<p>Ford came and opened a plant here because we were willing to work. They became the major employer.<p>Then they shut.<p>Central government again did nothing for us.<p>So we went up into London, got jobs in insurance. We had to start at the bottom. We had to spend a lot of money and time on overpriced trains. We had to retrain, office work is nothing like assembly lines.<p>Tell me I&#x27;m wrong.<p>When a load of that offshored, we jumped to finance.<p>Right now, they&#x27;re building crossrail near me. The first investment we&#x27;ve had in a century.<p>I don&#x27;t doubt the North has had it hard. But so had the South. I agree Westminster is a bunch of toffs with no interest in the lives of real people. But I&#x27;m as much of a real person as you.<p>The only difference here is we know no White Knight is coming to save us. Given the last 1000 years of history, I don&#x27;t know why the North keeps thinking that the likes of Boris and Farage are &quot;on their side&quot;. It&#x27;s especially amazing to me that you call me and elite (first person in my family to go to uni, born and raised in one of Europe&#x27;s most deprived areas, no inheritance coming for me) and not them?<p>Your comment on immigrants underlines my point: immigrants getting on and working hard is exactly the sort of thing people who don&#x27;t want to get on and work hard find maddening.<p>Are you now ready to go to those fields and do that work? Or will you continue waiting for Westminster to save you?<p>I&#x27;ve been quite blunt with you here. Its not because I don&#x27;t like you. It&#x27;s not because I think I&#x27;ll win something. Its because this is where we are. Whether I like it or not, we&#x27;re in this together now. The North, like everyone else, will need to get on and go. If you don&#x27;t think the North got the investment it needed before, it won&#x27;t get it now, so there is no point waiting. Its go time.<p>This is the horrible truth that Farage and Bojo will never speak aloud. They&#x27;ll keep lying and telling you it&#x27;s the Europeans, the immigrants, the elite, the educated, the benefit claimants, and whoever else.<p>Now tell me I&#x27;m wrong.')
