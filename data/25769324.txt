The Black vote didn&#x27;t turn out because they saw a tweet, they came out because people knocked on their door and talked to them and convinced them to brave the cold and vote.<p>And just as crucially: the Republican vote didn&#x27;t come out despite all of Trump&#x27;s tweets, and Cruz&#x27;s tweets, and all the other GOPers posting on social media. The Republican voters stayed home despite all the <i>social media</i> begging them to vote because the GOP <i>didn&#x27;t</i> have the same level of in-person events for the runoff as they did for the general election.')
