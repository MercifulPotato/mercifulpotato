It doesn&#x27;t take away any right, it&#x27;s about the limits of a right.<p>You also suppress freedom of speech indirectly when you put someone in prison, so any crime punished by imprisonment seems to be considered reason enough to justify that as well.<p>Saying that freedom of speech can&#x27;t ever be limited is a very ideological point of view, so far away from reality that I wouldn&#x27;t consider it worth debating at all.<p>Now there is a valid argument to be made, how decisions to deplatform a person should be made and&#x2F;or how such decisions can be appealed.')
