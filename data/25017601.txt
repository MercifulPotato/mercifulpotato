Assuming all states appoint electors in accordance with the safe harbor provisions of the Electoral Count Act, the &quot;real call&quot; is December 14th.  If that doesn&#x27;t happen, then it&#x27;s possible neither candidate will have 270+ votes and in that case the &quot;real call&quot; is an unusually counted vote in the house.<p>With the current projections, it would likely have to be <i>three</i> states that fail to send electors properly for Biden to have a chance of losing.')
