Everything I do just takes that bit longer than software that I choose to use, because everything is designed around the mouse.<p>Keyboard shortcuts aren&#x27;t enough to create a good UX for the keyboard, the whole UX needs consideration, and Notion has unfortunately failed on that.<p>For a while their text editor was very poor, to the point where my colleagues and I all edited text in other software and copied it in. This has improved a lot in the last year or so, but there are still plenty of issues at the block level and upwards, it&#x27;s just the word-level that got better.')
