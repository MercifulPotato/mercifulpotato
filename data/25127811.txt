Years ago some companies went too far with it and got burned. EA has their own fork of the STL that&#x27;s gotten increasingly crufty and behind in performance. AAA game engines also get <i>big</i>, so there&#x27;s a lot of pressure on avoiding explosions of build time with more advanced template techniques.<p>Gamedev tends to use its own patterns, particularly arena allocation for long lived fixed size tables, or their own internal object &#x2F; entity &#x2F; component model . It&#x27;s not really c with classes or c with templates, just kind of its own dialect.')
