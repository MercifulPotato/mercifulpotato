That will help everybody.<p>Still, there is reasonable probability that there will be a period of time when it will be hard to explain to many that they should keep behaving like potential virus carriers even after they received the vaccine (masks, distancing etc). If they do that then they will contribute to the earlier end of pandemic and directly and indirectly protect some vulnerable. By still behaving like potential carriers they will reduce already mentioned chance of transmission and contribute to health of everybody else. It&#x27;s somehow non-intuitive. Also non-intuitive: some percentage of all vaccinated will with such behavior directly protect themselves too, simply because even 95% isn&#x27;t 100% -- that 95% means one of 20 still gets sick, on average.<p>Then it won&#x27;t be the first time during this pandemics that &quot;dumbing down&quot; the message isn&#x27;t the best way to communicate.<p>Whoever cares about those who are most in danger, and even whoever just cares about the economy, should once again try to understand the nuances and then explain them to those who don&#x27;t.')
