The cinematography used various colors to get the desired look on black and white film, in some cases to evoke various percieved colors with totally different colors.<p>When colorizing, sometimes they have color photos from the filming. You can try to match those, but that may not match the intent of the film. But you might not know the intent either, so you have to guess at that too. It might be easier to convince people to watch colorized films, but it&#x27;s important to realize it&#x27;s not really the same film.')
