You&#x27;re ultimately limited by signal vs noise and can&#x27;t make up for the receiving area that simply isn&#x27;t there, no matter the width of the baseline.<p>This makes interferometers and stationary giant dishes different tools, suited to different types of observations. Arrays are not good at imaging extended diffuse sources.')
