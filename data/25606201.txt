You should not give them anything of your life, because it&#x27;s worth next to nothing to them. Mega-corps are life sucking leeches on employees, customers, and society as a whole. Everyone. How many horror stories is it going to take? Don&#x27;t get duped by the glamour. Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Facebook, Uber, none of them are going to be good for you. In the worst case, they&#x27;re going to make you hurt other people.<p>It&#x27;s an especially horrible idea if you&#x27;re in a vulnerable position like being here on a visa. Many vulnerable people, including some of my close friends, are being taken advantage of by megacorps, and have very few options. Stay away! It is <i>not</i> your dream job.')
