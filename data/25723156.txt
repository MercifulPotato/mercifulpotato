The &quot;left&quot; doesn&#x27;t act on &quot;policy&quot; and never change their votes.<p>The left <i>does</i> act on policy and actually <i>does</i> punish their representatives--<i>FAR</i> more so than the right.  We have the studies on this.  They were even posted in here.<p>So, I have to ask, why didn&#x27;t you quote those studies when changing my words to make an erroneous statement contradicted with evidence?<p>Congratulations: people like you are <i>exactly</i> the reason why this <i>isn&#x27;t</i> an opportunity.  People like you are more interested in whataboutism, false equivalence, and spreading false information rather than in working on positive policy changes.')
