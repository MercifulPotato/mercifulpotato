And it all comes down to attitude.<p>Some people look at life and see the opportunities. Others look and see the obstacles. Some take the hardship they encounter and use it to grow. Others use it as an excuse for their failures.<p>The older I get, the more people I know, the more I arrive to the conclusion that it’s all about attitude, more than anything else.<p>It’s our attitude that decides if we end up as winners or losers. It’s our own responsibility and merit, not others&#x27;. But pushing a victim mentality, a loser attitude on others - is criminal.')
