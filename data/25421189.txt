It is particularly damaging when talking to a genuine expert [2]. Having a user like rseacord commenting in threads like this is great for everybody. When you incentivize them to leave, you harm the entire community. Your other comment [3] was pretty insulting too (at the beginning); people don&#x27;t serve on standards committees because of money.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newsguidelines.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newsguidelines.html</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22865357" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22865357</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25420638" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25420638</a><p>Edit: we&#x27;ve already had to ask you to stop posting in the flamewar style to HN, and you&#x27;ve been doing it repeatedly lately. Would you please review the guidelines and use HN as intended? I don&#x27;t want to ban you.')
