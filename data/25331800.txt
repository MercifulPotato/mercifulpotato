The concept is not as weird as it sounds once you consider that the ship&#x27;s captain is a naval officer who has duties and a social role roughly similar to that of a doctor. For any task related to navigating&#x2F;operating the vessel (emergency or not), the captain&#x27;s word is final and there are penalties for negligent behavior that are determined completely outside of the &quot;corporate&quot; chain of command. Decisions of whether or not to ditch a block of unstable containers are made with 0 interference from commercial interests.<p>The captain is also the one responsible for upholding the laws of whatever flag the vessel flies under.')
