Item(by='julianmarq', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610404915, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25738283, text='<i>&gt; Do you see how by using the word “censorship” [...], you have made it difficult to continue this conversation?</i><p>Not really, no, what makes it difficult for me to continue this conversation is that I had no interest in having this conversation in the first place. My first comment was just asking the other person how he dealt with these threads, as I wasn&#x27;t sure what he meant exactly or if he had a trick or something.<p>I certainly didn&#x27;t want to start arguing the merits of free speech again (I already said I found it disheartening to read).<p><i>&gt; I didn’t present any position at all other than saying that neither extreme is realistic</i><p>And since I never spoke in favor of <i>any</i> extreme, I argued with you because your point about &quot;everyone being pro-censorship&quot; wasn&#x27;t apropos... Something you seem to know too.<p><i>&gt; look for people arguing about specific behaviors; avoid people arguing over the definition of the word “censorship”.</i><p>I&#x27;ve seen the same people arguing both in favor of the same &quot;specific behavior&quot; you mentioned and against free speech[1]. And no, those discussions were anything but productive or nuanced. With that in mind, I have no interest in looking for that.<p>[1]: Not that differentiating between that and censorship wasn&#x27;t already a distinction without a difference (as I already implied in my previous comment), but I must say that those discussions did make it evident that they were ultimately arguing for the same thing.')
