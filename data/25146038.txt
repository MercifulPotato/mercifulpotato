IG is the last piece I need to get rid of besides those apps I don&#x27;t care about with the &quot;sign in with facebook&quot; crap.<p>I&#x27;m trying to quit IG so my next phone will be fb free but does anyone have any recommendations on how to make dropping IG easier? So far I made a group with friends so we can spam pics but it&#x27;s not the same (probably cause not enough of us is spamming it)<p>Does anyone know of a IG replacement?')
