Random Noob who works out of the caf√© down the road selling attested signatures for five bucks. The whole point of PKI is that I&#x27;m trusting a third party to perform verifications on my behalf--it rather defeats the purpose if the third party in question is no more trustworthy than the person requesting their attestation.<p>That said, I find it interesting that a couple people on their partners list are Notaries Public--adding digital signature to the list of functions a Notary can perform would make the migration to digital signatures easier. It would probably require making the Notary&#x27;s signature part of a public chain maintained and issued by the local government as part of their licensure, though, so I don&#x27;t see where Certisfy comes into that picture at all.')
