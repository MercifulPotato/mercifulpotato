Item(by='edbob', descendants=None, kids=[25877231, 25878789], score=None, time=1611355072, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25876998, text='I don&#x27;t know the extent to which this is a problem (i.e., I don&#x27;t want to make this into a &quot;weak man&quot;), but there are some legitimate reasons to be concerned with the replacement  and&#x2F;or minimization of traditional holidays. At least one important motive for the replacement was to create the foundation for violent revolution: &quot;the creation of its own series of holidays all underscored Karenga&#x27;s premise that &#x27;you must have a cultural revolution before the violent revolution. The cultural revolution gives identity, purpose, and direction.&#x27;&quot; [0]<p>It&#x27;s easy for people to laugh at such concerns when they don&#x27;t see them as plausible, but when you also have people like Dick Costolo promising shootings and a violent revolution, it&#x27;s hard to know who can be trusted. When the left spends a year &quot;mostly peacefully&quot; killing dozens of people and burning our cities, it becomes a lot easier to believe that they might want a full revolution. Again, not to say that these concerns are necessarily justified, but that it&#x27;s very difficult to know whether they are or not. If one prefers to err on the side of caution and criticize Starbucks here, I think that&#x27;s a legitimate position.<p>(Kind of hoping that someone can give me a good way to debunk these concerns, so I&#x27;m just going to ignore any troll responses).<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;books.google.com&#x2F;books?id=Vhgk72OGBRYC&amp;pg=PA65#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;books.google.com&#x2F;books?id=Vhgk72OGBRYC&amp;pg=PA65#v=one...</a>')
