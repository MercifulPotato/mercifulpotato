On that VM I host some services for personal projects, gitolite, Grafana, InfluxDB, wireguard and some self baked daemons (they are also deployed as Arch Linux package, it&#x27;s not too hard and much cleaner and easier to deal with in the long run).<p>I update weekly to daily, but sometimes also a month goes by (e.g., if I&#x27;m on vacation or the like), never had an issue, never had any breakage. I reboot on kernel updates, downtime is a few seconds which I can deal with.<p>The VM is only single core, 4GB memory, 40 GB disk space - chugging along just fine.<p>Personally, I&#x27;d always feel safe and good with choosing either Arch Linux, Debian or Alpine Linux as VM&#x2F;CT distribution (my underlying  hypervisor would be Proxmox VE, which derives from Debian).')
