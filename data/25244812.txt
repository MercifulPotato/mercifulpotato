This is clearly not what people are doing. The &quot;protocol of the elder of zion&quot; conspiracy theory is this kind of example, but there aren&#x27;t a lot of them.<p>However, even with this definition it is still not clear-cut. If you were to say in the cold war that some US secret services were financing authoritarian regimes in south america to fight communism (or islamic extremists in afghanistan), this could easily qualify as a conspiracy theory today. Until you get the evidence that it is true.<p>At the moment, it looks to me like the only purpose of this label is to prevent people from trying to investigate into it. It&#x27;s a concept that prevents you from thinking rather than helps you think better.')
