The textbook definition of a &quot;short sale&quot; is that someone borrows stock and then, literally, <i>sells it</i> short. The buyer of the stock is free and clear to do whatever they want with the stock, including re-lend it for another short sale. Wikipedia has a good primer on how this works: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Short_(finance)" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Short_(finance)</a><p>This has created a lot of confusion on WallstreetBets, where many participants have come to believe that Gamestop&#x27;s short interest of 113% means that there are 13% more shares shorted than long positions to cover. It&#x27;s not true, though, because the long interest is always greater than the short interest.')
