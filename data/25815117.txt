Wild hogs are wreaking utter havoc and we don&#x27;t have effective means to control their population.  I&#x27;m fairly confident that humans will win that battle. But what if we nuked population centers?  Most of the hogs would survive, but only a fraction of the humans.  Who would win out in the decades to come?  Hogs can eat all sorts of roughage, survive out in the elements, etc., humans are much more dependant on their technology.  Want crops? Sorry, hogs ate &#x27;em.  Wanna eat hogs?  They&#x27;re smart, and after your ammo stores are depleted, you&#x27;re back to the stone age.<p>But the question isn&#x27;t mere survival -- can intelligent life <i>thrive</i> to the point where we can achieve interstellar travel?')
