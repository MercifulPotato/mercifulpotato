Historically lots of them notionally had independent programmes, but they didn&#x27;t actually do the maintenance&#x2F; oversight work necessary, so it&#x27;s like if they&#x27;d just shipped Linux 1.3.48 forever. 1.3.48 was a pretty good release at the time, but er, not five years later. Just auto-applying Mozilla&#x27;s changes is better.<p>However this isn&#x27;t entirely an apples-to-apple comparison. That package in Debian is for the Web PKI, CAs trusted to issue specifically for DNS names (and rarely IP addresses) for services on TLS, thus mostly the web but also IMAP, HTTP and other protocols that can use TLS. That&#x27;s it, no other purposes are warranted.<p>Whereas Microsoft ships roots trusted for several other purposes their users care about, including code signing for both application software and drivers, and document signing (used in some jurisdictions to give legal effect to a digital signature on a document, not to be confused with electronic signatures which are just an image of a written signature) and so on.')
