People were in all ways as smart and capable as us, they just had lower technology level and different concepts.

It&#x27;s just how invention works - many times a great invention is not recognized as valuable. Zero is classic case. It was invented independently in various times and areas and forgotten. Without zero you can&#x27;t have a positional numeric system.')
