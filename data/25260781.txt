Item(by='meowface', descendants=None, kids=[25260952], score=None, time=1606781916, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25258575, text='You&#x27;re right, &quot;all for naught&quot; was going too far and I apologize for the hyperbole, but it&#x27;s kind of like a blockchain fork: most new projects are gradually moving to the new async side of things, and this new mirror universe is being built at an accelerating pace while the previous fork (synchronous libraries) is decelerating.<p>In 5, 10, 15 years, a lot of code that might have otherwise still had some utility may no longer be practical. A lot of such code might have become obsolete after that long anyway, but some of it might be used far less than it could&#x27;ve been solely because it&#x27;s outside of the future async status quo.<p>There are some awesome Perl projects out there, and their work definitely wasn&#x27;t for naught, but it&#x27;s hard to justify using them for anything serious in 2020, kind of like how it might end up being hard to justify using synchronous Python in 2025 or 2030.<p>(Not in the sense of running a standalone application, in which case who cares what it&#x27;s written with, but in terms of something that may require some kind of continuous development or interfacing with other code.)<p>&gt;We had libraries based on twisted for over a decade, which were basically in the same position, but you&#x27;re not mentioning those?<p>My understanding is Twisted doesn&#x27;t suffer from the so-called &quot;what color is your function problem&quot;: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;journal.stuffwithstuff.com&#x2F;2015&#x2F;02&#x2F;01&#x2F;what-color-is-your-function&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;journal.stuffwithstuff.com&#x2F;2015&#x2F;02&#x2F;01&#x2F;what-color-is-y...</a><p>With Twisted, you need to swap out certain network calls with Twisted&#x27;s own APIs to use its full feature set, but it has an easy way to defer existing synchronous&#x2F;blocking code: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twistedmatrix.com&#x2F;documents&#x2F;12.2.0&#x2F;core&#x2F;howto&#x2F;gendefer.html#auto5" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twistedmatrix.com&#x2F;documents&#x2F;12.2.0&#x2F;core&#x2F;howto&#x2F;gendef...</a> There&#x27;s no way to do something like this with async&#x2F;await, besides some hacky third-party attempts, as far as I know.<p>But, yes, I&#x27;m not a huge fan of Twisted&#x27;s model, either. I was thinking more along the lines of a green thread model like gevent, which, although controversial, doesn&#x27;t require you to change a single line of code beyond a monkey patch line at the top of the file. I&#x27;m not really swayed by Twisted&#x27;s creator&#x27;s anti-green thread manifesto (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;glyph.twistedmatrix.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;02&#x2F;unyielding.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;glyph.twistedmatrix.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;02&#x2F;unyielding.html</a>).<p>And any language with a baked-in green thread model like Go also avoids this problem. Synchronous code can be run asynchronously, or synchronously, with no red&#x2F;blue barrier.<p>&gt;That comic is satire with many paths which don&#x27;t really exist.<p>Yes, of course it&#x27;s hyperbole, but it&#x27;s not that far off, in my opinion. Now that I use pyenv for everything I no longer run into any issues like these, but before, it could sometimes become a nightmare.<p>I love tools like pyenv and poetry and they make Python way easier to deal with (it&#x27;s still my favorite language, for sure), but part of the point of this thread is that it would be nice if universal tools like these were baked into the actual release like how Rust&#x27;s and Go&#x27;s tools are baked into theirs.<p><i>Tons</i> of people still aren&#x27;t aware that things like pyenv or poetry or Anaconda exist, or that they should consider trying them. Or they want to try them but are dissuaded due to work policy about changing things or using new third-party tools, or even any kind of third-party tools.
