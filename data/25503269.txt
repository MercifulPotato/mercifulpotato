The on-call person got a few hundred bucks extra  (taxed, but still...), and there was a budget line item for it.  It was a pretty nice token of appreciation.  The other two - one had an on-call rotation no extra bonus but an informal comp time policy if you had a bad night.  The other had nothing.  The expectation was that the two guys on the team were on-call all the time.  &quot;Oh, we&#x27;ll probably never call you.&quot;<p>Ironically, of the three, the one with the on-call bonus budget was the one where you almost never got called.')
