Item(by='carapace', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604803449, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25016815, text='&gt; There are reports of being able to predetermine when we wake before we sleep<p>FWIW I can do that.  At one point in my life I had to wake up a specific times (that varied day to day) and was using an alarm clock and I noticed I kept waking up exactly two minutes before the alarm was set to go off.  I stopped using the alarm clock but kept waking up at the right time.  It was like once I noticed I could do it I &quot;had faith&quot; that it would work and it did.<p>&gt; I assume anything related to stress, anger, or sexual responses are also consciously triggerable, given we can make ourselves stressed, angry, or horny by thinking about the right things.<p>That&#x27;s a good point, and it&#x27;s broader than you say, that is, pretty much every physiological response can be controlled through self-hypnosis, &quot;thinking about the right things&quot;.  But that&#x27;s different than the volitional control over breathing and blinking.  Every normal person can choose to control their breathing or their eyelids at will in a way that they can&#x27;t choose to control e.g their digestion or the rate of hair growth or their body temperature, etc.')
