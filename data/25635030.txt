The second one especially is a big deal because you can&#x27;t do things like team-only channels without a prohibitive amount of overhead.<p>That said (with zero knowledge of their architecture) I have to feel like both of those missing features aren&#x27;t too terribly hard to build. Its very likely Discord is growing as a business fast enough on the gaming and community spaces they don&#x27;t feel the added overhead of expanding into enterprise (read: support, SLAs, SOC, etc) makes sense and are waiting until they need a boost to play that card.')
