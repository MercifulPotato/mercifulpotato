Item(by='cocktailpeanuts', descendants=None, kids=[25363253, 25363821, 25363073], score=None, time=1607541018, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25361438, text='The &quot;is houdini ready yet?&quot; section is dishonest even though it&#x27;s factually correct. And this shows that Chrome is the new IE.<p>If you&#x27;re not careful, you may come away reading that &quot;is houdini ready yet?&quot; section thinking it&#x27;s mostly supported by most browsers except for some laggards like Webkit and Firefox. Except that, if you exclude those two, the rest of the browsers displayed in the chart are basically Chrome forks.<p>Normally in the past, something like this would have been packaged as some &quot;Google experiment&quot;, but now their &quot;blink engine&quot; trojan horse has penetrated other browser vendors, they are using that to paint a misleading picture to push their agenda.<p>Just to be clear, sure this technology is cool, but this is defacto &quot;Google chrome experiment&quot;, not a web standard supported by various independent browsers. It&#x27;s basically Chrome and other small fish browsers that depend on Chrome. Google should stop misleading the public about browser support of whatever they&#x27;re releasing. It&#x27;s dishonest.<p>On the other hand, I really think time is ripe for the next disruption of web browsers.')
