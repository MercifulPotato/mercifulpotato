I agree that some companies may be sustainable while having net zero growth, as you stated. I disagree that these companies do absolutely nothing to attempt to grow their businesses and don&#x27;t even think about growth. At minimum, these net zero growth companies must at least grow enough to offset their losses at a sustainable pace. That means these companies do have to participate in traditional growth activities.<p>Specifically, I&#x27;m responding to:<p>&gt; I&#x27;m kind of scared that people can&#x27;t even imagine this is a possibility to be honest...<p>From the outside looking in, a net zero growth company appears to be living happily as you stated, but I don&#x27;t think this reflects reality on closer inspection. All net zero growth businesses exist in a dynamic equilibrium in which they&#x27;re constantly facing losses and constantly finding ways to grow to (at minimum) offset those losses. And these are just considerations for your own business. What about the competition? If your competitor is willing to build a net positive growth company, what are your odds of survival in the long-term?')
