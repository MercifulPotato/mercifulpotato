It will take an awful lot of hard and determined work for us to ever make Earth less hospitable than Mars. Similarly it will take centuries of hard and determined work to ever make Mars as good as the worst possible Earth. Short of a full on nuclear war (small, but nevertheless non-zero probability) we&#x27;re better off improving what we&#x27;ve got.<p>Note, I&#x27;m only addressing the &quot;lifeboat&quot; justification, I still think sending folks to Mars would be cool as hell.')
