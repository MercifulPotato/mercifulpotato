One&#x27;s an all-in-one, the other is a large format photo printer. It&#x27;s been so long since I&#x27;ve used either that the ink is probably dried up.<p>On the other hand, I have a cheap laser printer and it just works. I don&#x27;t print a <i>lot</i>. I&#x27;ve gotten out of the habit of printing and filing most things and just keep a PDF. But there&#x27;s still a bunch of random stuff: recipes, trail maps, various things I do need to send as physical copies, etc. I don&#x27;t <i>need</i> to print it all and could take 30 minutes to print the things I do need at Staples or wherever, but I have a home office and it&#x27;s a lot easier to just print out a few pages every now and then.')
