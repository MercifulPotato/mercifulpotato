The article says:<p>&gt; <i>In the same vein as the Reports, you can see at a glance what links to what. It&#x27;s a lot like the call chart in a software development IDE.</i><p>I read it and I have to ask... which IDE shows nice call charts like that? I&#x27;ve worked with a bunch of those (every Java IDE, C++ in old and new Visual Studio), and there&#x27;s dearth of any kind of visual representation of anything in general, call graphs in particular. I can sometimes make Visual Studio to begrudgingly show me the static call graph as two trees (one for &quot;who calls me&quot;, and other for &quot;who is called by me&quot;), but on a moderately-sized codebase this essentially hangs the IDE.<p>It&#x27;s obvious that codebase exploration features would be nice to have. But where are they all hidden? In Enterprise editions of IDEs?')
