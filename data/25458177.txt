Counting IP addresses is an old-school method that was used before the modern age of JavaScript snippets and tracking cookies.<p>&gt; Since IP addresses are considered personal data under GDPR, we anonymize them using a one-way cryptographic hash function. This generates a random string of letters and numbers that is used to calculate unique visitor numbers for the day. Old salts are deleted to avoid the possibility of linking visitor information from one day to the next. We never store IP addresses in our database or logs.<p>...<p>&gt; In our testing, using IP addresses to count visitors is remarkably accurate when compared to using a cookie. Total unique visitor counts were within 10% error range with IP-based counting usually showing lower numbers.<p>From here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;plausible.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;google-analytics-cookies#can-you-get-web-analytics-without-cookies" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;plausible.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;google-analytics-cookies#can-you-g...</a>')
