I certainly wouldn&#x27;t be happy if say the Nazis Germany or the stasi were spying in india. Your response is very similar to &quot;I&#x27;ve got nothing to hide&quot; argument for government spying.<p>Second, just because lalamove didn&#x27;t do anything ontoward for you, doesn&#x27;t mean that chinese companies don&#x27;t spy on anyone. Maybe you should look at the rich history of china&#x27;s industrial espionage, or how US and Soviet Russia spied on each other during the cold war.<p>Third, this is part of a economic and trade war against china. Maybe you should read about how an authoritarian state works, and how subjugated people get treated by oppressors. Go look at tibet, taiwan, Hong Kong, uyghur, ww2 poland etc etc.<p>I&#x27;ll add a final point. I have found most such arguments made by people who hate the current indian government, which is indeed a bad one. But people are so hell bent on opposing the government that they even speak positives of entities that are against india, like china. Food for thought for you, what would your reaction be if it was the indian government doing similar things of industrial espionage, economic war, and spying. Would you say that modi was welcome to see that you ordered furniture from ikea?')
