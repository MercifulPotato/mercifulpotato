It was a ton of effort and the abstracted ORM logic didn&#x27;t actually help with this.<p>So if it doesn&#x27;t really help that much for a simple case like that, then it doesn&#x27;t seem like there&#x27;s much point in my opinion, as porting is going to be work either way (in a non-trivial application with non-trivial data access patterns, at least).')
