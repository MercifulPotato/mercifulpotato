It gives me the best UX, portability, and productivity.<p>My company’s five-year hardware refresh cycle and an industry trend towards soldered parts makes this harder. Soldering nixes ducking around the five-year cycle with upgrades. Instead, I need to ask for even more laptop. That’s harder: requests for big, new equipment are already really visible, and even bigger = even more scrutiny.<p>Option: prepare to offload a lot of work. But that has challenges versus on-laptop computation. Examples: UX&#x2F;productivity reduction. Need to manage additional, complex environments. Cloud-provider expenses. Etc.<p>Where do you see things going? If it is offloading personal workloads, what are the most viable ways of doing it?')
