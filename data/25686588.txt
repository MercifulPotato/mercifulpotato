She said, well.. you have 63 friends using it, I said... I don&#x27;t have 63 friends! She then proceeded to send me a screenshot with a list of her contacts not on ClubHouse that shows how many of their contacts are on it. I don&#x27;t know why this bothered me so much, but for whatever reason it did.')
