If your property is worth more than $0 you should add it to your net worth.<p>Potentially the same with your credit card debt. For example if you bought 100 guitars worth $1,000 each, you might have $100,000 in debt, but also $100,000 in assets, assuming somebody would pay you what you paid for them.<p>Of course, if you spent the $100,000 on restaurants and vacations, they are not likely to be worth anything to anybody  other than you.<p>Not judging here. Just demonstrating the power of buying assets.')
