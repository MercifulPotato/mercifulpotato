Character creation in DCC take about 5 minutes, if that. 6x3d6, assign to stats in order, roll on a few more tables, spend your starting coin, ok let&#x27;s go. It got several people over their hatred&#x2F;fear of PC death even in our non-DCC games. I&#x27;m starting up a Call of Cthulhu game (which is very rough on PC health, both physical and mental) and there&#x27;s more effort needed to create characters and <i>much</i> more invested in each character, but now that their fear is gone the game should be more enjoyable. Even with the possibility of characters disappearing in the night or losing their minds and becoming useless.')
