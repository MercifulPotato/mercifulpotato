I think it&#x27;s like you say, the mindset. If you purchase something because you want something that&#x27;s &quot;nicer than everyone else&#x27;s&quot;, you&#x27;ll be unhappy. You&#x27;re inherently fighting a losing battle. Not only that but a petty battle.<p>If you instead, similar to how you describe, <i>invest</i> in something that you want to hold onto for a long time, that&#x27;s a much better proposition. I have one expensive pair of boots. But I <i>love</i> them. I&#x27;ve had them for years. I treat the leather and polish them fairly frequently. I get them resoled. I expect they&#x27;ll last me the rest of my life. Couldn&#x27;t be happier with the purchase.')
