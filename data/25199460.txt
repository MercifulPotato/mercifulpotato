Sure, it can be done, but it&#x27;s a lot easier and a lot more efficient to start with a non-salty body of water.<p>Stopping carbon emissions is a lot more important in the short term.<p>Long term, I can see carbon capture being used as an alternative to push for a carbon neutral or negative economy.  We&#x27;ll likely need captured carbon for shipping, airplane travel, and plastics.<p>A positive of carbon capture is that you can pretty much set it up anywhere. You may be able to setup a capture facility at major fuel hubs to cut down on transport costs.')
