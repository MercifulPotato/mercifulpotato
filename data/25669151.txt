From a practical point of view, &quot;holding him accountable&quot; requires a group of politically-minded people to agree that he has committed a crime for which he needs to be held accountable.<p>Let&#x27;s say, for the sake of the argument, that there is indeed a law that he has broken. If the people with the power to punish him for it decide not to do it, then whether he actually committed a crime or not is a moot point.
