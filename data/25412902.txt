No support for higher video modes. Buggy.<p>So I got a USB switch and that worked well for a while with multiple monitors (Dell) that you could assign shortcut keys to the buttons to switch inputs with 2 presses.<p>Now I have a curved Dell and it has a built-in USB switch that works really well that you can assign to inputs. It&#x27;s a bit slow, switching USB takes as long as it does to switch video inputs, but it appears to be rock solid.<p>The other features, side-by-side and PiP are kind of a joke.')
