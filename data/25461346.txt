Two different things.<p>No, because when you refer to actual people, you still need to use a gendered noun. The issue is which gendered nouns to use, and different language have different rules about it.<p>In German, for example, one just like in Spanish needs to match the gender of the adjective to the gender of the noun. However, unlike in Spanish, German doesn&#x27;t really have gender distinction in plural, and you  generally use the same form to refer to group of people regardless of whether it comprises of only males, only females, or whether it&#x27;s mixed.<p>Spanish, however, has gendered plural, and it also has a rule that whenever one refers to a group of people, one uses female gender noun <i>only if the group comprises of only females</i>. Whenever the group is fully male <i>or mixed</i>, one uses masculine form of the noun. So, a group of Latino men is &quot;latinos&quot;, a group of  Latino women is &quot;latinas&quot;, but the mixed group of Latino men and women is actually &quot;latinos&quot; again. To add to that, the masculine plural version of the word &quot;latinoamericano&quot; is &quot;latinoamericani&quot;, but the feminine version is &quot;latinoamericanas&quot;, and not &quot;latinaamericanas&quot; (this is a compound word, and not an adjective-noun pair, hence the &quot;latino&quot; doesn&#x27;t get declensed to &quot;latina&quot;)<p>In short, any time you refer to group of Latin Americans in Spanish that doesn&#x27;t happen to be all female, you&#x27;ll always be saying &quot;latino&quot;, and never &quot;latina&quot;. Hence, the word &quot;latinx&quot; is solving a nonexistent problem, same as the word &quot;Americanxs&quot; would in English.')
