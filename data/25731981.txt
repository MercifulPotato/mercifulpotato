Was cracked both times by me :)<p>Disagree that hardening the API server is any better. This is the approach common in the US market, and my team has broken everything available there too. Also disagree with insinuations that these banks don&#x27;t have good, modern stacks. Barclays in particular is great. Way better than any challenger bank.<p>Lloyds also took a similar approach to Barclays but they did a better job than Barclays did (although Barclays did a great job themselves too) and so we never got around to finishing it before we pivoted to the US market. As far as I know it&#x27;s still unbroken, although I&#x27;m pretty sure my colleagues could easily break it today. We&#x27;ve since developed far more sophisticated reversing techniques.')
