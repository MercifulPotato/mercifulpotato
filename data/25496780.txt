They&#x27;re the rich kids. And if you think &quot;income sharing&quot; and the private sector will drive rates down from a federally-subsidized (&quot;predatory&quot;) rate, well, I don&#x27;t know what to say.<p>I certainly don&#x27;t think burying underprivileged students under a mountain of debt at graduation is a good thing. I&#x27;d very much like to see costs come way down, and I do agree that doing something about the loan system is a piece of the puzzle. But the reason the underprivileged are taking on this debt is that they&#x27;re attempting to move up, in a way that avoiding debt by avoiding higher education will never achieve. Unfortunately, higher education has become the only way to hang on to an otherwise-falling standard of living; wage stagnation <i>despite</i> increasing education level.')
