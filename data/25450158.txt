So far the best anyone has come up with for an attack on the SHA-1 in PGP is the mostly impractical Shambles attack on the PGP web of trust. This has been fixed in the implementations. When and if someone can demonstrate a practical attack using SHA-1 then more measures will be taken. This stuff is a little more complicated than just identifying particular hash methods in the list of features. This sort of thing is inherent in a long term encryption standard. You can&#x27;t just randomly break things because you have a bad feeling about something.<p>&gt;...but PGP&#x27;s public identifiers are paired with secret keys.<p>In exactly the same way that, say, signal links its long term private identity key to public identifiers (your phone number). The problem is inherent in using public key cryptography for messaging. Most PGP implementations identify where that private key is kept and allow the user to protect it with a strong passphrase. That is opposed to how Signal depends on whatever security the device can provide to a key hidden somewhere on the device.')
