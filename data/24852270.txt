Countless physical therapy and deep tissue massages helped alleviate the pain but nothing seems to solve the root cause. I am 26 and the thought of not being able to use my hands to do something I have frightened the hell out of me.<p>That&#x27;s when I stumbled upon John Sarno and his book &quot;The mindbody prescription&quot;. I thought it&#x27;s pseudoscience and I read it with very low expectations. And It&#x27;s been almost four months since I have trouble using my computer.<p>In a nutshell, most of RSI injuries are not just physical problems and they are tightly coupled with your mind. The most important step is to acknowledge that subconscious thoughts related to pain and work along with it. Whenever I feel a tingling sensation, I yell at myself ( In my head ) that it&#x27;s all in my mind and I have started to feel normal. Of course, this might not work for everyone but definitely worth a try.<p>And I also do lot of strength training and climbing which really helped strengthening my hands')
