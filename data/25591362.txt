Progressive Web Apps are supported on Firefox mobile, on android at least.<p>The real issue people should be discussing is Apple not supporting PWAs, or in fact, any browser engine other than Safari on iPhones. It&#x27;s the real blocker to wider adoption of PWAs (and many other features!)<p>Until that happens, whether Firefox desktop &#x2F; other platforms support this specific behaviour (Single-Site Browser) is a bit moot as it&#x27;s an edge case compared to 50% of mobile users.')
