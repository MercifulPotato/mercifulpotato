Item(by='nendroid', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604162449, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24950465, text='&gt;My flawed argument was based on India and China sharing a land border and that shared genetic markers are found on both sides of it.<p>This is not flawed reasoning. Despite Indians and Chinese people possessing unique genetic markers, people in India and China do still share genetic markers from earlier haplogroups. If you go far enough back into human ancestry we can find a markers arising out of Africa that all humans in Asia and Europe share.<p>&gt;I’m not sure there’s any need to cheapen your point by making personal attacks.<p>It&#x27;s not a personal attack. I assume your conclusions are irrationally influenced by the current &quot;woke&quot; trend that&#x27;s taking over America today. I say this because my conclusion can be arrived at trivially with zero technical jargon.<p>The same conclusion can be derived from just looking at people. The similarity in facial features between Indians and Europeans and the marked contrast between Chinese and Indians makes my expose into the genetics quite unnecessarily pedantic. It hinders conversation by forcing me to go into details in order to state the obvious.<p>Correct conclusions can be arrived at in significantly less time if people utilized a combination of common sense and scientific evidence where it is deemed necessary. If I didn&#x27;t choose to troll this thread with a mile long document of terminal evidence then very likely this conversation would have ended without a real conclusion despite the obvious fact that Indians and Chinese look different enough to be classified as following different branches in the ancestral tree.')
