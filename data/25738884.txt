There is also no direct evidence that they did not.  However, it is extremely unlikely that none of them use it.<p>The people who planned the Jan 6 coup attempt used Parler.  So the only way this happens is if they spend months planning the assault but then don&#x27;t show up for it and a completely different set of people just happen to follow the plan by accident.  This includes stuff like preparing and bringing molotov cocktails, pipe bombs, handcuffs, and flying across the country to participate.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npr.org&#x2F;sections&#x2F;congress-electoral-college-tally-live-updates&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;07&#x2F;954671745&#x2F;on-far-right-websites-plans-to-storm-capitol-were-made-in-plain-sight" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npr.org&#x2F;sections&#x2F;congress-electoral-college-tall...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.propublica.org&#x2F;article&#x2F;capitol-rioters-planned-for-weeks-in-plain-sight-the-police-werent-ready" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.propublica.org&#x2F;article&#x2F;capitol-rioters-planned-f...</a>')
