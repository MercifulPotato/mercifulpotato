Item(by='weare138', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606801748, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25260981, text='This entire thing is a hot mess.<p><i>and 75 hashed passwords available in TOR nodes:</i><p>What does this technobabble even mean?<p><i>Dominionvoting is also dominionvotingsystems.com</i><p>The anonymous author uses a screenshot from the Way Back Machine from 2011 to connect the 2 domains. There&#x27;s one massive problem with this assertion. The current dominionvotingsystems.com domain was registered on 5&#x2F;28&#x2F;2020:<p><i>Domain Name: dominionvotingsystems.com<p>Registry Domain ID: 2530599738_DOMAIN_COM-VRSN<p>Registrar WHOIS Server: whois.godaddy.com<p>Registrar URL: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.godaddy.com" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.godaddy.com</a><p>Updated Date: 2020-05-26T15:48:58Z<p>Creation Date: 2020-05-26T15:48:57Z</i><p>The anonymous author makes no effort to explain this obvious and glaring discrepancy. The entire basis for what ever it is he&#x27;s alleging hinges on this connection. The rest of the information presented it spurious, irrelevant and relies on broad, completely unsubstantiated assumptions. For example:<p><i>A search of the indivisible.org network showed a subdomain which evidences the existence of scorecard software in use as part of the Indivisible (formerly ACORN) political group for Obama</i><p>Wow, got all that from a subdomain? That&#x27;s his &#x27;evidence&#x27;? To top it off he never even tries to explain what this Scorecard software has to do with anything.<p><i>This Dominion partner domain “dvscorp”</i><p>This entire connection is based on the fact they&#x27;re hosted by the same ISP but again never explains what it had to do with anything other than there&#x27;s a Chinese domain with the same name? Again like every other reference never explains how it connects to anything else.<p>The author is going in 20 directions at once but never gets anywhere. Hell <i>who is this person</i>? Since when can you present an anonymous affidavit and declare yourself an &#x27;expert&#x27; without presenting any credentials? This is pure insanity. If you believe this I have a bridge in New York for sale. Contact me for details.')
