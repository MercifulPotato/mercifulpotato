Item(by='throwaway894345', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602769300, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24785957, text='I don’t think the problem is so much social media, but the polarization of our epistemological institutions, which erodes trust in them and rightfully so—we now have to take our academic information with a particularly large grain of salt, accounting for the aligned interests of the media and certain departments in the academy. However, many go too far, moving from skepticism to positions which can’t be supported by the evidence. They throw the baby out with the bath water. The only solution in my mind is to restore heterodoxy to these epistemological institutions, so people of all stripes can trust them. I know this kind of comment draws out bad faith arguments like a moth to flame (“...biased against reality”), so I hope we can dispense with that and focus on solutions.')
