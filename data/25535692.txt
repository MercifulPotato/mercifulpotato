I went through it some years ago.  I don&#x27;t claim to be the world&#x27;s greatest programmer, but I&#x27;ve been around for a while and am good by most standards.  The interview was fairly tough and the interviewer himself was technically strong and knowledgeable.  I don&#x27;t think anyone who didn&#x27;t know what they were doing could have gotten through it.  I passed, but friends of mine who weren&#x27;t slouches didn&#x27;t make it through the online screening.')
