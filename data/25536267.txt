Even the standard 1940s mainstream Keynes doctrine is quite clear on the no hyper-inflation scenario - additional money supply will <i>not</i> result in excess inflation unless the economy is at full employment. And by full employment, it doesn&#x27;t mean the headline unemployment rate of ~5% quoted in media. It means high labor force participation rates (currently at historical lows), low underemployment (currently at historical highs) and low unemployment rate. The fact we see persistently low inflation rates throughout the developed world for decades is intimately tied to these stats.<p>By finally having time to read Keynes directly from his own works, it&#x27;s amazing how prescient the man was. Sans the dandy early 20th century English, these quotes are just as applicable today as they were in 1930s:<p>&gt; <i>...the richer the community, the wider will tend to be the gap between its actual and its potential production; and therefore the more obvious and outrageous the defects of the economic system.</i><p>&gt; [on classical economics] <i>That it reached conclusions quite different from what the ordinary uninstructed person would expect, added to its intellectual prestige. That its teaching, translated into practice, was austere and often unpalatable, lent it virtue. [...] That it could explain much social injustice and apparent cruelty as an inevitable incident in the scheme of progress [...] commended it to authority.</i><p>&gt; <i>professional economists, after Malthus, were apparently unmoved by the lack of correspondence between the results of their theory and the facts of observation;— a discrepancy which the ordinary man has not failed to observe</i>')
