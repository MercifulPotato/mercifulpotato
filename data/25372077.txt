Fresh water isn&#x27;t distributed equally across the globe. That&#x27;s exactly what makes it a scarce commodity.<p>&gt; If this all becomes and open market, tons of wasteful crops like almonds will get wiped out way before drinking water is a noticeable expense<p>As long as those almonds can be exported to profitable global markets, almond producers will be able to afford pumping up water &#x2F; buying up water supplies, causing water related problems locally.')
