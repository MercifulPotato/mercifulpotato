Main individual goal: to be elected for either a city, state or federal mandate. The more turns you play, the more your chances increase of climbing the political ladder up to the presidency. Corruption, ethics and media layers add the complexity to the game.<p>Hey, congrats for your decision to leave the startup and starting your own thing. That&#x27;s the most important aspect here.')
