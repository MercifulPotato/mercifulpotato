I am a deep specialist in databases and a good generalist in most other areas. I built myself as a T-shaped developer. I have worked databases, back-end, front-end (web and native, mobile and desktop) and testing throughout my time. With databases, I have experience with everything from relational algebra theory (I studied C.J. Date) to database design and normalisation to query, procedure and index optimisation. Throughout my career, I have developed a systemic viewpoint and an ability to understand how different components of a project and different teams interact together, all in order to walk the path of technical leadership. As a true engineer, I understand the importance of measuring before changing.\nAlso, I am a sociable person and I have a teaching degree and have taught on numerous occasions with excellent results.<p>Due to my experience, I am currently aiming for a software architect&#x2F;engineering manager&#x2F;team lead role, or a role with growth opportunities toward a similar tech leadership position, a position in which I can grow and polish the skills of colleagues. From a tech stack POV, I am most excited by opportunities to work in Rust and opportunities to work on free open-source software.
