Nobody knows if that will continue to be the case. The MRNA vaccines are targeting the spike protein, which is what gives it many of it&#x27;s infectious properties. If it does mutate to change or eliminate that spike, we might get lucky and those strains won&#x27;t be as serious, but nobody can predict the future.')
