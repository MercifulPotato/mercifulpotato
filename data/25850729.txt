I&#x27;ll forward to some people I know who had several problems with that. The last one I talked with worked with a company in the U.K. with the restriction the &quot;worker&quot; had to have a bank account in their country of residence, not in any other country. Explanations on exchange rates below. They know more about this, and know more people in that situation.<p>&gt;<i>We’ve also been looking at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pilot.co&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pilot.co&#x2F;</a> <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.boundlesshq.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.boundlesshq.com&#x2F;</a> and <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.letsdeel.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.letsdeel.com&#x2F;</a>. Are you familiar with those?</i><p>Unfortunately, no.<p>What I also meant by payment problems is the disparity between the conversion rates in banks and on the streets. The disparity can be huge, so if you wire X euros to someone&#x27;s bank account, it is automatically converted to the local currency at rate X and they get Y, when they could get 1.6Y or 1.7Y (60% or 70%) more on the streets. A 70% delta is a lot.<p>Some networks have developed to enable people to get the full &quot;street value&quot; of their money.<p>&gt;<i>When we call it “the Middle East and North Africa,” we also get feedback that it’s inaccurate.</i><p>Well, as someone in Algeria, if I were looking for work and visited the site and it said: &quot;You&#x27;re in North Africa&quot;, that&#x27;s a fact of geography. It said &quot;Hire the best Arab software engineers&quot;, I&#x27;ll think &quot;I&#x27;ll forward the link to Arab software engineers I know since they&#x27;re specific&quot;.<p>There are a lot of competitions, hackathons, or events that use this terminology, and I know many very talented people who do not participate because it&#x27;s not for them. They&#x27;d rather go to another continent, and they do, where their ethnicity is acknowledged than submit a form that contains an inaccuracy that perpetuates a denial they&#x27;ve been facing for a long time. You are trying to optimize for brevity and clarity and you have to put <i>something</i> on the page, and I get that. I&#x27;m just saying and I think that you have lived through enough exclusion and non representativity that you understand that a message on a landing page that excludes you defacto kind of stings.<p>&gt;<i>PS: My co-founder Iliana has spent lots of time in Morocco and some in Algeria… and can’t wait to go back! She speaks some darija… and picked up a few words of Berber. :)</i><p>Well, I don&#x27;t need to tell you that you are welcome. Hit me up if you are around. You might find the students groups to be interesting. In the meantime, I&#x27;ll float the site around.<p>EDIT0: I sent it to someone who has a group. They sent the following:<p>&gt; Them: Too bad, I&#x27;m an infrastructure engineer.<p>They&#x27;re specialized in &quot;Microsoft, VMware, IT infrastructures, etc.&quot;<p>EDIT1: Sent it to the admin of a group of around 7.4K engineers and technicians (not just software). Some might be interested and share it to their networks.')
