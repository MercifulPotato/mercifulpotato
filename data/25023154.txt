Though a “more honest” ranking would be President &gt; US Senator &gt; VP (since they only ever vote in ties in the senate or sit around until the sitting President can’t serve.)<p>But if you read the constitution of the US, it’s more like SCOTUS &gt; House Speaker &gt; President &gt; Senate leader &gt; US Senator &gt;&gt; US House Rep. And then there’s the state governments. The ranking of the House Speaker is because that person actually has the power of the pen and can in large part dictate what happens. The genius move is all the rules and political factors make being the House Speaker essentially destroy a politicians political clout, standing - everything. The oddball is that you don’t have to be an elected official to be voted in as House Speaker - you just have to get a majority support in the House and not be otherwise disqualified (I.e. no former 2-term Presidents).')
