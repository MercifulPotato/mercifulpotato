I&#x27;m nowhere ready for a job. Now I have to find an education elsewhere and probably teach myself because now I don&#x27;t trust bootcamps.<p>Also, I will have to pay it back...because I will get a job in tech and I will make at least 50k within 5 years. I&#x27;m not going to let the disappointment of Lambda stop me from doing so. It sucks that I will have to pay them even though they won&#x27;t be the reason I get there and despite their misleading me and other students as to what their program contained.&quot;<p>Similar to the people getting hired at Google, Twilio, it&#x27;s because they took the Bootcamp and a ton of self-study. The ton factor becomes lower if you go to a brick university that forces challenging material and theory.')
