Anything that can be milked for money would be done. Reducing control&#x2F;choice(freedom) of consumer will always lead to more power for the vendor leading to more potentials for money and so it will be done. An individual consumer was always be in such a power imbalance and now with the trillion or 100s of billions of dollar companies on one side the balance is ultra skewed. You have regulation as a potential recourse but then the political systems are also controlled by money and they themselves love the lack of freedom leading to more political control. And perhaps the most critical is how the social media and media is encouraging an unthinking herd mentality that is making any change in the status quo all the harder.')
