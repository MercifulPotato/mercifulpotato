Item(by='0xbadcafebee', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607907107, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25411598, text='&gt; as a community we desperately need a fully open source FPGA-based ultra simple firewall appliance<p>Firewalls are sort of an anti-pattern. The idea of firewalls to most people is &quot;let&#x27;s make sure they can&#x27;t get past this one network control and then we can stop thinking about security.&quot; But we&#x27;ve known for a long time that defense-in-depth is the only real black-box security strategy. Yes, it would be nice if we could get high-performance packet inspection and analytics for cheap, but by itself it&#x27;s next to useless.<p>More than a &quot;firewall&quot; we need 1) federated authentication+authorization protocols to stick in between the network and application-layer protocols (these basically exist but nobody uses them, so it&#x27;s time to make something trendy), 2) a standard for ephemeral credentials tied to identities (tied to #1), 3) a standard for supply chain verification in modern technology stacks along with a simple way to certify they&#x27;ve been followed. This ensures better integrity of network boundaries (authn+z rather than network security) and that the software along the way is secure against supply-chain attacks.<p>I don&#x27;t know if #3 is even possible, but theoretically it is. Just maybe not with any network we have today.')
