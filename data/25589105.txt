Although at the same time I see a lot of people in mid-level management &#x2F; senior positions, making quite good money, and working parttime. But I guess you have to get there first.<p>I also feel it&#x27;d be looked down upon when I (30) would do it. If I was say 53, or say I had kids, it&#x27;d be much more normal. But if you&#x27;re taking time off without kids at 30, you&#x27;re really kind of signalling you value leisure more than work and more than money. That&#x27;s a very normal thing of course, but for a corporate environment looking to execute on a long list of deliverables, they&#x27;ll not be keen to put their trust in such a person to drive that process.')
