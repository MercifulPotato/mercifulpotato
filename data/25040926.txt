Exactly.<p>&gt; That is not what I want as a consumer.<p>Okay. Don&#x27;t use it then.<p>&gt; I want [magic beans].<p>Good for you. I want Heather Graham as my wife.<p>More seriously, what you want doesn&#x27;t exist yet. Not in a useful way at least.<p>Maybe go <i>build it yourself</i> if it&#x27;s something you really want.<p>Or maybe accept the fact that security <i>is not an absolute</i>, it inherently comes with tradeoffs.<p>Like life, really.<p>&gt; The comparison with email is apt, because no one in their right mind would design email as it is today without E2E encryption baked into the protocol.<p>Have you ever worked at a company where they were legally required to do audits or handle large financial transactions?<p>Cos baked in E2E encryption would make detecting malicious employees (defrauding clients etc) <i>really</i> difficult to do, and prosecuting them nigh on impossible.<p>Like I said, security comes with tradeoffs.<p>Golden rule of security: <i>it can&#x27;t be 100% secure and usable</i>.<p>The one time pad is a classic case of this golden rule.')
