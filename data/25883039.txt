I know next to nothing about physical servers, but I&#x27;ve had great success swapping HDDs for SSDs in laptops to dramatically increase Windows&#x27; modern UI&#x27;s performance. Our R720 has HDDs instead of SSDs, I&#x27;ve thought of upgrading them to see how it works out.<p>If you ever find a solution, please let me know.')
