I want to add, you also sometimes see spontaneous remission of distant lesions caused by local treatment, e.g. radiation therapy. There is research into exacerbating the tumor &quot;auto-vaccination&quot; by pretreating the lesion with immuno-stimulants.<p>Btw. &#x27;full remission&#x27; doesn&#x27;t mean cured, but clinical clearance or stagnation. Immune reactions may be limited to a major branch on the individual tree of lif.. death and other subclinical branches may emerge years later.<p>There are other cancers which may feature very high tissue differentiation&#x2F;maturation (early) and are dependent on a certain trigger. E.g. treating heliobacter pylori or chlamydia with antibiotics, may cause full remission in MALT lymphoma.')
