Item(by='mrkeen', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604174215, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24951841, text='&gt; Can databases be efficiently implemented without shared access?<p>Let me ask a different question: Why did databases take off in the way they did?  Sure they persist stuff to disk, but so do files.  What they offer is a concurrency model so good that you almost never think about it.  Beginner programmers can competently write large, concurrent systems by writing single-threaded programs which are backed by a central DB, without even knowing the term &quot;race condition&quot;.<p>If beginner database articles told users how to make database Threads, Thread groups, and how to signal and catch interruptions, I don&#x27;t think databases would have enjoyed nearly as much popularity.<p>While Threads are fundamental to Java concurrency, I kinda agree with yetkin&#x27;s point.  It introduces the Thread footgun without even paying lip service to the problems of shared, mutable state.')
