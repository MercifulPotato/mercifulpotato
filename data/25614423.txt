It&#x27;s also a little bit lower pressure since the idea is for me to accomplish the amount of work I want to accomplish rather than to fill up a certain amount of time, so with the new system the success metric is a bit more pared down. But I agree that &quot;one goal a day + time tracking&quot; doing essentially the same thing I have written in the post.')
