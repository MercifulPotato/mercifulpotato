Or when a politician says something dumb, that&#x27;s obviously untrue or a distortion, you just laughed and said &quot;what an idiot&quot;.<p>Today, these things are &quot;disinformation&quot; and are &quot;an attack on our democracy&quot;. This is a severe escalation, and I think what it&#x27;s priming us all to do is reject Free Speech as a principle wholesale and replace it with an &quot;official&quot; narrative that is approved ahead of time (approved by who exactly, that remains to be seen).<p>All politicians spread &quot;disinformation&quot;. That&#x27;s the nature of politics: framing the facts of a story, or distorting them, to support your preferred narrative to get elected. Same goes for all partisan journalism, and the same goes for &quot;mainstream&quot; outlets that still have their own narrative they like to push for their own reasons. Somehow we&#x27;re still so shell-shocked from 2016 that we&#x27;ve escalated every little bit of political tomfoolery to be a literal attack on the democratic institution itself. It&#x27;s just bizarre.')
