There&#x27;s something endearing about the rather academic, literal versions but having since read others and seen the value of a good translator, I wish I could go back and read them for the first time understanding in something approaching the fluidity and tone of the originals.<p>Another thing, you know something is a classic when you can sell the same book for a century and still never find a cheap copy anywhere! I feel like I never see Loebs below $10 unless they&#x27;re trashed and noted up.')
