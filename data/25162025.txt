More in-depth analysis of how VkFFT and cuFFT scales with memory clocks and bandwidth can be found here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;nvidia&#x2F;comments&#x2F;jxlbjs&#x2F;rtx_3090_overclocking_benchmark_vulkan_and_cuda&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;nvidia&#x2F;comments&#x2F;jxlbjs&#x2F;rtx_3090_ove...</a><p>I don&#x27;t know exactly what cuFFT does differently, but I am fairly certain they use very similar memory layout and algorithms behind their code (judging by execution times only).<p>What should be the main take from this is that Vulkan allows for similar in performance low-level memory control, while being cross platform and open source. I don&#x27;t think that SPIR-V is more expressive - bet Nvidia wouldn&#x27;t allow this. But it doesn&#x27;t prohibit it from still being good.')
