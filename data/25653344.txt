In these cases you usually have a bunch of management and logic tasks which are better suited to a CPU (basically anything with a large number of different serial steps and complex control flow will probably synthesize poorly directly to an FPGA: this is probably what the authors described as &#x27;too complex for dedicated hardware&#x27;), so you synthesize a CPU in the FPGA fabric which usually has a direct memory map to whatever registers you need in the FPGA design to accomplish your goals. This is common enough basically every FPGA vendor also sells FPGA SOCs which have a hard CPU attached to the fabric, and if you are using one of those then you will generally not synthesize a CPU in the fabric because it&#x27;ll usually be slower and less power efficient than the hard CPU you have. But that CPU also isn&#x27;t free and if your CPU compute requirements are not particularly high than the soft CPU might be more efficient for your usecare (or a hard CPU may not be an option in the range you need).')
