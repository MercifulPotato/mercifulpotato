I have enjoyed reading through these comments but I can&#x27;t consider my own &#x27;what could have been&#x27; without considering that which is outside of my self, namely God.  My own beliefs do not see this life as the end. Therefore my present actions are shaped by my future hopes. I hope some day to be rewarded by God for my actions today. This seems more important to me than thinking about how my past actions may have made me more successful today. Many of the great moments in history were defined by men and woman giving up their lives for what they hoped for in the future. Not what they hoped would have happened in the past.')
