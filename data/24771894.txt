We&#x27;re an iPhone&#x2F;iPad&#x2F;Mac&#x2F;Apple TV family, but the Nest Hub Max has become a really great part of our lives.  When combined with the Nest Hello, we get video of the front door in the kitchen when the doorbell rings, and the Google Homes in the bathrooms also notify us.  We have a couple HomePods that we tried to use, but there&#x27;s no doorbell integration we could find, and believe it or not, I really like having a photo display and visual cues when we interact with the kitchen device.  I would spend the money to transition to an Apple smart display&#x2F;doorbell and these HomePods, but they have stubbornly refused to produce the product so many others are selling.  I just don&#x27;t get it.')
