You want to ask someone to solve practical technical tasks that are relevant to the job they are applying for. For an entry level job this may be a programming task (build this one screen). For a more senior position you&#x27;d want to ask about things like architecture and practical trade-offs. You could use a whiteboard for this: I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s whiteboards people object to. It&#x27;s the irrelevant algorithmic questions.')
