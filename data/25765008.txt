Oh, sorry honey, I uhh... gotta do this thing at work. Darn it!&quot;<p>One phenomenon I&#x27;ve always noticed about workaholics is that they THINK they are being more productive, but often times they are just spending more time spinning their wheels. Also the effect it has on their mood&#x2F;interpersonal skills, and the pressure it puts on the rest of the team cancels it out. Seriously, one rude comment in the morning can throw a developer off for the rest of the day, it&#x27;s not worth it.<p>&quot;Man what&#x27;s up with frank today?&quot;<p>&quot;Oh he was pulling an all-nighter doing a non-urgent task.&quot;<p>&quot;Did anybody ask him to?&quot;<p>&quot;No. In fact we asked him to stop.&quot;<p>I consider independent study, side-projects, reading a good book, smoking some dope, cooking a good meal with my partner, getting enough sleep, relaxing, and exercising(!!!!) part of my job. I don&#x27;t care what kind of mutant you THINK you are, you will perform better if you go to bed and get a full nights rest and clean your brain out. It is just science.<p>Finally, while it is true that &quot;work more = better review at work&quot;, it&#x27;s just... not worth it. If your job is your whole life and you are not making +200k: GET A LIFE. You have better things to do with your time than make some other man money. Work is a &quot;safe place.&quot; Time goes in, money comes out. But that doesn&#x27;t mean it is a healthy way to spend all of your time.')
