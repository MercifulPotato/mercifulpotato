The more I listen to the recommended music, the more of the same crap keeps getting recommended to me. Even if I skip them.<p>I remember that Spotify actually had pretty good recommendations when I first started using it at the start of this year, because I had only listened to the songs I actually liked so far. But now I&#x27;m lucky if I find one decent song out of a hundred recommended ones.')
