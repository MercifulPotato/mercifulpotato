He was of the opinion that FB was very likely listening because he had multiple occurrences where he&#x27;d visit family, and they&#x27;d talk about something, either some product that family was interested in or had just bought, and hours to a couple days later he&#x27;d see an advertisement for it.<p>My stance (which looks to be the same as yours) was that they don&#x27;t even need to listen to you, and doing so would probably be really bad if it was found out.  Instead they know who you&#x27;re around, they what that they&#x27;re interested in, and they make some educated guesses and tag you as interested in stuff they are also or that they just bought, and it&#x27;s the hits that stick in our mind, not the random other stuff you were shown that you never talked about with others but they had searched for or bought.<p>Throw enough data at he problem, you&#x27;ll get some hits.  There&#x27;s a <i>lot</i> of data out there right now.')
