Very interesting.<p>&gt;U.S. President Bill Clinton owned and wore several early models (including the original) of the watch during his time as Governor of Arkansas and in the early years of his Presidency. In one of his early Presidential photographs and at his 1993 Inaugural Ball, he is seen wearing a blue and black Ironman Triathlon. Clinton&#x27;s forgoing of a more presidential watch such as a Rolex earned him some criticism; Gene Weingarten of the Washington Post described Clinton&#x27;s timepiece derisively as “a plastic digital watch, thick as a brick and handsome as a hernia”, while Omega SA ran ads in 1992 suggesting that Clinton should give up the Timex in favor of something more expensive. Clinton stopped wearing his Ironman publicly in 1994, starting with the 50th anniversary of D-Day.[2][3] Clinton has since donated one of his early Ironman models to the Smithsonian.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Timex_Ironman" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Timex_Ironman</a>')
