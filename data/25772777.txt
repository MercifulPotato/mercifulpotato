If you mean &quot;you can&#x27;t compare or sort a list of runs by hyperparameter or minimum loss or whatever&quot; then MLFlow can certainly do that, so I think I&#x27;m misunderstanding.<p>Any comments on Losswise or W&amp;B?<p>And do you have a plan for monetization or governance?<p>Sorry for all the questions! I have complaints about all the existing solutions, so I&#x27;m excited to see a new effort.')
