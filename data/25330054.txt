Nobody wants to read a commit history and see a page-long list of &quot;fix audit&quot;, &quot;fix typo&quot;, &quot;retry ci&quot;, &quot;test: change foo&quot;, &quot;Revert: test: change foo&quot;, &quot;Revert: Revert: retry ci&quot;... That&#x27;s why you rebase into a sequence of logical, if fictional, worksteps. But if you can&#x27;t do that, squash is second-best.')
