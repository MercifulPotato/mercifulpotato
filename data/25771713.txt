Altho I don’t remember being charged with the chore of drawing it. I draw on paper for fun.<p>It’s an art that has been alive for centuries. I remember hearing from some women that they’d sing songs while drawing them and in the olden days, that was a way to learn math and counting and geometry..because girls weren’t sent to school. It is remarkable to see them being drawn.<p>It can get complicated...I follow this woman online <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;m.facebook.com&#x2F;thelotusshakti&#x2F;videos&#x2F;252912082397860&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;m.facebook.com&#x2F;thelotusshakti&#x2F;videos&#x2F;252912082397860...</a> ...I can only find a Facebook link ..the dot kolams and chikku kolams are the most challenging. Line kolams are easier.<p>To me, the most poignant part of drawing kolams at the crack of dawn was that it will be gone by dawn the next day. And we draw a new design all over again. It’s like life. It’s always possible to create something beautiful from a clean slate. And clean slates are not only easy but necessary. You wipe the old out clean only because you believe that you can not just recreate but also know that you can create something better bigger and maybe even more beautiful.')
