But your 1-in-3 choice is deducted from the 3-of-3 choices that Monty could have had, so Monty only had a 2-in-3 choice: there&#x27;s a 2&#x2F;3 chance that the car is in the pool of doors from which Monty could select. Monty has a 100% chance of choosing a door without a car. Therefore, you inherit the 2-in-3 chances if you change your selection.<p>The first door will have the car 1&#x2F;3 of the time. The second door&#x27;s chances had been expanded to the remaining 2&#x2F;3 percent thanks to Monty always choosing the last 1&#x2F;3 door which is guaranteed to not have a car.')
