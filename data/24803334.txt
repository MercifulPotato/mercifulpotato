Nim realizes <i>better</i> ergonomics than Python in some ways (UFCS, command syntax, user-defined operators) and as good performance &amp; lightweightness as C&#x2F;Rust.<p>I&#x27;m honestly surprised Nim is not the secret weapon of many start-ups.  Nim is much more &quot;open architecture&quot; instead of pushing some &quot;single, canned turn-key fits most users&quot; solutions.<p>Having a juggernaut like Google marketing&#x2F;pushing&#x2F;subsidizing something might provide false as well as true peaces of mind. :-) { Such peace is a multi-dimensional concept. :-) }')
