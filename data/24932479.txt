They typically language about what constitutes bigotry. In the OP, yes, the CoC was weaponized, but it doesn&#x27;t reflect a necessary fault in CoCs in general.<p>I don&#x27;t think pindab0ter would agree with this interpretation. @pindab0ter, if you are still following the thread, can you clarify this with a yes&#x2F;no answer: do you count the OP article as an example of CoC weaponization?<p>&gt; I&#x27;m not sure what is even meant by &quot;weaponize.&quot; Is the implication that somebody at the conference had vendetta against OP?<p>Yes.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s clear that CoCs give people more power, which is a weapon, in a sense. Would reporting someone for CoC violation for sexual misconduct at a conference be an example of weaponization?<p>Well, if you dislike someone&#x27;s political views, and then you hatch a plan to make up fraudulent sexual misconduct allegations with the hope of &quot;canceling&quot; someone, I would describe that as &quot;weaponizing&quot; the CoC. But if the allegations are genuine and without ulterior motives, then I would not use that terminology.')
