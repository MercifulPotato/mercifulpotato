Item(by='frankbreetz', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603202216, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24836422, text='&gt;&gt; an important new dataset shared exclusively with &quot;Axios on HBO.&quot;\nThis doesn&#x27;t seem trustworthy. Why not use BLS data?<p>This makes the current economic situation look better then the official Unemployment Rate.\nWhen looking at the official rate it goes from 3.6% to 7.9% When looking at the &quot;True White Unemployment Rate&quot;  it goes from about 20% to 23.6%, that seems far less severe.\nNot to mention they don&#x27;t break the Official Unemployment up by race(this is present in the official Unemployment Situation Report output by the BLS), so you can&#x27;t do an accurate comparison.  \nAll indicators can be gamed, and no single indicator paints the entire picture, but most people can&#x27;t spend a lot of time comparing different numbers, and this new indicators seem to be correlated, so what is the point? They aren&#x27;t normalized seasonally, that makes it even more confusing. They haven&#x27;t strayed too much as far as the graph goes back, so this is not a new issue. \nThe data from this article is suspect, and it gives us no new information.')
