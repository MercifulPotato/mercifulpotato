Single-channel spike-sorting is by now probably close to as good as it&#x27;s going to get given the information content of its input, and the algorithms and software to perform it are well-understood and stable.<p>Algorithmic approaches to multi-channel spike sorting, however, are the subject of active research with multiple promising avenues of progress, and software to perform it is ... well, charitably, let&#x27;s call it &quot;rough-and-ready.&quot; (It&#x27;s nearly all lab-grown software, which means it&#x27;s written by enthusiastic amateur programmers [among whom I&#x27;d count myself, no shade intended here] who soon move on to new projects because of the structure of academic science. This means the software is buggy, poorly documented, inconsistently supported, and constantly evolving.)<p>Now, using dense silicon arrays does markedly increase the rate at which I can record well-isolated neurons, but a significant part of this increase is just having more pads in the target brain region - many of the neurons I get from these multi-channel spike-sorting programs only show significant power on one or two pads.<p>And all of this doesn&#x27;t even touch on some of the significant challenges that come with using multi-electrode arrays, including higher initial inflammation, later gliosis, and data-collection and storage (a 64-channel array [NB: the NeuroPixel 1 can record from 384 pads] producing 16-bit ints at 20kHz [just about the minimum sampling rate for decent spike-sorting] generates a bit less than 10GB&#x2F;hour - a volume that real big data people might laugh at, but it sure isn&#x27;t small!).<p>And finally, all of this is done off-line. On-line spike-sorting is harder.<p>So I&#x27;m sorry to say that just having a modern multi-electrode array absolutely does not make things &quot;quite a lot simpler.&quot;')
