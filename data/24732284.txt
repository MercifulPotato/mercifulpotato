I worked on a project a while back with an early bird (~6am-2pm) and a night owl (~noon-8pm) who had to coordinate a lot of changes.  I (half-)joked that they probably would have coordinated better if one of them was in Reykjavik and the other in LA rather than try to do everything in that narrow window when both were in the office.<p>I know some remote companies have timezone-based policies (e.g., you must be within 4 timezones of NYC).  I wonder if we&#x27;ll see less focus on where the employee is and more on when they are willing to work (&quot;I don&#x27;t care that you&#x27;re in Kyev or Mumbai or Jakarta, as long as you&#x27;ll work our hours&quot;).')
