The setting and concept are great, but Joe is a pastiche and until they calm his character down he&#x27;s not very believable. He gets too much screen time and the expense of other, better characters. As you say, it&#x27;s not bad, just it hasn&#x27;t grown into itself. The last series is both excellent and poignant. The group always being just a bit too early with their ideas creates a sense of innovation but it&#x27;s also tinged with failure which I think really works.')
