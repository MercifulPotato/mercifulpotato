Many people lack morals and ethics and seek only to better themselves using their ‘power’ and some law enforcement entities are “absolutely” no different. One may believe the law enforcement as well as government is always correct and infallible yet everyone reading this at this very moment in time likely recognizes this fallacy. Each reader can likely provide their own unique individual point of proof as evidence, see my link and provide your own. In my past business endeavors I have personally witnessed a ‘fall from power’ event around someone&#x27;s pure egotistical narcissistic greed so from my personal experience I would encourage everyone to ALWAYS get it in writing and save EVERY form of communication. You NEVER know when you will need it NOR the value it will make&#x2F;save you in that future.<p>To prove my point from my words above bringing all this together in the topic at hand you may find great interest in this yt link.<p>youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Qm4LHak5WZY<p>Be honest, be kind, be true, be you! All others will be discovered.<p>Stay Healthy!')
