It&#x27;s because this really is about people&#x27;s feelings and sentiments on those topics. And those emotions range wildly from totally supportive to indifferent to deeply threatened.<p>While that&#x27;s all completely valid, voicing your emotions unfiltered on the public Internet in front of an audience of anonymous millions comes with plenty of caveats. It&#x27;s pretty  much like standing up in a crowded, public town square and ranting unfiltered about how you feel personally in no uncertain terms. Or, more insidiously, taking on an appearance of reason and rationality, trying to hide an intention of eliciting an emotional response from others that validates your own feelings.<p>Many people don&#x27;t take issue with the topic, they take issue with your behaviour. And they will show you their disapproval.<p>Free speech allows you to voice whatever is on your mind, but that doesn&#x27;t force others to listen to you or give you a platform. Democracy doesn&#x27;t imply that any and all behaviour is to be tolerated.<p>In real life, such behaviour is relegated to backroom clubs, shady bars and questionable small organizations. The Internet unavoidably hosts their digital equivalent. Moreover, as you can hide behind an anonymous handle on the Internet, move between different platforms fluidly, easily find a platform between thousands that will cater to you,... all of that from the comfort of your  couch, really lowers the bar further.<p>The danger in all of this is when all of those digitally pent up negative emotions spill over in public life and starts affecting the very underpinnings that provide security and stability to each and every member society, regardless of who they are.')
