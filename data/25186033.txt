This is demonstrably not the case though. Apple silicon seemingly trounces other phone silicon. It&#x27;s not like Arm chips are going to come to PC and perform like the M1, they&#x27;re going to come to the PC and perform like Samsung&#x27;s smart phones.<p>Yup, and it assumes that all x86-64 chips will behave like Intels obsolete architecture right after AMD has shown pretty impressive IPC improvements with Zen3 as well.<p>It&#x27;s clickbait by someone who doesn&#x27;t really understand the difference between an architecture and actual designs being built.')
