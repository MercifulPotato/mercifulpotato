And I mean truly platform agnostic, PS4, PS5, Switch, etc. Those are new platforms that may or may not have ports of whatever else is &quot;available&quot; and &quot;fast&quot;.<p>Bink fits the bill today and has fit the bill since forever. I don&#x27;t see any of the alternatives having similar performance characteristics, ease of integration or availability on platforms that are more or less closed and there&#x27;s no indication of them being open in the future.<p>In adition to that the switch cost is quite high so any other alternative has to be good, and I haven&#x27;t yet seen a contender.')
