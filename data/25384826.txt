If you extract the raw elements of a random mixture of polyethylene and polylactic acid then you only get hydrogen, carbon and some oxygen, not neatly separated polyethylene and polylactic acid. Fossil fuels are a much cheaper source for carbon and hydrogen. There is also no shortage of oxygen on this planet. Recycling a mix of two types of pure plastic is already an impossible task. Once you consider that there is actually no pure plastic on this planet because of pigmentation and additives you realize that the problem is far harder than &quot;impossible&quot;.')
