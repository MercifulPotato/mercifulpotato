Divorce wasn&#x27;t widely &quot;accepted,&quot; but it was more common than one might think. Perhaps this was because of a culture of encouraging marriage to make fulfilling needs (sexual, relationships) &quot;acceptable&quot;, and boomers had financial freedom to take the risk that it wouldn&#x27;t work out.<p>Marriage is a success multiplier. Successful people generally marry other successful people. Your monetary, behavioral, and intellectual capital double just by signing a piece of paper, given you find the right person. Plus you get significant tax benefits (on ~$300k combined income, you can save $20k-$30k per year).<p>But there&#x27;s a huge downside, too. If you get divorced, you (give or take) lose half your assets on top of attorney &amp; emotional costs. Younger generations are getting married later because they weren&#x27;t given the stability that Boomers had, and therefore can&#x27;t take the same risk their parents did. A divorce didn&#x27;t mean a financial end for many boomers (or, at least, they probably weren&#x27;t aware that&#x27;s what could happen).<p>With the rise of the internet, young people are aware of the risks and how susceptible they are to those risks. Since younger generations also no longer feel the same level of stigma for fulfilling sexual and emotional needs from partners outside of marriage, it follows that marriage rates would fall.<p>It also makes sense that divorce rates would fall. Older generations&#x27; marriages that have lasted this long will probably last until death. Younger generations that choose to marry will likely have found and married another successful, responsible person. My guess is these marriages are (on average) more stable than those of previous generations.')
