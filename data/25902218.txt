Consumers choose from what&#x27;s available on the market, not from some abstract space of possible products. Not only is technology too complicated for the mainstream audience (and products on the market do their best to make everything seem like &quot;magic&quot; that cannot be understood casually by non-specialists), the market doesn&#x27;t really listen to user feedback anyway, preferring to divine everything from telemetry.<p>Greed, in general, motivates corporations to make money. Sometimes, providing people with what they demand is the easiest way to profit. Oftentimes, there are better ways. Like investing in marketing to <i>make</i> people demand what you want to provide them. Or scam them through convoluted business models.')
