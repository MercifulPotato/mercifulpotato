This is certainly true if you&#x27;re running more than one chain, since including them all with this same starting value will bias the results (in a real, not just theoretical sense, though the magnitude of the bias will of course vary with your problem).  Even if you&#x27;re running just one chain, you should discard at least some burn-in (say 5%) even if you have no evidence that it is necessary, because you really don&#x27;t know that your supposed good starting point is actually representative.  (That is, you don&#x27;t know this a difficult problems, which are the ones I&#x27;m discussing.)')
