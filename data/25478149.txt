I haven&#x27;t given up on the game yet, but I am growing more frustrated.<p>five hours in, I killed a security guard and his body (which carried a key needed to advance the mission) fell through the floor. I had to load a previous save and be extra careful about where the body landed. honestly this kind of thing isn&#x27;t so bad. it&#x27;s obviously a bug and I know how to fix it.<p>the worst are the cases where I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s a bug, a stupid dev choice &quot;working as designed&quot;, or simply me being an idiot. I just finished playing the clouds mission, which is a club with a main area, a VIP area, and offices behind the VIP area. once I got in, I just started wandering around. I saw a guard telling some other NPC that he wasn&#x27;t allowed in the VIP area, but I tried going in anyway, since he didn&#x27;t say anything to me. no warning, all the guards open fire on me and I have to reload the checkpoint. okay, guess I&#x27;m not allowed in the VIP area. I talk to someone in the main area who sends me to sneak into the VIP area to talk to someone else. this time, the guards don&#x27;t react, although nothing in the dialogue indicated I had permission to be there. maybe the areas just get unlocked when you have a reason to be there? anyway, I talk to my next contact who sends me to talk to the manager in the back office. since it&#x27;s now fine for me to be in the VIP area, I assume it&#x27;s fine to also go in the back office area. the next guard I run into shoots me. what the fuck?')
