The fact is that here in HN there is a large group of people that think in a pragmatic way like &quot;Trump is doing an incredible danger, it must be stopped&quot;, without giving the right weight to the other components of the issue, that is how important is that social medias are so neutral to even allow to say terrible things. American left-wing is very different than EU left-wing I identify with, and this causes a cultural mismatch that results in the downvotes.<p>About the TOS, to say the final word is impossible because the TOS is written in a very obscure way. But I don&#x27;t believe they will, at the same time, keep implementing end-to-end encryption and, at the same time, have a TOS that states they can read your messages. Reading your messages would be completely unacceptable: then yes many would switch. IMHO it&#x27;s just that lawyers tend to fail big time at their work, and that this will get clarified soon.')
