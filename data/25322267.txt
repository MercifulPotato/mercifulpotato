It&#x27;s very centering:<p>- it unglues me from devices (I don&#x27;t listen to anything during most of my walks)<p>- it makes me open to sensual details of the world (such as: frozen dew on grass makes nice crunchy sound when walked on)<p>- it makes me explore and connect to my surrounding area<p>- it makes me feel good after I&#x27;ve finished the walk (nothing like coming back home after a nice walk outside).<p>Sometimes I feel like I&#x27;m too tired to go for a walk in the evening, but it&#x27;s just &quot;brain fog&quot; from all day of sitting and thinking and being stressed in job. If I force myself to go out, usually I feel ok after 10-15 minutes of walking and can easily walk for 1-3 hours feeling energized rather that tired. For reference, my daily average walking distance over past 2 years is 5 kilometers.')
