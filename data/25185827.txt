It requires a set point, an ability to measure deviation from that set point, and an ability to influence a factor that can reduce said deviation.<p>It&#x27;s not a conspiracy theory to observe that news publishing is first and foremost a for-profit enterprise. That the primary, overriding goal of any private news agency is making money to survive and pay its owners. It&#x27;s not a conspiracy theory to observe that news publishing is controlled to maximize that primary goal. It&#x27;s also not a conspiracy theory to notice that people&#x27;s behavior is influenced by the news - and here you have all the components you need for a feedback control loop.<p>If you notice that ad-based revenue model makes media profits proportional to &quot;engagement&quot;, and that fear and hatred are some of the most strong emotions out there, you arrive at the reason why news publishing is trying to turn everyone into afraid, hateful bigots. It&#x27;s how they make money. There&#x27;s no conspiracy theory involved, just free market at work.<p>That there&#x27;s no single actor with intentions and explicit goals - it only makes the phenomenon more robust.')
