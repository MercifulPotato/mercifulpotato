The easiest way to spot propaganda is the justification in the headline. If it was the other way around, the headline most definitely wouldn&#x27;t be justifying iran&#x27;s cyber &quot;operation&quot;. And it certainly wouldn&#x27;t be calling it an operation. I imagine it would be like &quot;Iran&#x27;s sneaky cyber attack...&quot;<p>I&#x27;m sure iranian propaganda does the same thing. A fun game to play is switch the sides and see how strange the title seems.')
