If you show up mouthing off you&#x27;ll be called on it by the regulars who may all look like they&#x27;re shit talking each other, but who have mostly spent time together in real life, and who as a group have each other&#x27;s backs against outsiders. If you keep it up you&#x27;ll be asked to leave, possibly if needed by the managers (forum mods) who&#x27;ll ban you for a short or extended time.&quot;<p>It works remarkably well for that particular group of people. It&#x27;s almost certainly turned a lot of people away who _may_ have pulled their head in and become contributing members of that community, but largely they don&#x27;t care too much. The forum has stayed small (it was recently characterised only a bit unfairly as &quot;12 cranky old cunts&quot; by someone who wouldn&#x27;t&#x2F;couldn&#x27;t live up to the community standards there.)')
