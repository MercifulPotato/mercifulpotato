One Black employee said her manager suggested in front of colleagues that she was dealing drugs and carrying a gun, trading on racist stereotypes.<p>In an era of smartphones and viral videos, the fact that we don&#x27;t have a single audio&#x2F;video recording exposing the racism seems rather suspect. I&#x27;m not saying that is proof of anything. But something to consider.<p>The idea that coinbase, a silicon valley&#x2F;SF&#x2F;etc company, would discriminate, especially against black people, is hard for me to believe. But I&#x27;m open to anything. Certainly even if the company doesn&#x27;t have a culture of bias, it may have a few bad apples.<p>&gt; If the numbers haven’t changed, it’s definitely because there wasn’t a real intention to do so<p>This is a lie. Everyone who works in tech knows that companies are bending over backwards to hire black employees. The problem is the lack of qualified employees. Even unqualified black employees are being hired just to say &quot;we have more black employees today than last year&quot;. It&#x27;s been like this for a few years now. That tech companies had no real intention to hire black employees is simply a lie.<p>&gt; When Mr. Armstrong wrote his blog post in September asking employees to leave their outside interests at the door, he was celebrated and praised by several tech investors.<p>So this is why we have a nytimes article. It&#x27;s a political attack masquerading as a employment bias issue. Got it.')
