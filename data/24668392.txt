Item(by='triceratops', descendants=None, kids=[24670793], score=None, time=1601684650, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24668292, text='&gt; The number of people willing to put the amount of time and effort required into writing a book without a profit motive is very low.<p>Citation needed. Writing a book, on average, makes people very little money. Some of the funniest or most entertaining content I&#x27;ve read has been on sites with user-generated content, such as Reddit, where there&#x27;s no (direct) profit motive for good writing.<p>Profit motive or not, people will continue to write. Homer and Shakespeare lived in a time with no copyright laws and produced some of the greatest works of literature.<p>I&#x27;m not advocating for zero copyright laws, but I call bullshit on this assertion that creative works exist only due to their protection.')
