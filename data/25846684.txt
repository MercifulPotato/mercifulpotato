Gamestop did not invent used game sales!!<p>We didn&#x27;t have gamespot in the SNES or NES era when I was a kid. My parents didn&#x27;t have much extra money, nor did any of my friends parents and new games were absurdly expensive. In the life of my SNES my parents only purchase three games new, all JRPGs. Of my friends, most probably purchased less than that new. However, we&#x27;d be at one of the local second hand stores, swap meets, or pawn shops all the time to buy or sell games. We&#x27;d borrow and trade for each other&#x27;s games. We played so many games without buying anything new.<p>If anything I think gamestop actually decreased used game sales because they made used games more expensive, and new games are cheaper today (adjusted for inflation) and games in general are much higher quality and easier to vet if you&#x27;d like them before playing.')
