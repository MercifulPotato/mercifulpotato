Definitely could adjust the font sizes and since I&#x27;ve been working mostly on my laptop, I realize I might not be optimizing for other screen sizes.<p>&gt; I feel like a little more vertical space between posts and maybe making the URL smaller or moving it below the post title (or both) could really make the homepage a little less overwhelming with only a few minor changes.<p>I will experiment with this further. The vertical space should be easy, the urls are part of the text of the title, so maybe either shrink them slightly or a more muted blue?<p>Thanks for the feedback!')
