We spend so much money on phones, if we donate $1 a month for a few months and fund a few top class open source developers to do this full time whilst giving them market rate salary we can dramatically change the mobile ecosystem.<p>If a trusted name in HN Community or the tech world starts this many would contribute and it would have network effect.<p>Once we have Linux on mobiles, many startups would form around this ecosystem. Which would - \n<i>localize jobs\n</i>redistribute  wealth so that Apple &amp; Google don&#x27;t get to hoard it.\n<i>stop planned obsolescence which is rampant these days.\n</i>create a market for open source hardware &#x2F; cruelty free hardware.')
