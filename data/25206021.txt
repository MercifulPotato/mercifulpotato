Then through the summer it picked up, and the streets are now incredibly congested throughout the day. More people are driving everywhere to avoid public transit, and possibly out of boredom. It&#x27;s very frustrating. I hardly go anywhere at all, working from home and all, but when I need to drive somewhere, like to a distant appointment in the middle of a weekday afternoon, there are cars, cars, cars everywhere.')
