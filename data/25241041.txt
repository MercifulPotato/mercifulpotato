Right now it is track bike and e-bike only, so not even for hub gears.<p>The track market is miniscule and we&#x27;ll catered for. Then the e-bike market does not need a 2 percent gain in chain performance.<p>The enemy of the chain is dirt. Real world cycling in the 1950s had hub gears and a big case to keep the dirt out. Then derailleur gears aimed at the sports market dropped the chain case. This made sense for cyclists with a team car behind them.')
