I usually don&#x27;t go to the store to buy only one thing, I do my weekly shopping or at least put together a list. With free shipping and Prime on Amazon, I don&#x27;t have to think. Just order my Alexa to buy it and it arrives tomorrow. Its even easier than putting it on a shopping list.<p>Not to mention, where I live in Europe its actually easier to take public transportation to the store most of the time.')
