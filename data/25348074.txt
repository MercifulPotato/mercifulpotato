Hegel&#x27;s focuses on very high levels of philosophy, abstraction taken to the highest degree. Choose an &quot;-ism&quot;. Reality pushes against it, creating ideals. From the start, Marx is wrong. At his time, he had a very limited understanding of nature.<p>Wealth doesn&#x27;t tend to concentrate. The business cycle turns novel scarcity, such as electricity, into commonplace utilities or even waste they pay you to take or find a way to reuse. Free markets exist today which require zero wealth to start, all skill and knowledge. Wealth tends to inflame character flaws and speed up individual demise or force people into charitable giving. The world&#x27;s much too big for one special interest.<p>The needs of the proletariat will never become the same as the needs of the state. For that to happen, everyone will have to become poor, and wealth just leaves. The opposite occurs. The richest people are Xi, Maduro, Castro, Iranian Mullahs. The richest place in the world is Washington DC. Wealth is the interview. Power is the job. If you can&#x27;t do it yourself, why do you get to tell everyone what to do?<p>We have advanced quite a lot since the moon landing:<p>The November Revolution in particle physics at Cornell<p>Voyager I &amp; II<p>Bell&#x27;s Theorem<p>Antiparticle applications<p>Mapping human genome<p>NIH Brain initiative<p>Parker Solar Probe<p>The Event Horizon global radio telescope array<p>Interferometry<p>Mining asteroids worth a hundred times the global GDP<p>I think this ends with pointing a telescope at a really empty region of space thinned out by cosmic inflation, and manipulating the thin boundary of a black hole to bring galaxies into existence from nothing, a true gravity application. If we can do that, we can put chemicals or matter waves into orbit, and do it to ourselves, have complete control over what&#x27;s inside. We see a star. Everyone else sees a black hole.')
