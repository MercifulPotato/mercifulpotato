Item(by='eesmith', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606545945, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25235575, text='&gt; In May 1961, an IBM engineer, Bob Bemer, sent a proposal to the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) to develop a single code for computer communication. ANSI created the X3.4 Committee,<p>Hmm. That seems to leave out quite a bit.<p>Eric Fischer (an HN&#x27;er) wrote &quot;The Evolution of Character Codes, 1874-1968&quot;, available from <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.org&#x2F;details&#x2F;enf-ascii&#x2F;page&#x2F;n23&#x2F;mode&#x2F;2up" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.org&#x2F;details&#x2F;enf-ascii&#x2F;page&#x2F;n23&#x2F;mode&#x2F;2up</a> .<p>In it, Eric writes:<p>&gt; By  1955,  Herbert  Grosch  had  become  sufficiently concerned  about  the  growing  incompatibility of character codes that he urged the attendees of the Eastern Joint Computer Conference   to   ‘‘register   common codes so that ...<p>and<p>&gt; The  American  Standards  Association  (ASA)  got involved  in  character  code  standardization  on  August 4,  1960,  when  it  created  the  X3.2  subcommittee  for Coded Character Sets and Data Format.<p>Bemer&#x27;s letter in 1961 therefore doesn&#x27;t seem to have been a proposal to <i>develop</i> a single code, because that was in the works. Rather:<p>&gt; The  March  8-9,  1961  meeting  of  X3.2  finally  led to  a  code  (based  on  a  proposal  by  Robert  W. Bemer, Howard  J.  Smith,  and  F.A. Williams)  that  nearly everyone  could  agree  upon—but  there  is  some  dis-agreement about exactly what it was that was agreed.<p>And that&#x27;s in March 1961, well before May 1961.<p>Indeed, May 1961 is when Bemer et al. wrote the CACM article &quot;Design of an Improved Transmission&#x2F;Data Processing Code&quot; - <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ed-thelen.org&#x2F;comp-hist&#x2F;ImprovedDataProcessingCode_BemerSmithWilliams_CACM_May1961.pdf" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ed-thelen.org&#x2F;comp-hist&#x2F;ImprovedDataProcessingCod...</a> .')
