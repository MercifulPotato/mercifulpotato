It seriously slows down my workflow having to hover over each tool for a few seconds to find out what it actually does.<p>And this comes from somebody who has used the software pretty consistently for 20 years (Fark.com photoshop contests from my teens, woo!).<p>Maybe this is just a mac thing, though?<p>Anyway: congrats on 25 years, GIMP team!  Your tool is a joy, and your work is hugely appreciated by me!  Great job!')
