It is a much lesser experience than any DX game, so that is a real sour point for players expecting, or at least familiar with, that.<p>And the bugs are not a sideshow.  I played 2 hours on PC and returned it.  When I had mission markers coming and going completely unrelated to any quests I had started I said &quot;enough&quot;.  If the game is made playable, then I&#x27;ll buy it again and likely enjoy it as a cut-down DX Fable-like in a pretty setting.<p>Edit: the trip point for me will be when the game actually provides a non-lethal path through the game.  Currently there is no polish or thought given to this aspect of UX.  There are quickhacks and non-letha weapons, yet the game throws you into mandatory shootouts (namely the first scripted car chase) before you have access to non-lethal methods of neutralizing enemies.  Maybe there is one small path of points dispersal that could lead to non-lethal options, but if there is it is obfuscated.  They never signal to the player how to perform non-lethal combat.  It feels like the options are placeholders and the game is meant to be murderous.  This is a far cry from a DX game that gives a fair option to go non-lethal, full stealth as a challenge.  The DX games were actually playtested.')
