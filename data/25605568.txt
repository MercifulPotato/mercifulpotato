Item(by='Pyramus', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609527062, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25605000, text='Wikipedia has a good summary of what we know: &quot;there were insufficient data to reach any conclusion on underlying mechanism of increased transmissibility (e.g. increased viral load, tissue distribution of virus replication, serial interval etc.)&quot; [1]<p>&gt; is it more infectious through touch, by breathing it in, or when viral particles reach your eyes?<p>I think a better mental model of transmissibility is to think of what concentration of viral particles is needed to trigger the reproduction. It seems that there is some early indication that the new variant binds more easily to human cells (N501Y mutation) so a lower concentration of particles is needed, and also infected hosts distribute more particles (higher viral load).<p>An actual expert on viral transmission please chime in.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Variant_of_Concern_202012&#x2F;01#Transmissibility" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Variant_of_Concern_202012&#x2F;01#T...</a>')
