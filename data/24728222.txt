I mean, don&#x27;t get me wrong I want it to succeed, but in this ecosystem of apps&#x2F;capitalism, and Apple&#x2F;Google duopoly, I see no chance of an open project like this going mainstream, and the intersection between the tech enthusiasts (as I really don&#x27;t think this project is aimed at the non tech-savvy) and who actually would want to replace their phone with this isn&#x27;t enough (HN community isn&#x27;t a good KPI for this, obviously. We need to check out the general audience) to support the costs.<p>I&#x27;d like to be proven wrong though.')
