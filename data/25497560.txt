Went round and round with the employer and the insurer. Of course it was the others fault.<p>Finally talked to DoL guy and they told me it&#x27;s absolutely the employers responsibility. They kept going back and forth with me. This was about and $1800 difference in out of pocket max, not in my favor...<p>Finally they fixed it, but only for my wife. Since she had the majority of the bills due to a surgery, the insurance clawed back a bunch of smaller stuff they had already paid. So that cost me about a $1k. I guess I&#x27;m going to have to sue in small claims, which is what the DoL guy recommended.')
