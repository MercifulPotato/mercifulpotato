They are not the same.<p>Clearly defined...? Maybe?<p>I don&#x27;t know of any popular HTTP proxies that rely on these definitions to automatically decide how to cache things, because people in the real world follow the definitions very loosely. GET is the only one that I&#x27;ve seen relied on, and it&#x27;s still just a good bet, not a guarantee. Usually, you have to define which routes are cacheable and carefully configure the cache settings... in my experience, at least.<p>Maybe it&#x27;s just my bad luck to have encountered all the ways these verbs <i>aren&#x27;t</i> used consistently over the years. They&#x27;re a <i>hint</i> towards what will happen... at best. In my experience, anything goes, no matter what the verb says.<p>I truly hope you&#x27;ve had a better experience, and that it&#x27;s just me.<p>&gt; I don&#x27;t believe gRPC handles this or it looks like its experimental.<p>Which seems fine. We can&#x27;t rely on HTTP verbs for state management because of how inconsistent implementations are, so I don&#x27;t expect gRPC to do that either, but at least gRPC won&#x27;t make you choose a random verb.')
