(And that&#x27;s not the standard we were held to, I&#x27;m sure).<p>If your standard is the median for our age group, they were probably better-than-middling. It was an advanced class, after all.<p>Actually, I think that if nobody is trying, such an exercise would be counterproductive. In that scenario, the right thing to do would be to determine and address the reasons why nobody is trying.
