In my experience, taking hand written notes helps to absorb and recall information faster as compared to typing it. Also, most editors do a bad job at writing formulae. One downside of taking handwritten notes is that I cannot easily connect my ideas across notes or disciplines ie difficult to create a zettlakasten. The solution I thought of was to buy a device which can convert my hand written notes to digital as well as make it easier for me to create a zettlkasten.  So, HN what&#x27;s your preferred note taking device?')
