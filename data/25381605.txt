Each has their own APIs, SDKs etc. All you do for weeks is basically update and build apks for each store, they get rejected or you find a bug later and again.<p>From the development point of view 1 store at saves a huge amount of time.<p>I am all for open platform, low fees etc. But I am against a billion store apps.<p>And why would consumers want 10 store apps? And then search the app you want in each of them? I really doubt that.<p>Also how many of other stores have resources to check and validate each app? Probably none.<p>We should push Apple to treat all developers equally, lower fees, etc, but creating a bunch of app stores is not the way. Just integrate all your wishes in the one.')
