Then one day someone notices visual&#x2F;UX inconsistencies between products so a process is introduced to ensure consistency. Then someone notices the tone of the copy is not what they think it should be so it is decreed that all copy should go through the writing team. Etc.

You answer to them. Their job is not to help you make users’ lives better. Their job is to stop peons like you from screwing up.')
