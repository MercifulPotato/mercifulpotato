Truvada for PrEP has a program both for insured patients that covers co-pays up to $7,200 per year (I pay zero dollars a year because of this), and a medication assistance program for uninsured patients where after signing up and meeting eligibility requirements (which are basically &#x27;are you at risk of getting HIV&#x27; and &#x27;are you not wealthy to the point where you should definitely be able to afford insurance&#x27;) you receive the medication at zero cost.<p>This is true of many medications, but Truvada is especially famous for it. As a gay man I have a lot of friends on it, and because of the aforementioned program, only two of the thirty+ pay any co-pay at all, and it&#x27;s something like 20 bucks for them.')
