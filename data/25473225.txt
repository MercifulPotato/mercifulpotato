That vaccination as a concept is hogwash because if it was useful, we&#x27;d have done it through evolution.  But that&#x27;s plainly nonsensical - we wouldn&#x27;t need a system that functioned by random variation if we evolved the ability to know what the real targets would be, but we couldn&#x27;t do that without specific knowledge, which we can&#x27;t get without being exposed to the things, by which time ... it&#x27;s too late to have then already built the specific defenses.')
