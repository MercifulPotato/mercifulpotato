Their jobs price them out of property ownership, they have near zero chance of retirement and very faint perspectives in starting families. All those problems would go away with the raise of the purchasing power of their salary, but the corporate world has found a cheaper solution. People are told to follow their feelings, &quot;bring entire themselves at work&quot;, etc. Instead of paying them more, we let it slide when they blow their steam off at someone they don&#x27;t like. It keeps them busy and it costs zero on the balance sheet. A much better alternative to unionizing or starting competing co-ops, right?<p>In long-term, this creates a massive divide in the society. Conservative-minded people that are happy with what they have find this childish. Emotional people feel that conservatives have some unfair advantage and try to attack them for it. The recent election is just a good indicator of the divide, since the conservative vs. emotional groups clearly have opposing opinions about it. The corporations are simply supporting the side that costs the less to them, it&#x27;s business and nothing personal.<p>In a longer term, it looks like the death of American Dream. You are no longer expected to achieve wealth and financial independence through hard work, and then do what <i>YOU</i> want. Instead, the role model is to dedicate your energy to endless bashing of your peers from the opposing political camp, while the corporations grab an unprecedented share of the economy.')
