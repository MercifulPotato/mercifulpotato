At least IMHO it defeats the purpose of using richly typed language.<p>The Approach i would take is smartly dividing the code into namespace and libraries :<p>1. Spend more time in design process and isolating the low level concerns. \n2. Seperate the business logic code into multiple namespace or perhaps libraries\n3. extract the common utility classes, interfaces, enums in separate namespace, also the common layers like ORM, HTTP networking etc.\n4. Test suite must be separate and can also adopt above 3 points mentioned internally\n5. Provide enough configuration in build file so that the Independent or Semi-Independent modules or libraries can be compiled in both parallel through using multiple CPU cores and incremental manner through last compiler output cache.')
