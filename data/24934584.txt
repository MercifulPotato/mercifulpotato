Forget about the president. Ultimately, why I find the substance of this argument compelling is because the masses, even on this website, <i>very</i> greatly underestimate the engineering challenges involved in colonizing another planet. This is a problem so far beyond our current capabilities that we can&#x27;t even project a timeline on when such a thing might be possible. It&#x27;s also very possible it may <i>never</i> be practical to achieve. For these reasons, it&#x27;s foolish to propagate the idea that colonizing another planet is a realistic solution for <i>any</i> problems we&#x27;re facing on this planet.<p>With all that stated, I still think it&#x27;s worthwhile to try for a variety of reasons; we are natural explorers, we are curious, there are huge boons to research and technology as a side effect of this work and as far as Trump goes this is one of the least worthwhile aspects of his presidency to complain about.')
