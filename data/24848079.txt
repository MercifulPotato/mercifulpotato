Gmail&#x27;s search box semantics are unusably bad no matter what language you use.<p>If I click &quot;Inbox&quot;, Gmail takes me to my &quot;primary inbox&quot; where my non-spam emails land. As far as I&#x27;m concerned, that&#x27;s my inbox. It takes another click to &quot;promotions&quot; or &quot;social&quot; to see all the unwanted advertising semi-spam mail that I probably signed up for but don&#x27;t want to read. Google is really good at this bit.<p>But to <i>search</i> for unread emails in this inbox, you can&#x27;t do &quot;in:inbox&quot; because that brings back all the mails from &quot;social&quot; and &quot;promotions&quot;, and the interface for search results doesn&#x27;t have the same 3 tabs, so the relevant emails are buried a hundred pages down. &quot;in:primary&quot; doesn&#x27;t work either. The magic incantation is &quot;category:primary is:unread&quot;, but at various points in the past you&#x27;ve needed instead to use &quot;is&quot; or &quot;in&quot; or &quot;label&quot; instead.<p>Google supports you searching for messages by content. Type the words or the sender&#x27;s name and you&#x27;ll find the email. Advanced search is an afterthought or downright discouraged, in the same way it&#x27;s been made less powerful on Web searches than it was in 2001.')
