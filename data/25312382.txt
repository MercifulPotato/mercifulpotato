Is it a state where you cannot even afford rent and actually sleep on the streets? I have read quite a few posts in HN referring to homelessness. For someone from a much much poorer nation, posts&#x2F;comments from here suggest it is so so easy to be homeless in US than ours which brings disbelief to me.<p>And secondly, the author points she is &quot;upper class&quot;? How can upper class family or individual ever need to borrow loans and also not have assets? I only ask to gain some social context. For example, our social context, a middle class family wouldn&#x27;t take education loans and would have assets, in general (even the many thousands of students who immigrate to US to study, the middle class student do not take loans to fund their education in US university - This is what always surprises me when I see posts&#x2F;comments similar to this)')
