I&#x27;d argue a lot of what happens on consumer devices can (or could) be done in parallel. There&#x27;s some need for a fast response, but things like, responding to a button click and updating some internal state, take a trivial amount of computation to implement. Updating your UI in response to that button click, that&#x27;s again something that can be parallelized.')
