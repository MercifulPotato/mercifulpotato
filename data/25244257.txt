Major apps will get prominent first-page listing on the App Store and will show up frequently at the top of searches, and Apple does not charge for that. Random indie app won&#x27;t get this level of promotion.<p>I&#x27;m not sure how to account for that fairly, it seems wrong to charge for prominent listing, but on the other hand it seems wrong to charge small indie devs the same as the majors while shuffling them in deep in the catalogue. Maybe the discount for small publishers Apple announced recently will help with this, though that system does seem to have it&#x27;s own flaws.')
