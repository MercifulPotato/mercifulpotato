Three and a half years ago, it hurt even to brush my teeth. The damage was primarily from using trackpads, mice and worst of all mobile phones, but it was much to late to just use a keyboard.<p>I had to take a complete break and then limit myself to a couple hours a day and only on a fully ergonomic mechanical keyboard. The difference in using VIM and staying mostly on the home rows vs constantly hitting chords with modifier keys to do everything on other editors was massive. I could work almost twice as long before feeling pain!<p>At the time I could get around VIM but hadn&#x27;t ever customized my .vimrc or really made a concerted effort to study it. I just knew the standard navigation with hjkl, insert, append, copy, yank, delete, lines, words and find. And yet it was still reasonably productive.<p>Once I learned about change&#x2F;delete&#x2F;yank <i>in</i> word&#x2F;tag&#x2F;line&#x2F;etc, it was already better than using VS Code in normal mode. Making shortcuts in my .vimrc made it even better. In a sense it&#x27;s like snippets at a meta level that apply to your work flow.<p>Nobody pushed me to use VIM and I like it quite a bit, despite having had a <i>lot</i> more experience with non-modal editors. I&#x27;ll use VS Code, etc, but I when I do, I use VIM mode in them unless I&#x27;m recording a screencast where I don&#x27;t think that would be a good idea. So far, the only major editor I&#x27;ve encountered that fails to support VIM mode is Xcode.')
