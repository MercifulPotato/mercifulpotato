But for folks who play the long game, supply and demand tells a <i>very</i>compelling story for Bitcoin.<p>Calling Bitcoin a &quot;currency&quot; at this point is essentially incorrect and just creates confusion.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bitcoin.org&#x2F;bitcoin.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bitcoin.org&#x2F;bitcoin.pdf</a>')
