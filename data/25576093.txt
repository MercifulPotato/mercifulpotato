Regardless of whether you have two driven wheels or four, if they aren&#x27;t making contact with the road you aren&#x27;t putting any power down and your wheels are just spinning. The only thing that can help you is better tires that can move more water out from under them, hopefully giving you a contact patch with the surface.')
