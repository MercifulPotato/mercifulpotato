The people fighting the police (many of whom are police themselves, and whom some police are collaborating with) also just attempted a violent coup. So they all suck. And surprisingly, Donald Trump managed to support all of the ones doing the systematic violence AND the ones attempting violent coups.<p>So really, yes, it all around sucks, and we need to fix a lot. But some people are clearly hurting more than helping! Maybe when theyâ€™re gone, we can finally focus on fixing these longstanding systemic problems rather than arguing about a man-child.')
