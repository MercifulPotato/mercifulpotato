I&#x27;m glad I am not the only one feeling this way after all!<p>I literally said the same thing yesterday to another comment in another post: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25672161" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25672161</a><p>This sort of censorship will backfire badly. I won&#x27;t be surprised if a real Civil War breaks out in America because of suppression of right wing groups by the Big Tech. This division is very real and scary. I shudder to think what sort of ripple effects it will have on 100+ countries where Big Tech operates! If it can nuke the US President&#x27;s account what chance do other Presidents&#x2F;Prime Ministers or Governments have?<p>Please remember that this is not just an action&#x2F;reaction issue. It is not that simple. There are Second Order Effects at play. You can&#x27;t even launch a rival platform without first gaining traction. How would you gain traction if the medium for gaining traction is controlled by Big Tech? How do you promote a Twitter alternative if Google, Facebook, Apple and Twitter ban you from their platforms. Can&#x27;t advertise on Google, can&#x27;t put your alternative app on Android Play Store or Apple Play Store, can&#x27;t promote on Twitter. Literally have no choice but to follow the guidelines set by Big Tech and be at the mercy of Big Tech. We are looking at a Big Tech Cartel controlled by left wing ideology. That&#x27;s precisely what it is today.<p>So what should the right wing do? Create a right wing Google, Facebook, Twitter, Apple alternative? Are we staring at the balkanization of internet as we know it?')
