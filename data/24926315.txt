I learn music theory without a particular goal. I paint without a particular goal. I play guitar and keyboard without any goal, I don’t see myself\nas ever becoming a professional musician. But I do enjoy the journey. \nWhat i was refering to is learning shiny tech that lasts for 2 cycles of 2 years then goes dusty. Most times it is convoluted and quirky, unintuitive, filled with jargon and the knowledge doesn’t translate well in other areas. \nFor example I put a month or two of effort to learn Angular 6 or 7 and then did a 4 month project with it. It was fun and enjoyed it but my company decided not to go with Angular anymore. In this sense I don’t regret it but the investment wasn’t really worth it and i’d rather spent the time deepening some other skillset that I could put to use. In my company everybody jumped on the blazor bandwagon. I don’t have a good feeling about it and have 0 motivation to learn it.')
