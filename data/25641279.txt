Item(by='owyn', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609813462, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25641152, text='Thanks! I&#x27;m fine!<p>Since I started my career in SWE (at a company which went public and crashed hard in the first dot.com bust) I&#x27;ve always had enough so I never really worried about money.  And I usually had more than my musician friends so I &quot;felt&quot; well off, if that makes sense.  I could always buy a new guitar and they couldn&#x27;t always do that.  I rented the van to go on tour when they couldn&#x27;t afford it because it was a bucket list thing for me and I&#x27;m glad I did it. Now I&#x27;m starting to think maybe I should have thought about it a little more.  I&#x27;ve always been so busy working and pursuing other hobbies (guitar, then drums, now game programming (or just game playing? hard to tell) and weight lifting) that I never thought &quot;hey, dude, sit down and plan your retirement&quot; beyond checking a box to auto-fill the 401k.  I have also worked at a lot of companies that didn&#x27;t even offer a 401k so that also made a bit of a dent.<p>I&#x27;m definitely dreaming about finding a remote job and moving out of SF, like half the developers in the city... I could easily afford a house in any other part of the country. I could use the savings to hire a younger guy to stand in front of the web cam while I type. :)<p>My parents are still here in CA so I&#x27;m standing by to care for them if&#x2F;when necessary. My dad is in a home already but I&#x27;ll probably move back in to hang out with my mom soon. So far I&#x27;ve been happier maintaining my own apartment I&#x27;m sure a lot of people with mom&#x27;s can understand. I spent a half hour on the phone today doing technical support. :)  Another hint -- set up remote desktop!<p>I&#x27;m still torn between spending the rest of my career at some BigCo or taking a shot at one last startup.  A lifetime of indecisiveness has led to a lot of these half-assed decisions for sure.<p>Since this post is about aging, one bit of advice: get your parents to sign power of attorney (medical &amp; financial) documents long before they can&#x27;t sign paperwork any more! By the time you actually have to use it for something it may be a LOT more difficult. Fortunately my parents trust me and they were happy to do it, and we&#x27;re all very happy we did.')
