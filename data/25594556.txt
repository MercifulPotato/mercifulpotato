In practice, this entails a lot of work to create runtimes to do anything interesting in wasm, but the behavior is secure by default (ignoring side-channel attacks, of course). Java applets run in a sandbox by default, of course, but the JRE itself has unmitigated access to the host system, so the security boundary isn&#x27;t as well defined. Users can also be tricked to trust malicious applets, which is a built-in mechanism to escape the sandbox; browsers hopefully will not provide this feature for their wasm runtimes.')
