Item(by='ridaj', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611848672, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25942240, text='&gt; With their heads in cloud nine, hedge funds tried to kill GameStop ($GME). They tried to squeeze it so much that it would suffocate and die. They didn&#x27;t care about the people who will be out of jobs, unable to pay their bills, or even survive.<p>A low stock price doesn&#x27;t, by itself, kill a business and put people out of jobs. Bad management kills a business, as does being in a bad business to begin with.<p>&gt; Never in their wildest dreams, the hedge funds would have thought this day would come. The tables have finally turned as the hedge funds try to gulp in their last breath of air.<p>We&#x27;re really not talking about &quot;the hedge funds&quot; in this case. Just a few hedge funds who, indeed, should&#x27;ve seen it coming. It&#x27;s not like during the subprime crisis where every large financial institution had a large exposure to them. The exposure of the financial industry to GameStop is minuscule at the scale of the system. It&#x27;s also not new, in the sense that sometimes hedge funds will try to squeeze one another too<p>&gt; I honestly don&#x27;t believe that people are going to sell their positions on $GME stocks. As I said, they are not in for the money anymore. They are fighting the good fight, and they have the potential to win this WAR.<p>Maybe they won&#x27;t sell, but there are cases where fundamentals will catch up with the gamers. If&#x2F;when the business runs out of cash and undergoes restructuring, the stockholders will be left holding pennies.<p>Maybe the CEO of GameStop (notice how he&#x27;s been quiet?) will be like, f--- this job, <i>I&#x27;m</i> selling all my stock and retiring, thanks Internet')
