I&#x27;ve got a case open with their customer relations team right now. They&#x27;ve had money off me for a laptop that doesn&#x27;t work.<p>The funny thing about the customer relations team is that they don&#x27;t have an inbound phone number. If they aren&#x27;t answering your emails, not only can you not get anything that way, but even if you phone the customer support team, they&#x27;re internally segregated so <i>they</i> can&#x27;t see what&#x27;s going on either.<p>I&#x27;ve been trying to get a working laptop out of HP since the third week of September, and as far as I can tell that&#x27;s just not something they&#x27;re capable of.')
