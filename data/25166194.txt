I&#x27;ve manually written out 1000 hindi flash cards. I would go through them a few times each day. I usually add a few of the older cards randomly, and I&#x27;ve had good progress over the course of a year. I think it was better for me to use that than Anki since I had to learn to write the devegnari.<p>I also heard finnish is a really hard language, so maybe it&#x27;s that.')
