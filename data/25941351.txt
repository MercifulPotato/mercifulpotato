What is defined in the law as legal, or not defined as illegal is what is legal. This is why no smarty pants bureaucrat should be allowed to wiggle out arbitrary powers by coming with &quot;interpretations,&quot; &quot;extended definitions,&quot; or &quot;legal theories.&quot;<p>&gt; If you think the lawmakers and regulators will throw their hands up and say geez, it&#x27;s technically legal, carry on, you&#x27;re sorely mistaken.')
