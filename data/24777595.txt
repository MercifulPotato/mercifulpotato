Item(by='djsumdog', descendants=None, kids=[24778358, 24778464, 24778641, 24777806], score=None, time=1602689153, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24777440, text='There is still a lot of unrest in Portland and Seattle, but Federal police (US Marshals, FBI, BORTAC, et. al.) have used regular old police work (cameras, under cover anarchists, wiretaps with warrants) to arrest a ton of these people when the city prosecutors simply wouldn&#x27;t do a damn thing or catch and release them.<p>Now many of these people are facing federal crimes. You can get some serious years for swinging a sledge hammer at a US Marshal, as what happened at the Federal Courthouse in Portland. (Remember, three of those Feds are now blind in at least one eye from the green lasers?)<p>But the Anarchists&#x2F;Antifa types that are burning down Portland are also being thrown together with the McCloskeys who were arrested for having guns out, while on their lawn, after people broke into their gated community. Or Jake Gardner, who the DA ruled as acting in self defense, with a full video clearly showing him acting in self defense after both he and his father were attached.<p>We&#x27;re starting to see real terrorists conflated with what are clearly political prisoners from local officials.')
