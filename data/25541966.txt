I&#x27;ve seen it a million times and just wasn&#x27;t in the mood. I started mouthing off about how George Bailey is an unrelatable character who has an amazing life but is just ungrateful for it.<p>About 90 minutes later I was choking back tears, despite knowing the movie line for line, knowing exactly what was coming and when, and looking for any reason to be annoyed at it because I&#x27;ve seen it too many times.<p>There are very few films that can slice through my anger-based emotional shield. This is definitely one of them.')
