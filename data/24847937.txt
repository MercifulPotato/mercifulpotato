If it were any other language being abused, there would be campaigns to stop it happening.<p>I disagree and vehemently. The strength of the English language is its ability to change and absorb words from other languages. Your proposal to have campaigns restricting change leads to the decay of a language and to oddities like &quot;courriel&quot; instead of email in Quebec French which - mind you - tries to keep itself free of English borrowings. See also the needlessly long compound words in languages like Dutch and German. Even Finnish has &quot;speaking box&quot; instead of telephone.<p>This is a road you won&#x27;t like. I think you should accept that English is no longer &quot;your&quot; language. It belongs to everyone now.')
