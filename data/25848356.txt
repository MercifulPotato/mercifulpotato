It&#x27;s a task in a schedule that has its dates hardcoded and thus will not move, which is really insanely wrongheaded. A scheduling tool like this is, at a basic level, all about assembling a list of tasks with durations (and, ideally, assigned resources and work and costs) that are connected by a chain of logic. If an early task is delayed 3 weeks, you&#x27;ll see that in later tasks that depend on the first task. [...] A &quot;Manual Task&quot; just ignores all that.<p>That&#x27;s assuming that all your tasks are movable. If there is a task that can only be completed in a certain time period (and there are some activities that you cannot or will not move in any organisation), you plan around it. It will not move just based on your whims or your schedule.<p>And yes, it can mean that your auto-schedule makes no sense if something gets delayed and the task causes your critical path scheduling not to make sense any more, but that is the price you pay in the real world.<p>It&#x27;s a weird hill to die on.<p>&gt; Imagine Excel introduces a feature called Manual Math that allows you to override the rules of arithmetic. If you want the total to say 10,000 but the column has entries that sum to 12,234, just turn on Manual Math!<p>Imagine if someone was able to type in a flat, straight up not calculated <i>number</i> in a calculation spreadsheet, overriding any formula that you have put in. The world would end.')
