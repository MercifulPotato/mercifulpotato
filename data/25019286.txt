Everyone wants a candidate that they like more than they want a candidate who can ably run the country. The fact is that this country is full of people with different ideas, desires and needs. Donald Trump had real support, but only from a single faction. He was president of his base only. Joe Biden on the other hand, is no one&#x27;s favorite but it should be pretty obvious to anyone that he&#x27;s qualified and that he can be a president for all of the United States.')
