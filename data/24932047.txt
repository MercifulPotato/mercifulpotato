Play audio files through a speaker and record the speaker with a microphone. Then you have the original and the analog recording. Train the machine to reverse the process. Now you can grab high quality audio from any source.<p>Machine learning isn&#x27;t this magic thing that can defeat math. The digital to analog process is lossy, and you&#x27;re asking machine learning to reverse that lossy process. This is very similar to saying &quot;If I train my machine learning model that 10 + 10 = 20, and 3 * 40 = 120, if I ask it x + y = 42 it should be able to tell me x and y&quot;. It&#x27;s obviously impossible, mathematically so.<p>You could train it to reduce some predictable sources of analog interference, sure, but you absolutely can&#x27;t &quot;grab high quality audio from any source&quot;.<p>Well, actually, there is an exception! For data you train on, assuming you train the neural net enough, it will eventually encode a fingerprint of input audio and an output of the original digital training data, at which point your neural net has encoded copyrighted training data... effectively it&#x27;s a form of compression (or maybe just obfuscation) now, and contains copyrighted material. Oops.<p>Disregarding the fact that this process would be mathematically impossible, let&#x27;s say you do produce this program. So, does it circumvent copyright law? Does it actually improve anything?<p>No, it turns out what you have is even more obviously a circumvention device than youtube-dl or anything else. Under the DMCAA, the neural network would be an illegal copyright circumvention device, and all the audio it produces would not be legal copies, and could not legally be owned. I&#x27;ll reference &quot;what color are your bits&quot;[0], since it&#x27;s an excellent description of one of the problems here. You&#x27;re proposing a technical solution, but there is no technical solution here, it&#x27;s a legal problem. Whether you torrent an album or whether you reverse an analog source through magic, either way the bits are colored with copyright infringement.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ansuz.sooke.bc.ca&#x2F;entry&#x2F;23" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ansuz.sooke.bc.ca&#x2F;entry&#x2F;23</a>')
