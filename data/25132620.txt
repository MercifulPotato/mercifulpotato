Better started with friendlier languages like Java&#x2F;C#&#x2F;Python etc where beginners can focus on implementing their algorithms without messing with lower level details like pointers, manual memory management, etc.<p>Of course I&#x27;m not saying C is not useful anymore (it still is, for example if you are doing system&#x2F;kernel programming, very likely you&#x27;ll deal with C). But this is not the typical case for beginners.')
