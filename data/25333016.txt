Not that Scheme lacks amazing implementations such as Chez, Gambit or Chicken (my favourite) but I would have a harder time building something non trivial in those.<p>As a counter argument you have <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fare.livejournal.com&#x2F;188429.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fare.livejournal.com&#x2F;188429.html</a> from a seasoned Lisper so YMMV.')
