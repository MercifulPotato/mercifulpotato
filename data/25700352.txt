It&#x27;s distinctly _not_ a Java or a .Net and that&#x27;s ok, as it&#x27;s not trying to fulfill the same role.<p>Things in Haskell have names from theoretical computer science, because people are using it to express and experiment with those ideas - they don&#x27;t need or want to spend undue time describing a monad or a functor for the 15-millionth time, they want to use them in some new cutting-edge way.<p>I once saw (on this website) Haskell described as &quot;the primordial soup of programming language features&quot;. Wild and weird ideas get tried-out in Haskell, and then 5-10 years later someone takes the lessons learned from the evolution of some feature in Haskell and brings it to mainstream programming in some elegant, distilled form. And I think that&#x27;s super cool.')
