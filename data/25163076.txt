I think it&#x27;s easy to forget how hard it is to pick up for beginners except for the handful of people who have the ability to &quot;think like the abstract machine&quot;.<p>I think folks who are steeped in the webdev stuff and UI don&#x27;t always grok languages like C++ or its many footguns as easily as one may suspect. fwiw I feel the same way when I have to do any web stuff (i.e. out of my element). C++ may seem easy, especially when using a framework like Qt, but students tend to get really overwhelmed by all of the rules to avoid the language&#x27;s pitfalls (e.g. the GSL rules, abseil&#x27;s tips, Scott Meyer&#x27;s books and so many other authors, etc).<p>Perhaps if one is a great teacher, the pedagogy can introduce these things in a tolerable progression. I found as long as students stuck to value semantics only they got it, but as soon as they used a framework that dealt in references &#x2F; pointers it was a real step function in difficulty. Thinking about the lifetime pitfalls and related UB really ratcheted up the mental load, and I was not really trained how to teach effectively (like most grad students).')
