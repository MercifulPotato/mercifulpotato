And then suddenly everything went south and weâ€™re writing code like this.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s a funny observation, but not really a meaningful statement. JSX component based development saved web dev from the jQuery plugin based &quot;truth-in-the-DOM&quot; hell that was early web application development. Things like CSS in JS might be going a bit far, but there&#x27;s nothing inherently wrong with combining HTML and JS. Most other UI development environments use this same approach (QT&#x2F;QML, SwiftUI, etc.).')
