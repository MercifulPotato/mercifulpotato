It does not exist for the benefit of mankind, but rather for the benefit of its member states - and those have differing agendas.<p>Current WHO head was elected in part thanks to chinese votes and influence. When the WHO recommended not closing any borders, how can you disentangle the professional epidemiology opinion from the political push? You can&#x27;t.<p>Which is not to say it is evil or incompetent (it may be either, both, or none - I don&#x27;t know enough) - but it seems to have an aura of &quot;professional only&quot; organization, which is unjustified.')
