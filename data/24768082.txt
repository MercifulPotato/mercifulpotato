That&#x27;s <i>my</i> issue.<p>All I&#x27;m asking from Unity and its evangelists is honesty: you either have ready to use features or you don&#x27;t. Putting all the good stuff that you&#x27;re advertising behind a &quot;preview&quot; label and claiming it&#x27;s the customer&#x27;s responsibility when it doesn&#x27;t work well is not ok.')
