You don’t know what’s In his contract. Maybe his cofounder can’t fire him. Maybe He could but that would trigger the vesting. Maybe he could put it to the board and fire his cofounder.<p>Maybe his cofounders threat that it’s 3% or nothing is bluffing. It doesn’t really make sense for his cofounder, because that guy maybe is in the same situation if OPs contract is favorable. Maybe It’s 40% or nothing for him.<p>The only acceptable advice here is to go talk to a lawyer. That’s it. Internet advice about things like this is always bad even when it is meant well')
