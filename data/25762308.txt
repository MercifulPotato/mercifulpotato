Try creating your own compatible x86 processors, and find out how long it takes before Intel&#x27;s attack lawyers come down on you.  ARM is a bit better but you still have to pay licensing fees.  For people who want to git clone a design and manufacture it without involving lawyers or licensing fees, RISC-V is likely the best choice.')
