Czechia is pretty much the most atheist place on earth if I had to make a guess. I think pew in 2015 or something placed 70%+ of the population as irreligious. If you&#x27;ve spend a day there and met someone under 40 who is religious I&#x27;d be impressed<p>There&#x27;s one exception which is Poland due to the intimate ties of nationalism and Catholicism. But even so even in places that are religious in Eastern Europe it&#x27;s almost more political or nationalistic than it is &#x27;spiritual&#x27;.')
