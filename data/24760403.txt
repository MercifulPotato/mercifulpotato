For some people that&#x27;s not a problem, for a lot of people it is.<p>edit: based on responses I didn&#x27;t communicate clearly. What I mean is that there are way more potential distractions at home. Some people are still able to be productive in spite of that, but a lot of people (including myself!) are less productive. For some people it may even be the case that working from home there are fewer distractions, although I imagine that&#x27;s pretty rare.')
