Item(by='mNovak', descendants=None, kids=[25450528, 25450084], score=None, time=1608159681, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25448532, text='As an antenna engineer working on phased arrays, I find the claim that reducing the physical size directly reduces manufacturing cost by an order of magnitude laughable. As if the plastic radome or PCB factors into the cost at all.<p>The cost of these systems is 100% in the electronics. What I presume is going on here, is that Amazon (like SpaceX) has developed custom RFICs, which handle both uplink and downlink in a single package, thus requiring the apertures to be overlapping. The advancement is in having developed a better IC, the size reduction is an indirect outcome.<p>If Kuiper is taking a very different approach, more akin to Kymeta or ThinKom, the original statement might be credible, but the aperture looks too thin for that to be the case.')
