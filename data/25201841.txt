Good luck rewritting all the big data tools from Java (Elasticsearch, Spark, Kafka, Hadoop, Neo4j, Deeplearning4j, Cassandra, Solr, Arrow, OrientDB)<p>Yep, this is true. Java has an upper hand in data engineering. There are better languages for targeting the Java libraries and JVM than Java itself. I always use Clojure instead of Java when doing data crunching because it is much easier to create parallel programs with it. Kotlin is also coming up in this space.<p>Having said that. I like Rust for some reasons:<p>- targeting multiple libc (musl, no libc at all)<p>- targeting multiple platforms (ppc, mips, etc.,  even though some of those are tierN)<p>- having ML features<p>Why I do not like Rust:<p>- accidental complexity and convoluted syntax (maybe it is only me, but it is very hard to follow what is happening)<p>For me the ideal language would be something like F# with the good parts of Rust.')
