People would take the game clients and build their own servers to play off of, then edit the client just enough so it was talking to the private server instead of the real server. People, usually amazing talented teenagers, would construct amazing experiences that rivaled and sometimes surpassed what the $100m+ game companies were producing.<p>Unfortunately, these servers were incredibly prone to griefing particularly DDOS attacks. And though the private server developers were very talented and supremely motivated, they didn&#x27;t have the resources or infrastructure expertise to mitigate even relatively small DDOS attacks from 1 or 2 nodes.<p>Who was there as the universal solution to DDOS attacks? Freaking Cloudflare, and it worked, and it was affordable even by teenagers who had at most two nickles to rub together. Where are those ridiculously talented teenagers who built those private servers now? Probably running the world&#x27;s infrastructure.')
