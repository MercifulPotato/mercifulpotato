Every day, he opened his window exactly as I was passing in front of it.  After a few weeks, we got to know each other in that strange way that people &quot;know&quot; each other but have never talked.  After a few months, we were saying &quot;bonjour&quot; to each other, and sharing a smile.  I would be honestly surprised if the man suddenly decided to shot me!  Would that be a common thing to do in the U.S.A. ?')
