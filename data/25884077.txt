I didn’t immediately see anything relevant at the time, so I then looked to see if onlydevs.com was available, which it wasn’t – parked by some domain shark. But the service I used for looking for domain availability suggested only.dev which is available and I was like oh neat but then I saw the price that it would cost and it was too much for me.<p>Only.dev would cost ~870 USD per year which is way to expensive for a domain for some random idea.<p>Anyways, neat to see that someone came built this, and nice that they were able to come up with a name for it that would not cost them an arm and a leg for the domain :p')
