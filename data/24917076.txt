Is this not just the cost of doing business in that specific industry?<p>Typically you&#x27;d just raise your prices to factor in support costs. You&#x27;d have different margins for each industry.<p>Realistically, the reason you&#x27;re unable to raise your prices is because you&#x27;re stuck competing with companies that simply don&#x27;t offer customer service themselves, and hence would undercut you.<p>If there was an appropriate amount of public outrage (and ideally legal repercussions) toward businesses not offering sufficient customer support, then your competitors would also have to increase their prices. You&#x27;d be no worse off, and general customer satisfaction would improve across the board.')
