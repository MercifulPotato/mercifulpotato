Unfortunately, some versions of you will be tortured and let&#x27;s assume that collectively you will be tortured for 10,000 years meaning that the measure your torture is 10,000 &#x2F; 1 billion.  But if you sign up for cryonics you most likely only get brought back in a world that has cured death and isn&#x27;t evil.  If many versions of you do sign up for cryonics say you live collectively for 2 billion years and are only tortured for 11,000 of these years so the measure of you being tortured is 11,000&#x2F; 2 billion.')
