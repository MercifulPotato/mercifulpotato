It doesn&#x27;t mean you have to form your worldview around the first piece of information that reaches you passively. It&#x27;s about being deliberate about news consumption.<p>The way I follow the principle is: if I hear about something and it crosses the threshold of importance, I hit multiple different news pages simultaneously, as well as smaller communities, to ingest multiple points of view and hopefully get a relatively low-bias picture of events. But when I don&#x27;t have a specific important thing to look for, I don&#x27;t read the news sites at all.<p>BTW. I gave up on news ~14 years ago, after realizing that following news stories every evening was causing me great amounts of stress. Every day, I felt the country or the world was about to go down in flames. Well, turns out here we are, 14 years later, and nothing of such proportions ever happened.<p>I&#x27;m also reminded of someone on HN (can&#x27;t remember the handle) who says they&#x27;re reading the news every day - just not the current news, only one week&#x27;s old news. Even taking it as a mental experiment is a good reminder that 90%+ of stuff on the news is utterly irrelevant and unimportant.')
