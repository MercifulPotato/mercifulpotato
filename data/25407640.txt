They busted the coin example.<p>I was super confused by it because it suffers from classic AM-GM inequality mistake. I doubted that Peters would make such a trivial mistake (he didn&#x27;t). He talks about the utility of a single outcome of the game, not the expected value of 10 plays of 10 different games.<p>In the article: Using an arithmetic mean on percent-return doesn&#x27;t make any sense. If you calculate the expected value and mistakenly use arithmetic mean you&#x27;ll get +5%, but it&#x27;s actually roughly -5% when calculated correctly with a geometric mean.<p>Which is why all their silly simulations come out negative.. none of which has anything to do with Peter&#x27;s actual work.')
