It is a pure social construct. Why is anybody entitled to be an &quot;employee&quot; and bitch about &quot;authoritarians&quot;?<p>Everybody is an entrepreneur. If you have nothing, you sell your body and work hours. But that&#x27;s just a contract like every other contract.<p>In any case, if those workers don&#x27;t like the authoritarians, they are free to start their own companies. Then they get to call the shots.')
