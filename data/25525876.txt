Like NY, in London everyone uses the tube. Doesn&#x27;t matter if you&#x27;re rich or a poor sob, there is still public life and shared public space.<p>SF feels, to use tech jargon, &#x27;unbundled&#x27;. I have never met more classist people than Californian tech workers, who seem entirely unaware of their own classism to boot.<p>The ideal world of the SF tech worker I think is an individual driving around in a driverless car (because that means they don&#x27;t need to talk to the driver), ordering their food on Uber eats, having chats on clubhouse. And what&#x27;s weird is how distinct this is from the finance driven culture of NY or London. The SF tech scene is also where I for the first time encountered people talking about &#x27;unschooling&#x27; frequently, which is basically affluent people separating their kids from everyone else but they seemed to be convinced that this is very progressive.<p>Despite folks in finance also making a lot of cash, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever met a trader in the city of London who unschooled their kid.')
