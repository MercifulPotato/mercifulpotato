But it&#x27;s funny how the same viewpoint results in different takeaways. Of course, the topic under discussion is a pedantic one.<p>However, &quot;that&#x27;s true of any type system&quot; just feels dismissive of the current state of the world. The comment you were replying to was pointing out that <i>at present</i>, enabling strict type checking in Python, that has been bolted on as an add-on only recently, will not be able to provide benefits to the same level as the ones in Java and Rust where types are front and center. That might become true tomorrow when all Python libraries have adopted types. Hypothetically, tomorrow the Rust community could also decide to adopt Any as the central type everyone uses. But today, the state of the world is very different. Python is still known as a dynamically typed language where devs can essentially forget explicit types, and Rust is a strongly statically typed language where devs will rarely have to worry about missing types.')
