I work with a guy who has a family, and probably stopped growing career wise years ago. But he makes good money, he enjoys the company, and he seems happy. He has enough depth of skill that if he were to get laid off, he could easily find another job in that area.<p>For a while I looked down at him, like “dude why are you stagnating?” But over time I could see why he’s doing what he’s doing, and it works for him. Maybe I’m wrong and if he got laid off he would have difficulty finding another job. But that’s his choice, relative to living with daily stress of stretching and pushing to the next level.<p>I think the people who are making poor choices are those who are driven by fear - they want to grow, they aren’t, and they are afraid to make a move. Or they fear being disloyal, or whatever.<p>I myself stayed in my second job far too long, and have regretted it since.<p>Since being at my current company, I’ve done something like this, though less formally.  I went thru a period of 6 months where I was having less impact and I felt like I hit a “ceiling”, so I kept pushing for a different role. Then covid hit, some people left, priorities change, and now I have a perfect role and am growing again.  If covid hadn’t happened I think I would’ve needed to start looking. I love my current company so was willing to wait it out a bit longer.')
