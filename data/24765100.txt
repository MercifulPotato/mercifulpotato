I dont really have a better example of oppositional art lately, which adds to the idea that its gone. Maybe SUPERHOT&#x27;s &#x27;obey&#x27; motif may qualify barely.<p>I don&#x27;t want any of that stuff, per se. I&#x27;m just saying its gone.<p>I dont understand how you came to the conclusion that I want institutional power over society, when the advant garde was exactly against that. The institute had power and it was sucessfully rebelled aginst. No longer.<p>If you want a better recitation of art history look up Camille Paglia. Its more provoking and better explained over a lecture than trying to jam it into a comment.')
