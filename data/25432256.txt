For all the anti-trust rhetoric from the US, it&#x27;s unlikely it&#x27;ll accept this level of over-reach without pushing back. Imagine a US company getting approval for a merger from the US and not getting approval from the EU, what happens then? Can China also grant itself this level of influence over American business?<p>We&#x27;re definitely in the beginning stages of a new world order that&#x27;s far less cohesive, with distributed levels of influence.')
