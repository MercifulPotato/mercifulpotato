Item(by='zamalek', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603159110, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24830368, text='&gt; Because even creating an account on discord after clicking a &quot;join server&quot; link only requires you to put in an username.<p>I also want to add: you don&#x27;t have to install a thing either. I played a few games that heavily encouraged community coordination and still remember people backing out of VOIP because of the download (&quot;I&#x27;ll do it when I log off&quot; and then never do). In addition, because of a central API, users can be authenticated with in-game&#x2F;game account info and automatically assigned a role, instead of sitting about waiting for an admin.<p>Discord removes every barrier of entry possible.<p>&gt; to mailing lists that 97% of their users will find fucking annoying.<p>This lets you measure engagement. Discord trusted their product enough to know engagement would happen.')
