First job out of college was working for my alma mater.  It was incredibly rewarding to give back to a place that had given me so much.  I helped build systems and improve efficiencies for fellow staff and faculty.  It was amazing and felt like my dream job.<p>But after a few years, I realized there was a plateau and I was on it.  My technical skills had matched fellow developers around me.  We also were the only software development team on staff and a pretty small one at that. I realized if I wanted to continue to grow and learn I would have to look elsewhere.<p>It was bittersweet as said alma mater holds a special place in my heart, but it was honestly the best thing for me.  Landed a job where I got to learn how to scale systems to millions of clients and what it&#x27;s like to work in a giant Fortune 100.  Wasn&#x27;t my favorite (not totally fulfilling work) and later found something in-between that fits exactly what I need and want.<p>If you&#x27;re like me and on the fence about leaving a good job you&#x27;ve outgrown, I&#x27;d say leave it.  The next one probably won&#x27;t be your dream job, but I bet you&#x27;ll learn a lot along the way.')
