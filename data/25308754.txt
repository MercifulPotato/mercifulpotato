I work as a consultant implementing a specific software package and recently interviewed with a Unicorn trying to switch to mroe general purpose coding.  The difference in the process is night and day.  When I do interviews with consulting firms it&#x27;s almost always someone with significantly more experience than me.  And they are usually pretty free flowing and in depth discussions.<p>The Unicorn interview was 100% checking boxes.  I had 4 leetcode style coding challenges and the only thing that really mattered was solving the problem.  The discussion ones were pretty obviously interviewers asking questions from a piece of paper.  The only goal there was to give them something good enough to write in the box so that it would pass later review.')
