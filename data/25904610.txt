I feel like I heard a more specific name for this genre (or sub genre) a while back, but have since forgotten it. Or maybe &quot;Japanese cyberpunk&quot; is a distinct genre from &quot;cyberpunk&quot;. I really enjoyed some of these, especially <i>Electric Dragon 80000 V</i>.<p>My first exposure to something influenced by Japanese cyberpunk is probably Billy Idol&#x27;s Shock to the System music video - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=lx2fZU5USus" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=lx2fZU5USus</a>.')
