They&#x27;re competely equivalent, but your method makes it seem like you need to remember more state. For example, to test 678101 for divisiblity by 11 you&#x27;d go &quot;678101, 67809, 6771, 676, 61, nope&quot;. With the alternating digits method you go &quot;1, 1, 2, -6, 1, -5, nope&quot; only dealing with one-digit numbers at every step. Maybe with practice you learn to ignore the leading digits until you need them.')
