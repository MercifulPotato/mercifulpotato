I wonder if this is their Great Filter, preventing the emergence of more cooperative, social behaviors among themselves that could potentially put them on the path humans found themselves on.<p>Certainly I think octopus and squid show that intelligence is rather easy to come by so long as it&#x27;s adaptive. Human-level intelligence is probably only adaptive given other factors that preceded leaps in our intelligence. For example, I bet nascent (but theretofore unseen) altruism and culture emerged and created an ecological environment into which our intelligence could expand, after which the process probably accelerated and became more dynamic.')
