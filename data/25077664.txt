Each has approximately 1600 warheads deployed. Even with using 3 warheads per target, that means over 500 cities&#x2F;targets in each country destroyed. Of course neither side would use all their active warheads on the opposing country; they would save some for other nations. Then you have to factor in British and French warheads. Israel, Pakistan, India, China and NK would all join in as well. So perhaps the African continent might be spared, and the majority of South America as well. But full scale nuclear war would eliminate North America, most of Europe, a large portion of Eurasia and the Far East.<p>And then what is left would have to face the fourth horsemen of the Apocalypse; carrying famine, disease, pestilence.<p>Oh and conventional warfare would occur as well.')
