Drones don&#x27;t do air to air combat, the only real use of drones at this time is ground surveillance.<p>That may change some day in the future, but that&#x27;s the reality now.<p>And the F35 can do CAS, sort of, but that&#x27;s not really its role.  We&#x27;ve got a whole host of fourth gen aircraft to do CAS as CAS is nearly always done in an environment where we have full air superiority.')
