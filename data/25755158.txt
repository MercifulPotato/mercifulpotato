Item(by='acdha', descendants=None, kids=[25756408], score=None, time=1610492119, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25754752, text='Beyond being technically incorrect (a firewall with a whitelist still works) you&#x27;re missing the larger point: if you don&#x27;t trust Apple not to surreptitiously access your data, you can&#x27;t rely on Apple-managed security mechanisms to enforce it. Run this command to look at the list of applications which aren&#x27;t subject to the application-level firewall (the lower-level packet filter does still apply):<p>defaults read &#x2F;System&#x2F;Library&#x2F;Frameworks&#x2F;NetworkExtension.framework&#x2F;Resources&#x2F;Info.plist ContentFilterExclusionList<p>That list breaks down into two categories: things which you can&#x27;t safely be on the Internet without (e.g. security updates) and things which aren&#x27;t enabled unless you enable them (iMessage, Photos, Music, Find My Mac, etc.) and load some kind of data you care about into them.<p>In the former case, your options are to enable it or switch to a different operating system — you may choose to schedule them but there&#x27;s no good security policy where you don&#x27;t install updates promptly.<p>In the latter case, people come up with these hypothetical scenarios where someone finds a way to, say, enable iCloud music or photos without your knowledge and then do … something … sketchy with it. The problem with this line of thinking is that if you use those services, you can&#x27;t firewall them and if you don&#x27;t you&#x27;re trying to come up with a scenario where someone can start a service, login using MFA and deleting the notification emails, load your data without prompting, but somehow doesn&#x27;t already have control of your system or an easier way to exfiltrate your data.<p>The person I replied to had an even sillier version: “Access to our personal data by Apple - intentionally or &quot;accidently&quot;”. That asks us to believe that there&#x27;s some way Apple would want to access your data, deploy some kind of attack code which bypasses all of the prompts for each stage, but forget to, say, simply disable the firewall entirely or exfiltrate data through a hostname used for other purposes (such as the software update CDN). It&#x27;s technically possible but it&#x27;s so farfetched that Hollywood screenwriters wouldn&#x27;t touch it.<p>Any time spent playing firewall admin like this would be far better spent enabling MFA on everything you use and reconsidering the other software you install. Defending against the OS vendor is close to impossible and where people in reality lose data it&#x27;s due to third-party apps &#x2F; browser extensions, insecure backups, etc. which are both far more important and much easier to make meaningful improvements.')
