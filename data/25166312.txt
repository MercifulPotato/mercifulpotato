Item(by='mlyle', descendants=None, kids=[25167091, 25166336], score=None, time=1605914319, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25166180, text='&gt; I agree with the gist of this article, but I think if you are not a FAANG as the article suggests, then you probably also are not at a scale where your carbon impact is actually measurable...<p>It&#x27;s not hard to have a startup that does use 100kW of servers and maybe about 150kW total-- HVAC, networking, UPS inefficiencies, etc.<p>There&#x27;s about 450 grams of CO2 emissions per kilowatt-hour from typical electrical generation.  Therefore this is about 600 tonnes of CO2-- not counting other lifecycle costs.<p>On the one hand, this is a tiny smidgen of overall CO2 emissions.  On the other hand, this is about 80 households \nworth of CO2 emissions.<p>As a developer, making this kind of thing 1% more efficient is the same magnitude as completely eliminating your home carbon footprint, and is a whole hell of a lot more plausible to do.<p>I know offsets are &quot;cheap&quot; at $10 per tonne or whatever as the article says.  On the other hand, please don&#x27;t really assume that buying $6k of offsets really does as much good as eliminating 600 tonnes of emissions for realsies.')
