Often dedicating them to pedestrians and&#x2F;or bikes. And adding bike lanes on major roads. But this is old cities without room for making bike lanes.<p>In SF, you could have bikelanes everywhere, give up street parking on one side of street... Or even just make the pavement less broad on broadway :)<p>It&#x27;s a choice, Americans choose not to. To be fair their cities tend to be less dense involve greater distances.')
