Next I suppose someone will show me how to disable those !@#%ing colour control codes that always make my text blink?  I don&#x27;t want colour. I don&#x27;t want syntax highlighting.  I just want my old-school terminal.  Mind you I&#x27;ll probably have to sacrifice my cherished 8x15bold font (still installable after all these years) if I really want to go UTF8.')
