I have no doubt that stuff like this does happen.  An Indian friend (Brahmin, Indian citizen, has lived in the US for over a decade) has also seen this happen sometimes, and tries to avoid reporting chains with too many Indians down the line, even though it&#x27;s unlikely he himself would experience discrimination (he just has no patience for ultra-political, back-stabby environments).<p>But labeling all Indians of a particular caste this way and asserting &quot;this is the truth&quot; is just flat out bigotry, no matter how intellectual and self-effacing your comment sounds.  Are there people like this?  Sure.  Are there a lot of them?  Maybe?  Even probably?  There are also people of other races who act in similar discriminatory ways against other groups, often in much more insidious ways.  Is it the same?  Maybe not, but it doesn&#x27;t matter: painting an entire ethnic group with the same broad (negative) brush based on your limited anecdotal experience is just not okay.')
