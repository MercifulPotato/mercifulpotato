Some folks like the idea of it, some might even use it, but no one _actually_ likes esperanto (OK, except the 1000 &quot;native&quot; speakers the article refers to).<p>There&#x27;s something profoundly unappealing in a hard-to-define subjective sense about engineering a language for humans to communicate with.<p>There&#x27;s plenty of languages in existence that already &quot;just work&quot;. What&#x27;s wrong with English, Spanish and French? One could argue that English has already taken on the role that Esperanto was supposed to have. In the colonial past that might have been French or Spanish. In the distant future an Asian language could become a lingua franca? Or perhaps more radically, effective machine translation could render such efforts unnecessary?<p>Yes, there&#x27;s annoying things about real languages. There&#x27;s inconsistent grammar in English, &quot;Passe Compose&quot; tense in French, one could list hundreds of pain points for every language. But none of these things actually prevent someone from the practical usage of a language and being conversant in the language. Why do we need to make-up another language with iron-clad consistency? It&#x27;s just not necessary.')
