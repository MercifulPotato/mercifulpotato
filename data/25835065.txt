You&#x27;d get essentially an ARM core in an AMD chip with all the surrounding circuitry. They hyped it so much I wondered if they might go further than just that.<p>Further? Maybe a core that could run either ISA, or a mix of both core types. I dunno, but they dumped that (or shelved it) to focus on Zen, which saved them. No doubt the idea and capability still exist within the company. I&#x27;d like to see them do a RISCV chip compatible with existing boards.')
