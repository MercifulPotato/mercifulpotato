It&#x27;s one of the best series to watch to get an broad understanding of the history of science and science itself. I&#x27;ve watched and rewatched them since college in the 90s. All of the videos are on YouTube and they&#x27;re still incredible.<p>Though Connections is entertaining, an afternoon down the Wikipedia rabbit hole on any topic will give you sooo much more information and context than Burke could have dreamed of in 1978. My issue with many of those YouTube channels you&#x27;re talking about is they do little but read for the viewer (NOT 3Blue1Brown, his work is the gold standard of course).<p>This isn&#x27;t a horrible thing, but it would be nice if those channels put a bit more work into synthesizing their content, rather than just regurgitating Wikipedia for views.')
