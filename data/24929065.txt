Inspired by Bill, our VP of Growth, we decided to start sharing our story:\n- How do you get up after 2.5 years of failure day-in and day-out?\n- How do 2 people (now 4 and counting) run a lean $700k&#x2F;year operation?\n- How do we validate a product before we dive in? (there are at least 2-3 products we’ve thrown off a cliff in the last 3 years)\n- How do you make your first dollar?\n- How to juggle between multiple products?\n- How do you scale your team (Rework, I’m looking at you)?<p>This is part 1 of the story.<p>We’re going to be sharing more parts of our story, our next step struggles, cool “growth hacks” we tried and more.<p>Hopefully you gain some insights from this one')
