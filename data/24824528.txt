(www.weopined.com)<p>About us: Opined is a topic-driven platform for people to share and discuss their opinions.<p>Background: We had launched our MVP (website and Android app) with very basic features and functionalities to begin with. Based on the feedback that we have received from our initial 8000+ users, we are now working toward redesigning and revamping our product.<p>Question: We are confused with whether to include a feature right way where users get points&#x2F;coins based on various activities users perform on the platform. We understand that this will help us increase the user engagement and organic growth but does it really required in the coming updates or can it wait for the community to grow and later date, we can introduce the same.<p>Looking forward for constructive feedback.')
