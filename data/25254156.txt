Moving from rural North Carolina to attend college in Chapel Hill, I had to &quot;scrub the rural from my voice.&quot; When I went to graduate school in New York, I tried my best to coach  myself to a &quot;flat American accent,&quot; which carried me well through the midwest when I later moved to Ohio.<p>One of the small joys of my life right now is working with folks with thick accents in positions of seniority. At my previous job, we had a chief scientist who also came from NC. At one point, he told me that he&#x27;d suppressed his accent until he was promoted past the level where anyone could judge how he said things instead of what he said.')
