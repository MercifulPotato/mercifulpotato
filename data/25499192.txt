We&#x27;re gonna get hit with ANOTHER $20K bill because I developed a complication from a procedure that my insurer doesn&#x27;t cover. I will ride this out.&quot;<p>* After 2 weeks of horrific pain, I broke down and went back to the surgical group.<p>* They told me that the bills that I received were probably an error.<p>* I calmly explained to the physician&#x27;s assistant that I had neglected dealing with the complication as a DIRECT result of receiving those bills and I not-so-subtly implied that there might be a lawsuit coming their way.<p>* Within 20 minutes of leaving the surgical group, I got 3 phone calls from different people at the hospital expressing deep apologies and rescinding the bill.')
