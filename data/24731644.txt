But, if I say &#x27;this is a table&#x27; you can come and check the truth of it.  In the objective world, I can confirm a thing and say &#x27;I know&#x27;.  I can tell you how I found out, and you can check the veracity of my statement.<p>If, say, I have a box, and I say &#x27;inside the box is a potato&#x27;, in the context of what we are talking about you have a couple of options.  You can check (verify) whether that&#x27;s true.  Or you can accept it as true without checking.<p>I&#x27;m saying, everyone - EVERYONE - is accepting claims all day long, without any proof.  No one is checking.<p>And this has become the basis of people&#x27;s reality.  A consensus group think determined by what is presented on a screen.')
