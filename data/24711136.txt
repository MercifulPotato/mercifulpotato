The <i>latency</i> improvements are commonly something around that, but the total page loading performance will tend to be better because you get proper multiplexing.<p>But then you may say, why do we need this instead of HTTP&#x2F;2, which had proper multiplexing? Well, it improves things a bit further, commonly improving throughput and latency by 1–10% if I’m recalling the right figures; but more importantly, it fixes the TCP head-of-line blocking issue that made HTTP&#x2F;2 often actually perform a <i>lot</i> worse than HTTP&#x2F;1.1 on low-quality connections.<p>I know of sites that have held off on HTTP&#x2F;2 or rolled it back because it made things measurably worse for some users, and of sites that split things across domains with some HTTP&#x2F;1.1 and some HTTP&#x2F;2, deliberately, purely because of the TCP HOLB issue. HTTP&#x2F;3 fixes that, so that it should no longer be a question of whether you make things faster for some users at the cost of others—you can instead make it faster for everyone.')
