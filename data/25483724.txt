Item(by='disown', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608436172, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25479888, text='&gt;  Here&#x27;s what&#x27;s on nytimes.come right now:<p>What&#x27;s your point? You could make the same argument on every propaganda outlet. Do the same thing for fox news, xinhua, al jazeera, rt, etc.<p>It&#x27;s naive to think that propaganda necessarily means lies. It&#x27;s half-truths, excessive coverage, ignoring of topics, etc.<p>&gt; The happy medium is: know when a newspaper was in a position to know the truth and trust them if they were, or if the article explains its evidentiary basis in convincing detail.<p>No. That&#x27;s the childish naive view. You should know that every newspaper is an agenda driven propaganda organization serving the interests of the elites ( after all it is the elites who created these newspapers ) and judge accordingly. No newspaper is deserving of trust or should be trusted because their primarly goal is to deceive. Anyone who trusts a newspaper or a politician is a moron at this point. Just take everything they say with a grain of salt and move on.<p>Certainly the last thing one should do is worship the NY Times which many here sadly do. But then again old people are their target demographic. Easily scared and insecure.')
