You do that by having no lane switching except at entrance intersection.  Does not always work but does sometimes.  Another trick he has used sometimes is 2 lane picking.  Basically you can only 1 lane at a time.  The thing will sometimes get confused and try cutting across 3 lanes of traffic holding up all 3 lanes.  He usually stacks 2-3 of the 1 lane switches after each other and that sometimes clears it up.')
