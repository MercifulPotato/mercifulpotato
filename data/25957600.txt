I don’t think the current position of GME is a reasonable one, but neither is the situation in which 140% of its shares have been shorted. And it’s not just academic: that makes it difficult for the business to grow. The hedge funds are literally trying to suffocate it into bankruptcy.<p>And yet no one raised the alarm then. No one worried about retail investors with a long position in GME, or the workers who could be laid off. The truth is that almost no one at all cared about the market being detached from reality or the ordinary people left holding the bag when the hedge funds were set to profit. But now that they’re <i>losing</i>, suddenly everyone is beside themselves with worry.')
