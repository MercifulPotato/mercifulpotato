And with it being legal, it&#x27;s a good example of what over-availability of drugs can cause. If cocaine was made legal, sold and marketed over the counter as alcohol and now weed are, I&#x27;m convinced that the ripple effects on society would be absolutely disastrous in terms of public health.<p>Looking at the opioid crisis for example, we can definitely see that a high availability of a substance, backed by a legal capitalist drive of selling stronly said substances, is not something that do good for society in the long run. \nWe&#x27;re talking about more than half a million dead over the past 20 years, with many more millions whose lives are ruined.<p>And we&#x27;re talking about a medically-sanctioned effort, with prescriptions and regulations. If opioids were marketed and sold as alcohol, legal weed or cigarettes are, can you imagine the disaster?<p>I think there are a lot more good people to lose to addiction than there are good people to lose to the cartels and the &quot;war on drugs&quot;. It&#x27;s a tough choice to make as a society.')
