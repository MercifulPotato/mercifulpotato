Item(by='belval', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611119225, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25833781, text='&gt; We think that Amazonâ€™s behavior is inconsistent with the norms and values that are especially important in the open source ecosystem.<p>It is not, Elastic does not have a monopoly on what open-source is or mean.<p>&gt; Our license change is aimed at preventing companies from taking our Elasticsearch and Kibana products and providing them directly as a service without collaborating with us.<p>Therefore they admit that their market strategy was bad to being with. A lot of open-source technology is being used extensively by AWS&#x2F;Azure&#x2F;GCP. I don&#x27;t see the maintainers of Kubernetes, MariaDB, [insert your favorite OSS project] or even Linux arguing that they are somehow owed money for a product they voluntarily distributed under a permissive license.<p>&gt; When Amazon announced their Open Distro for Elasticsearch fork, they used code that we believe was copied by a third party from our commercial code and provided it as part of the Open Distro project. We believe this further divided our community and drove additional confusion.<p>Then sue them and be done with it.<p>Every time this particular subject comes up I get slightly riled up because it is just a display of misplaced after-the-fact outrage over poor business development planning. Elastic grew because of that open source license and benefitted from a wide adoption because of it. Now that they realized that giving away software isn&#x27;t a great way to make money they pull this bait-and-switch and expect &quot;the community&quot; to blame the big bad company.')
