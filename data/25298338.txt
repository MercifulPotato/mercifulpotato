The kernel exposes more-or-less the low-level API of the GPU chip itself.  So, an application that wants to use the GPU without tying itself to a specific GPU will use the OpenGL API&#x2F;ABI, and link against libGL, and then when installing drivers you&#x27;d install the appropriate libGL for whichever graphics card you have, and libGL would implement OpenGL on top of the low-level API exposed by the in-kernel driver for that GPU.  (The assumption that most platforms will work this way, not just the Linux kernel, is baked in to the spec of OpenGL.)<p>On Windows (at least back in the days when I was kinda familiar with Windows), that&#x27;s pretty much how it really worked: when you installed the drivers for your GPU, a large part of that was just it plopping in its own libGL.  A growing part of libGL is actually hardware-neutral OpenGL-related code, and most hardware vendors hold their libGL close to their chest because they&#x27;re competing on optimizing the hardware-neutral OpenGL code in their libGLs almost as much as they&#x27;re competing on actual hardware.  But in the FOSS world, where the code isn&#x27;t a secret, all that hardware-neutral OpenGL code can actually be shared between the libGLs for different GPUs, so we&#x27;ve ended up with pretty much just one libGL that supports all the GPUs: Mesa.  So Mesa is both the graphics card driver and the hardware-neutral part of OpenGL.<p>Now, as much as I would like it to be, GNU&#x2F;Linux isn&#x27;t just the &quot;FOSS world&quot;, we still have proprietary things here: For many years you had to choose between Mesa or your hardware vendor&#x27;s proprietary libGL, most notably NVIDIA&#x27;s.  Eventually NVIDIA realized that it was problematic to ask users to remove Mesa, especially with the growing occurrence of multi-GPU systems.  So NVIDIA coordinated with Mesa to create libglvnd (lib GL vendor neutral dispatch), which can be the libGL, but is thin shim that will dispatch to the &quot;real&quot; libGL implementation (NVIDIA&#x27;s or Mesa&#x27;s) as appropriate, so that they can be installed side-by-side.')
