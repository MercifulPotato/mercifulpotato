Presumably a &#x27;growth hack&#x27; to get more users.<p>The pizza place, seeing the difference, bought pizzas for $16 and received $24 from Door Dash, so for each purchase they were $8 better off.<p>They also ordered plain pizza dough in larger quantities, for more profit. Presumably because they didn&#x27;t have to actually make the full pizza.')
