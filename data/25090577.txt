The failures are eliminated in a process akin to natural selection of species.<p>Capitalism doesn&#x27;t do that either. This entire comparison is a category error.<p>In this discussion, capitalism is being conflated with markets and socialism with planned economies. Neither of those conflations are valid.<p>&gt; the only form of socialism that capitalists oppose is the one where socialists restrict the form in which people own productive capital.<p>That is all forms of socialism. It&#x27;s the only thing socialism is consistently about.<p>&gt; all those alternative forms of socialism you advocate are free to exist in a free market<p>No they aren&#x27;t. They&#x27;re fundamentally incompatible with the theory of a free market. They are all focused on the abolition of private property.<p>&gt; but they are as rare as hen&#x27;s teeth (not to say nonexistent). why is that?<p>Because when they get a footing they&#x27;re actively attacked by capitalists. Economically attached with sanctions, invaded, coup&#x27;d, bombed, etc.<p>Rojava is doing an experiment in communalism as we speak. Turkey is bombing it once the US got what they wanted from Rojava (fighting ISIS). Chile elected Allende, who was coup&#x27;d within two years by CIA-backed Pinochet. EZLN survives through the weakness of the central Mexican government and their relative irrelevance to capitalists.<p>Most political systems do not actually allow for the election of such parties to power. They have powerful propaganda campaigns baked into their education and mass media systems, with bourgeois infighting characterized as the extent of acceptable debate. Many force a two-party duopoly where only bourgeois parties have any chance of winning. Many outlaw socialist&#x2F;communist parties or kill and harass their leaders. Many aren&#x27;t democracies at all and would require an ideological military process to establish it - and have their opposition strategically funded by Western powers.<p>There are many reasons that ruling powers maintain that power.')
