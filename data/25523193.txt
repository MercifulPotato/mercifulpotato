Lots of successful software began as an incomplete and ugly version of what they became. So, solve your initial issues as quickly as possible to not lose motivation (e.g. plug an auth library that you don&#x27;t have to spend too much to write code for, use Heroku&#x2F;Digital Ocean App Platform&#x2F;Vercel for deploys) and ship something. After that point, you officially become a web developer who adds features to their product :)')
