For example even if you have a Confederate flag or a picture of Stalin outside your house, the local electric and water companies are not allowed to turn off your service as long as you are paying the bill.<p>TIL that this is due to the implied monopoly. I think the difference is that electricity and water are required for survival but internet isn&#x27;t so it isn&#x27;t regulated as such. This can also be extended to the difference in buying milk (walk in and pay cash) vs. buying alcohol (need a <i>current</i> govt issued ID).')
