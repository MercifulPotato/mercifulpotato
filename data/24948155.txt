Living in the suburbs? Yes, sure.<p>Couple years back someone stole a bunch of prescription drugs out of my neighbor&#x27;s car (pharmacist - they were for his job), police wouldn&#x27;t touch it.  Now they&#x27;re even less likely, because the city isn&#x27;t prosecuting as much.<p>And by not as much, I mean even lower than where we were at last year.  Seattle went from a &gt;80% prosecution rate in 2007 to a ~50% prosecution rate for non-traffic in 2017.')
