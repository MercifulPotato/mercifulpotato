I use it to follow a few people who make stuff outside of Reddit but post intermittently on their respective subreddits. I don&#x27;t use it at all for following my actual friends.<p>* Various features that prevent one subreddit from raiding others. np links are one, but there are others.<p>* Subreddit CSS.<p>* Mods being able to hide scores and the downvote button on their subreddit.

Can mitigate the natural tendency for a group to become an echochamber.<p>* Some of the features of reddit Gold are pretty good but considering you have to pay for them, they ought to be.<p>* Buying rewards is probably the least bad monetization scheme they could have come up with.<p>* While their image and video hosting is kinda crappy, it is there and it seems like imgur had to get less aggressive about forcing you to get an account.')
