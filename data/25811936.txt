Item(by='least', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610900338, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25808789, text='&gt; It <i>seems</i> possible given an 12.9 inch iPad Pro only weighs 1.4lbs \nThe iPad Pro&#x27;s weight jumps up significantly if you have to add a keyboard and trackpad to the mix. Though personally I would welcome a tablet mac with no included keyboard since I use an ergonomic keyboard the vast majority of the time anyway.<p>&gt; and other manufacturers have entries in that range.<p>The one that comes to mind is the LG Gram series, of which they make a lot of compromises in order to accomplish their weight goals. Opening up the chassis of the LG Gram 17 and 15 you&#x27;ll see a lot of empty space and a battery that is much smaller than it could accommodate. I think it&#x27;d be doable if apple made a 16 inch variant with the m1 chip in it but I&#x27;m not sure that you could without making similar compromises that LG does.<p>Personally for a 16 inch laptop I&#x27;d rather have longer battery life and processing power which I think more closely aligns with people who prefer the larger form factor anyway. Still, it&#x27;d be nice to have options!')
