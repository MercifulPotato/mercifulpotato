Normally when there have been too few people who knew a section of code, it was because:<p>- The area of code has a high ramp up,  high risk, and few new work incentivizing ramping up on it.<p>- The curse of knowledge makes it hard for the person familiar with the code to know what is needed for others to understand it.  Incentives are needed to encourage learning by others to force the maintainer to better understand how to explain things.  This isn&#x27;t a judgement on the person in their general inability to write code for humans nor is it about obfuscation.')
