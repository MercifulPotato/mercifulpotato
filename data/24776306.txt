However, Spotify and Jones aren&#x27;t in direct business (making money off their business deal together). I&#x27;m fine with Spotify and Rogan doing business.<p>It&#x27;s not that I go around worrying about what&#x27;s said in every song and podcast on Spotify, it&#x27;s rather whether I agree with Spotify&#x27;s business practices or not. I wish Spotify told Rogan to stop having conspiracy theorists on his show (unless they are critically exposed), but I don&#x27;t consider Alex Jones as being a part of Spotify&#x27;s business model because he is a guest in one of their pods.')
