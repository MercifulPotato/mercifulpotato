It shows links you have bookmarked within the app for further filtering. You can bookmark a link by clicking on the black bookmark icon at the bottom of the link.<p>I&#x27;ve been thinking about a similar public boards feature, and I certainly think it would be useful to implement something like that.<p>Interesting to hear your viewpoint on this, it seems like most people are content with the tools they&#x27;re using. Do you think something like a webclipper would help the project? This would allow you to add links directly as you are on the page, eliminating the process of actually copy-pasting it. I think this would make the process easier and actually make SeeLink more seamless to use.')
