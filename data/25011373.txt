It has the bones to be great, it just needs a lot of UI and UX polish, and in open source those things always seem to attract the least passion (which is okay! if people work on something for free and of their own accord, they can pick whatever they want to work on). If some serious industry dough was being poured into GIMP, they could pay people to work on the less-fun bits.<p>Tbh they also should ditch the NIH attitude. Yes, sometimes Photoshop&#x27;s behaviour or keybinds are more convoluted than GIMP&#x27;s, but people have Photoshop&#x27;s quirks ingrained and making the transition easier is what counts. Blender has an amazing &#x27;industry keybinds&#x27; option.')
