Any US citizen can go to their local DMV and get a state issued ID.<p>What it does do, is restore just a small amount of confidence in the election process, something that is woefully lacking, people are so disillusioned with how far the divide in the US is, that half of them believe the Russians planted the current president via election fraud, and the other half believed that the current president&#x27;s loss in the recent elections is invalid due to fraud.<p>Lack of confidence in elections, eventually leads to revolutions, voter ID is a small token of a way to restore some of that confidence and to assume people are too poor or uneducated to get a state issued ID, is &quot;White mans burden&quot; under a different guise.')
