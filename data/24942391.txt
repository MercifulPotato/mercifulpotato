Each place is keeping it&#x27;s own records.<p>If you go to Joe&#x27;s house and Joe makes a note that you came to his house, then you go to Bob&#x27;s house and Bob makes a note that you came to his house, nobody is stalking you. Each individual is keeping track of who visits them. That is not stalking.<p>Yes, <i>maybe</i> later on, the government or someone else could come along and ask to see each person&#x27;s records of who visited them. But that is <i>their</i> information to share or not share. You went to <i>their</i> place! If someone comes into your place of business or residence, does the record of that person visiting you not belong at least partially to you? Are you not allowed to keep track of who enters your own property?')
