Item(by='apostacy', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610026042, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25664508, text='&gt; The rioters&#x2F;protesters are largely white as opposed to the more-diverse BLM protesters (more on that later)<p>&gt; And of course the irony here, when compared to the BLM protests, is that if a sizable segment of these rioters&#x2F;protesters weren&#x27;t racist they would understand that this is how Black American have felt _for a couple of hundred years_.<p>Why is what people look like so important to you? It sounds as if you are saying that if a group of thousands of black Trump supporters did exactly the same thing, it would be ok. And that the BLM rioters over the summer were somehow more acceptable because they were more diverse.<p>How is that not pre-judging people by how they look?\nWhenever I ask people this, they essentially tell me that while they can&#x27;t know exactly what an individual is like by their skin color, they can use skin color as a proxy for other characteristics, and make inferences about how that person has been treated in life by how they look.\nSo in a roundabout way, yes, they are making unjustified pre-judgements based on people&#x27;s skin color.<p>Is this really ok?<p>You can see interviews with David Duke where he clarifies that he doesn&#x27;t hate <i>every</i> black person, he just assumes that black people in general are not compatible with our society, but that there are individual exceptions to this. Klansmen will tell you in interviews that they don&#x27;t hate black people purely because of how they look, but how they act, and that they are using their skin color to infer how they will act.<p>Height is a visible characteristic that is strongly correlated with success in life, do you use that to judge people as well?<p>The truth is that purely through numerical probability you can make pre-judgements about people based on their appearance. I for one however go out of my way not to. That doesn&#x27;t mean that I am blinding myself to people&#x27;s physical characteristics or trying to erase them of course. It merely means that I won&#x27;t condemn or excuse people&#x27;s actions because of how they look.')
