You&#x27;re trying to be cool with Klaatu, but your favorites are the same as everybody else&#x27;s..<p>You&#x27;re stuck in the early 2010s. You must have peaked right around Ninja Sex Party&#x27;s Under the Covers.<p>That&#x27;s it. I&#x27;m done.<p>I need to go recalibrate my taste levels.<p>Shutting down.&quot;<p>Yeah, I&#x27;m a 90&#x27;s kid who listened to their parents&#x27; music from the Classic Rock stations they always had on. If anything, I&#x27;m more stuck in the 70s; the early 10s is just when I stopped paying much attention to new music, though my wife is trying to change that. You can&#x27;t shame me, A.I.!<p>What&#x27;s funny to me, is that I actually discovered Klaatu via Spotify. I&#x27;d never heard them before, but they came up in one of my weekly playlists, and (obviously) I took quite a liking. &quot;Calling Occupants&quot; was my #1 song of 2020.')
