Per resource type&#x2F;experience etc, per week (per day for &lt; week of effort) -- typical for software dev jobs where the change requests and evolution can destroy you otherwise.<p>2. Results based billing -- Used when we were handling more of the process, e.g. helping to bring product to market, marketing, content, ads, campaign management, product placements etc<p>We mostly used a combination of the two as we matured and wanted to start make more than just a percentage on time, which to be honest is a hard way to make money and doesn&#x27;t scale nicely.<p>Results (revenue) based billing is awesome but can also leave you hanging a little sometimes, so structure and terms are really important.  Results&#x2F;revenue billing is the way to make much better margins and not be tied to a persons time, but recognize it isn&#x27;t without risks.  Terms are critical and I generally only did these with U.S. based companies because of legal &amp; tax complexities.')
