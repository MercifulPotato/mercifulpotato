I feel productive, but in reality, it&#x27;s superficial knowledge, and spending time here is time I don&#x27;t spend on actually working on my goals.<p>In the end, it&#x27;s all about balancing the pros and cons. For Facebook, Instagram, it&#x27;s easy, I don&#x27;t use them. For Twitter, I focus exclusively on tech so that I don&#x27;t end up in a pointless yet vicious fight. For HN, it&#x27;s spending 10 minutes on the top articles, keeping up with important industry news every second day.')
