But my COGS going down has only partial bearing on what my customer pays me.  I charge my customers the maximum I can get them to pay me, and my suppliers do the same to me.<p>&gt;SV paid high prices because the explosive growth and geographic constraints made housing prices very high, therefore salaries had to go up to entice people to come. Rising salaries were not based on competition for talent alone.<p>SV paid high prices because they wanted to hire people in a specific geographic area, thereby lowering the supply of labor they had to choose from. If SV expands their supply of labor, and SV thinks it can get the same output from different supplier willing to accept less, then they will choose to do that.')
