It might have been Bob Palmer, but I don&#x27;t think he was ru(i)nning the company until the early 90s.<p>Ken was a frugal and deeply religious man.  The first time I met him, he was picking up trash in the parking lot outside the Mill, and he offered to hold the door for me because I was carrying a stack of books.
