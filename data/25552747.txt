Problems&#x2F;Environments are formulated in a way where methods can be applied easily (i.e. Markov decision process) and thus the solutions are directly connected to the way the problem is formulated.<p>Deep learning is used for function approximation and is not in contrast with evolutionary computation. You can train a neutral network policy (mapping states to actions) with an evolutionary algorithm, but most of the success has come from methods that utilize the internal structure of the problem as mentioned earlier and evolutionary algorithms do not, which is what makes these optimization strategies both weak and powerful.')
