I guess you would need temperature stable viral RNApol to do direct &#x27;RNA&#x27; amplification. Not sure if that exists or if it&#x27;s even possible due to RNA instability. As you say not so worthwhile due to high errors.<p>Producing RNA from DNA amplicons (PCR products) makes sense, I&#x27;m curious if that is the source of material from in the vaccines, or if it&#x27;s artificially synthesized?<p>Would that be a trade secret?')
