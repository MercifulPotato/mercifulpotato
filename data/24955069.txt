It&#x27;s true that code is one of the things that keeps it &quot;all&quot;. However, it&#x27;s not the best place for documentation or even storage of that knowledge. Code changes.<p>Tests are what you need to invest in. When you test all of you business use cases in an abstract (perhaps even no-code) way, you are truly independent. You can rewrite the system very quickly, if you had a test-suite that allows for quick iteration (TDD style) and does not depend on implementation details.<p>Given just the code? Well good luck migrating to another cloud vendor. You will probably introduce one million bugs on the way.')
