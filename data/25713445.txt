Furthermore, the later video where he said that the trespassers would be prosecuted is clearly scripted&#x2F;edited (from the monotone and cuts in the filming), and likely happened because of some strong-arming (how else did he go from &quot;we will never concede&quot; to admitting defeat in a single day?)<p>My best guess as to what happened there was that Mitch McConnell (or someone else) figured that he could whip enough votes to impeach &amp; convict if need be and Trump, facing potential consequences, reluctantly decided to play ball.')
