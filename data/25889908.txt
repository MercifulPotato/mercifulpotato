Item(by='ChrisSD', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611470872, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25889677, text='A Rust `bool` is not a WinAPI `BOOL`, for one thing they have different sizes. A wrapper function could translate between the two... but even that&#x27;s not universally possible. Depending on the API, `BOOL` can sometimes have three or more values (e.g. -1, 0 or 1). So whatever happens you need a safe wrapper around the function call that understands what `BOOL` means in this specific context.<p>Incidentally, there is no reason why the metadata can&#x27;t be improved with more information that can be used to create safer wrappers. The winmd format isn&#x27;t restricted to only that which can be represented in C&#x27;s type system.')
