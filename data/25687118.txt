Read the first volume of that and you&#x27;ll understand what is or isn&#x27;t OK in government, even in exceptional times. You&#x27;ll also understand what government actually is, and what politics actually is. You&#x27;ll see what a leader making a difficult and controversial decision, and then taking responsibility for it, actually looks like - in both success and failure.<p>- Leadership: In Turbulent Times, by Doris Kearns Goodwin. A classic which looks at Lincoln, Teddy Roosevelt, FDR, and LBJ at critical moments in their Presidencies and their past experiences which prepared them for success as leaders during a crisis.<p>If you had read those books, or works of a similar quality, you would know better.<p>As it stands it just sounds like you don&#x27;t really understand what responsibility, leadership, accountability, politics, and government actually are.<p>Or, that you&#x27;re not interested in those things actually functioning in a just and democratic fashion.<p>I honestly don&#x27;t know which it is.<p>Not to stereotype but I feel like SO many people on HN don&#x27;t realize just how uneducated they are about history, government, and politics.')
