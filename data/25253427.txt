A major use case for me is visualizing large data sets. I can generate data using any backend (Python, C++, MATLAB, etc.) and want the ability to plot it, zoom in&#x2F;out to a rectangle, filter to a subset &#x2F; go back to the full dataset. Simple 2D plotting, no 3D or hard rendering stuff.<p>In such plotting I find Octave (and to a lesser degree Python&#x27;s matplotlib) super slow compared to MATLAB. To see it, make a scatterplot of 1-5 million points (say, with x and y random, uniformly distributed in [0, 1]). Zoom to a portion a couple of times. MATLAB response is instant, Octave takes seconds. Do the same for 20 million points (which is still a very small dataset by today&#x27;s standards) and forget about interactive plotting with Octave :(.<p>As I said, I still wish Octave the best and hope it succeeds, but with my student days behind me I prefer to just buy an individual license of MATLAB every 5 years or so for my hobby projects.')
