Your chances are probably better than you think, if my experience is any indication, but your approach may be way off.<p>1) Start lifting weights. Helps boost your confidence and your T levels, making you more attractive.<p>2) If you do not yet practice the rudiments of grooming, do so. Shower every day, shave, comb your hair. Make sure your clothes are clean and you don&#x27;t smell.<p>3) The key to engaging with women is: when you encounter a new one, always be kind to her and treat her with the basic amount of courtesy and respect due another human being but no more. Avoid fawning over her, no matter how cute or hot you find her. Keep it in the back of your brain that she&#x27;s just a woman, just a human, and may be as messed up as you are if not more so. Hold the door open for her, help her load her groceries, or whatever -- then disengage. If you get a smile or thank you, savor it. A smile or thank you from a pretty girl is a tiny gift, and we accept gifts graciously and appreciatively without hoping for more.<p>It&#x27;s kind of this weird tension. You can&#x27;t give off &quot;looking for a date&quot; vibes. If a girl is to any extent cute she will know it, and she will be able to use that to control the interaction if you seem too desperate. The vibe to cultivate is basically pleasant, but somewhat aloof. Make her feel like she has to work to prove herself to you. If she&#x27;s at all interested, she <i>will</i> put in the work. You&#x27;ve gotta do this with multiple women, keeping them in your friend circle while not giving off thar you want to get closer -- that is not until <i>they</i> signal they want the same (and they will in unambiguous terms!). And it may take years to get there. Anyone who tells you finding a good partner is quick or easy is selling something.')
