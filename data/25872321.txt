Maybe.  <i>Should</i> it be legal?  Is it ethical?  Is it good for society?  These are questions that people should ask.<p>Are you saying that Google <i>shouldn&#x27;t</i> pay for the works they are quoting?<p>This action by the Australian Government seems to be based on the idea that what Google is doing is unfair, and so the law should be changed.  Google is fighting against it because they say it&#x27;s legal, and it shouldn&#x27;t matter that they make a lot of money from it.<p>Copyright as a concept seems to be fair game on HN for many reasons.  Maybe this is another place where it should be reformed.  Maybe the amount taken from a single work is not the issue. Maybe what should be an infringement of copyright is having a &quot;work&quot; that is primarily taken from other works, even if only in small pieces.<p>I have no skin in this game, I have no axe to grind, but I do feel that the situation is unbalanced, unfair, possibly unethical, and needs to be reviewed and possibly changed.<p>I&#x27;m no Oracle ... I don&#x27;t know what the right answer might be.')
