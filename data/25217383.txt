Lots of companies have to rebrand, especially when their leadership and&#x2F;or product have changed.<p>The core problem here is that the article seems to be an attempt to fix Mongo&#x27;s reputation through misleading PR (e.g. using different definitions of words than everyone else in the industry), rather than technical solutions.<p>It&#x27;s typical of Mongo as a company, though. They don&#x27;t have technical merit and try to make up for it by trying to convince us all that the sky is green.')
