There are multiple root causes, and the bad software is one of them.<p>There are multiple <i>intermediate</i> causes, and all of them are the responsibility of the human bureaucracy—including, to the extent it contributes, the selection, use, and failure to correct bad software—and all of them stem from <i>one</i> root cause, to wit, that the bureaucracy faces insufficient consequences for it&#x27;s failures and thus lacks motivation to do it&#x27;s job well.<p>Now, were the analysis being performed <i>on behalf of</i> the bureaucracy <i>because they had decided to do their job</i>, rather than being part of a discussion outside of them, the causes which are intermediate from a global perspective would be root causes, sure. Context matters.')
