A plumber&#x2F;carpenter&#x2F;electrician works to code under threat of losing their license. Additionally your building could be exempt from code for numerous reasons (grandfathered&#x2F;historical, outside of city limits and no county building codes&#x2F;etc.)\nDevelopers and Software Engineers don&#x27;t have this threat.')
