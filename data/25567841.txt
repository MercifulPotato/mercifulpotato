Above you falsely accused me of dishonestly misrepresenting the initial capacity limit.  I believe I demonstrated in an objective and indisputably way that you were mistaken.  Rather than acknowledging your error about Bitcoin and the inappropriate insult, you&#x27;ve simply changed the subject.<p>What purpose is there to continuing the discussion if you&#x27;re going to do that?<p>&gt;  clearly intended for this to be a temporary limit<p>This is in a thread with him loudly urging people to NOT change it, in a message responding to someone saying that it could never be changed.  Saying that it isn&#x27;t impossible to change something does not mean that it is merely temporary.  A concrete retaining wall is permanent yet can still be torn down if people choose to do so.<p>What do you think of his much later statement that &quot;Bitcoin users might get increasingly tyrannical about limiting the size of the chain so it&#x27;s easy for lots of users and small devices.&quot;?<p>&gt; I did try to have an open discussion on r&#x2F;Bitcoin, but what I found was that answers to my questions were removed, and even my questions were removed.<p>Where?   If you demonstrated the kind of apparent bad faith approach you&#x27;ve done so here-- perhaps you should consider that you might have earned it?<p>If not, you might have just been made roadkill by an overactive immune system--  that subreddit was utterly mobbed by an endless stream of shill sockpuppet accounts arguing a particular agenda.  :(<p>&gt; I did see that Adam Back was challenged to a public debate on these issues<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Sealioning" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Sealioning</a> But also... who cares what he thinks?<p>If you wanted to see debate there are literally hundreds of kilobytes on the subject written by people who have been actually involved with developing the Bitcoin system.')
