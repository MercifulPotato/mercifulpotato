That&#x27;s fine.<p>But I was working for a hardware manufacturer too (One Laptop Per Child), making its own laptop designs and doing board bringups on them, and when the point is to test real hardware you don&#x27;t get shortcuts like using a VM.  :)<p>The shortcut we had for trying to maintain productivity while testing real hardware was actually to stop using Linux: we had a port of Open Firmware that was the first thing run on new hardware, and then running tests (e.g. bisecting how large the timeout on a device request needed to be) could be done in a live OFW Forth REPL, and then ported to Linux from there.')
