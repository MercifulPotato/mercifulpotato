At this point, pretty much any string <i>could</i> be a valid email address.  You can certainly run a bunch of tests and get a decent signal, but it&#x27;s a lot of work, and if you reject an email address without testing it you&#x27;re going to cause someone some trouble at some point.  It&#x27;s a lot easier and more accurate to just accept the string and try to send email to it.')
