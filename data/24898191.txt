I can text, call, talk, email her and say “let’s get bob, mary and finance on the phone at 4” and she’ll move stuff around to make sure that happens. I can also delegate complex administrative tasks that need to be done in my name.<p>When I’m at the dentist, I usually do a “hey Siri” to book it as it saves time. At home, “hey Siri turn on the lights” is helpful. It’s magic, but not the same.<p>The tech companies try to frame this stuff “bigger”, but in doing so they create an unreasonable expectation. Google home, Siri, Alexa are amazing, but we bitch and moan about them as a result.')
