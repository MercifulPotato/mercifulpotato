This is about following the law&#x2F;regulation.<p>Customer service can indeed be variable, and it&#x27;s up to the company to pick their approach (terrible&#x2F;no CS and low prices or very good CS and higher prices).<p>When it comes to complying with the law&#x2F;regulation, if your company is bound by those laws then it should comply just like every other company does. &quot;Following the law&quot; shouldn&#x27;t depend on how much you pay; the companies expect the customer to follow the law, so the reverse should apply too.<p>The problem seems to be that the current law&#x2F;regulation isn&#x27;t up to scratch and allows companies to act in bad faith and get away with it (the author is indeed correct that all of this can be made easier through automation and the airline not doing so should be considered obvious evidence of bad faith).')
