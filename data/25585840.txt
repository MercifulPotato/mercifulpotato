Item(by='jcranmer', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609360894, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25581057, text='&gt; In the case of disused (bike trail) rail corridors around here (Ottawa) I think the chief concern would be NIMBY pressure. Going from a quiet bike trail to a busy commuter train route... OMG property values!<p>About a decade ago, CN bought out the EJ&amp;E to use as a bypass around Chicago. The communities near the tracks were outraged and tried to block the deal, since it would transform the railway from a low-traffic route to a much higher-traffic. Yeah, there&#x27;s serious NIMBY pressure on merely upgrading a train route; reconverting a local trail is going to be seriously worse.')
