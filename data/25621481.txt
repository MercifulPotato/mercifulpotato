I&#x27;m validating if people are actually interested in something like this, so it&#x27;s still very limited. Your projects are now live as soon as you are creating a project. I think will add a &quot;publish&quot; button soon.<p>I&#x27;m going to look into custom domains! A custom subdomain was my MVP version, but having a custom domain is something people definitely want so hopefully I can add that options soon.<p>I will also investigate how much work it would be to add a &quot;export to HTML&quot; button.')
