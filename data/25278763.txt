Its hilarious to go online today and hear all Trump supporters to scream “fraud” and trying to argue that it has to be fraud since Biden broke all possible records including number of votes, number of black votes etc. Its even more laughable since it comes from exactly the same people who like you claimed huge Trump 2016 victory and were proud Trump broke all the records.')
