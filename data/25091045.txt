If that work needs money then this is the sort of investor you approach.<p>Back when I was doing startup stuff (about 10 years ago) we called this a seed round. You could raise with literally just an idea on paper - you might have had no prototypes or traction or customers at all. These days you need all those things just to get on to an accelerator. It&#x27;s a bit sad. There were more fun and crazy ideas being worked on when it was easier to get initial funding.')
