Item(by='freeone3000', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607901159, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25401891, text='I&#x27;m not sure I agree with her assessment of quality, nor its importance. Lots of FOSS software is written with the author&#x27;s view of quality in the forefront - for instance, the GNU HURD project and NixOS are <i>absolutely huge</i> on properly handling error conditions returned from library calls and syscalls, and well-defined interfaces and interactions. We see a similar dedication to well-formedness in the KDE project.<p>But even in <i>this</i> limited realm, these projects don&#x27;t have primacy. People use GTK, despite it writing literal screenfuls of warnings to console on every application launch. systemd has taken over linux, despite a lack of forethought of how its systems interact or are formed.  So it appears that well-formedness has nothing to do with success or adoption of a project.<p>In the closed-source world, the most popular operating system since Windows 95 was Windows. The inherent quality of Windows, while continually improving, appears to be completely irrelevant. In fact, Windows 10 has a lower marketshare than ever, despite crashing less. For individual programs, Photoshop has continually been a crashy, buggy mess, but it&#x27;s only since they changed licensing schemes has Clip Studio Paint caught on. Word has continually outperformed StarOffice, no matter whether StarOffice handled its COM exceptions nicer or not.<p>The most important thing for a computer system appears to be universality, followed by featureset, followed by user interface. Sadly (or not?), the only &quot;quality&quot; that appears is when the failures are enough to get in the way of the user -- and even then, projects such as Brave for Android and Sharepoint continue to be widely used! Because they offer something no competitor can. Reliability may end up being a tiebreaker, but for most user-facing software, it simply isn&#x27;t as important as meeting your goals on the feature matrix.')
