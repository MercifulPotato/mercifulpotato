When I willingly contribute to open source with no compensation, it&#x27;s with the understanding that it&#x27;s because my contribution is available to anyone under the same terms, I&#x27;m contributing to a &quot;commons&quot; open to all, willingly for the public good.<p>If anyone wants to use it for profit-making purposes, that&#x27;s generally fine with me, because everyone can on an equal basis.<p>If instead the software is licensed such that one company has special rights to profit off of it that others don&#x27;t... why would I donate my contributions for free to that company? Shouldn&#x27;t I get a cut?')
