It is usually AL “always” which is omitted in assembler. There wasn’t any limit on how many conditional instructions you could have in sequence, but a branch is usually faster than three or so conditionals.<p>It gets really fun when you combine condition codes with comparisons, or with ALU instructions that set the processor status bits: you can do some quite intricate logic in very little space.')
