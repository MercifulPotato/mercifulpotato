It&#x27;s not a very &quot;mob&quot; town.  But my parents put me in a private elementary school, and there was this one kid who went there who arrived every day in a chauffered limo.  Rumor was that his dad was the mob boss of Salt Lake.  To us, though, he was just another kid - never beat up anybody, never threatened anybody, not treated any different from anyone else.  Come to think of it, he may have kept to himself more than most, but I wasn&#x27;t very socially cued in, so I can&#x27;t be sure.<p>Eventually his dad went on the run.  There were occasional reports that he&#x27;d been seen in a casino in Vegas for a few years, then nothing.<p>So even places that aren&#x27;t mob territory still had some mob presence.')
