We are talking about diaper changes, cooking, feeding, putting to bed, online classes, entertaining them because they can&#x27;t be outside with kids their own age, tantrums, and usual baby stuff. Doing work full-time and taking care of babies full-time is leading to a lot of depression and loss of concentration on the work-front.')
