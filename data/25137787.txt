File storage would be the expensive part. Starting at 10-20TB usable space with slots for more would be nice.<p>The location would either be at my parents&#x27;, as I move often and they have a rack installed (with nothing in it, the internet link isn&#x27;t amazing but should be fine) or it could be colocated at a non-profit FAI (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ffdn.org&#x2F;en" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ffdn.org&#x2F;en</a>). The colocation is probably the most sensible option for the internet link and stability they bring (proper data center context, back-up generators and they have static IPv4).<p>+ long-term encrypted backups to some random service like Backblaze even if I have duplicate storage, I don&#x27;t trust myself enough to do everything properly.<p>The idea isn&#x27;t new, I have already seen a few online (I remember of two but no links). The focus was more around hacker&amp;friend groups, looking like private tilde clubs. Here the idea is to provide services usable by anyone in my family, with a nice identity (I like seeing it as an island, a village or such).')
