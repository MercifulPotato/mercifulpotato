It&#x27;s quite decently polished and supports a <i>ton</i> of devices. Where devices have local APIs, it uses those, so it doesn&#x27;t rely on vendor cloud services unless there is no choice.<p>I use it with TP-Link Kasa smart plugs and Broadlink IR blasters, both of which have usable locale APIs, on an isolated WiFi network with no Internet access (it&#x27;s harder to <i>turn off</i> the cloud stuff for these kinds of things, but as long as I can block it myself I don&#x27;t care if they try and fail to connect to the cloud).')
