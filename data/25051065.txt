My first approach is de-escalation.  That has failed, and I&#x27;ve been attacked by people, and still did not want to hurt those people.  Nor will I allow people to simply beat me up.  I&#x27;ve defended myself by deflecting and avoiding their attacks, using their momentum against them and whatnot; and when necessary, various holds or joint locks.  I&#x27;ve also successfully fled situations where I think others would fight out of a sense of pride.<p>My approach would not work against somebody significantly larger and&#x2F;or more skilled than myself.  Nor is it effective against a group of assailants.  Flight is not an option in confined quarters.  I&#x27;d probably resort to more harmful techniques if I thought my life was in danger.  And I&#x27;d significantly regret doing so.')
