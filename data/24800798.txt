Item(by='murbard2', descendants=None, kids=[24801137, 24801149], score=None, time=1602856243, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24800646, text='Musescore does do a great job and is open source, so there&#x27;s that. Another option is to have users manually upload midi with a proper score attached to some store or community repo with user reviews. It&#x27;s less satisfying as a solution, but it means all it takes is one motivated user for everyone to enjoy the score.<p>For my final point, you can model this as a hidden markov process. You&#x27;re observing notes, but not the user moving his mental &quot;cursor&quot;. Classical filtering algorithms should do well here.<p>Ah, one more missing feature, good scores have fingering, but it gets lost in the midi. I&#x27;m pretty sure fingering can be infered though and this would be pretty powerful. Amusingly, it can also be seen as a filtering problem:<p>- At any given point, a hand can have a finite number of fingerings, and that number isn&#x27;t that large. Give each of them a difficulty.<p>- Now, make that difficulty conditional on the previous hand position.<p>- Run Viterbi&#x27;s algorithm on the score to minimize the difficulty.<p>The difficulty can be obtained from an expert or through some physiological model, but they could also be inferred from an existing body of music sheets.')
