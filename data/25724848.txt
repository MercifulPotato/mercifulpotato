But I do honestly think Uber and Tesla have evaded morally deserved punishments by blaming customers or contract staff who were pretty much doing what everybody would expect to be able to do using the technology as described.<p>&quot;it&#x27;s inevitable that even a responsible _person_ will screw something up&quot; - but that doesn&#x27;t mean we give them a zero consequence break if they kill or injure someone. (We do, however, distinguish between things like murder, manslaughter, and negligence-causing-death. And penalise differently, based at least partly on the ability of the punishment to discourage other people from doing similar things. Perhaps Uber was only guilty of negligence-causing-death for using minimum wage contractors as safety drivers. Perhaps Tesla was guilty of manslaughter by advertising as &quot;autopilot&quot; a thing that drives full speed into offramp dividers?)')
