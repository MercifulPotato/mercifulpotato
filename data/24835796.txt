Is there evidence that the letter really was sent by authorized persons representing the foundation? If it was only sent by email, it has no legal relevance anyway. I would ignore such a letter even if it was really genuine and sent by registered letter, because the request is obviously nonsensical and would hardly stand up in court.')
