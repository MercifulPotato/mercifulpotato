Most of the apps I work with run on Heroku, so I&#x27;d likely end up reaching for their [High Availability Postgres] feature, but nice to know of an alternative if I&#x27;m not on heroku.<p>That said, I don&#x27;t think this would serve the intended purpose here. My specific use case was upgrading the postgres version I was using. To do that we introduced a follower, prevented writes to the primary (with the approach summarized in the post), upgraded the follower, and finally promoted the follower to be the new primary. Automatic failover to the follower during this process would likely confuse things.<p>[High Availability Postgres]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;devcenter.heroku.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;heroku-postgres-ha" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;devcenter.heroku.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;heroku-postgres-ha</a>')
