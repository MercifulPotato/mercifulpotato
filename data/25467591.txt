I like to go in with minimal knowledge. Helps keep story elements a surprise and I&#x27;m not let down about things getting cut.<p>I only ended up buying the game so soon after release because CD Projekt Red is well known in the PC gaming space and because I saw a bunch of friends playing it (which I guess means I got swept up in the tail end of the hype?)<p>Cyberpunk made me remember why I normally wait to buy games. I played it for under 2 hours before requesting a refund. It only performed decently on a GTX 1080 when set to look like a 10+ year old game and the mouse input was atrocious. Felt like there was both input lag and acceleration. Also the dialogue selection controls were pretty stupid. Q&#x2F;E to navigate up and down? Why not W&#x2F;S? Or even better, direct selection with number keys. (I know it sounds minor, but if I&#x27;m going to be making many dialogue choices during the game, it should be ergonomic)')
