So, according to your framing of the issue, doing this would hurt &quot;wealth creators&quot; that sit on a house they inherited (in a growing location by chance), and reward wealth destroyers, like people who build new housing for people to live.  Does this framing seem more useful than the article&#x27;s?<p>It&#x27;s easy to develop a knee-jerk reaction to bad economic ideas that are frequently justified by &quot;fairness&quot;, which IMO is such a fuzzy term as to be pretty much useless.  But this does not seem to be a collection of those ideas, but instead reasonable ones based on examining cause-effect relationships and where current regulations may be leading to negative outcomes.  Do you really mean to object to this?<p>Rather than price being determined by &quot;wealth creation&quot;, I think a more nuanced view is price is determined by supply and demand.  But that the real wealth of countries in the long run is determined by productivity (units of output per unit of labor), and that these things may be correlated but not perfectly so (shortages and inflation make prices go up but don&#x27;t create wealth).<p>Anyway, the article doesn&#x27;t seem to be a call for dramatic expansion of government but rather a call to examine cause-effect relationships and to use existing policy tools in a smarter way, including removing harmful regulations, in the interest having economic opportunity be more widespread.  I think this is exactly the sort of thinking we need, and rejecting it because it sounds a bit superficially similar to bad economic thinking is a mistake.  Bad economic ideas are likely to be the alternative.')
