There are ~14 billion USDT minted, and BTC alone is going for a market cap of 500bi. The top 3 &quot;serious&quot; exchanges are all averaging $1bi+ in daily volume (and if you believe they are doing wash trading, Uniswap alone is in the same ballpark and wash trading there would be very costly). Tether is bad, but to think they are able to prop BTC (and crypto in general) to this bubble is delusional.<p>Also, it&#x27;s interesting how you downplay the fact that the Fed printed 22% of the dollars in circulation in <i>2020 alone</i> with the majority of it destined to bail out banks and surely to end up under control of Wall Street. Also interesting how you seem to be so bothered by the lack of KYC&#x2F;AML of some exchanges and pull the &quot;enabling terrorism&quot; card, yet you see no problem in the Stimulus Bill having 10 million dollars for Pakistan. Perhaps if the crypto projects start saying that the funds are going to gender studies your worries will be eased?')
