Item(by='ChrisMarshallNY', descendants=None, kids=[25988250], score=None, time=1612180918, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25987685, text='One of the reasons I like to open-source my work (even in “source-available” form), is so that there is clear “prior art.”<p>However, I have yet to write an app that has been highly successful, so being copied has not been a problem for me.<p>Seeing the behavior of these scammers, I have no doubt that they would gleefully take my source, tweak the storyboard, and release a clone. They don’t seem to have any sense of shame, at all. Some of these shops have stables of hundreds of apps; each, a minor tweak of other apps in their roster.<p>It is annoying that Apple gives me a hard time for some small cosmetic detail on my app, while rubberstamping these tsunamis of pure, shameless garbage.<p>I do get annoyed by “looks like” scams. A couple of years ago, my wife accidentally purchased a “looks like” app that was basically a screengrab of another app (and was approved on the App Store!).<p>She was able to get the subscription (!) canceled, but it was a pain. Apple also left the junk app on the store.<p>She was also so unnerved by the situation, that she never got the original app, so it shows that these spam&#x2F;scam apps can cause a lot of collateral damage.<p>Getting a refund did not fix the problem.')
