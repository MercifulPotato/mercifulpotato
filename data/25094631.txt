It&#x27;s difficult to say what exactly this kid did since the article is light on detail; it could be an achievement.<p>It&#x27;s quite trivial to build a simple processor in HDL (.v or .vhdl) because the compiler synthesizes the actual digital logic for you. It&#x27;s not much different than C or a functional language like Haskell or OCaml, but with considerations of timing and don&#x27;t cares&#x2F;high impedance.<p>PS: s&#x2F;no more hard&#x2F;no more difficult&#x2F; because &quot;more hard&quot; is always improper when &quot;harder&quot; exists.')
