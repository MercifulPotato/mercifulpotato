Time to find another OS.<p>Apple&#x27;s outside counsel do not take anything for granted.  Post a link to the &quot;cupcake&quot; case and let&#x27;s have a look.<p>iOS is a licensed product.  The license only allows iOS to be run on a single &quot;Apple-branded&quot; computer.  Here is an earlier version:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.apple.com&#x2F;legal&#x2F;sla&#x2F;docs&#x2F;ios6.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.apple.com&#x2F;legal&#x2F;sla&#x2F;docs&#x2F;ios6.pdf</a><p>The license is interesting because all not the bits that make up iOS are written by Apple nor exclusively licensed to Apple; iOS is not 100% proprietary.  What rights does Apple actually have that it can license.  Some parts of iOS come from BSD projects, some come from other open source third party projects, some parts come from Apple, the later some of which have been open-sourced.  The mere fact of a license does not mean Apple will successfully be able to enforce all its terms.  Avoiding legal challenges to them is one way to keep licensees guessing as to their enforceability.  Wanna bet whether this case settles before trial.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;opensource.apple.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;opensource.apple.com</a>')
