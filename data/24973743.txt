Item(by='aeturnum', descendants=None, kids=[24973911, 24973890], score=None, time=1604353162, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24971726, text='&gt;Although environmental regulations and requirements in most European countries are as elaborate as U.S. regulations, the environmental review processes are generally better streamlined, and approval is obtained faster than in the United States.<p>The idea that U.S. regulations are simply administered more poorly than European ones reminds me of the U.S. tax system. For years, anti-tax people in the U.S. (and the tax prep industry) have blocked changes that would simplify filing taxes. They think (correctly imo) people will like taxes less if they&#x27;re hellishly complicated to file. Is something similar has been happening with other regulatory requirements?<p>I would be interested to read about it if anyone has any sources.')
