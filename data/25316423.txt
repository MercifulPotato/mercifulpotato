I thought Mank was incredible. The costume and set designs were great. Gary Oldman, like usual, gave an Oscar worthy performance. Amanda Seyfrieds portrayal of Marion Davies will probably get overlooked but I think it was one of her best performances. Great film, especially if you’ve seen Kane recently. Definitely recommended')
