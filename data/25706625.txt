You hear a lot of people comparing Teslas to Audis and BMWs to point out how poor their paint is, awful panel gaps, and how lacking their interiors are, but I&#x27;ve never heard anyone compare powertrain reliability or quality.<p>The value of a Tesla comes form the advanced telematics and EV powertrain, the later of which is more expensive to produce than what&#x27;s found in an Audi or BMW.<p>In terms of how well the interiors hold up over time, I don&#x27;t think that any of them hold up any better or worse.  My 2+ year old Model 3 looks just as nice inside as the day I got it, I&#x27;d say the same of my friend&#x27;s BMW 5 Series that was about 2 years old when she sold it.<p>In terms of maintenance costs, a Tesla requires maintenance ever 2 years at around $150 a visit.  BMWs typically get free service for the first 3 years, but after that you&#x27;re looking at something like $250 every 5000.  So if you&#x27;re expecting to keep your car for more than 3 years there&#x27;s certainly value in that respect.  The high reliability and low maintenance costs of Teslas also increase their resale value compared to other vehicles.<p>Personally, I find the interiors or Audis and BMWs to be a lot of pomp and circumstance to help their owners justify the price.  There&#x27;s a lot of lights, noise, and different material finishes to make them look impressive but is that better?  I don&#x27;t think so.')
