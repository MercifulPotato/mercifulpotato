The LiquidMotion rotor has volume within that is carries gases, while the Wankel rotor is solid (or at least if it&#x27;s hollow the volume inside isn&#x27;t used). I don&#x27;t recall ever seeing a counterweight on a Wankel but then I&#x27;m not even a little acquainted with Wankels in the field so it could be that Mazda forgot to tell me.<p>There is of course the possibility that this is a Wankel as far as patents would say. As different from a Wankel as a true Hemi is from a regular V8.')
