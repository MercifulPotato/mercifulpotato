For example, setting up GitHub automation so that changes from Git will cause tickets in Jira to transition to the next stage. Or, automating a transition from &quot;Pending Estimate&quot; when a Jira user assigns story points to a ticket. The automation features in Jira are far beyond anything I&#x27;ve ever used before (one might even consider it an &quot;IFTTT for project management&quot;), and on most teams I&#x27;ve been on, very much under-utilized. I can even automate starting the process of development when design is finished, as when the design ticket is marked &quot;Done&quot;, the development ticket it&#x27;s linked to will change to &quot;Pending Estimate&quot;, as it&#x27;s now possible for a developer to estimate how long it will take to implement the given design.')
