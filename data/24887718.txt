It&#x27;s hard to imagine something useful that doesn&#x27;t have either JVM port, or originally written in Java (testing&#x2F;mocking, builders, freaking ORMs, frameworks).<p>It&#x27;s not always good though, in Java world you have to choose between multiple competing tools, while other ecosystems have mostly only one, often adopted from Java version (except Javascript, Rust, they have their own zoos). But IMHO Java is still the nursery for all kinds of tools for development.')
