Because there is a word &quot;designers&quot; in &quot;UX designers&quot;, a lot of designers expanded their credentials to include UX. In my experience, they invariably suck at it (at least the ~5 I had the <i>pleasure</i> to work with).<p>The proliferation of high-fidelity wireframes (and tools like Adobe XD, Figma) is another testament to that; impressive looking designs that hide basic UX mistakes. Low fidelity wireframes would make them obvious, but who wants to look at the &quot;wires&quot; when you can have colors?<p>I think the designers simply prioritize aesthetics over content &#x2F; usability and it is difficult for them to get past that. The best UX designers I have worked with in the past were either engineers or coming from completely unrelated fields.')
