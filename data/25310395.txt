If she asked at that time for a complete list of things to fix, nobody can give it to her because the review isn&#x27;t finished.  Nor can they produce it in a timely matter because it takes time to do the review.<p>Later the detailed feedback is ready.  And if she wanted to submit the paper elsewhere, she could have fixed it and done so.  But by then things have blown up and it is too late.')
