Brilliant for a disease which kills people with median age of 82 years (in the UK). Why would you even design a protocol that looks only at young people?!<p>They used a different protocol in Brazil and South Africa. Why did they use a different protocol in different places? Pfizer and other companies managed with one. Having different protocol is treated as different trials - so the trial in South Africa didn&#x27;t have enough cases and wasn&#x27;t even considered in the EMA authorization. EMA estimates 60% efficacy.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ema.europa.eu&#x2F;en&#x2F;news&#x2F;ema-recommends-covid-19-vaccine-astrazeneca-authorisation-eu" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ema.europa.eu&#x2F;en&#x2F;news&#x2F;ema-recommends-covid-19-va...</a><p>&gt; methodology<p>Ok so the efficacy looks worse but is not directly comparable. That doesn&#x27;t really detract from my point that the trial(s) was not well designed, no? It just wasn&#x27;t given to enough old people.<p>EDIT: Also, the efficacy in preventing asymptomatic infection was only 27% (again with insanely wide confidence interval). So, they designed the trial to measure it, but it doesn&#x27;t do really well at that.<p>&gt; I believe this claim is totally untrue, also.<p>It could be true, could be untrue but it&#x27;s not falsifiable from the data. The confidence interval for efficacy in 65+ is -140.5% (yes there is a minus) - 94.2%. We just don&#x27;t know.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;olivernmoody&#x2F;status&#x2F;1354781400071860230" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;olivernmoody&#x2F;status&#x2F;1354781400071860230</a>')
