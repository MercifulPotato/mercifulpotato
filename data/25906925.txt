My mail client then highlights emails sent to these aliases in green color and shows their description instead of the alias itself in the &quot;From&quot; column of the message list.<p>I always give random aliases to online services, eshops, shipping companies, etc. These private aliases will never receive SPAM, or phishing, unless leaked by the company.<p>Anything that looks like a transactional email from some service, and is not sent to private alias, just gets deleted right away. It&#x27;s not even worth opening, no matter how good it looks.<p>And I can keep my phishing guard up on much lower volume of green emails. It also makes whitelisting transactional email easier, without allowing random SPAM to the Inbox, because filtering based on the &quot;shared secret&quot; per company delivery address will allow in all important email from the company, regardless of how or from what address it was sent.')
