Then I discovered how quickly Caltrans was able to fix that tank truck destruction of the highway in the East Bay. And then I looked at the stuff and realized something: America doesn&#x27;t actually need the infrastructure. It&#x27;s all a jobs program. Because when America needs it, it comes fast as fuck. But the truth is that America doesn&#x27;t need it. You don&#x27;t need high-speed rail (planes are better). You don&#x27;t need that road to be resurfaced (the loss of life and property over the period in question is minuscule). You don&#x27;t need the Central Railway. You don&#x27;t need more interstates. It&#x27;s okay to allow some bridges to fall killing some people.<p>Almost all American infrastructure is either a vanity project, a jobs project, or a political quid pro quo operation to an ally to get some other thing done.<p>The problem is that once you get really used to this mode of operating, you kind of forget that there are sometimes things that really do matter. I think America has a picture of the things she already knows of: crucial highway collapses? gotta fix now! But the ability to recognize new crises goes away without novel crises.<p>So America can&#x27;t build ventilators in an emergency, can&#x27;t train nurses in an emergency, can&#x27;t do anything new. But I think America can deal with the old things just fine if she wants to.')
