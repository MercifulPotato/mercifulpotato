In the end one has to make the tradeoffs between development speed (something an ORM has going for it) and performance and the eventual issue of having to handle the object impedence mismatch. For me it&#x27;s just so much more clear to read a handful of queries and see how things work. You can even create user defined functions and call them like an API from your codebase (a sort of ORM) and get the best of both worlds. It&#x27;s not a easy choice to ORM or not but SQL should be a skill everyone learns.')
