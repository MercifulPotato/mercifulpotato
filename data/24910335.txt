However, I&#x27;d also like to manage content change requests via git and deploy via Netlify.<p>Ideally, the architecture I&#x27;d prefer is:<p>Content version controlled via GitHub<p>Deployment via Netlify or Github pages<p>External users could login to edit pages Google&#x2F;Facebook&#x2F;GitHub Oauth?<p>Edits are wiki-like: Public edit requests are possible via a wiki-like interface, but require approval<p>Edits appear behind the scenes as pull requests - it&#x27;s possible to view change history via github<p>Is there anything out there like this? I&#x27;ve been checking out Gollum and netlify-cms, but I&#x27;m not entirely certain either of these really match what I would ideally like. Any suggestions?')
