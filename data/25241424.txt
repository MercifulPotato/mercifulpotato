Item(by='TulliusCicero', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606605600, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25238599, text='&gt; The notion of bullshit jobs is basically about people doing busy work without actually doing or producing anything of real value.<p>I think this is real to a certain extent; think of it as bureaucratic &#x27;cruft&#x27;. However, it&#x27;s also hard to spot exactly which jobs are bullshit; if it was easy, you won&#x27;t have this problem of dead weight positions in big companies. There are almost certainly jobs that <i>look</i> bullshit but aren&#x27;t, and vice versa.')
