I used to be able to find interesting threads randomly by browsing comments, but it seems like a large amount of what I see there now is low effort bickering. Additionally, I can&#x27;t seem to get engagement or discussion on any of my &quot;on topic&quot; comments. Now this might be my fault, but some of the threads I make that seem more interesting, tend to get maybe an upvote or two and little to no comments.<p>I&#x27;ve come and gone over the past several years, but tend to come back because its still the site that curates the most interesting tech content, but most of my good tech <i>discussions</i> happen on various discord servers now.')
