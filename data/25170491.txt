Item(by='radford-neal', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605975532, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25169595, text='I posted the following as a comment on the article, but it&#x27;s stuck in moderation there...<p>I&#x27;m not clear on what it is that you [the post&#x27;s author] don&#x27;t understand about interpretation of Bayesian credible intervals.<p>Both &quot;objective&quot; and &quot;subjective&quot; Bayesians interpret them as degrees of belief - that, for instance, one would use to make bets (supposing, of course, that you have no moral objection to gambling, etc.).<p>The difference is that that &quot;objective&quot; Bayesians think that one can formalize &quot;what one knows&quot; and then create an &quot;objective&quot; prior on that basis, that everyone &quot;with the same knowledge&quot; would agree is correct. I don&#x27;t buy this. Formalizing &quot;what one knows&quot; by any means other than specifying a prior (which would defeat the point) seems impossible. And supposing one did, there is disagreement about what an &quot;objective&quot; prior based on it would be. To joke, &quot;The best thing about objective priors is there are so many of them to choose from!&quot;.<p>Many simple examples can illustrate that the objective Bayesian framework just isn&#x27;t going to work. One example is the one-way random effects model, where the prior on the variance of the random effects will sometimes have a large influence on the inference (eg, on the posterior probability that the overall mean is positive), but where there is no sensible &quot;objective&quot; prior - you just have to subjectively specify how likely it is that the variance is very close to zero. Another even simpler example is inference for theta given an observation x~N(theta,1), when it is known (with certainty) that theta is non-negative, and the observed x is -1.  There&#x27;s just no alternative to subjectively deciding how likely a priori it is that theta is close to zero.<p>Frequentist methods also don&#x27;t give sensible answers in these examples. Subjective Bayesianism is the only way.')
