The top-tier care in the US is indeed excellent for those who can afford it. Care in Canada is occasionally slow, often overcrowded, and has obvious gaps like dental coverage and pharmacare. But I would gladly take mediocre care that I know will always be there for me and everyone I love, over excellent care that I can only access because I can sign a big enough cheque.<p>Also, the private health services I have used in Canada are truly top-notch and far cheaper than in the US. They have to be, because they&#x27;re competiting with a service that&#x27;s available free to everyone.')
