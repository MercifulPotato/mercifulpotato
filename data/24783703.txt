It&#x27;s called &quot;homologous reinfection&quot;: the person&#x27;s natural immune response is not always up to the task of actually providing immunity to a specific viral strain, and that exact same viral strain can reinfect the patient even immediately after recovery.<p>This idea that the human immune response is always 100% effective (assuming the patient survives) is frankly a bizarre misconception: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC3863957&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC3863957&#x2F;</a>')
