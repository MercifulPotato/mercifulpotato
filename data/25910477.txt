Item(by='astrange', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611617810, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25907225, text='&gt; ASS subtitles are particularly popular in anime fansubbing as it allows for advanced typesetting.<p>Those are just &quot;SSA&quot; subtitles. The difference mattered (ASS was an &quot;Advanced SSA&quot;) once but now people just call it &quot;ASS&quot; as a joke. So Google is sort-of right, he could leave it out of the description.<p>I doubt this guy knows this since it&#x27;s impossible he implemented SSA on his own due to how complex it is.')
