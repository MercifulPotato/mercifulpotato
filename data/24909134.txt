The rerouting was done (as far as we could tell) client side and it seemed there was no inherent server side method of detecting such scenario.<p>Company email for a few thousand folks went down after the two clients took off doing their thing for a short while.<p>IIRC the client wasn&#x27;t immediately inclined to forward other forwarded emails (again enforced on the client) but an easily crafted rule would bypass that easily.<p>At the time I was surprised there wasn&#x27;t any automatic prevention of such things, as my career has gone on, I just assume such things aren&#x27;t there ;)')
