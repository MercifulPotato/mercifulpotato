America is fracturing itself while China just keeps executing. Our bridges and electrical grid and transit systems rot into oblivion while people riot in the streets against their political opponents. While China is building up its hard power, soft power, and economic force projection with the Belt and Road initiative.<p>Was a incalculably powerful US that toppled democratically elected regimes in Latin America&#x2F;Iran&#x2F;etc. a morally acceptable one? No but that&#x27;s what it is and all you other fucks had to learn English to get some of our money. Now the shoe is on the other foot and we are the fucks who will need to learn Chinese. Serves us right but I still ain&#x27;t happy about it.')
