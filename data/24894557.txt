I enjoy it, and it keeps me familiar with the guts.<p>Most of the hour is just being careful I&#x27;m hooking up the wires correctly. In college I worked as an electronics technician, and one job was putting together a stack of Heathkit serial interface cards. I don&#x27;t recall the exact times, but the first one took me an hour and the 5th one maybe 10 minutes.<p>It&#x27;s also like taking the cylinder heads off my old Mustang V8. The first time took me 2 hours. The third time - 20 minutes. It&#x27;s all in being familiar with just what to do, and having all the right tools ready.')
