Have you seen web application implemented in MVC+jQuery where each page was developed by different person and everyone was just making their own approach. Then when something was to be fixed and other person was taking over he was introducing his own ideas to code already written by someone else.<p>That is what angular solves for me, I don&#x27;t have to spend time introducing new person to the project structure. I don&#x27;t have to argue with &quot;I know better juniors&quot;, I don&#x27;t have to deal with condescending seniors &quot;who wrote it that way it is total mess&quot;.<p>Maybe you have seen some project handover to different team or you got project inherited from someone. It will be a lot easier to understand if that other team speaks &quot;angular&quot;.<p>I don&#x27;t say code is perfect, you can still write total mess with it, but having angular saves a lot of digging into some insane monstrosities that I have seen in jQuery.<p>In the end you might never need it, because everyone has different requirements and different projects.')
