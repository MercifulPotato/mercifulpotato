It was one of the fastest crashes in stock market history. However, the federal reserve and government acted in tandem to enact the swiftest and largest economic response to an event like this in history.<p>That&#x27;s what drove the turnaround and led to the subsequent (and ongoing) bull market.<p>However, the market is much frothier now (in certain segments) than before covid hit. For example, Tesla&#x27;s value has increased by 10x from the March lows. Tesla is being priced as if it will be a near monopoly on both car sales and the self driving market, which is pretty clearly not true. Even though it may take legacy automakers or Apple a few years to catch up.<p>There are less levers to pull than before. Interest rates are close to 0, congress has already passed trillions in new spending. Ability to counter a second dip will be more limited than before.<p>A catalyst would be something like accounting fraud being uncovered in one of the growth stock darlings (ala Enron), or perhaps Tesla simply reporting numbers far below expectations. Volkswagen EVs are outselling Tesla in Europe for example, so the bull thesis of a monopolistic market position is a bit weak. Another catalyst could be unexpectedly high inflation, which would indicate the Federal reserve may raise rates soon.<p>It&#x27;s also entirely possible the market just trades close to flat for a few years until valuations level out into something more realistic.<p>Is it possible that we&#x27;re in a &quot;new normal&quot; where stocks are just valued higher than historical norms in perpetuity? Maybe, but when things look this frothy, the &quot;new normal&quot; thesis generally doesn&#x27;t pan out.')
