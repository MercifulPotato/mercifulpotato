Microsoft implemented a more generous free tier in 2020, but even before the acquisition the pricing structure was $7 - $21 per user, per month.<p>GitLab is now $19 - $99.  If I wanted to move my organization to GitLab it would now cost me an additional $78 per user, per month.  A total nonstarter, even if I desperately hated GitHub.<p>I don&#x27;t understand the suddenness to this maneuver by GitLab.  My guess is it is driven by the CI&#x2F;CD minutes, but they have really thrown out the baby with the bathwater with their pricing structure.')
