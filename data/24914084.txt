We always benchmark power, performance, etc between ASIC and FPGA, so this is based on some real deigns. A 5x reduction in power is fair for most of what I&#x27;ve seen and the FPGA is actually better at achieving FMAX than you&#x27;d expect - control paths do need a lot more pipelining than ASIC, but compute intensive (DSP) datapaths are pretty good with a few tweaks. I think sometimes people throw code at them and get 100 MHz and say we&#x27;ll FPGAs are slow so it&#x27;s expected, but in my experience with a little tuning you can get most datapaths to run at 500MHz. You do pay the power penalty vs dedicated ASIC, but the performance is very good.')
