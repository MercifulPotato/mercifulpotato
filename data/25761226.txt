I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s malicious, its just they have so many thousands of teams, often working independently of each other, and your experience with them is like dealing with sightless people describing an elephant. Some teams do amazing things, some mediocre, some downright awful, like any company, but exaggerated because of their central importance in so many other peoples&#x2F;companies lives. Some of this could be fixed but even there Apple is a huge operation and executives are of all kinds. I work for a F50 company (non tech) with an infinite set of teams and execs and its another mix of amazing&#x2F;stupid.<p>No one company can uniformly manage so much code and hardware to boot and do it perfectly. There are things Apple could do to make it less irritatingâ€”the hard problem is picking which subset of horrifically irritating things to fix.')
