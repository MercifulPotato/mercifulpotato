If you can send a message saying &quot;there was a big upward movement in the price of instrument X&quot;, that&#x27;s enough to be incredibly valuable if it gets to the other end before anyone else knows about it. There might only be a few dozen instruments you&#x27;re interested in, and a few events for each one, so being able to send a single byte could be enough.<p>Obviously, more bandwidth is useful, because you can send more details, and make better decisions at the receiving end. But most of the value is in getting a small message there fast.')
