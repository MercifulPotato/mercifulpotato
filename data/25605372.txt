Item(by='CivBase', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609525754, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25601814, text='&gt; A food delivery platform shall not arrange for the delivery of an order from a food facility without first obtaining an agreement with the food facility expressly authorizing the food delivery platform to take orders and deliver meals prepared by the food facility.<p>That&#x27;s more than just preventing apps from listing a restaurant.  I don&#x27;t think delivery services should be able to represent restaurants without an agreement like many of them currently do, but I think this goes way too far.<p>This basically outlaws competition in the food delivery market.<p>EDIT: A food delivery service essentially buys food from a restaurant, then resells it to the customer.  Is there any precedent for outlawing sale of a legal product to a business?')
