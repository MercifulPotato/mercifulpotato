And since developers can&#x27;t assume you have a controller, mobile games are stuck in this very superficial built-for-touch limbo that limits what they can be.<p>You&#x27;re missing a lot if you think a Pixel + Razr controller competes with Switch even after removing all Nintendo games. That&#x27;s to suggest that mobile tap-interface gaming competes with Switch&#x2F;PS&#x2F;Xbox games.<p>Just consider the difference between Skyrim on Switch and Blades on iOS&#x2F;Android. That&#x27;s the chasm I&#x27;m talking about.')
