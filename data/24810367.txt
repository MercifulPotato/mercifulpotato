Long term effects are indeed present but only in those genetically predisposed. Doesn&#x27;t apply to the majority.<p>(2) Actually we didn&#x27;t. My wife works in a small city hospital. They only have 4 beds with respirators and almost never had more than 2-3 people at a time there. The city is being locked down the second time because we have 5 infected in 20k.
