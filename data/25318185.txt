Here are some I would recommend:<p>* ‘superintelligence’ by Nick Bostrom<p>* ‘Down Girl: the logic of misogyny’ by Kate Manne<p>* ‘dialogues on ethical vegetarianism’ or ‘The Problem of Political Authority’ by Michael Huemer.<p>These are admittedly not going to cover the so-called big questions of philosophy, or survey the history of epistemology. But, like Michael Huemer, I think that most works of philosophy are not worth reading, so that you might as well start with something really good and work  backwards (e.g. pick one of these books and then read any of the references that sound interesting).<p>Peter Singer is someone whose books you could pick up and read straight through as well.')
