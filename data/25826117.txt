The construction part, as you said, can be estimated.<p>2. I&#x27;d just call the other thing &quot;allocated time&quot; instead of &quot;estimated time&quot;.<p>Any time someone asks me how long it will take me to fix a bug that I haven&#x27;t really looked at yet, or to plan some new feature or something like that, and they badly need a number, I ask them how much time I should allocate to that. I can&#x27;t promise to have something like that done by that time, but it gives us both an idea about how to treat that problem.<p>For example, we could allocate two hours to fix a bug, with the understanding that if that turns out to not be enough then we&#x27;ll need to talk about workarounds. Or we can allocate two days to plan a new feature, and the best solution we can think of in that time shall be the one we use.')
