Nice to see people who know what they are talking about putting data out there. I hope eventually these persistent HN memes about M1 memory will die: that it&#x27;s &quot;on-die&quot; (it&#x27;s not), that it&#x27;s the only CPU using LPDDR4X-4267 (it&#x27;s not), or that it&#x27;s faster because the memory is 2mm closer to the CPU (not that either).<p>It&#x27;s faster because it has more microarchitectural resources. It can load and store more, and it can do with a single core what an Intel part needs all cores to accomplish.')
