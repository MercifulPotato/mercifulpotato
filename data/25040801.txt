At first it was completely understandable with the pandemic, but they seem to have taken that as an excuse to just give up on the Prime shipping promise period indefinitely. I was starting to order everything sensitive, from electronics to health, elsewhere anyway over counterfeit and fraud worries. But now I find other places ship <i>massively</i> faster than Amazon, &quot;Prime&quot; shipping on Amazon routinely takes a week or even weeks, plural, even when it says &quot;in stock&quot;. Other places ship right away and have it my rural area in days.<p>So for me at least Amazon has finally exited default territory, because it doesn&#x27;t even have the &quot;well it&#x27;s more risky, but it&#x27;s fast and reliable&quot; rush argument anymore. Of course I don&#x27;t expect the general population to move instantly, and it&#x27;s not like I&#x27;ve dumped them entirely either. There are even some manufacturers I like who use them for fulfillment pretty exclusively (at least for small orders). But I do wonder in cases like this whether we&#x27;ll see a non-linear curve: everything seems to be going swell for a business, right until some tipping point is reached and suddenly things go backwards fairly quickly. And that can be hard to recover from. Of course Amazon does have some moats overall, I don&#x27;t expect them as a going concern to have any real trouble particularly on the service side, AWS and all that. But the moats actually seem weakest for Amazon-as-a-B2C-market, there isn&#x27;t really anything inherently sticky there beyond habit.')
