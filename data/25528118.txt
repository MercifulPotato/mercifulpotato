People can normally exit the building quickly. Worst case jumping from the 3-5th story is likely to result in serious injury but is often survivable.  Start talking 6+ floor things get exponentially worse with every additional floor increasing the risks.<p>This is of course an arbitrary line, I would have a lower limit but the tradeoffs are complicated.')
