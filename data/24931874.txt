Maybe it would be more in line with the facts to say that elite overproduction was &quot;a contributing factor to the famines of 1300-1350 and the wars of 1350-1400&quot;.<p>That doesn&#x27;t seem to line up well with Turchin&#x27;s secular cycle theory, though: 1300 is supposed to be the peak of the &quot;integrative phase&quot; and 1400 is supposed to be the trough of the &quot;disintegrative phase&quot;. In fact, many of the &quot;disintegrative phase&quot; events happen well before 1350 (the Great Famine of 1315-1317, the Shepherds&#x27; Crusade of 1320, the Flemish peasant revolts of 1323) and many of the events that happened after 1350 could be explained more simply as effects of the Black Death.<p>To be fair to Turchin, I think his thesis is that overpopulation and elite overproduction happens first, which then leads to famine&#x2F;scarcity decreasing the non-elite population, which finally leads to a later period of warfare that kills off the excess elites as they fight for shares of the smaller pie. But I think the claim that this process happens for all societies on a 200-year sine wave warrants some skepticism.')
