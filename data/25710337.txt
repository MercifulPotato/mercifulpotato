Sometimes I think a whole generation has forgotten that we still live under the threat of global annihilation in under 15 minutes.<p>The schools used to have duck and cover drills to prepare for nuclear attacks. This may have made people too afraid of the word nuclear and thus nuclear power is not possible in the US. Now there are &quot;stranger on campus&quot; drills instead. I wonder how that is warping the minds of the present generation.')
