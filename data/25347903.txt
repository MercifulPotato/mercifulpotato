Sound cancel feature wasn&#x27;t that great, couldn&#x27;t pair with multiple devices at the same time and have the audio switch seamlessly between the two, and I also didn&#x27;t want to have to trust Sony with my listening data. Call me paranoid if you&#x27;d like, but smart headphones are basically pumping out information about what we&#x27;re listening to or hearing around us, and if I was going to trust any corporation to be user-centric on privacy in this regard it&#x27;d be Apple.<p>If Apple&#x27;s headphones have high audio quality and a seamless experience across multiple devices and cool features prepping the way for VR&#x2F;AR (the way other comments have suggested) then I&#x27;d buy a pair.')
