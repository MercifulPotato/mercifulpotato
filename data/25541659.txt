I studied with Reggie during several of the summer sessions in Rome starting in 1998, and dedicated my edition+translation of a 16th-century treatise to him. He really transformed Latin into a living language for those lucky enough to study with him, and his courses leveled up one&#x27;s fluency like nothing I&#x27;ve ever seen at university or elsewhere. What a force of nature. He used to say that if he became pope (ha!) He would take the name Leo, and would roar like a lion against the docile corrupters he encountered every day in the Vatican. I&#x27;m glad and honestly a little surprised he lived this long, because in those days wandering around Rome 20 years ago, he was really not taking care of his health at all. Used to claim he slept 2 hours a night, sitting in his cell in the dark watching tv and eating potato chips in his underwear into the wee hours of the morning. The world will never see another one like him.')
