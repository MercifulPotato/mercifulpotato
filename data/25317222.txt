I agree with you that the current nazis are not a real threath.\nBut lets not forget that there&#x27;s very smart people that are hungry for power and will do anything to take control of our lives for its own benefit.\nWith them you can have a &quot;neo-nazism&quot; adapted for the reality of the country. Remember &quot;war on drugs&quot; and &quot;war on terror&quot;? Guess what, manipulation tatics using fear to control a large number of people for political gain.<p>Remember all the things Snowden and Assange bring back to light? first, with centralized control, it would never be possible to go against &quot;the men&quot;. Second, that they describe how under Obama, you know that guy everybody likes and thinks do everything for the good of the mankind? the peace nobel prize? the first black president of US? how can he do wrong right?<p>And yet there was a lot of shady things going under his government, like spying its own people to resort absolute control under this &quot;above good and evil&quot; figure in a country who worship celebrities and big money (the winners).<p>My point being, its doesnt even need to be a nazi state, and can be a facade &quot;rainbows and unicorns&quot; kind of government, that do a good job into making people think everything is good, and their leader is some sort of Gandhi, that the real show, the nasty one, the one that even resemble the nazis, can happen behind the curtains.')
