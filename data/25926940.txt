Item(by='marvin', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611746936, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25924560, text='I greatly enjoyed this article, not necessarily for what it says, but for what it doesn&#x27;t. It has an ideological undercurrent that probably doesn&#x27;t represent <i>either</i> the views of Banks, Musk or Bezos; rather, the author attempts to interpret the words of Banks to refute something that neither Musk nor Bezos actually think.<p>What I enjoy so much about the Culture series is Banks&#x27; account of the <i>good things</i> in human nature, while also acknowledging the chaotic and sometimes violent, contradictory parts of our motivations. I view the series as a rare, honest attempt at answering the question &quot;if you could wish anything you wanted for humanity, what would you wish for?&quot; Trying to frame such a wish in a way that keeps only what we want to keep, if there were no materialistic limits. I am not sure that Banks would agree with me, but I&#x27;ve interpreted his socialist angle as merely what seemed the best plausible path towards that, from his point of view. Rather than with communism as an end to itself.<p>There&#x27;s so much philosophy to unpack in this question, and it&#x27;s fascinating to consider it through the lens of what might be possible in contemporary and near-future society. Today&#x27;s richest people, while having tremendous power, obviously don&#x27;t all wish to enslave humanity, the way one could erroneously conclude by going too deeply into far-left ideology.<p>Neither do they necessarily try to move directly in the direction of &quot;progress&quot;, if we define progress to mean the fastest possible path towards the nebulous, ideal future of humanity as described above. But certainly <i>some</i> of the efforts of humanity&#x27;s brightest are pulling us in this direction, and it seems implausible that any single contemporary ideology has the answer. It wouldn&#x27;t surprise me if some billionaires would wish to move society in that direction. The apparent contradiction in that seems superficial to me.<p>I&#x27;m sure that many ideologies get <i>part</i> of the question right, but they all leave so much room for the parts of human nature that we would largely exclude, if given the choice. As do the power structures in contemporary society. They are limited by both the practical limits of contemporary economics <i>and</i> the partially selfish human motivations of their members.')
