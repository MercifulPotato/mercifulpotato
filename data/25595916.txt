As a terminating carrier, I don&#x27;t care if the caller paid, I got paid from the originating carrier.<p>As the originating carrier, I should damn well have a billing relationship with the caller, and they&#x27;re not getting services if I&#x27;m not paid. I&#x27;ll probably charge a collection fee for each charge I bill the caller, so works for me too. Require a deposit to continue service when calling patterns look robotic.<p>(intermediate carriers can fill in between, they won&#x27;t make money from the robofees, but will be incentivised to properly pass them through)')
