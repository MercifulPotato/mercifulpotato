It&#x27;s a wireless device, and for some reason, they think that if it supports a wired mode, it won&#x27;t be as special (or whatever their idiotic reasoning is).<p>And, why use the lightning port?! Aside from the price, choosing to not use USB-C for a charging port killed it for me. I like being able to charge all my devices off one power brick, and I&#x27;m not spending $600 on headphones if I need a stupid lightning port for the next 6+ years.')
