The replicators in Star Trek had this problem. People were shown wanting for nothing and having no wages, because they could replicate stuff.<p>The problem is that even today a huge part of the economy is not material production but services of some form, many of which can&#x27;t be supplied infinitely no matter how fancy your tech gets. If you want an hour of time to get advice advice from the world&#x27;s best investor, then short of that man choosing to upload his brain into a massively sharded AI or something, his time is <i>scarce</i> and no amount of tech will work around that.<p>And a lot of what capitalism allocates today is even less physical than that: attention and social status. Instagram sometimes feels like an experimental post-scarcity society in which millions of people with abundant material wealth spend their time competing over social status and influence.<p>Fundamentally even in a post-scarcity society there will always be competition for the influence of your ideas, other people&#x27;s time&#x2F;attention and of course power over those people. This is why the concept that communism happens with sufficiently advanced technology doesn&#x27;t make sense to me.')
