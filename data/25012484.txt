I don&#x27;t claim to be the world&#x27;s best manager or anything but the approach that I have been successful with is that I try to be very clear about the results I expect (and why) and then when the results I receive don&#x27;t match what I expected I communicate about the delta in results (the <i>what</i> as opposed to the <i>how</i>) and try again.<p>Using this approach can be a little slow in the beginning or when adding new team members, etc. but over time you and your people come to understand how to communicate with each other and trust each other and the team will be happier and more productive because they are given the space to work the way they find most effective and enjoyable.<p>People that are micromanaged are almost universally miserable and it&#x27;s hard to reach the highest levels of productivity with a miserable team.  At least (in my 25 years in business) I&#x27;ve never seen anyone do it.')
