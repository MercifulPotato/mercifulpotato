Why not just embrace OOP and go with one method (Read) that takes a specification which itself encapsulates the set of files you want to read? Then it works for none, one, and all files...and makes the argument about Mocking vs Faking somewhat moot; the mock is a simple &quot;for any args return this&quot; and the fake is just as simple.<p>I guess my point is that if you have to agonise over mock vs fake then really it&#x27;s a sign that your design is not quite as testable as you might like :)')
