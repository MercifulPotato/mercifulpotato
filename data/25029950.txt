Pretty much everybody loses their life somehow. It&#x27;s amazing to me that so many of my peers survived childhood.<p>It is pretty stupid to try to jump a car on your bicycle without a landing ramp. Or play catch with lit M80s. And those weren&#x27;t our dumbest ideas.<p>When I was a kid every 8-year-old pushed a lawn mower around once a week. And rode in the back of a pickup truck. Today I don&#x27;t let my kids ride in the back of pickup trucks, and I&#x27;m nervous about the lawn mower. Or rather, I&#x27;m nervous about trusting my kid not to be careless with the mower.<p>But when I see the metal detector at the door of my kid&#x27;s school I wince. Some dangers and some fears need to be met head on. For some people, those include riding in the back of pickup trucks. For some it is the school&#x27;s metal detector. If only we could make those choices for ourselves and our children without forcing our fears onto our neighbors.<p>Edit: clarity')
