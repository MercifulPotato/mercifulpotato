So far it goes to black screen - other Source games work fine though, so I think it&#x27;s just a matter of time. I already have a 2017 13&quot; MBP but for some reason (dual channel memory? throttling?) the gaming experience is terrible, worse than a 2012 Mini in Bootcamp.<p>I&#x27;ve wanted a gaming laptop (or better put, a laptop that I can also game on) for years but couldn&#x27;t stand the crappy quality of ASUS&#x2F;MSI&#x2F;Lenovo in sub-2k price range. As I said in another comment, I can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s going to be a MacBook :)')
