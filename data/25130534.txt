First display the window in some random place on the screen,<p>2. Then move it to the position I actually specified.<p>3. Draw all the widgets with a slightly wonky layout,<p>4. Then erase the widgets it just displayed and redraw them with the correct layout.<p>This happens in every Swing app I&#x27;ve ever used when opening a window, even IntelliJ. (The glitching window position is not always observable.)')
