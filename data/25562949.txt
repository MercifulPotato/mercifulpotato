Recruiters that ghost are my competitive advantage. I can beat that barrier where others can&#x27;t. Waste your time on this if you want. It won&#x27;t get you closer to your objectives.<p>When I was younger, a recruiter for interns at Nvidia ghosted me entirely. It left a bad taste in my mouth because the internship time was particularly stressful for me since I procrastinated till very late. In comparison, the Microsoft recruiter just told me that while they&#x27;d take me, they&#x27;d filled their capacity. Whether they were truthful or were letting me down nicely, I appreciated the response.<p>But that was then. I was upset at all of Nvidia back then. But at some point, the perspective shifted. Now if there&#x27;s something to get, I go take it. If the recruiter ghosts me, I LinkedIn their recruiting team, Rocketreach or PeopleDataLabs myself their emails, and use an automailer to drip them with where I&#x27;m stuck in the process.<p>The way I see it is that punishing people is work I&#x27;d have to do to make a company more effective at something. I want a reward for that. No one will reward me for that. What they will reward me for is shotgunning everyone else.<p>And is anyone <i>seriously</i> going to GDPR or CCPA me? If they tried, I&#x27;d shit on their faces on Twitter and even if they revealed the so-called underhandedness of my tactics people will remember them as the guys who ghosted someone and then sued that guy when he tried to unghost them.<p>Hyperoptimize for your own objectives. Everyone else&#x27;s problem is their problem.')
