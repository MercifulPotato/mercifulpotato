Item(by='drewbug01', descendants=None, kids=[25217666], score=None, time=1606372817, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25217374, text='&gt; But the NYT should be inherently trusted, unless I read your original comment incorrectly.<p>Yes - I believe you did read it incorrectly. I am personally inclined to trust the NYT more than the words of a CEO of a tech company; I personally put more trust in the former rather than the latter.<p>As you’ve eloquently laid out - that’s a personal choice I make, and I own that. But I am not declaiming in my comment that the NYT should be inherently trusted by all.<p>Now - if you want to ask me <i>that</i> question directly: I <i>do</i> think that the NYT is more trustworthy than Coinbase. And if you want my opinion on the matter, yeah - I think you should trust the NYT too!<p>But: that simply wasn’t what I said in my original comment. I don’t think that’s a fair reading of it at all.<p>&gt; You literally called it &quot;fundamental truth&quot; in your original comment, so I&#x27;m actually a bit curious about your answer to your own question.<p>I would answer it by saying you’ve missed the forest for the trees. I was not alleging that the article will be “fundamental truth” - in the sense that every word it says will be true. Rather, my comments in context imply that I trust there will be at least <i>some</i> truth in the article - and that the words Coinbase published serve to highlight the presumed core of truth in the article.<p>What you’ve said here is nitpicking at a word and ignoring how it’s used in the context of my words as a whole, and doesn’t move the conversation forward.<p>&gt; This is not enlightened discourse. Again, just because you think it is doesn&#x27;t mean that it is. Specially when using vague non-descriptions like &quot;amateurish&quot;.<p>You’re right; this is devolving into name-calling. And I stand by my usage of “amateurish”. That is a perfectly acceptable word to use in a discussion here, and it’s not even as imprecise as you claim. If you have questions about what it means, of course, do ask.<p>I’m not going to engage further on this thread. You’re nit-picking at words here in a really unkind way.')
