Cookies do not automatically require consent. If you use a session cookie to remember someone&#x27;s login session, that does not require consent. It&#x27;s when you use that session cookie for analytics, advertising, etc. that consent enters the picture.<p>2. The fact that you can uniquely identify the user on an ongoing basis, even if you&#x27;re not tying it to any actual personal details or an IP address, is what makes that identifier personal information. Just because you obfuscate it does not change that. A hash hides the original data but it does not change the fact that it&#x27;s a unique identifier, and therefore it&#x27;s still personal information.<p>You have to anonymize the data in such a way that you couldn&#x27;t pick out the specific individual from any stored data. A lossy anonymization step is one way to do it. A hash of a browser thumbprint is not, unless that hash also pools multiple users together and mixes the data up so that you can&#x27;t pick them apart again.')
