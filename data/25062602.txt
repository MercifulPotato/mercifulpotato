Including the WAL.<p>Part of that is historical &#x2F; unintentional. But there&#x27;s also plenty places where generalizing subsystems would make the whole slower and&#x2F;or more complicated.<p>There definitely are bits that I&#x27;d like to have used outside of postgres many times. If you have to write C, something like postgres&#x27; memory context API makes it so much more convenient (and often more performant too!).')
