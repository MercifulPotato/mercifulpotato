Yes, humans do have intelligence and that does help quite a bit, but I would also guess that a system could potentially be better than most ordinary human drivers without LiDAR just because they have a much better view of all cars around them (humans have a somewhat narrow field of view and can only look in one direction at a time, computers can have a full 360 degree view all of the time). They never suffer fatigue and never get distracted. My guess is that, yeah, it is better to have LiDAR, but also we can also probably make a really good system that is better than humans on average and saves many lives per year without it. It seems worthwhile to me to continue exploring and investing in.')
