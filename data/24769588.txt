Frameworks like Gatsby, Hugo, and Wordpress have one or more of 3 problems: too complex, too slow, or too vulnerable, partly because of their mass appeal. So for serious SEO gains we actually stay away from them.<p>This blog issue illustrates the too-complex problemof Gatsby - you don&#x27;t find out about some minor configuration error until it gets indexed weeks later, and you lose substantial business due to the long feedback loop of SEO. Add to that the long compilation time, and you&#x27;re looking for alternatives soon after investing massive resources in a setup.<p>Hugo had a different problem the last time we tried it. In a test setup we did, a small configuration issue spewed your entire server and configuration data to anyone who visits a 404 link. Any issue with the setup created the volcano of sensitive data vulnerability. Didn&#x27;t take the time to dig in any further.<p>Wordpress is a behemoth, but because of that and slow hosting service providers it is incredibly slow to use on a hosted shared server, without caching. On top of that thousands of bots on the web are looking for and sending post requests to Wordpress admin files or php plugins (even if you&#x27;re behind Cloudflare).<p>There are faster and more performant ways to SEO, especially  if you can code.')
