I&#x27;m not huge into this direct life automation, but I do automatically download most of my data from 3rd party platforms, including banking data, expenses, documents I scan on my phone (i. e. letters) and load them onto my NAS. I then have automated scripts that categorize, catalogue and index the data. For only very few of them I look at the data specifically, but it just makes me feel at ease to a) know it&#x27;s there and b) know it&#x27;s organized and I don&#x27;t have to do it.')
