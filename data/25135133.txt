But at 4x that would be 40GW of electricity, which would actually be enough to just power the whole country on a typical weekday evening (as the sun goes down, day time place of work usage isn&#x27;t all stopped yet but home usage is picking up).<p>Now, obviously it isn&#x27;t always windy, but on the other hand it also isn&#x27;t always a weekday evening. At 3am on a Sunday in June the country is ticking over at 20GW, and the weather doesn&#x27;t care so your wind turbines might be kicking out 40GW anyway. We need to store or export that. That&#x27;s a key challenge for the next decade.')
