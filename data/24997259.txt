Nothing in the article says vaporware or describes anything that could be said to be vaporware.<p>V could maybe use &quot;misleading marketing&quot; at best, but it&#x27;s in no way vaporware, as if it was, the author would not be able to perform all the things they did in the blogpost.<p>It&#x27;s also over a year old, would love to see the author to revisit the claims of V like they did in the post, but with the latest versions.')
