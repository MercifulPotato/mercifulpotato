You seem to have completely misunderstood my argument. I&#x27;m not &quot;Monday morning quarterbacking&quot;, and I in no way think that Facebook&#x27;s success was guaranteed.<p>The point I was making was the idea that it was believed early on that social media was a &quot;toy&quot; or that it would never be profitable or that people poo poo-ed the idea of Facebook in its early days is not accurate, at all. Indeed, the example of MySpace shows that it was already well known that there would be a scramble for dominance in the social media realm.<p>&gt; So why FB took over MySpace? We don&#x27;t know. Yes, we don&#x27;t know in 2020, 16 years later.<p>Uhh, I think we have a pretty good idea. First and foremost, Facebook was always focused on your real, offline identity, which <i>was</i> rather new at the time. MySpace and the early social networks were primarily based on different online personas (e.g. online usernames, no real name policy, etc.) MySpace tried to get people to add their real names and identities later, but it was basically too late by then. This isn&#x27;t hypothetical, either, one of the founders of MySpace told me as much in a conversation about a decade ago.')
