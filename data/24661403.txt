Worst-case means <i>worst-case</i>, ie. the input is selected by an adversary with complete knowledge of your algorithm and initial memory; and there is no source of randomness other than the input itself.<p>And, yes, that&#x27;s usually not applicable in practice. But worst-case complexity is a theoretical concept defined only on abstract machines (implicitly a Von Neumann-like machine here).<p>Instead, to do useful analysis on hash tables, you should use probability complexity analysis, which allows your algorithm access to a source of randomness the adversary doesn&#x27;t have access to.')
