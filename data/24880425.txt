I used flashcards to memorize a fair number of Emacs shortcuts.<p>It&#x27;s not always that easy to find - even with C-h a or C-h m, etc.<p>But the bigger benefit is even knowing that feature X exists and there is a key combination for it. I found flash cards useful because I would get an occasional &quot;reminder&quot; that X exists and I should use it more often!<p>A trivial example: flush-lines and keep-lines. I never knew these existed till I read them somewhere. I put it in my flashcards, and over time I would remember its existence and use it more and more.')
