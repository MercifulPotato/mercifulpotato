Here&#x27;s what I found:<p>Cayea, Danelle, and Ralph A. Manchester. &quot;Instrument-specific rates of upper-extremity injuries in music students.&quot; Organ 26.362 (1998): 11-14.<p><pre><code>  The high-injury-rate instruments (12.0 to 18.0)\n  included the piano, guitar, and harp. Women had\n  a higher overall injury rate thanmen (8.9 vs 5.9).\n</code></pre>\nSmall sample sizes for some instruments (e.g. only ~20 female trumpet players) make me doubt the solidity of the results, but it looks like bigger instruments are <i>vastly</i> more dangerous for women to play. The piano and organ are both pretty bad, with about 10% of women reporting injuries compared to about 7.5% of men. The double bass has the largest difference in the study, with 17% women reporting injuries compared to 8% of men. I have no idea how harps compare because there were exactly zero male harpists in the sample, but female harp was tied with female double bass as highest-injury sampled instrument at 17%.<p>Note that, as the studied population was &quot;the students at a single institution&#x27;s music major&quot;, an RSI injury this early might indicate the beginning of a chronic, career-limiting problem.<p>I can&#x27;t find any competitions for the double bass that I might be able to use to confirm the correlation between injury rate and under-representation in high-level competition.<p>TL;DR I find it quite plausible that some instruments are objectively difficult for women to play as indicated by a higher level of upper-body injury.<p>edit: I read some more of the site and found <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;smallpianokeyboards.org&#x2F;pain-injury-and-performance-quality&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;smallpianokeyboards.org&#x2F;pain-injury-and-performance-q...</a>, which agrees with the research I did above.')
