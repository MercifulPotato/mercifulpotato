Item(by='loudmax', descendants=None, kids=[24924613], score=None, time=1603900805, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24919769, text='Tesla&#x27;s term &quot;Autopilot&quot; is misleading and it&#x27;s gotten people killed.  Tesla and Musk deserve opprobrium for giving their driver assist system a name that implies that the car can drive without constant supervision.<p>But Consumer Report&#x27;s title isn&#x27;t entirely clear either.  They rank Cadillac ahead of Tesla because Super Cruise makes stronger attempts than Autopilot to make sure the driver is engaged.  That isn&#x27;t a bad thing, but it should be clear in the title that the &quot;performance&quot; they&#x27;re measuring heavily weighs toward safety. It&#x27;s like saying that a Volvo station wagon outperforms a Ferrari sports car because your family is safer in the Volvo.  Sure, I&#x27;d rather my kids ride in a Volvo but that&#x27;s not what I think of when I read the word &quot;outperforms&quot;.')
