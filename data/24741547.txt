For example, consider a company that develops and RTOS that is used in both cars and missiles, where does that stand morally? Even the most benign technology can be used for evil so it&#x27;s worth asking the question to what culpability individual bear for who their company sells their software to. In the case of SpaceX, Iâ€™m sure much of the code is the same between the military and the NASA use cases.')
