For all the useless Java &quot;factory&quot; patterns, the one thing there ISN&#x27;T a factory for - Futures - is the one thing you could use to easily solve your list of issues and really improve the quality of actor &#x2F; async programming.<p>This is fundamentally what NewRelic and other instrumenting libraries do though, also there&#x27;s stuff like JetBrain&#x27;s `Schedule` and `Execute`. It&#x27;s a bit of a puzzle to me why this isn&#x27;t just standardized.')
