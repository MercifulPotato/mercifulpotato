(To be fair, that was true of the Democratic Party instead of the GOP from the founding <i>until</i> the 1960s, but for a couple of breaches between the extreme racists and the rest of the party that were usually healed in short order. White supremacy has always been a powerful enough force in America that it&#x27;s always been a significant influence on at least one major party.)')
