The first readout was to have been at 32 cases in design, but after discussion with the FDA, Pfizer changed the first readout to 62 cases. By the time the discussion concluded, the study had already hit the <i>second</i> readout of 94. The final study analysis is concluded at 164.<p>The 90% efficacy is reported based on the second readout data, which was all the data they had at the time. The 95% efficacy is reported based on the final readout data, which was only more recently available.<p>Note that the media has not done a great job of indicating that the initial Pfizer (and Moderna, for that matter) results were based on interim analysis.')
