Authoritarian governments, if they decide to act in such ways, will go in contact with you and let you know the consequence of what you will do to your families. There is no need for this endanger anyone, because they already have the name.<p>On this basis, I agree that the possibility that this was a factor in the arrest of anyone is essentially zero.<p>Because, for China to ask if someone is going to be on the committee, they must already know about that person, and if they know about that person, they will already do their best to arrest them or threaten them.')
