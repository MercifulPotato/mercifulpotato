But the fact of the matter is the issue is largely settled in the public eye. How did we get here? The answer is simple. The approach was a dispassionate search for the best solution.<p>There were no &quot;scientists&quot; claiming hyperbolic doomsday scenarios if we didn&#x27;t pass specific legislation by a certain date. The collapse of our transportation infrastructure due to Kessler Syndrome -- but for highways. This should cause any rational person to be skeptical.<p>There were no fund raising rallies held by highly influential &quot;scientists&quot; who refused to wear seat belts themselves. This too, should cause any rational person to be skeptical.<p>People did not start with a chosen solution, and selected evidence to back it. They started with evidence, and searched for the best solution.<p>In effect? Seatbelts and airbags weren&#x27;t a cargo cult driven by celebrity &quot;scientists&quot; that relied on emotional appeal.
