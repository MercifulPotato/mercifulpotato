Item(by='JSavageOne', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605466597, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25096877, text='No. I normally wouldn&#x27;t post since it probably comes off as insensitive, but since every comment seems to be talking about how depressed people are, I will give a counterpoint.<p>I&#x27;ve been pretty blessed. I was working remotely before COVID so it didn&#x27;t really affect my life much other than being way more restricted in where I can travel. I&#x27;ve been nomadic the last couple years so the travel restrictions were an adjustment, but there are still places one can travel to. I&#x27;m currently in one of those countries that had no restrictions. Unfortunately it&#x27;s looking like they&#x27;re going to start making businesses close at 9pm, which sucks but isn&#x27;t a huge deal since I can still work out of my favorite coffee shop during the day.<p>I find that my happiest times seem to be correlated with:<p>1. Having goals, and subsequently purpose and meaning. Doesn&#x27;t have to be career-related by the way, can be a hobby or caring for a loved one<p>2. Having a sense of community with real in-person human contact. Intimacy is good to have too, or at least avoiding a complete lack thereof.<p>3. Accepting that which one cannot change<p>I get that the pandemic has made things more difficult, but we can still control our destiny to an extent and make the most of the cards we&#x27;ve been dealt. I had spent 3 months in the U.S. at my parents&#x27; house bored out of my mind before deciding to fly out to a random foreign country, and have had a blast here. I could&#x27;ve just stayed put at my parents&#x27; house and said &quot;but I shouldn&#x27;t do anything because the pandemic&quot;, but thankfully I didn&#x27;t.<p>My sympathies to anyone who is out of work or depressed. But I do think it&#x27;s healthier to look at our mental health as something that we can influence and control through our own life decisions and mindset, as opposed to just looking at it as a disease where cure = therapy &#x2F; pills (not that there&#x27;s anything wrong with therapy + appropriate medication).')
