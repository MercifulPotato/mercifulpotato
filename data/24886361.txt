That&#x27;s because this book is a compilation of surface level sampling from various branches of math.<p>Mathematicians&#x27; version of your lamentation would probably look something like &quot;I studied all the ins and outs of measure theory&#x2F;functional analysis and category theory&#x2F;algebraic geometry for four years and all I do today is teach engineering students calculus and freshman math majors - elementary real analysis. That&#x27;s deeply sad&quot;. :)')
