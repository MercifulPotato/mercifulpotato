Item(by='Forge36', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606748221, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25254137, text='+1 on verbose by default. I&#x27;ve seen a lot of &quot;error occurred&quot; dialogs which were absolutely useless.\nVs reading a verbose stack trace: trivial to back trace and say X passed this data from Y. Even for areas I wasn&#x27;t an expert it. Made finding the next owner to investigate significantly easier.')
