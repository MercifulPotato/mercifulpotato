I agree that we shouldn&#x27;t have the open rampant drug abuse going on that we see downtown.  I&#x27;ve seen guys shooting up in the metro staircase.  It&#x27;s bad.  It&#x27;s not &quot;terrible neighbors&quot; who just happen to want to smoke crack in the streets though, and it&#x27;s not isolated from the economic shifts that have rocked the city since ~2001-ish.<p>&gt; Techies are basically the ideal denizens of a city. Young, educated, well-paid, law-abiding people. You could hardly ask for a better group to populate a city.<p>Is that the tech guilt&#x2F;savior complex again?<p>The problem is they aren&#x27;t populating an empty shell!<p>They come as a displacing wave of invaders, made all the more insufferable because they&#x27;re convinced that they&#x27;re God&#x27;s gift to the world at a subconscious level.')
