But if you drilled down the official materials deep enough, there was acknowledgement that the system was state capitalism, it was just generally wrapped in vague terms of &quot;building socialism, towards communism&quot;, etc. etc. Outside of USSR, most other attempts were quickly &quot;removed&quot; from existence.<p>Technically even in socialist countries in USSR sphere you had somewhat market-acting private companies, though the most &quot;ideologically correct&quot; form of them were co-operatives.<p>China is interesting case, with mix of centrally planned and market economy. But I can&#x27;t provide enough details (though I&#x27;ve seen <i>glorious</i> poster calling on people to start SMBs to build communism :D) to argue either way.<p>Ultimately - Even USSR called the system state capitalism, with a fig leaf that supposedly the people controlled it.')
