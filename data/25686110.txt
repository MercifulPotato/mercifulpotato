A more dramatic&#x2F;extreme example would be whether we would think it is ok for other illegal organisations&#x2F;services (e.g terrorists) to be on Twitter if they weren&#x27;t breaking ToS on the platform, I suspect many would say no.<p>On Trump, it wouldn&#x27;t surprise me if he broke Twitter ToS on the platform but you would have to admit that his ban would involve greyer interpretation of his tweets than a black-white ban of a service that aims to break the law.<p>And I say this as a big support of sci-hub too.<p>Generally speaking delete Facebook&#x2F;Twitter&#x2F;etc, I did and it has been a big improvement to my life.')
