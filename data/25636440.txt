They can tell you if you&#x27;re assigning a string to an int, but not if you&#x27;re assigning 200 to an int whose type allows only numbers in [10, 100].<p>I am pretty sure Ada did that in the 80s. :)<p>I get what you are saying, but the example you gave is a pretty trivial one that has been solved (although not implemented very often...) for awhile in more &quot;regular&quot; languages!')
