In meanwhile, the openly accessible technology &#x2F; know-how will be gone or hired by them and there will be no one left. Just look around, how many people you know that are capable of handling on-premise server? What about farm of servers without using any of google&#x2F;aws&#x2F;microsoft technology?<p>This just isn&#x27;t something new.<p>It is just another case of &quot;historia magistra vitae&quot;. We had this, 30-40 years back, we had centralized environment (have you heard about mainframes before?), due to huge price pumping the decentralized environment came in (personal computers, internet, on premise servers, storage, ...). IT needed almost 20 years to get out of the hooks of corporations and now we are all diving in into the latest &quot;cool&quot; thing - centralization, now backed up by advertising revenues and shady practices like not showing your company on google search.<p>This is not a joke: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Google_litigation" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Google_litigation</a><p>And you can bet the history repeats itself.<p>---<p>Let me show you my point and where it is going, lets do a tiny experiment - use your router&#x2F;firewall&#x2F;whatever you are fond of and block the following ASNs:<p><pre><code>  AS40873,AS396982,AS395973,AS394639,AS394507,AS36492,AS36385,AS36384,AS36040,AS36039,\n  AS26910,AS26684,AS22859,AS22577,AS19527,AS16550,AS15169,AS13949,AS6432,\n  AS19448,AS16591,AS45566,AS43515,AS41264,AS394699,AS36987,AS139190,AS139070\n</code></pre>\nthen:<p><pre><code>  AS16509,AS14618,AS7224,AS19047,AS395343,AS62785,AS58588,AS9059,AS8987,AS39111,AS38895,AS10124,AS264167,AS17493,AS135630\n</code></pre>\nand:<p><pre><code>  AS8075,AS8074,AS8073,AS8072,AS8071,AS8070,AS8069,AS8068,AS6584,AS63314,AS6291,AS6194,\n  AS6182,AS5761,AS45139,AS40066,AS397996,AS397466,AS396463,AS395851,AS395524,\n  AS395496,AS36006,AS3598,AS32476,AS31792,AS30575,AS30135,AS26222,AS25796,AS23468,\n  AS22692,AS20046,AS17345,AS14719,AS13811,AS13399,AS12076,AS35106,AS8812,AS200517,\n  AS58862,AS59067,AS52985\n</code></pre>\nNow try to surf the internet. Casual style. As nothing happened.<p>Baidu (China) and Yandex (Russia) will still work from search engines. Duckduckgo not (shame on you). As any other you know. &quot;The internet&quot; as you know it will stop to exist for you. You know what you have blocked with those ASNs? Only 3 companies. Google. Amazon. Microsoft.<p>For complete experience you can also throw in AS714,AS6185,AS2709 and AS63293,AS54115,AS32934 (Apple, Facebook), but those two are not really relevant.<p>Maybe this will be eye opening how much we have f* up the internet, something that should survive 3rd world war is now mostly in the hands of 3 companies. Now imagine they pull the switch.<p>Oh yeah, that bad it is.')
