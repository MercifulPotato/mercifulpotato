Its wasteful just in the nature of it, you can&#x27;t recycle those parts, your not producing them so you drain them from somewhere else. What I would love to see is hybrid broad acre&#x2F;high density greenhouse farms.<p>I&#x27;m leaning towards productions suited for my region for this example, it would require tailoring to each regions climates&#x2F;capacities if you were to do this everywhere. On the broad acre you essentially would do native grasses&#x2F;root vegetables&#x2F;shrub crops and runs of more traditional mono crops in dispersed amongst heavily Wooded paddocks. like 30-40% tree cover,30-40% perennial natives, 20-30% rotated mono-crop runs. You need to not stress the land too much where I am, and work with the droughts that come through (Australia). The whole goal of the broad acre is to produce a little food buffer but mostly material for nutrient creation.<p>So maybe you harvest&#x2F;cut your native grasses a few times a year, bail it, inoculate it with fungi to eat it and convert it to a higher nutrient product for fertilizer if your running soil greenhouses. Or you could use mulched grasses to run a snail farm, that in turn feeds a aquaculture setup which you can strip the fish shit out of for nutes to supply your high density vert farm. Having the broad acre allows you to do other things too like maintain bee hives which can be brought into the greenhouse for pollinating.<p>Huge amounts of resources&#x2F;capital required to set closed loops like this up...but on the plus side...once their setup, if you do things right like use high grade materials(e.g stainless for all your greenhouse piping&#x2F;water setup) it can last for near infinite time with correct maintenance. Just good luck getting a investor who gets profit @ 10-20 year mark rather than 6-12 months. Market doesn&#x27;t seem to like long games these days even if it is whats probably best for environment&#x2F;long term sustainable high density farming.<p>Oh and also we need a robot that can pick fruit&#x2F;veg and do maintenance that requires dexterity (think unscrewing a nozzle or pipe fitting). Bad. Labor is a killer for broad acre tree crops and stuff that requires a bit of dexterity for harvest (see Australia&#x27;s current farm labor shortage).')
