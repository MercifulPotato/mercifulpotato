They say they plan to support the direct explorer to playback. I hope because if they start adding the files I play to some sort of library, whether by duplicating the binaries or not, this is the end of me using VLC.<p>What I like a lot less is controls overlaid on the video. It&#x27;s a matter of taste but for me I absolutely hate that. Don&#x27;t mess with the image. If I want the controls to disappear I am happy to go full screen.
