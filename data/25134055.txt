Its processors are competitive (often superior) and it&#x27;s gaining marketshare.<p>Intel has been in trouble for some time due to its own failure to downscale, a failure which has little to do with x86. They&#x27;d be losing to someone else if Apple&#x2F;AMD hadn&#x27;t been there.<p>Intel still has some time to recover: it has plenty of money, and Apple&#x2F;AMD are unable right now to take full advantage of their position. Apple&#x2F;AMD rely on a supplier (TSMC) which does not have the capacity the supply all or even most of the processor demand, so Intel gets quite a bit of marketshare almost by default.')
