Item(by='bnralt', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611296271, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25859823, text='&gt; Are there places that with no construction in popular urban areas where prices truly don’t rise?<p>As the other comment suggested, there are pretty run down areas that tend to not increase as much or even decrease (in extreme cases). Revitalized areas are going to tend to be more expensive than non-revitalized areas. You&#x27;ll see a lot of this if you live in a city and follow redevelopment efforts and which neighborhoods change over time (IE, neighborhood A, B, and C are poor, C gets a big development push, C becomes more expensive than A and B).<p>Also worth noting that amenities don&#x27;t simply increase or decrease, but they shift. Supermarkets from the same chain in the same city can have cheaper, lower quality food in poorer areas and more expensive, higher quality food in wealthier neighborhoods.<p>&gt; Though at that point what’s the policy: suppress housing supply and keep areas burnt out and crime ridden to deter outsiders? Not so great for quality of life or the tax base<p>It depends on your goals. I&#x27;m generally in favor of development, but others have goals that are different from my own. There are long time residents that feel that the disruptions these changes bring outweigh the good. Even things that get overlooked like there being fewer local cheap eateries because of increasing commercial rent, or more police attention driving away crime (a good thing) but also street vendors, or the percentage of the people you know and are able to talk to greatly decreasing (not uncommon in ethnic enclaves).')
