IE maybe they baked them, moved some stuff around, and forgot to rebake. Or forgot to mark some objects static, etc.<p>- Meshes disappearing.. not sure, thinking maybe theyre using some fixed size arrays to avoid reallocations but maybe theyre hitting a fixed size limit and things get evicted.<p>- Weird spawns. Guessing this might be something like a broken line of sight calculation. Maybe similar to the theorized navmesh thing -- occluders could be wrong too')
