Will current social media platforms change?<p>2. If Trump doesn’t get a second term and he is censored at Twitter, will be leave Twitter?<p>3. When he does and if he starts his own social media platform, would it gain traction?<p>4. Will it be the social media equivalent Fox News Gen.2.0 to fill the void left by a weaker Ailes-less FNN as counter balance?<p>5. Will Trump create the next social media platform of podcast(no more news channels)&#x2F;YouTube&#x2F;FB&#x2F;Twitter&#x2F;Insta combo.<p>6. Or would it be a partnership network? By creating a platform of existing outlets or maybe buy them out?')
