If there is an utility to this post other than just as an exercise in using Z3Py, it isn&#x27;t just getting TLA+ into Z3 which as you say is already covered by the apalache project.<p>I think that as someone who doesn&#x27;t really know TLA+, but is very familiar with python, it feels very comforting to being using python instead of something totally foreign. Also since it is such a small translation (really the 10 lines always combinator is the core of it), if you want&#x2F;need access to the logical guts of the checker, it&#x27;s easy. Or if you wanted to autogenerate a spec in some manner, being embedded in python is a huge boon.')
