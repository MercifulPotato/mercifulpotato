Already in a small mountain town but in my new-ish neighborhood the houses are crowded together.  We&#x27;ve considered buying more remote land but the zoning codes in most CO counties require you to finish a building in 1 year and prohibit RVs until a house is finished (to deter people from doing exactly what we would do: parking an RV on your 10 acres).  So: if we could rent a similar setup once in a while for a month or two that would have great appeal.   However in my situation I would NOT want other cabins, bathrooms,  or firepits any closer than 300 or 400 feet away. If I want to hear my neighbors while i&#x27;m coding I can just stay at home.')
