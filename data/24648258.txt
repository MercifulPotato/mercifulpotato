Dealing with car seats is one of the most annoying and cumbersome issues of being a parent in the US.<p>However I will also say, for the sake of other parents who may be in a similar boat: Diono Radian carseats fit 3 across in our Mazda 3, which isn&#x27;t exactly a big car. So if you find the right seat, you can make it work.<p>The biggest problem is the infant period where they have to face backwards. For that we went with a Cybex Aton 2, which was sufficiently &quot;vertical&quot; that the front seat passenger could sit comfortably. Everything else we tried required the front seat to be shoved way too far forward.')
