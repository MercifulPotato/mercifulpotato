Since when is the number of of past comments a barometer for legitimacy? I mean Hacker News even gives you the option to post from a throwaway account.<p>Further the comment is simply refuting one Wired article with an earlier article Wired published on the same subject in which he participated in. It&#x27;s not like some crazy idea was being posited in the comment.<p>Lastly Dr Stillwell has made the assertion many times that the app and data he and Dr Michal Kosinskis developed for their &quot;MyPersonality Quiz&quot; app at Cambridge University is neither the same app or data as Aleksandar Kogan&#x27;s My Digital Life&quot; app that Kogan developed  for Global Science Research and their client SCL Elections.
