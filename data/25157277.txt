I&#x27;ve been experimenting with an old TRS-80 CoCo I have. I&#x27;ve got the original system, built in 1982, and it still works. But, emulators of the machine are actually easier to use. So, I&#x27;m developing software for the machine there and I&#x27;ll transfer it over.<p>As long as we save these old files, they&#x27;ll be accessible in the future.<p>But, probably not everything will survive, only the most important things. I think I&#x27;m okay with that.<p>Then again, maybe by 2120 there will not be enough interest in a machine from 1982 to continue to build an emulator. But, maybe they will emulate the MacBook M1 and from there my great grandkids can load an even older emulator to try the TRS-80 that they read about in my programming ebook from 2019. If HTML, Kindle or PDF still exist anyway.')
