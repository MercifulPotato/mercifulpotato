I&#x27;ve seen synthetic differential geometry, which isn&#x27;t nearly well-developed enough for use in all of physics, and I&#x27;ve seen nonstandard analysis, which obviously doesn&#x27;t do away with the uncomputable reals at all.<p>&gt; there is no way in which the use of mathematics by physics serves as justification for the reality<p>I am not saying the standard reals are <i>real</i>. I am saying that they are more convenient than any existing alternative, and fulfil the current needs of all of physics. I am also saying that the parent&#x27;s claim that &quot;uncomputable numbers â€¦ in the guise of string theory obtained a death grip on fundamental physics&quot; is absurd, since string theory and uncomputable reals are pretty much unrelated.')
