If you make a &quot;Oh, the places you&#x27;ll boldly go!&quot; joke on HN, the Geisel estate won&#x27;t come after you - or if they do, your post will be taken down after almost everyone who was going to read it has read it.<p>If a million people make a million &quot;Oh, the places you&#x27;ll boldly go!&quot; jokes on social media, maybe they&#x27;ll come after the 10 most popular. If so, the world can live with the other 990,000.  More likely though, they&#x27;ll come after the 10 guys , the 10 guys selling T-shirts with the meme, who you already agree are fair game.')
