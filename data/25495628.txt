Item(by='calibas', descendants=None, kids=[25497656], score=None, time=1608563662, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25492672, text='&gt;Morals are how one ought to behave, and how one ought to behave can intersect with cultural and personal values, but is not determined by cultural and personal values.<p>There are plenty of people who believe this, that their morals are absolute, and you can refer to the Spanish Inquisition to see exactly how &quot;evil&quot; that kind of thinking can get. Moral relativists are saints compared to what the Catholics have done in the name of &quot;morality&quot;.<p>All religious fanatics agree that morals are absolute, they just don&#x27;t agree on what those morals are.<p>Also, and I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll disagree, but how you quantify and qualify &quot;merits&quot; is based upon personal&#x2F;cultural values. If you don&#x27;t realize this you&#x27;ll just argue endlessly with people over whose perspective is correct, not realizing you&#x27;re both just viewing things through your own biases.<p>To me, &quot;good morals&quot; are trying to understand and empathize with other people, while allowing them their own unique perspective.')
