But in general Reddit has so little content actually worth anyone&#x27;s time that it&#x27;s crazy to me how people spend so much time on it.<p>I don&#x27;t go to Reddit for content, I go for the community. That doesn&#x27;t seem right because the perception is that Reddit is highly toxic, but it sustains a lot of life when you look closer.<p>There is a particular health-related sub-reddit that I discovered after a diagnosis and while it is highly imperfect it was a lifeline and something I spent a lot of time contributing back on. In about 20% of threads it spun off to PM threads and discussions continued over days. I see this pattern across the site, even though my bookmark goes to r&#x2F;programming.')
