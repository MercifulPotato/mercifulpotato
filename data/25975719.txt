This is exactly the kind of website that should be built with reliable technologies.  You don&#x27;t need fancy animations or whatever junk the SPA style sites  have.  Just old style server side frameworks, minimal Javascript, standards supported HTML and CSS.  The article mentioned Internet Explorer as an issue?  Cross browser support is no issue if you stick to the old standard HTML and CSS and minimize use of Javascript.  Mobile support?  That&#x27;s just loading the right CSS library.

The goal here is a simple reliable CRUD website for scheduling appointments, the previous generation of web development tech stack is perfect for this.')
