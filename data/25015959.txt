But haven&#x27;t had ready-made solutions.&quot;<p>You don&#x27;t need a ready made solution unless you are trying to keep the data consistent, too. If you are, better to use something off the shelf. If you aren&#x27;t...just deserialize it into whatever local data format makes sense, the same as you&#x27;d do reading from an external cache. You basically just have some push&#x2F;poll mechanism to get data from your data store when updated&#x2F;at intervals, deserialize it, and now it lives in RAM.<p>The one downside of that is if autoscaling is thrashing instances, it can thrash your data store (though that&#x27;s true with Redis etc too, depending what is loading data into it; having a caching layer in between DOES decouple that), and also what happens if the data store is unreachable (I&#x27;ve done things like query the rest of the cluster for the data, just via a REST API, because the total amount needed was all of a few megs).')
