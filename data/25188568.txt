The only access that is guaranteed by law is to emergency services. If you don&#x27;t have a paid insurance (through your employer or yourself), then you cannot access preventive care or otherwise normal medical consultation. Millions of people in the US don&#x27;t have access.<p>For example, if someone needs to treat cancer, it doesn&#x27;t make any good to go to an emergency unit: they will discharge the patient as it is not an emergency situation.')
