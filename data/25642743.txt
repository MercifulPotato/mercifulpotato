Inertia implies the world is divided into cells numbered 1 to N, and people don’t move from X to X + 1 unless they report, say 5, consecutive times from X + 1. Overlapping systems remap the cells 1,2,3 to 1; 2,3,4 to 2 and so on. So if someone oscillated between new no. 1 and new no. 2, you’d still have no of knowing whether they were in old style cells no 2 or 3.<p>Hmm yeah I meant overlapping cells then, not inertia based ones.')
