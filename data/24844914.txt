It might be part of the issue, but it&#x27;s very likely because most big applications use tooling that hide this issue, i.e. using tools like Babel which just translate let&#x2F;const into var automatically. I imagine it&#x27;s never really been noticed because it just never really has been a &quot;real world&quot; problem.')
