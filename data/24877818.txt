And every once in a while, a developer or UX researcher gets thrown in the mix (or middle) to try and build some kind of a bridge between them. It really looks like projects are started out of a crazy overnight &quot;we need to do SOMETHING NOW&quot; hurry, and then 6 months down the road, everyone just sort of lost interest and moved on to other things.')
