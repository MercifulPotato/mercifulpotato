I hate their special names for everything. Reminds me of Starbucks.<p>Here is my take: GCP tools are better PubSub, CloudSQL. However they don&#x27;t support email and their docs are not as up to date and helpful as AWS.<p>I think the main reason to select the big three is a) security (network, instance, user management) b) you don&#x27;t get fired for selecting the big guys c) some specialized tools (SES, s3, CDNs, github)<p>I always feel that the time you invest to learn all the details of AWS you could have invested into Ansible, Docker, Wireguard, Iptables, zfs and linux, and deploy a much more cost effective solution on Heztner, (which I prefer over upcloud, do, vultr). But you need to know what you are doing. Many companies prefer to trust a vendor instead of their employees.')
