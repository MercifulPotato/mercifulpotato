In the event of a default by one member this could trigger\na chain reaction. Firstly, initial margins will rise in an event of a default, which will restrict other traderâ€™s ability to\nparticipate in the market possibly acerbating the move in the underlying markets. Secondly, if the defaulting member was\na particularly large player in one asset (likely, as this would be the cause of the default), the members with opposite\npositions may not receive variation margin and hence will become unhedged at the very moment they need hedging.\nThirdly, the clearinghouse may well have to recapitalise itself from the surviving members.  Major clearinghouse members (including JP Morgan) appear to be seriously worried about a clearinghouse problem after the default by a member of Nasdaq Clearing AB ...&quot;<p>Be careful out there. :-)')
