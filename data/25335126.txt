I cook a lot, and I moved from a kitchen with a modern electric range, to a gas one... and it was a definite downgrade.<p>My only concern is how well a wok will heat up on induction.<p>Gas has the benefit of wrapping around the wok, I worry that induction won&#x27;t do that. :&#x2F;<p>I hate the smooth glass electric stoves, if a pan is even slightly warped it won&#x27;t work. I&#x27;ve waited 20+ minutes for a pot of water to boil on an electric glass top because the pot had a slight bow to it so only a tiny fraction sat on the actual stove.<p>Also the last glass top I had got messed up the first time a sugary liquid over boiled and spilled on it. Never could get it looking brand new again (and most glass tops I&#x27;ve seen have stains, even after being vigorously cleaned by professionals!)')
