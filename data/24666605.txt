Most jobs in my field require a driver&#x27;s license to apply.<p>I live in this town. I would be happy to help people succeed in developing it, but I was treated so badly that I don&#x27;t even want to help these people anymore.<p>Anyway, I am doing my own thing and maybe that will finally pan out for me financially. The short version is I had a lengthy health crisis and I am more able to work now. So hopefully that will lead to more money, in spite of the world being a lousy place full of lousy people.')
