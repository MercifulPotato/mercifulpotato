When offered choice between A and B, people routinely evaluate A in some ideal situation X which is not real, decide that A does not match this situation very well, and discard it, choosing B - while failing to notice that in real situation B is even further from achieving the desired outcome.<p>Example: we consider building option A and B for a feature of the product, and we know users like feature B much better, so we don&#x27;t choose option A, even though we have neither resources not budget to actually implement B properly. As a result, we get half-implemented broken B instead of somewhat-less-liked but working A, and the users end up hating the whole thing. Seen it so many times.')
