Itâ€™s called social media.<p>Without getting into the irony of the fact that the article we&#x27;re discussing was blocked on social media, I want to make clear: I don&#x27;t want to abandon editorial rigor.<p>But I do think that electioneering concerns should be irrelevant to the context of whether you present information in the public interest. Just as reporting on Trump&#x27;s tax returns or the Podesta emails were in the public interest, so too are the Hunter Biden emails.<p>There has <i>not</i> been a historical problem of major publications publishing Russian falsehoods. The &quot;fake news&quot; epidemic is mostly quickly stood up sites propagating on Facebook.<p>Nor did I see any evidence that Glenn was connected to a Russian disinformation effort. If that were to change (say, if he were found to be receiving payments from the Russian government), then I would support removing him as a writer outright.<p>&gt; an editor still had to find balance and appropriate context.<p>Agreed. My claim here is that the editorial staff of The Intercept failed at this goal and their suggestions were not balanced.')
