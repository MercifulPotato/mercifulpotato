Because I don&#x27;t want to see that again, I&#x27;m living in the past?<p>Should I ignore previous experience as unimportant?<p>I&#x27;d point out that <i>because</i> NYC took strong action back then, we are now mostly open.  And I&#x27;m glad we are.<p>I don&#x27;t think we should lock back down.  Rather I think it&#x27;s important to do the myriad <i>other</i> things (social distancing, mask wearing, basic hygiene, widespread testing&#x2F;tracing, etc.) that will keep the number of cases at a relatively low level (cf. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www1.nyc.gov&#x2F;site&#x2F;doh&#x2F;covid&#x2F;covid-19-data.page" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www1.nyc.gov&#x2F;site&#x2F;doh&#x2F;covid&#x2F;covid-19-data.page</a> ) to <i>avoid</i> such unwanted draconian measures.<p>Ignoring the risk posed by <i>not</i> doing the things that will limit the spread just increases the likelihood that the virus will be uncontrolled and make &quot;lockdowns&quot; <i>more</i> and not less likely.<p>I remember what happened in March-May precisely because I want to <i>avoid</i> further lockdowns, not because I support them.')
