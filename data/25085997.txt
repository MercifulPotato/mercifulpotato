Assuming I have this right, there are no &quot;off year&quot; elections in a parliamentary system like in Canada. Elections occur when the government in power receives a vote of no confidence. In a minority government situation this could be the first session after an election. In the rare occasion that a government makes its 5 year term limit, the PM will &quot;drop the writ&quot; at a strategic point to queue up an election.<p>Municipal elections do occur on a schedule here, but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s relevant since it&#x27;s hyper local.')
