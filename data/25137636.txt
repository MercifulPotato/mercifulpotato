Sony actually announced this was going to happen a few months ago and it was covered in a few prominent online gaming sites. The only thing Sony did was streamline their online store (no delisting going on) to focus on current and previous gen stuff. All the older stuff is still available on their respective console stores. So if you want to buy or browse PS3 games, you have to boot up your old PS3 and open the store, no big deal really to have to use the machine they play on to buy them. Very few websites will keep all the content live continuously just for the sake of it, they nearly all revamp and update occasionally, especially with new product&#x2F;technology launches.')
