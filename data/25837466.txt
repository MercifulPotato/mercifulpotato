I agree that it&#x27;s pedagogically sound to <i>motivate</i> the notion of determinant by the volume of a parallelepiped, but using volume as the <i>definition</i> of determinant just doesn&#x27;t sound right.<p>And strictly speaking, determinant is not volume because the former is dimensionless. It is the scaling factor of the volume when a geometric entity is transformed by a linear map.')
