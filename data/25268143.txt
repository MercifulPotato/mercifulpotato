It needs a friendly UI, etc, but it has potential for sure.<p>Generally, any situation where you&#x27;re away from the office and need to be able to print tiny bits of paper regularly, it could be quite useful.<p>Other than that it&#x27;s a little gimmicky, <i>maybe</i> you could print off nice little TODO lists or something, but nothing a normal printer wouldn&#x27;t do much better.<p>&gt; If you are broke and want to learn programming, you&#x27;d be<p>&gt; much better off with that Raspberry Pi keyboard and an<p>&gt; external display.<p>Once you&#x27;ve got an SD card, support cables, etc, you&#x27;re looking at quite a reasonable second-hand laptop. If you&#x27;re able to go desktop, sometimes you can even pick up something for free.')
