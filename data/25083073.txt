It was he &quot;blessed hardware&quot;. Wifi didn&#x27;t work after wake &#x2F; sleep and my connection via usb-c to my monitor was unusable. I switched back to a mac because I wanted to work, not fix my tools.<p>These aren&#x27;t one off anecdotes, there are dozens of people in this thread with the same story slightly different. This isn&#x27;t people going to Apple because it is shiny, it&#x27;s going to Apple because managing hardware isn&#x27;t their job.<p>Either verbally address that meaningfully or drop the condescending attitude.')
