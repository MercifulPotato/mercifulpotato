Hillel is quoted in the Mishna[0] as saying,<p>&quot;If I am not for me, who is for me? If I am for myself, what am I? If not now, when?&quot;[1]<p>If Hillel said &quot;if not you, then who?&quot; I have not found a source, but I believe this is a common interpretation of his first sentence. Then again, maybe he was talking about self care and not taking responsibility. I don&#x27;t know.<p>[0] Avoth 1.14<p>[1] Translation by me, the wording is terse and open to interpretation so I tried to be faithful to the text and not inject my own interpretation')
