I haven&#x27;t gotten around to going through Michael Feathers&#x27;s book, but the list of steps described is what I try and do anyways when working with legacy code.<p>It is amazing how fast bitrot can take hold of a codebase that isn&#x27;t being continually maintained. The author&#x27;s reference to broken window theory, that once you have a chunk of code that is pretty gnarly, the next person who comes along and has to add something to it just slaps it in there, it is already a mess, so why try and clean it up? There is a hard tradeoff with pragmatism that we have to make, especially if you are working at a startup where not getting to market could be the death of your company. But I think that knowing and understanding these techniques can give you confidence that you will be able to go back later and clean up your own legacy code.')
