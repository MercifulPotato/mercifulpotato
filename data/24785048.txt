But for things like dryers where it&#x27;s a simple continuous motion for hours on end, I could see it easily justifying an air motor conversion.<p>Bonus: Compressed air is inherently dry. It&#x27;ll come out of the motor cooler than ambient, but pass it through a heat exchanger and you&#x27;ll get almost-room-temp super-dry air. (And maybe use the exchanger to condense some of the moisture out of the dryer&#x27;s exhaust; you&#x27;re halfway to a ventless condensing dryer already!)<p>I wonder if refrigeration appliances would be designed differently if they assumed compressed air as the power source.')
