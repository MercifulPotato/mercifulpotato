Often you don’t get a wanted effect without potential side effects.<p>OTC drugs are usually extremely cheap (hence why you could think the medical community dislikes cheap medication). The fact that you don’t need a medical professional to get them makes them a target for the alternative medicine crowd.<p>In the end it’s also the fault of patients for simply asking for simple cures.
