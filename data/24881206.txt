You wouldn&#x27;t use pure erlang for a game where perf is critical, but not every game is like that.<p>I bet you could even write a fantastic AAA game by carefully dropping into NIFs as necessary.<p>I think though my argument is that you also wouldn&#x27;t use <i>objects</i> for that sort of thing either.  The brittleness of the code has nothing to do with the underlying vm, or its performance, or even it&#x27;s concurrency, and everything to do with the code architecture and data organization, which is isomorphic between genservers and objects.')
