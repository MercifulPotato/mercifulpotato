There is plenty of historical precedent for tyrany overcoming public opinion, judiciary, politics. I don&#x27;t think the current topic is an example of this, but as a general statment on power i find this contrary to my experience.<p>You&#x27;re basically saying, I don&#x27;t worry about abuse of power because there will always be some check on it, no matter how ineffectual. That just flies in the face of every time someone managed to use their power to overcome whatever checks were in place.<p>And this is like a constant theme in history.
