What else was she attempting to steal from the election building?<p>You (or the allegers) are just creating a narrative that&#x27;s convenient for you&#x2F;them! And filling in the details. We don&#x27;t even see them leave the building!<p>Here&#x27;s another one: the lady on the left gave the other one her car keys, and the girl and guy were about to sneak off to the carpark to make out. Or, it was a bag of weed, and they&#x27;re about to go to the back of the building and get high.<p>Did you even confirm how the votes are stored? There are boxes with United States Postal Service in the background. So surely they&#x27;re counting mail ballots. There are no computers on the desks, so, it doesn&#x27;t seem the results of the counted mail ballots are being stored digitally. Do these 3 look like master hackers, or is it so easy to tamper with the digital files that it&#x27;s plausible anyone (including many in republican areas) could do it, but you&#x27;ve only &quot;caught&quot; these 3 doing it?')
