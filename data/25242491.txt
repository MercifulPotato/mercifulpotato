It also saves energy on FALD backlights and will save energy with upcoming microLED displays.  It&#x27;s also nice when your looking at your device in a dark room.   Light mode is nice when your in a bright room or outdoors during the day.<p>I think apple started the trend because their devices were going OLED to improve battery life.  I think dark and light mode are good and basically all apps should have both.  That way if you hate one or the other you can always turn on the mode you like.')
