The underlying NT kernel seeing all processes, whether Win32 or WSL, is one thing, but the psutils in the Linux world being able to see non-Linux processes doesn&#x27;t make any amount of sense.<p>kill works by sending signals. This makes no sense to processes that are not in the Linux domain.<p>Edit: also what ralph87 writes in paragraph 4:  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25154556" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25154556</a>')
