A failure mode so rare that they can&#x27;t isolate it.<p>RPi--the system that overdraws every USB interface on the planet and requires <i>special power supplies</i>.  RPi--the system that couldn&#x27;t even get USB-C right.  RPi--the system that shuts down when you fire off a flashbulb (not their fault--but still a power failure).  RPi--the compact system that needs a heatsink or it shuts down.<p>RPi has lots of things going for it.
