I thought nothing of driving in Lee Highway, and didn’t know that all these monuments are created in the 1930s.<p>And that doesn’t even mean Trump’s assertion is even incorrect. Maybe the protesters had the same misconceptions about history as many people who grew up in a fairly liberal place in the 1990s. That actually supports Trump’s point that people who oppose taking down the statutes aren’t necessarily raving white supremacists.')
