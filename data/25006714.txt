PA already had a rule that they couldn&#x27;t start counting mail in ballots until polls closed; that&#x27;s not new, and that&#x27;s essentially what&#x27;s causing the delay here, along with similar rules elsewhere. States which didn&#x27;t have rules like this finished quicker, but these rules aren&#x27;t new.')
