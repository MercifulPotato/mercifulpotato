So when we replaced the stove we went with induction. Its amazing, and heats faster than our previous gas stove. There is no loss from heating the air around the bottom of the pan, and you can pump a surprising amount of heat out real fast with induction.<p>Was also surprised to find out that it is actually the more economical choice for us as well. We can only do propane, and not natural gas, and its a lot more expensive, so it works out nicely.<p>Don&#x27;t want to go back to anything other than induction at this point.')
