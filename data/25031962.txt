There are three different Congressional districts that are partially within Prince William County.<p>These aren&#x27;t nefarious, suspicious Biden-only votes, they&#x27;re just showing one race that&#x27;s on everybody&#x27;s ballot and comparing it to another that isn&#x27;t. The count of reporting precincts also seems to have been edited for the listing of Presidential votes: it shows 44 in the image instead of the actual number of 94.<p>You <i>could</i> chalk these things up to mistakes or misunderstandings, but judging by the content of the rest of this person&#x27;s messaging I think it&#x27;s pretty clear that assuming good faith isn&#x27;t warranted here.<p>(edited to fix Twitter link... I think)')
