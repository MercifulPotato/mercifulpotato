Restrictions (even speech restrictions themselves) are subject to the court of public opinion (we&#x27;re talking about them right now), there&#x27;s the judiciary, political opposition and so on.<p>This argument never had any pull for me for the same reason I&#x27;m against abolishing the police or abolishing surveillance or anything else. Power, even in the hands of people I don&#x27;t like, can&#x27;t be exercised arbitrarily.')
