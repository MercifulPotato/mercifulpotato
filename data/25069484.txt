Some things really do work better in a &quot;borrow&quot; type system. For instance, I&#x27;m fixing up my old bike and the sheer number of tools necessary for basic tasks is astounding. I wish there were some local &quot;bike maintenance tools&quot; library where like-minded folks could go to fix up their bikes and use tools. You could probably serve an entire city with a handful of chain tools, and yet it&#x27;s interesting to consider how many millions of them must be manufactured so that everyone has one for the one time a year they need to replace a bike chain.')
