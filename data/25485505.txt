The bigger question is if Jeff Bezos were replaced with someone else, how much different would Amazon be? Unfortunately, we don&#x27;t really have any tools to scientifically answer this type of question. My belief is that Amazon wouldn&#x27;t be a thousand times smaller if Jeff Bezos were replace with another reasonably competent manager.<p>Also very important would be to ask how many of those 800k people would have similar or better payed jobs if Amazon didn&#x27;t exist at all. Would there be an Amazon-shaped hole in the market, or would there actually be more economic activity if instead of one giant corporation there would be thousands of smaller ones? I believe the second is more likely to be true.')
