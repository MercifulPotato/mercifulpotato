Item(by='didibus', descendants=None, kids=[25105443], score=None, time=1605466473, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25099492, text='I&#x27;m mostly a classic liberal person, think founding fathers, enlightenment era.<p>And to be honest, I&#x27;m curious about what your definition of conservative is?<p>To me, there&#x27;s only two way to define it. Either the old way, where conservative means you are a feudalist, monarchist, theocrat, oligarch, autocrat, statist, fascist, etc. Basically you want to go back to a pre-liberal establishment style of society, and are opposed to a liberal democracy.<p>In this definition, as you see, all these today are generally known as morally bad. Jew hating tin foil crackpot would fall under here, or any other form of A hates on B, since all prior forms of government are about having a ruling individual or class over others, thus a way for A to rule over B.<p>So in that definition, being conservative means being against liberal democracy, thus against democracy, reason, liberty and equality.<p>Or the new way, where conservative means liberal but not progressive. In this sense, you believe and value liberal democracy, thus democracy, reason, liberty and equality, but you are content with the implementation of government that we currently have to drive and uphold those liberal values. Therefore you oppose yourself to progressives who think that we&#x27;re not doing a good enough job at implementing liberal values, in that you believe it is either too risky to change the current implementation or that the proposed changes would result in a worst realization of liberalism.<p>As you see, in the second categorization, you&#x27;re still a liberal, so it doesn&#x27;t make sense to speak about conservative vs liberal in that second one. And because in the US I see people put liberal and conservative at opposite ends, I tend to assume the first categorization. Which would imply that conservatives, to me, are a huge treat to democracy, reason, liberty and equality.<p>So I&#x27;m genuinely looking for clarity. Is there some miscommunication here? How do you categorize &quot;conservative&quot;.<p>I ask because it is very confusing to me. You speak of nuance, and I want to understand that nuance, so would love an explanation.')
