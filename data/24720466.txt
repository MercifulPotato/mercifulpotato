Item(by='ThrowawayR2', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602173294, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24712955, text='&quot;Meritocracy was meant as a satire&quot; is brought up as a rebuttal frequently but it&#x27;s somehow never accompanied by an explanation of how the negatives Young brings up are relevant to the topic at hand.  Based on a cursory search, a summary of Young&#x27;s point in his satire seems to be that meritocracy had the undesirable consequences of demeaning&#x2F;devaluing those who scored poorly on measures of merit and also triggering a societal arms race as people did whatever they could to improve their own and their children&#x27;s measured merit, neither of which is salient to this discussion.  He doesn&#x27;t seem to say that meritocracy itself was ineffective.  (Somebody please correct me if I am in error here.)<p>It&#x27;s also worth noting that the same Wikipedia article that the parent poster points to says that the concept of meritocracy predates Young&#x27;s coining of the word by centuries and also details its history of successful application by many societies in various eras.')
