Actual election day is November 3, 2020.<p>Some states are in early voting right now [0].  That typically means that there&#x27;s a very limited number of polling stations open.  For instance, in Pinellas County, FL there&#x27;s only 5 early voting locations, compared to 301 poll locations during election day.  That&#x27;s a 60x discrepancy!  This is for 713,000 registered voters.  Pinellas county early voting also doesn&#x27;t start until next Monday, October 19.<p>I think there was likely not much thought put into the number of early voting locations.  It&#x27;s always been viewed as a low-budget, customer-friendly alternative to voting on election day.  That probably should have been re-evaluated given the pandemic and the likelihood of greater numbers of early voters.<p>And by far, the biggest problem is that election day is always on a Tuesday and is not a national holiday.  IMO this would be the best change to make first, to enable more people to be available for voting.<p>[0] The availability and dates of early voting are determined at a state level.')
