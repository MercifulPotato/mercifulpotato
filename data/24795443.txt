I bet I was better at solving quizzes when I was young. I&#x27;m sure I can understand and solve real world problems now.<p>Agree. That&#x27;s what these quizzes miss.<p>After working in development for years, top performing developers aren&#x27;t the ones who dwell on these trivial function-level optimizations.<p>Yet, that&#x27;s exactly what these tests are testing for.<p>The 10x developers are the ones who can understand the big picture, synthesize information, and deliver solutions that are flexible given constantly changing requirements.<p>Function-level optimizations are important, but it&#x27;s not something we sit around and memorize like we did when we were still in school.<p>As you said, if the company is looking for developers fresh out of college, then sure... These quizzes are a good way to determine raw computer science knowledge.<p>But if the company wants code that&#x27;s more likely to work the first time, and to require less maintenance over the long-run, these tests are actually filtering out those more-seasoned developers.')
