If only domain methods are able to mutate state, it&#x27;s a lot easier to find where bugs might be hiding. If any consumer of your domain model can mutate anything in any way it sees fit and then invoke some generic UpdateState(model) method, then you have a much bigger problem.<p>Put differently, as long as you have good accountability of all the things that <i>can</i> change the state and are comfortable with how that set of things operates, then you are probably in a decent position.')
