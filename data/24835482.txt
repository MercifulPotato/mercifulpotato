The lead using a sinus oscillator to get nice pure tones, a deeper sound 4x slower with a pulse oscillator to get more edgy sound, the deepest sound 16x slower with a sawtooth to get a gritty bass. Layered with the perspective scaling of the dots to get something bleeps in synch with the visuals.<p>Hope that answers your question')
