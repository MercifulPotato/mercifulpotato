This is just the example I use that, to me, is the most straight forward and best documented.<p>&gt; Why in most cases did they not even try once in a venue where lying would have penalties?<p>Often times the courts haven&#x27;t even provided the opportunity to swear in witnesses.<p>Other times, e.g. Arizona, only a few were deposed unfortunately.  Probably for time reasons?  It took weeks to document the affidavits.  I would have preferred that Binnall had chosen other witnesses&#x2F;affidavits to swear in, but there certainly wasn&#x27;t time to do them all.')
