Not sure why it&#x27;s meaningful that a laptop maker can put out a model that&#x27;s as thick as a college book, has the very top bins of all parts, sounds like a jet engine when running at max speed, and is purchased by 1% of the most avid gamers.<p>Oh, and if someone puts out a second model that adds RGB backlit keyboard, but is otherwise equivalent, that should somehow count against Apples achievements, because for some reason counting by number of models is meaningful regardless of how many copies that model sold o_O')
