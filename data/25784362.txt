E.g. one of the most upvoted news from HN is “Steve Jobs has died”. I imagine even on your system users would assume this would raise to the top and would buy a lot of “shares”, so it becomes more of a game of “predicting what will be further upvoted &#x2F; echo chambered”. Am I missing something?<p>Again, exciting project nevertheless.')
