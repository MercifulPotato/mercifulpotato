As a side effect, you are extracting energy from the device with the graphene in the lab so it will get cooler.<p>So the net effect is that the device in the lab gets cooler and the object far away get hotter. So you have a flux of heat. But if the other object is hotter, you have a lux of heat from in the wrong direction, that is impossible according to the Second Law.<p>There are a million ways to rewrite this <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Second_law_of_thermodynamics" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Second_law_of_thermodynamics</a> in more abstract or more concrete ways. With some oversimplifications, another is that you need at least two heat baths and the efficiency of the device to transform heat from the &quot;hot&quot; bath to of &quot;useful&quot; energy can be calculate using the temperatures of the baths. When the difference of temperature is zero, the efficiency is zero and the device can produce no &quot;useful&quot; energy. Or in other words, with only one heath bath, you can produce no &quot;useful&quot; energy.')
