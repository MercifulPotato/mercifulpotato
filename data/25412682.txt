But why would it matter when buying a car? Sure, Tesla showed that it was possible (and Nissan with the Leaf), but being affordable matters more than being first.<p>In any case, infrastructure matters even more for EVs. I was in the market for an EV car in Japan, and ended up buying an ICE car, with the intent to switch in 5~10 years when the infrastructure catches up. I live in a brand new building and it&#x27;s not even equipped for EVs! Crazy.<p>The only EV owners I know have houses. I hope things will change thanks to the new Suga administration that seems somewhat more forward thinking than the Abe one in these matters... We will see.')
