Most of the economy is like this, you can&#x27;t really pre-emptively define what is &quot;good&quot;, the best way is to create a market and let consumers decide in aggregate.<p>Security is a little easier to specify, it&#x27;s a more clearly defined space but you still have to be careful or you end up with outdated standards actually holding back industry security.<p>I have nothing against a public option, as long as it is an <i>option</i>. Government regulation of the tech industry doesn&#x27;t sound to me like it&#x27;s providing more options.<p>I never thought basic income was a good idea in the first place, I&#x27;m not sure what to say about this.<p>Basic healthcare is a more complicated case, but the healthcare industry doesn&#x27;t look anything like the software industry. Regulating healthcare won&#x27;t and shouldn&#x27;t be like regulating software.')
