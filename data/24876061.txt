I didn&#x27;t notice the first example where its more apparent there are paintings used as a source material -- are the other examples on the landing page produced from paintings or some other original source? It would be an interesting task to try and design images knowing they will be used as the GAN&#x27;s inspiration.<p>Also out of curiosity, did you determine anything about the legality of training the GAN on copyrighted images and decidings its output is its own creative work, or using public domain images?')
