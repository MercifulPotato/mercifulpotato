Especially since GDPR isn&#x27;t enforced that heavily.<p>But I also understand why US companies are doing this. It&#x27;s kinda like when my dad got parking and speeding tickets sent home from a foreign country. Most likely nothing would happen if he didn&#x27;t pay them, but you never know when you want to go back to holiday in $country, and the border agent sees them in your &quot;permanent record&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s at least imaginable that the EU _could_ do something similar, ask for a fine and if not dealt with, the company (or even worse directors of the company) getting some kind of dent in the proverbial permanent record.<p>(I&#x27;m not saying that it&#x27;s likely, but if EU visitors aren&#x27;t a big user base for your local regional news paper, I see why it&#x27;s so tempting to just check the &quot;Block EU visitors&quot; checkbox.)')
