As someone who ran bots  since they were simply macros this is exactly what is done.<p>If you find a botnet you can assume they have an additional ~50% or greater &#x27;clean&#x27; accounts on standby for exactly this situation. These become easier to obtain over time via purchasing or black hatting accts, etc. The longer you run undetected the longer you have to stockpile clean accts as you <i>know</i> its simply a matter of time.<p>I would imagine if 100% of your revenue depends on it you&#x27;d be even more prepared.<p>I know back in the Diablo 2 days some of us were friendly with blizdevs who would warn us of impending banwaves, upcoming updates to server code and whatnot. I&#x27;m quite sure the same still applies today only at a far larger scale since back then online communication was still young.<p>Anyways all this to say if they are experienced and know its coming they wont be down for long, if at all.')
