I want to work on docs and knowledge-transfer a lot more in 2021. 2019 and 2020 were definitely full of sprinting to bring Caddy 2 up to par. I think in terms of major functionality it&#x27;s settling down now, so docs and guides will be more feasible.<p>In the meantime, I always encourage anyone to contribute to our wiki: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;caddy.community&#x2F;c&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;13" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;caddy.community&#x2F;c&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;13</a> -- there&#x27;s already lots of great topics there and room for plenty more, especially examples.<p>Hint: there&#x27;s a LOT of market space for paid content to master the Caddy web server, if anyone reading this is looking to profit from their expertise...')
