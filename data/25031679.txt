America&#x27;s sins aren&#x27;t unique, but Americans are fairly unique in demanding that they shouldn&#x27;t have to confront those sins. That&#x27;s for people of color to do, every day, disproportionately shouldering the burden of American&#x27;s demand for innocence. It&#x27;s like white Americans insist on being children, needing and deserving to be emotionally coddled instead of being told to grow up.')
