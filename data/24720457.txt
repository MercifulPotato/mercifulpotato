Item(by='dmos62', descendants=None, kids=[24721077], score=None, time=1602173232, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24720243, text='I think you might be underestimating the comfort and convenience of train travel.<p>&gt; Thatâ€™s almost 6 hours on the train compared to a 2 hour flight.<p>A 2 hour flight also has you getting to the airport early-ish (~1h), going through check-in and&#x2F;or security (0.75-2.0h, 1.5h average in my experience), waiting for luggage upon arrival and navigating the airport (~0.5h), getting to center city from the airport (~1h). So in addition to 2 hours in the air, there&#x27;s an additional cost of 1h+1.5h+0.5h+1h=4h, so that&#x27;s 6 hours in total, and that&#x27;s best case scenario.<p>I&#x27;d choose train travel over plane travel always, provided the trip is not more than a couple thousand kilometers and it&#x27;s an express. Trains are spacious (in comparison), and you don&#x27;t experience intense pressure changes, or the bad air conditioning that you have in planes. Air travel tires me out for the rest of the day; after train travel I find myself energetic enough to do things the same day.')
