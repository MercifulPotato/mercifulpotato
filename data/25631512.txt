The author is grabbing random disasters to support his argument without any proof.<p>1) Toyota&#x27;s unintended acceleration: Brakes failed once in a while, so rarely that the problem was basically impossible to reproduce. The author notes that the car&#x27;s software was &quot;spaghetti&quot;. He does NOT prove that the latter caused the former. He doesn&#x27;t comment on whether other car manufacturers suffered similar problems, and whether their code was also of low quality. FWIW, there is speculation that Toyota&#x27;s problems were caused by cosmic rays flipping bits.<p>2) The Boeing MAX crashes: Again, the author claims that bad software was to blame. As is widely known by now, the causes of the crash were: 1) Boeing putting much-too-large engines on an old plane design (737) because this was cheaper than designing a new plance from scratch; 2) the weight distribution caused by this design led to stalls; 3) software was designed to override controls to deal with stalls; 4) the software was led astray by bad sensor input, and Boeing made sensor backups optional; 5) In another attempt to cut costs (retraining), Boeing claimed that the new model would be operated just like the old model, causing them to suppress information on the nature of the override and the methods for dealing with it. Again, this is all well known. Using this tragedy to slam object orientation is just breathtakingly wrong and stupid.')
