They could have also just opened the app to look at the messages.<p>&gt; The whole article read like amateur hour, which is I assume why they removed it.<p>&gt; <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;moxie&#x2F;status&#x2F;1337434126186553345" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;moxie&#x2F;status&#x2F;1337434126186553345</a><p>--<p>Basically yeah, adding a pin to signal would also prevent this, they didn&#x27;t bypass such extra measures.<p>This is what they did in their blog post:<p>&gt; We found that acquiring the key requires reading a value from the shared preferences file and decrypting it using a key called “AndroidSecretKey”, which is saved by an android feature called “Keystore”.<p>No further mention of it, so I assume they just had access to it. From Moxie&#x27;s post, I assume that the keystore is unlocked when the phone is.')
