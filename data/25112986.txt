One of them is avoiding to trip the run-of-the-mill scrapers. The takedown was serious but we don&#x27;t know what triggered the lawyers&#x27; attention in the first place. IMHO a simple runtime obfuscation would remove that particular attack vector, once coupled with some plausible deniability (i.e. deleting all downloaded data once tested). At that point, YTDL is still on RIAA&#x27;s generic shitlist (which will require other mitigations to survive) but at least doesn&#x27;t get flagged every week by a scraper.')
