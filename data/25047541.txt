For eg, marketing team needs a dashboard, the reporting&#x2F;ETL infra needs to setup or is broken, internal products, or even clearing the bug backlog. Ideally the dev shop also has someone who can do some product&#x2F;design work if necessary.<p>If you&#x27;re hiring a dev shop for higher velocity&#x2F;shipping features quicker, you have to be careful. Reviewing their PRs, communication (if in different TZs), sharing context, poorly done work, and disconnect between team&#x27;s best practices and theirs can eat into your core team&#x27;s time and potentially lead to some frustration.<p>As much as possible, the key is to protect your team&#x27;s time aside from critical inflection points -- initial scope, them sharing their approach, validating if it looks good, and the occasional review&#x2F;check-in.<p>Hope this helps.')
