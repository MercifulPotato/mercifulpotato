A tool that&#x27;s optimized for everybody is optimized for nobody. Jira for me is in the class of &quot;false consensus&quot; products. Since everybody has to manage work and get things done, there&#x27;s an illusion that people mean the same thing by that. But the way people and teams work and the kind of work they do varies so greatly that there will never be one perfect work management tool.')
