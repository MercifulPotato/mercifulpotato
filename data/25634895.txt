States have known since <i>this summer</i> that a vaccine was coming, likely by the end of the year, and somehow they have all neglected to prepare.<p>We&#x27;ve got what is by all measures a modern <i>miracle</i>, an answer to the most horrifying global event of the last century, given to us by a bunch of scientists who have been working nonstop for the last year to give it to us, and state health workers are doing things like taking weekends off and only opening a single vaccine site.<p>And then they also seem to concerned about <i>fairness</i> WRT to the vaccine distribution that they are willing to simply let this <i>literal miracle</i> go to waste on a shelf, rather than accidentally give it to somebody who didn&#x27;t deserve it.<p>The way that almost every state seems to be treating these vaccines are not in any way in alignment with what I would expect from <i>the worst pandemic in the last 100 years</i>.  It is <i>infuriating</i>.')
