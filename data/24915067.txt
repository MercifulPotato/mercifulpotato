This is a powerful message to send. It says, &quot;We know what you&#x27;re doing. Moreover we known <i>who&#x27;s</i> doing it. And there&#x27;s a risk and a price for doing that on our sovereign soil.&quot; This message isn&#x27;t just sent to the leaders and higher-ups, who has most likely already gotten protests through diplomatic channels. Instead it&#x27;s directly targeted at agents, of whom many will have second thought about accepting such assignments if they know they&#x27;re putting their own life and health at stake. On the other hand, I&#x27;m not truly convinced about case. It also sounds a bit like American made spin, to increase hostility towards Russia. On the other hand, Russia has indeed increased their undercover activities, and some of them might be eager to show or warn the world that they&#x27;re capable and dangerous. But death rays? Sounds like something out of an old James Bond film lol. So if nothing else, perhaps more people will write good spy flicks from this...')
