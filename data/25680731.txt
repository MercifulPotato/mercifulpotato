GMAC Bank was spun off as Ally Bank. Ally Bank (until 2014) was not even in the mortgage business.<p>I can tell you that as an actual customer of (the now former) GMAC Bank, I didn&#x27;t feel like I got short changed in any way. They had good interest rates, and I&#x27;m glad they survived through hook, crook, and some TARP money (which was ultimately paid back with interest).<p>Just my perspective, it doesn&#x27;t affect me in any way who you bank with.')
