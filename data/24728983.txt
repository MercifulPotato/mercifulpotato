Someone can make cookies based on your recipe and then make them again without looking at the recipe and then finally write their own recipe and still not violate copyright. You could repeat this for every single recipe in the book and then create an almost identical book with exactly the same recipes in the same order. There would be some minor differences because your memory is off and you have some creative freedom to design the book any way you want. However you wrote that book yourself and therefore it is yours.<p>Is there still a way to protect your cookies? Yes, it&#x27;s called patent law. It&#x27;s explicitly designed to prevent reinvention.')
