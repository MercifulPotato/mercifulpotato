We added one when we moved in and we got another 10 years out of the furnace.  What killed the furnace was 27 years of moving air.  And parts were no longer available to replace the &quot;squirrel cage&quot;.<p>Heating the house with natural gas (from the replacement furnace) is now cheaper than using electricity, which is not what I predicted when we put in the heat pump.  But I didn&#x27;t foresee fracking.<p>Anyway, heat pump gets us hot air in the winter, cold air in the summer, and lowers our bills.<p>A neighbor put in a well-based (as opposed to air, like ours) heat pump which I was very interested in.  But it took them 3 days of drilling (rocky soil) and tens of thousands of dollars.  So probably just as well.')
