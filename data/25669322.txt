By running &quot;lscpu&quot; I see only two lines in default mode (not using &quot;mitigations=off&quot; right now), everything else &quot;Not affected&quot;;<p><pre><code>  Vulnerability Spectre v1: Mitigation; usercopy&#x2F;swapgs barriers and __user pointer sanitization\n  Vulnerability Spectre v2: Mitigation; Full AMD retpoline, STIBP disabled, RSB filling\n</code></pre>\nBy having those it will affect my CPU perferomance?
