Learning C++ will not hinder you at all and the newer C++ features make it fairly easy to use for someone coming from higher level languages.<p>I have only dabbled with Rust (I use C++ professionally), so I don&#x27;t have a strong opinion about it. However, a lot of the positive reviews you hear about Rust are from amateurs who aren&#x27;t using it in real products and a lot of the criticism you hear of C++ is from people who don&#x27;t use it. Hopefully that helps you adjust some of what you hear to be a bit more grounded.')
