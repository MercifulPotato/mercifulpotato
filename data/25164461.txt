If there really are no systematic efforts to control the stray cat population, I have a hard time believing that nature isn&#x27;t performing the same function. Cat populations grow explosively unchecked- if this phenomenon has been happening for hundreds of years, there&#x27;s no way that the cat population hasn&#x27;t been butting up against various limits by now, with all the suffering that that implies.')
