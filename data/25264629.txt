If had a chronic illness I&#x27;d do the same.<p>I&#x27;m arguing against the experience of anyone person being applicable to anyone other than <i>that one person</i>.  That why we have the FDA and randomized controlled trials.  There are so many confounding factors that unless you test a treatment under very strict conditions, there is a very good chance you observed is completely unrelated to the treatment.
