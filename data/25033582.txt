Item(by='bananaface', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604920638, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25033355, text='Ryan Holiday&#x27;s debut book was called <i>Trust Me, I&#x27;m Lying</i> and it pretty much outlines his early internet marketing career and all the nutty tactics they used. He&#x27;s very blunt and the stories he tells should be required reading. I respect him for being honest.<p>He doesn&#x27;t address the weird Timarkothy Newmanson metamorphosis into esoteric actualization guru that coincidentally seems to occur to all of these guys once their hack-the-system-to-print-money tactics stop working, but you don&#x27;t need that outlined. It&#x27;s the only book from these guys I can stomach.')
