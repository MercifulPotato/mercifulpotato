When they&#x27;re treated like soundboards they tend to get entrenched, when they&#x27;re listened to they tend to listen in return. People listening to each other is the only hope of finding a common way forward, everything else just ends in sectarian violence. It is amazing that simply tolerating a diversity of opinions and listening to them has become such a radical notion!')
