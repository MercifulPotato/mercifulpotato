If you normally shoot RAW, they&#x27;ll be a bit &quot;flat&quot; since no post-processing is done, but Halide will post-process them to make them similar to jpg output (while retaining the editing flexibility that RAW gives).<p>What I can&#x27;t figure out...are the Instant RAW settings baked into the file as it is captured? Basically, if I open up a Halide RAW in Lightroom or DXO, will they be able to see the edits?')
