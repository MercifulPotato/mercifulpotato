Item(by='kamaal', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612069492, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25975485, text='&gt;&gt;Beef consumption has been forbidden in most Indian states since independence and supported by all political parties.<p>Only &#x27;Productive Cow(milk yielding)&#x27; slaughter was forbidden until recently. Karnataka(Ruled by same party as the center) recently banned all bovine slaughter. Farmers now say they will happily pass on the expenses to take care of unproductive cattle(calves, bulls and older bovines) to consumers in the form of higher priced milk.<p>Regarding the remaining thing. As a Married Indian muslim who has registered their marriage. All Indian muslims go under special marriage act whose provisions are way way more stricter than the Hindu marriage act. They even send out your application to the local mosques in Bangalore to check if this is a genuine alliance or if the couples have eloped and parents have objections to file. The time given is 45 days. All the best registering a marriage between a Muslim and Hindus.<p>&gt;&gt;It may forbid triple talaq but other provisions like custody and alimony still apply.<p>Literally negligible follow triple talaq in Muslim community. In my entire biological and parents biological existence and our entire network of friends and family we don&#x27;t of a single case of divorce happening this way.<p>Things like 498a and DV laws apply to all Indian citizens as they are criminal laws.<p>The reason why people protested against 3T is because even a random stranger could accuse a Muslim man of 3T and the criminal proceedings begin, with arrest and imprisonment of the Muslim man. tl;dr a law created to reign in strong men who wouldn&#x27;t bow to your political&#x2F;religious harassment.<p>&gt;&gt;Protests, crazy ones just like for the CAA.<p>It&#x27;s quite a telling about you when you say refusal to walk into concentration camps as crazy.')
