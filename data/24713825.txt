Some states have been doing this for a long time (Oregon, Colorado), but they have the processes in place to handle elections.  Other states are trying to do it in a few months with no real prep ahead of time.  We&#x27;re already seeing this lead to ballot printing problems, ex:[0].<p>To build on that, many of these states aren&#x27;t allowed to even open&#x2F;proces absentee&#x2F;vote-by-mail ballots until election day or after[0.5].  That means that problems with these ballots may not be caught ahead of time.  Along with that, having to processing millions of ballets (when they are used to 5-digit amounts of ballots), means it will take a lot longer to handle those ballots.  This will lead to a delay in knowing the results.  As well, mail-in-ballots get rejected at a much higher rate than in-person voting[1], which will lead to lawyers fighting over which ballots are valid if things are close.<p>Democrats are more likely to vote-by-mail than Republicans[2].  This means those delayed ballots will likely swing towards Biden, which means as days go on for counting, Biden&#x27;s lead is likely to increase (which is totally fine, but it will definitely stir up controversy).<p>Then you have lawmakers and judges changes the rules[3].  There are a few cases going on around the country where there is a push to allow late mail ballots to be counted.  In this case, a Judge decided to allow ballots to arrive up to 3-days post election.  These kinds of cases are going on around the country and still being fought.<p>It&#x27;s going to be messy.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;local&#x2F;va-politics&#x2F;virginia-voters-receive-duplicate-ballots&#x2F;2020&#x2F;09&#x2F;25&#x2F;2e9e52bc-ff51-11ea-9ceb-061d646d9c67_story.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;local&#x2F;va-politics&#x2F;virginia-vo...</a><p>[0.5] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncsl.org&#x2F;research&#x2F;elections-and-campaigns&#x2F;vopp-table-16-when-absentee-mail-ballot-processing-and-counting-can-begin.aspx" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncsl.org&#x2F;research&#x2F;elections-and-campaigns&#x2F;vopp-t...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npr.org&#x2F;2020&#x2F;08&#x2F;22&#x2F;904693468&#x2F;more-than-550-000-primary-absentee-ballots-rejected-in-2020-far-outpacing-2016" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npr.org&#x2F;2020&#x2F;08&#x2F;22&#x2F;904693468&#x2F;more-than-550-000-p...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.usatoday.com&#x2F;story&#x2F;news&#x2F;politics&#x2F;elections&#x2F;2020&#x2F;08&#x2F;18&#x2F;election-2020-biden-voters-twice-likely-vote-mail-survey-finds&#x2F;3394795001&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.usatoday.com&#x2F;story&#x2F;news&#x2F;politics&#x2F;elections&#x2F;2020&#x2F;...</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nymag.com&#x2F;intelligencer&#x2F;2020&#x2F;09&#x2F;pennsylvania-becomes-ground-zero-for-election-lawsuits.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nymag.com&#x2F;intelligencer&#x2F;2020&#x2F;09&#x2F;pennsylvania-becomes...</a>')
