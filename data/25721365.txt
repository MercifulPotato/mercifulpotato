Everyone I know has migrated away from facebook a long time ago. And a few years ago I heard stories suggesting this was a broad movement. People organising their birthday on facebook and no one showing up, etc. Kids today aren’t using facebook either. But facebook’s results suggest they are growing their active user base. So if those numbers are real, their user base must shift. At least away from european+educated users.')
