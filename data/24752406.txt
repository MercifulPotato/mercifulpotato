Wood was probably just a part of that gentleman&#x27;s own &quot;energy mix&quot;, consisting mostly of culm(coal dust), trash, coal and wood.<p>Recently coal dust for heating purposes was outlawed, along with stoves not meeting a certain standard of emissions, but that didn&#x27;t stop retailers from offering products which were not up to those standards.<p>Anyway the main issue still appears to be awareness, as many people who could easily afford to use gas for heating still choose to pollute, because it&#x27;s cheap and convenient.')
