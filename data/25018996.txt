Essentially, Atlassian holds customers with confidentiality requirements for their data hostage - no support after 2024 for on-prem at all.<p>The key thing to remember is that Atlassian is an Australian company, they are bound to Australian laws, their cloud is not in the legal area of the European Union. For anyone who has sensitive information to store, <i>all</i> Atlassian projects just have died, because the vendor cannot be trusted to not abuse their position any more.<p>Hopefully alternatives will be rising, it&#x27;s badly needed (especially given the ... shoddy state of the code&#x2F;architecture behind Atlassian projects).')
