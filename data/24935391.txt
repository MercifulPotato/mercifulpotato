Why would you say such a thing without providing any shred of evidence?<p>Are you actually saying, without irony, that it&#x27;s bullshit and baseless that Linus Torvalds, one of the most famously abusive OSS maintainers in history, had made people&#x27;s lives worse by way of these actions?<p>Linus himself has said that he recognizes he hurt people.<p>&gt; [RMS] awkwardly hit on some women because he is a bit of a social retard.
