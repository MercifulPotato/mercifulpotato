I have a rooted Nook Glowlight, years old, yet I find it much better.<p>The Dasung had several &#x27;modes&#x27; you could choose, but none worked well.  Worse, their software is closed source, is fairly buggy, and requires root for zero reason.  I felt very uncomfortable about installing it, and didn&#x27;t.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;Paperlike&#x2F;comments&#x2F;au0yuc&#x2F;dasung_on_linux&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;Paperlike&#x2F;comments&#x2F;au0yuc&#x2F;dasung_on...</a><p>Without the software installed, you have to manually hit the &#x27;refresh&#x27; button.  This is done to clear up errant pixels aka a screen flash.  Yet the refresh process was slow, so to test, rather than let their questionable software do it, I hit the manual button on the monitor.<p>The flash on&#x2F;off was highly annoying, and I couldn&#x27;t imagine reading text, coding, working this way once the software was installed.<p>Customer service from dasung was non-existent.  I had to return it.<p>I so much want an e-ink display.')
