The pin is dropped in a fine place, at the building by the Lake Elizabeth boat ramp.<p>I mostly know where I&#x27;m going anyway, and as I come up Washington Blvd I notice it&#x27;s asking me to turn early, so I follow just for kicks. Inexplicably, gmaps directs me to an area about a mile to the south of my destination, at the end of the Railroad Ave trail (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;goo.gl&#x2F;maps&#x2F;G5xV7MDemtbtmNYRA" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;goo.gl&#x2F;maps&#x2F;G5xV7MDemtbtmNYRA</a>). It then appears to suggest that I park and walk the trail for a mile to get to my destination. In the middle of downtown Fremont! When using driving directions!<p>The weirdest part is that gmaps clearly knows that it&#x27;s taken me to the wrong place. There&#x27;s a dotted line instructing me to walk a mile along a footpath. But then, why not just take me to the actual destination address in my car, which has a huge parking lot? I can&#x27;t wrap my head around what&#x27;s going wrong in this scenario.<p>This wasn&#x27;t a fluke. I reliably get told that this is the best way to the park. If gmaps can be this wildly wrong in the middle of Fremont CA then I can only imagine how bad it gets in rural areas.')
