It&#x27;s part of the justification for the 1st Amendment.<p>We have new technologies which are being leveraged to intentionally misinform people, in a society that has degraded public education and raised the cost of higher education to levels prohibitive for the majority of the population, and as a result, the society (as a whole) is no longer sufficiently informed.<p>So, how can democracy function if the citizens are not educated?
