I even did some WTFPL in the past.<p>I like free software and open source because of <i>freedom</i>. Restrictive licenses are the opposite of that.<p>It is perfectly fine to me if a company decides to not release a change. They probably have good reasons to do that. And if they don&#x27;t, then it is just a dumb decision that will end up costing them more anyway.')
