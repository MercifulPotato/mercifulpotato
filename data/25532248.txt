It&#x27;s pattern recognition. Techniques for achieving fair and equitable AI are frequently quite similar to &quot;playing god&quot; and do come dangerously close to implementing &quot;rejecting your reality and substituting my own&quot; into the data through sophisticated techniques for social justice reasons. This can elevate the impact of an AI developers actions far above what they may have expected.<p>For instance, I am shocked that the right wing media has not reported more about the &quot;censorship&quot; inherent to some kinds of word vector debiasing techniques proposed in papers after the famous &quot;man is to computer programmer as woman is to homemaker?&quot; paper within NLP. Usually the undesirable associations (programmer is &quot;male&quot; and homemaker is &quot;female&quot;) are due to a representation gap either inherit to reality (far fewer female programmers) or due to failure to properly write about and represent female programmers in corpra (Wikipedia editors should write more articles about female programmers).<p>One of the techniques proposed to prevent this bias is to simply find the specific rows in your dataset that maximizes the undesirable association and remove these rows. In practice, most of these &quot;undesirable&quot; rows (let&#x27;s say a row is a wikipedia article) will have <i>no inherit bias what-so-ever</i>, and only get their poor scores because the article is about someone where the editors&#x2F;authors wrote a lot about their relationship with their dad (using male words) before talking about their programming career. It leaves me with a bad taste in my mouth to remove <i>not-sexist</i> articles to mitigate or remove <i>sexist associations</i>.<p>Maybe the OP could have critiqued this kind of work rather than their original post and it may have been more constructive...')
