Fir example he shows that some forms of induction are not possible in consistent formal logical systems. Well fine, so build an AI that isn’t a formal logical system. We can build computer programs that meet this criterion right now quite trivially.<p>It’s difficult to go up against someone like Penrose as he’s evidently a genuine genius, I’ve huge respect for the guy, but nobody on Earth knows how to build a strong general AI. That means nobody really knows the details and trade offs of its function, genius or not. So really it comes down to whether you’re a materialist or a dualist, whether you think Intelligence and&#x2F;or consciousness are physical processes or not. Even if quantum mechanics is a necessary element, it’s still a physical process and quantum computers are a real thing.')
