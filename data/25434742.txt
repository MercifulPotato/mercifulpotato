Once you have a 100k+ salary and potential for more in the future in the USA, it&#x27;s not in your interest to support social unrest or anything that upsets the status quo. I imagine this does subside a bit once you get real security in your life ( some significant property, savings, strong network, etc ) but there is a large gap between being secure enough to be comfortable in your own life and being comfortable enough that your own interests are secondary.<p>This _definitely_ does not apply to all people and all situations, but I think it is an effect, it&#x27;s typically framed as &quot;as you get older you get more right-wing&quot; but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s anything related to age particularly and more to do with where you are on the ladder.')
