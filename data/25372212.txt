Item(by='CaptainZapp', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607596839, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25371966, text='&gt; Usually its preagreed to pool all the tips into one pot for the shift and then divided amongst the employees<p>That, probably, is restaurant specific. Some places pool the tips and the kitchen staff is also part of the pot in other places the server gets to keep the tips.<p>The American model of tipping (like 20% essentially mandatory) really annoys me. I say that as a person who usually tips quite generously, but it&#x27;s really not my business as a paying patron to be responsible for the staff salaries.<p>Raise the damn prices already and let a tip really be a tip.')
