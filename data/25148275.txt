Item(by='yannovitch', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605783798, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25146808, text='Seeing where the industry is going, I&#x27;m thinking more and more of having &quot;one computer per purpose&quot; rather than trying to have &quot;one computer to rule them all&quot; (and in the darkness bind them, ahem, sorry, I digress ^^).<p>To explain a bit more, I do writing, development, photo editing, video editing, music production.\nNowadays, my sole computer (besides multiple Raspberry Pi) is a gaming laptop running Windows. It can handle all of these tasks.<p>Before that, I had a 2012 MBP, but when I wanted to upgrade to an other mac with 32GB RAM, a good graphic card and Thunderbolt 3 in the end of 2015&#x2F;beginning of 2016, the option of that much RAM and a good video card just wasn&#x27;t there at the time, and so I switched to the Windows world again.<p>I&#x27;ve been able to upgrade the gaming computer over the years to 32 GB RAM, I now have 3 (!) SSD in the computer, and it runs what I want quickly enough (except for Lightroom, but that&#x27;s an other story ;)).<p>But for development, the feeling just isn&#x27;t there, even with WSL&#x2F;WSL2, it&#x27;s just not as straightforward as macOS with homebrew or macports, not to talk about Debian or Archlinux which are even better, so for me, it always feel like &quot;death by a thousand cut&quot; to develop on Windows platform.<p>For video, ProresRAW is only available on Apple, and I want to futureproof my future cameras in that aspect too. Or maybe I could go the BlackmagicRAW path to be able to do it in the Windows or Linux world, or converting to Prores4444, but ProresRAW and BlackmagicRAW don&#x27;t seem to like each others, and in video, I don&#x27;t want to spend my time fighting the computers and the codecs. So I&#x27;ll probably have to switch to Mac in the long run for that.<p>For the sound part, in my point of view, there is still nothing coming close to Mac with CoreAudio, even if Linux is good (with Jack &amp; cie), macOS is miles ahead when it comes for example to plugin or DAW support. And in Windows, it&#x27;s still not as good as mac for Audio, at least in my perspective.<p>For the photography part, Darktable is getting good and faster than Lightroom, but still not as efficient in workflow than Lightroom or Capture One. Buuut it&#x27;s getting close.<p>So I think more and more of buying one laptop just for Linux &amp; development (or even stripping a Chromebook of Chrome OS and installing Linux on it ?).  \nUse my iPad for writing, because it&#x27;s the most enjoyable &quot;sit on a couch and write&quot; experience.\nAnd maybe buy a M1 (or M2) Mac for Audio, Video, Photo.<p>There still remain the question of buying a beefy workstation with for example 128GB RAM and beefy graphic card and 10GBe and RAID, to handle the big audio&#x2F;video&#x2F;photo project. I wanted to go the Hackintosh route, but now with ARM, I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a futureproof purchase...')
