I&#x27;ve searched for an exact string, which matched nothing, but google returned a list of partial matches.  I didn&#x27;t realize they were partial matches, and wasted a few minutes trying to find what I was looking for in those messages, only to realize, it wasn&#x27;t there.  And I couldn&#x27;t find a way to get gmail to just show that nothing matched what I was looking for.')
