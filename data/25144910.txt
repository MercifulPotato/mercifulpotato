Now I understand what geometric algebra refers to.<p>When people talk about it, it always sounds like a simple generalization of exterior algebra.  And so it is.  You allow a formal sum of a 0-form, a 1-form, and so on up to an n-form; instead of x∧x being zero, it&#x27;s |x|².  I assume the textbooks show how to do all this in a basis-independent manner.<p>Can you do the same thing with chains, and come up with an even-more-generalised Stokes theorem?<p>There are two things I don&#x27;t get.<p>Why start calling things 2-vectors, when you could call them 2-forms and people would know what you were talking about?<p>Also, when discussing 3D rotations, the article decomposes a vector u as the sum of two vectors a + b, where a·i = b∧i = 0, and i is a 2-vector.  I&#x27;m fine with b∧a, and I know that there is an inner product for forms of the same degree, though I&#x27;d have to look up how it works.  But how do you take the inner product a·i of a vector and a 2-form?  I&#x27;d guess this is an abuse of notation whose meaning is obvious if you&#x27;re used to it.')
