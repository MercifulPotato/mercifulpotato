We got a lot of side-eye for that but the numbers were pretty stunning. For our app, the cost of running that data center was about $120K&#x2F;month, on Amazon (or IBM&#x27;s cloud) that cost was at least $1.2M&#x2F;month so 10x higher. What was even more of a pain that getting all the machines in the same racks so that they didn&#x27;t share &quot;east west&quot; bandwidth with other racks in the data center was a huge ask for these folks, the proposed solution of over provisioning, made it just that much more expensive.')
