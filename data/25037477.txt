We&#x27;ve created a new language, called Clarity, for smart contract development on our platform. It&#x27;s lisp-based and is _not_ Turing complete. We believe that decidability is quite important for smart contracts. Algorand has joined our efforts, and they will support Clarity on their blockchain.<p>I am not involved with the development of Clarity, but I really enjoy writing smart contracts with it!<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;clarity-lang.org" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;clarity-lang.org</a><p>Web-based REPL: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;clarity.tools&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;clarity.tools&#x2F;</a>')
