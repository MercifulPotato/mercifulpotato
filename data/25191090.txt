If the company needed armed staff, they could simply hire full-time armed guards.  There is no reason head of security at Apple needs to be armed using a concealed weapon.  They are not going undercover to bust smugglers or whatever.<p>On the other hand, the payment was to the Sherriff&#x27;s office, not the sheriff himself.  That makes it a lot less like bribery to me because it still benefits the government.<p>What makes it especially tricky is that it seems as though the Sherriff asked for the payment.  If they did and provided official written documentation to Apple, that feels like a professional and real agreement to provide hardware to the government.<p>At the end of the day, what will make this bad for Apple&#x27;s head of security is that he was personally benefiting from the Sherriff&#x27;s actions by receiving favorable treatment for a CCW he didn&#x27;t need, and used company hardware to get that favorable treatment.')
