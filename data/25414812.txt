I know there is one in Eclipse. I&#x27;m working on some legacy code where they implemented everything in this fashion (even though 99% interfaces have only single implementation and never will have anything else). This shortcut makes the work manageable.<p>I don&#x27;t remember how it is done exactly (it&#x27;s in my muscle memory), but I think ctrl and hover over shows up a mini dropdown where you can click on what you want to navigate to.')
