With your hands on home row, the distances to the modifier keys are different for left&#x2F;right; but even the distances to the inner columns of keys aren&#x27;t symmetric. That asymmetry makes it uncomfortable to use the right-hand modifier keys; and more awkward to type, in general.<p>It&#x27;s fairly hard to accurately touch-type the number-row with a standard row-staggered keyboard; but this is more accessible with an ortholinear keyboard.<p>Moreover, ortholinear keyboards (because they&#x27;re so niche) tend to have firmware customisation, which allows for some improvements. (e.g. allowing different keyboard &#x27;layers&#x27;).')
