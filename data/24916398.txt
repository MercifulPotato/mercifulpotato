Links are one way, things don&#x27;t flow based on concept but based on this clunky chunk called a page. We still only have one functional semantic for cross linking the clunky chunks called the hyperlink.<p>The only way we have to find things are to use companies that have managed to visit and index all the sites, not through some search and index interface but by processing the page that the human sees and then trying to rank them making the web ultimately heavily centralized.<p>Then there is the authorship meta layer that doesn&#x27;t exist to interleave content from the same author, say by email or some other identifier. Instead we&#x27;ve centralized that into temporal structures that vanish when you look back, like in a dream in a &quot;let 1000 flowers bloom&quot; method where all you ever end up with are just a bunch of silly flowers.<p>Then there is the permanence feature where the internet is like a river that&#x27;s always moving. Someone else has to rely on generosity to yet again, centralize the historicals so hopefully things can exist at least as long as bad ink on terrible paper. Otherwise a couple generations of thought will be in metal garbage heaps<p>I could have written all this, word for word in 1993 but instead it&#x27;s 2020,<p>Honestly, I&#x27;d say solutions to 70% of the fundamental problems are still unsolved nearly 30 years later.')
