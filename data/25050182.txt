Probably more faster than both i9 MacBook Pro 16 and iMac Pros, and GREAT battery life!\n* Finally better camera and wifi 6\n* same price<p>Cons:\n* Wont not run all apps in full speed for now (temporary)\n* Memory expansion is expensive and limited to 16GB (temporary)<p>Most limitations are temporary, I think these are amazing products unless you want more than 16GB memory.')
