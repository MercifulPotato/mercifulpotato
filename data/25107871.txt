It was a bad look for privacy-conscious Apple especially considering that basic OCSP queries are unencrypted HTTP requests.<p>In my post (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.cryptohack.org&#x2F;macos-ocsp-disaster" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.cryptohack.org&#x2F;macos-ocsp-disaster</a>) I argued that OCSP was inherently a poor way to perform certificate revocation in this scenario, and that an approach based on Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) could be preferable. Regardless, it looks like Apple might be doubling down on OCSP but encrypting the requests, or possibly adding a new protocol altogether.')
