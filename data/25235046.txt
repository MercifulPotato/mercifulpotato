It&#x27;s of wildly varying strength (and price) these days apparently. My first couple friends dying are what led to me getting clean around nine years ago.<p>The vast majority of them (if not all) also took oxy before&#x2F;during their stints with IV heroin. This is obviously anecdotal but that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve seen!<p>Edit to clarify: \nGenerally it&#x27;s been accidental as far as I can tell, there have been two instances where it might&#x27;ve been suicide. Generally one way to think about the heroin problem would be: \nImagine wine (which is normally 14% abv and costs let&#x27;s say, $20) but sometimes it&#x27;s 100% abv and costs $20, or 5% abv and costs $30, or 7% abv and $100, or 75% abv and $0.99 and you can&#x27;t tell until you buy it and try it.')
