Many people assume chinese characters are somehow &quot;static&quot; and that the modern traditional characters are not aggregately mapped from older characters. Your last point is also very important as the top questions I&#x27;ve come across language learning forums is traditional vs simplified. This seemingly trivial issue to people fluent in Chinese often get exaggerated and politicized to the detriment of Chinese learners. The best analogy I can think of between traditional vs simplified is akin to American English vs British English, except English learners don&#x27;t make a big fuss about which version they should learn first.')
