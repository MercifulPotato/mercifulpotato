You can then read the FULL source code in a few hours, to see if you trust it or not. \nSee here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;josephernest&#x2F;nfreezer&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;nfreezer.py" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;josephernest&#x2F;nfreezer&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;nfreeze...</a><p>If I want to do this with the source code of the tool you mentioned, I would have to spend at least one full week. (this is normal: this program has 100 times more features).<p>The key point is: if you&#x27;re looking for a solution for which you don&#x27;t want to trust a remote server, then you probably <i>don&#x27;t want to trust</i> the backup tool of a random internet person either. And you probably want to read the source code of the program.<p>So having only &lt; 300 lines of code to read in a single .py can be an advantage.')
