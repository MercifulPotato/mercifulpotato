Do you have a citation for that?<p>I did not say anything about &quot;could not ever&quot;. I guess you could maybe interpret it this way, but if you actually followed the citation I gave, it would have been clear to you. What I meant was that the section 205b of Immigration Act of 1990, which is the legal basis of &quot;dual intent&quot; policy, explicitly amends section 214b of INA, to remove permanent residency application as acceptable evidence for the purpose of establishing immigration intent <i>in context of section 214b</i>.')
