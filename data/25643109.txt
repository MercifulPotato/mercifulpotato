And, even then, it took quite a while to figure out that it was a virus.<p>In the middle of flu season, COVID probably wouldn&#x27;t flag until your hospitals suddenly fill up for no reason.  And even then most people would just write it off as a nasty flu.  Otherwise, COVID is just a fairly invisible bump in your mortality rates for people with comorbidities and age.  Do you really think China is gonna look too hard into a few extra old and&#x2F;or sick people dying for some reason?<p>Given that a full hospital is likely to be the first point where someone will start looking for cause, that really has no relation to origin point.<p>And, I would argue, China is worse than that.  A local party leader in China will absolutely not bump something like COVID up the chain until absolutely forced to.  It is quite possible that there <i>were</i> other flare ups that were covered up and the Wuhan one was simply large enough to be uncontainable, close enough to a virology lab to get flagged, and occurred right before Chinese New Year which <i>forced</i> a government response.')
