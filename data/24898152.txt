Without autossh, the ssh tunnel sometimes randomly closed. I tried configuring ServerAliveInterval to some low value but the issue still happen sometimes, and when it happened sometimes the port it binds on the vps can&#x27;t be reused anymore (port in use error). Autossh fixed all of those issues.')
