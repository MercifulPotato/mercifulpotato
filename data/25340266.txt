The state grossly mistreats it&#x27;s most productive citizens, when its those very citizens that fund the greatest chunk of the state&#x27;s largesse. Hopefully enough major taxpayers will leave that it creates a fiscal crisis that can only be solved by increasing taxes further, driving more productive citizens out and sending the state government in a death spiral.<p>You&#x27;d be bitter too if you paid several hundred thousand in state taxes in 2019 to a state whose politicians probably at least halved your net worth by using your company as their whipping boy for years just to make themselves look good.')
