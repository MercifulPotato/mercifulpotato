Although many people write these programs in more user-friendly languages like Python and R, most of these programs call through to C++ frameworks (which many people use directly too), so in a way C++ has latched itself to the growth of such languages. Furthermore many major accelerated computing platforms (frameworks?) such as CUDA, Intel&#x27;s oneAPI and Khronos&#x27; SYCL are focused on and committed to the C++ language and ecosystem and I don&#x27;t really see much competition in this space for the time being.')
