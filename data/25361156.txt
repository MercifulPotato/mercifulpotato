Have fun finding a 10px strip that won&#x27;t turn into an edit workflow when clicked!<p>&gt; Click your mouse on a non-interactive UI component and press “.”<p>Even using the keybindings (seriously everyone, hit &quot;?&quot; and look through them) events are lost.  Want to create a subtask?  It&#x27;s not `.sub&lt;enter&gt;`, it&#x27;s actually `.sub^H^Hsub^H^H^Hsub&lt;enter&gt;&lt;wait&gt;&lt;tab&gt;&lt;tab&gt;&lt;give up and use mouse to focus a field, because it arbitrarily unfocuses fields&gt;Title Of My Task&lt;use mouse to find the submit button&gt;`<p>They&#x27;ve done so much work to make it a quick UX but it&#x27;s all for nothing when it randomly eats keystrokes and defocuses constantly.  Maybe some of our add-ons are at fault, I&#x27;m interested in hearing if there are jira installs that aren&#x27;t like mine.')
