Good we have that stated clearly.<p>Big Guys, solution is simple: just delete or anonymize those data, so it is not possible to surveil people, you will not have to fight legal battles and NSO will not try to break into your database.<p>In addition you will avoid temptation to surveil people by yourself!<p>And you will not need to hand over these data to parties that are able to force you do this. Be that Chinese government or FBI or some other 3 letter agency.')
