I let my heart rate get below 130 between weight sets, and like to check my peak after a set as well.  Also, it likes to alert me when I&#x27;m having one of my infrequent panic attacks. You&#x27;d think I&#x27;d notice anyway, but, not always<p>- unlocks my computer when I&#x27;m wearing it. This is a tiny affordance but really a nice one<p>- pay for groceries without bringing my phone or wallet out. Do I have to? No. Do I like to? Yeah, I&#x27;ll cop to that. It&#x27;s nice<p>- take the occasional call when my phone is in another room or I don&#x27;t want to dig it out. Works long enough to say &quot;hey I&#x27;ll call you back&quot;, which is usually about all I want to say<p>- remind me what the date is, because I&#x27;m terrible at that. Granted that my automatic watches would do that too<p>- when I&#x27;m feeling nostalgic, load up a watch face that shows me pictures of times when I was happy, and people I love<p>- pause and play music&#x2F;podcasts&#x2F;whatever<p>I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m missing a few, but I&#x27;ll also say this: it&#x27;s way less fashionable than my automatics. It&#x27;s actually kinda dorky when you get right down to it.<p>But it&#x27;s so much more functional that I just don&#x27;t care, I&#x27;ve made my peace with it.<p>Someday, I&#x27;ll get to leave the house again and do fancy things, and I have a couple timepieces for those occasions. But in the meantime, and the rest of the time, it&#x27;s a smartwatch for me.')
