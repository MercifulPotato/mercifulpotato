I don&#x27;t think people should arbitrarily decide when other people should have the conversation. What if some people think it&#x27;s never the right time? Should we never talk about it?<p>How about this, people should be allowed to have conversations about anything at the time of their choosing? Do we really need a moral police to tell us when we can communicate with each other? Nobody should force you to participate in a conversation and certainly you shouldn&#x27;t prevent others from participating in a conversation.')
