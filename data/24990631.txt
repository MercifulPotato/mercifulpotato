Almost every website I load renders in less than 100ms. Every single page. If it doesnt render, than it&#x27;s a javascript issue and I <i>may</i> open it in firefox if I really care.<p>So, by using links2, for almost all websites, I get instant loading, with no possible way for the browser to popup anything, distract me anyhow, just the data thankyouverymuch, get out of my way.')
