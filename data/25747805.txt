I ended up designing my own Prolog virtual machine rather than mimicking the WAM, using a union-find address space to represent unified terms, with hopes to make it a persistent data structure and so implement backtracking over unification by cheap checkpointing. I never got around to it, but it left me with a fascination with Prolog internals.')
