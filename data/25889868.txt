And of course China, Russia I imagine, most of the Middle East, Africa, the rest of Asia, and South America. So the vast majority of the world&#x27;s population. And if people can&#x27;t speak anonymously or pseudonymously, it&#x27;s going to have a huge chilling effect on free expression online. By the way, look around the world to see just how much the definition of &quot;really extremist stuff&quot; can vary.<p>I didn&#x27;t suggest that moving to a platform outside of the Big Tech hegemony was necessarily <i>easy</i>, but I did suggest that it was <i>possible</i>. We&#x27;re in the early days of the consumer revolt against Facebook&#x2F;Youtube, but if people are suitably motivated to move to other platforms, those other platforms will grow and develop. And it&#x27;s a whole lot easier to move to a different tech platform than it is to move to a different country, or to change the law when you&#x27;re in a political minority.<p>Governments can really only properly surveil people who are taking active measures to conceal their activities in relatively small numbers. They can get a certain amount of information and metadata about the majority of the population who use popular platforms and services, but there has been a tendency in recent years to encrypt everything and then to collaborate with the security services of particular countries.<p>&gt; The liberty you are talikng about was already lost to corporates, the survalience state is alrwady here. you have no ability to escape phone providers selling your date and no knowledge of them doing it.<p>If I&#x27;m concerned about Alexa hearing my private conversations, I can unplug her. I get to decide whether the potential risk to my privacy is worth the benefits of using particular products and services. I can ask my friends not to livestream me on Facebook when they walk into my house. There&#x27;s loads of popular technology that I&#x27;m perfectly free not to use, or to seek out alternatives. The fact that so many people choose the easiest, shiniest option is their decision, and their problem, and  you don&#x27;t get to make that my problem. It&#x27;s both untrue and it&#x27;s also a complete non-sequitur to say that we&#x27;re already living voluntarily in a corporate surveillance state and then to say that we might as well therefore  make it into a government-controlled surveillance state, and to replace terms and conditions with laws, and account cancellations and bans with criminal penalties.<p>&gt; At least governments can be held accountable at the voting booth<p>In practice, this only tends to happen in countries where people are relatively free to do things on the Internet without the government tracking and controlling their activity. There&#x27;s a causal link here.<p>&gt; a monopolistic company can&#x27;t.<p>Facebook will only continue to be the pre-eminent social network as long as vast numbers of people choose to continue to use it. You, personally, can hold it to account by not using it any more, but you have no right to stop other people from using it if they want to.<p>&gt; There was a really good quote adressing monopolies: &quot;If we will not accept kings and tyrants over over lives, then we shall not accept a king over necceseties of life&quot;<p>To suggest that Facebook is a necessity of life really highlights what a position of privilege we&#x27;re in. Perhaps people who are trying to advance that kind of argumentation need to have a good, hard look at what the &quot;needs&quot; and the &quot;wants&quot; really are in their life. I&#x27;d also recommend that you read some of the Austrian economists to find out what a real monopoly would actually look like, and why it is that you&#x27;re unlikely to encounter one.')
