Your &quot;team play&quot; ability only matters to the extent that you engage in peer-to-peer relationships, which can be relatively minimal in that position compared to, say, middle management. See, for instance, Steve Jobs. I&#x27;ve never heard him described as a &quot;team player&quot;, exactly.<p>In the end, I&#x27;d say both types are important. Obviously we need team players, but sometimes you need an auteur or benevolent dictator. Measuring success for these different types should account for their respective strengths.')
