One of my favorite group chats is in Signal. My mom is using Signal, I just sent her a message I might need to leave WhatsApp, so she immediately installed Signal all by herself. Now we have video chats that have been working really well.<p>I mean, this is the first time the mobile app gives trouble. I&#x27;d wish the desktop app would be better, like it&#x27;s been the biggest problem between me and Signal. Otherwise it&#x27;s an amazing tool and I&#x27;m happy to donate for it to be even better.')
