The whole idea of refactoring is to make code less repetitive or modular without changing functionality. Common patterns include replacing copy&#x2F;paste code with common functions, replacing complex inline conditions and if&#x2F;else cascades with helper functions returning bools&#x2F;enums, etc. A true refactor is provably neutral wrt functionality, often so by simple inspection. If you&#x27;re changing functionality that&#x27;s a rewrite, and it&#x27;s not making the code better because the original code no longer exists.')
