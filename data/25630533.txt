But a small reminder that conspiracy theory doesn&#x27;t tell you anything about the truthfulness, e.g. that the Iraq War was based on made-up evidence was a conspiracy theory.<p>That being said: Your explanation makes more sense to me. It is often enough to anger the wrong person to get a bad treatment (well, even assassination). And looking at history this is exponentiated in dictatorships, where power is concentrated on few ppl, who can act with impunity.')
