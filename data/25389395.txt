It&#x27;s easy to discount since people are happy to have made money, but I&#x27;m not sure this was a stunning IPO considering that. If I was on the company side, I&#x27;d be pissed at the initial pricing and the money that was left on the table.<p>The counter narrative is that pricing is hard and the banks try to do the best they can (with a slight preference for under pricing to benefit themselves). This is probably closer to the truth, but there&#x27;s a lot of evidence that they&#x27;re just not good at it.<p>It&#x27;d be interesting to see some clause that if the banks mis-priced by some X% the partners would have to sell and give 50% back to the company. Though I suspect even this wouldn&#x27;t help because market price is hard to predict even if you&#x27;re incentivized to try your best.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;podcasts.apple.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;podcast&#x2F;bill-gurley-direct-listing-vs-ipo-invest-like-the-best-ep-144&#x2F;id1154105909?i=1000451016956" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;podcasts.apple.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;podcast&#x2F;bill-gurley-direct-lis...</a>')
