I don&#x27;t need a desktop (I&#x27;m not doing any ML that would require a GPU), and I <i>want</i> to go back to Mac (OSX is <i>way</i> better than Windows, easier to install software, more intuitive, JustWorks(TM), etc.) but there&#x27;s simply no equivalent offering. I can&#x27;t use an iPad for development (it&#x27;s not actually a computer), so the only alternative is a MacBook (Air &#x2F; Pro), which is however <i>way</i> less portable than a tablet.<p>The addressable market is tiny though so I don&#x27;t expect this to change anytime soon.')
