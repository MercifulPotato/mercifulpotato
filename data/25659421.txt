The Gen Y&#x2F;Z TikTok crowd are the cool ones now<p>The funny thing about that, much like when we were that age, those platforms and things the young folks think are cool were made by people who are the age of millenials or older for the most part.<p>I dunno, when I was younger a lot of the music and stuff I thought was cool was being made by people who were around the same age I am now.<p>Not too sure what my point is really, your comment just made me think of this. People around that age start lamenting their lack of cool, but are responsible for many of the things people younger than them find cool...something like that I suppose.')
