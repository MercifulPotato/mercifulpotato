You did not have that luxury if you were, say, gay prior to the early oughts.<p>I think you&#x27;re looking at the past through rose-tinted glasses. It was less &#x27;live and let live&#x27; and more &#x27;sit down and shut up if you are different&#x27;.<p>Now those people have a voice, and a lot of folks are finding it quite upsetting.')
