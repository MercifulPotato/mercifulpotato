It is ignored because it undermines this pitch.<p>That market is fragmented and disorganised and inefficient. But it’s deep, cross border and growing. Issuers write their own transfer policies which range from nope to fully permissive. The former aren’t interested in something like this because they aren’t focussed on shareholder liquidity.
