It is ignored because it undermines the pitch.<p>That market is fragmented and disorganised and inefficient. But it’s deep. And it’s growing. Issuers write their own transfer policies which range from “nope” to fully permissive. The former aren’t be interested in something like this because they aren’t interested in shareholder liquidity. The latter don’t gain anything by forcing shareholders to only do business through Carta. (If they <i>do</i> want to do all that work, they can just do a tender. It is cheaper. And has no lock-in.)<p>This is a product in search of a problem.<p><i>Disclaimer: I work in the private markets.</i>')
