Adding ~6cm to the round-trip path would add about 0.3ns to DRAM latency, which is already over 30ns. So we&#x27;re looking at less than 1% difference between on-package vs on the motherboard. This is a much less important concern than signal integrity and drive strength necessary to maintain bandwidth when moving DRAM further from the CPU.<p>Your argument would be much closer to relevant if we were discussing SRAM caches.')
