The unreliability hurt more than the money.  There&#x27;s something pure about using a capitalistic API (e.g. AWS, Stripe, Twilio) where you know they&#x27;re making a good buck off your usage, whereas with Google it felt like a side business that they&#x27;d change on a whim.<p>I feel similarly about brokerage accounts that are upfront about charging a transaction fee or checking accounts that have a clear minimum or fee.  When it&#x27;s &quot;free&quot;, I&#x27;m always scared that I&#x27;ll end up paying another way and what I&#x27;m relying on will get washed away.')
