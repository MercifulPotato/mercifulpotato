It was in getting people to discover&#x2F;communicate via these abstractions of channels rather than point to point. This provides a lot of value in a company when you don’t know the specific person to talk to or want to talk to a group rather than one person.<p>EDIT: It also allows bystanders to learn from or keep abreast of the conversation.<p>However, this cultural practice can be easily transferred to another tool.<p>As an external observer, Slack seemed to have various issues that prevented it from innovating further.<p>One was lack of vision of how to innovate further. I think this often happens when someone stumbles onto an idea. They don’t have deep reasoning or conviction of where to go further.<p>Another issue is that they seemed to have other cultural preoccupations for a time. Look at the cultural discussions brewing when their growth was exploding. They have since stepped back from that but I think it slowed them down.<p>I don’t think these helped when you have a competitor that can integrate their entire suite of products into their chat system while effectively selling the chat for free. Slack didn’t even integrate as well or as quickly.<p>Slack wasn’t innovating enough to not be overtaken.')
