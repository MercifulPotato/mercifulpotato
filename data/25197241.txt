On an empty battery, they emitted three to eight times more than official values. When driven in battery-charging mode, which could become more common as motorists charge up ahead of using electric mode in low-emissions zones, the PHEVs emitted three to 12 times more.&quot;<p>1) when empty, they emit more CO2 than their average assumed values.  this is obvious.  its just using gas, no battery.<p>2) when using the gas engine to charge the battery (i.e. instead of just generate enough electricity to move the car as desired), of course it is the worst performing.  you&#x27;re running the generator at full blast.<p>I had a Chevy Volt in palo alto where I was able to charge every night.  I used it for commuting around (including a regular weekend trip to SF and other trips as far north as berkeley).  As I was able to charge regularly (either 220v or 110v), I filled up the gas tank once a year (and that&#x27;s because the car forces you to not have gas over a year old on average).  Now, I don&#x27;t have the ability to calculate how much CO2 was produced because of my charging times, but in terms of actual CO2 produced by the car, I&#x27;d put my experience over any other traditional ICE car.<p>Similarly, drove the car cross country.  While I wasn&#x27;t able to charge regularly, the electric motor handled the ups and downs of the terrain much better than all the other ICE cars I passed with ease.')
