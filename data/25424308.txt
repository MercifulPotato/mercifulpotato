Since WFH started I don&#x27;t pretend to be working anymore when I&#x27;m actually not.<p>Before (at the office): arrive at 9am, leave at 17pm. Work (productively) for around 4h. 1h or so for lunch and multiple breaks. 1h or so of socializing. 2h or so wasted doing... what? I don&#x27;t even remember.<p>Now (WFH): start at 11am, finish at around 16pm. 30min&#x2F;1h break. I work the same amount of time as before Corona (in terms of productive hours), but I don&#x27;t waste time anymore.<p>Deliverables are still the same, we still manage (as before) to push our products further.')
