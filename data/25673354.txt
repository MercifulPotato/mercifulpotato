I&#x27;m not American and even I know that Portland has been the site of continuous nightly riots for months now. It stopped being reported a long time ago but it&#x27;s still happening. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;MrAndyNgo" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;MrAndyNgo</a> posts pictures and videos of it every single day all summer and winter. They smash up and burn buildings all the time, and that includes repeated attacks on federal courthouses.<p>Ngo claims the group are called antifa and the rioters all seem to be white, but they <i>claim</i> to be BLM and to be fighting against racism so I guess it&#x27;s reasonable to call them BLM riots.<p>I mean, which kind of rioting is worse is absolutely a reasonable discussion to have, but writing off the last six months of nightly rioting in Portland as &quot;right wing hyperbole&quot; when there are endless pictures, videos, mugshots, etc ... well that just seems like the kind of bubble isolation that is being decried up thread.')
