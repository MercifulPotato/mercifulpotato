We are doing things, and we are affecting the road toll. A quick look at Australia shows that from the worst years, 1970s, where ~3,500 died a year, we’re now down to ~1,200. That’s a 3x reduction <i>because we did something</i>. (Airbags, improved car design, improved road design, improved compliance, etc.)<p>If only we had some sort of analogue for doing something vs. not doing something re: COVID. Oh wait, we do.<p>- Number of Australians dead: 908.<p>- Population adjusted, 13.1x: 12,000.<p>- Number of Americans dead: 298,000.<p>That’s 25x as many. We did something, America didn’t.<p>Spotting a pattern?')
