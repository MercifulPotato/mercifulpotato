These days, they&#x27;re all pretty good. Spotify, pandora, google music, and now youtube music will do a good job of giving you recommendations based strictly on what you&#x27;ve been cue-ing up.<p>But the recommendations from these services are the equivalent of going into a record store and getting advice from a dim-witted and disinterested employee. You&#x27;ll get all the obvious stuff, maybe things you forgot about, and if you happen to like popular stuff the recommendations will work OK. But you won&#x27;t get challenging, provocative recommendations that expand your taste. You&#x27;ll get cloying recommendations that try to cater to your taste like it was a static attribute. Oh, yeah, and there&#x27;s &quot;the surveillance capitalism thing&quot; which happens to be the centerpiece of all these services. Is that a problem? Yes.<p>The best &quot;discovery algorithm&quot; is still HUMAN BEINGS.<p>If your cool friends aren&#x27;t available, then the next best thing is a mag like pitchfork (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pitchfork.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pitchfork.com&#x2F;</a>), xlr8r (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xlr8r.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xlr8r.com&#x2F;</a>) or in-depth reviews like Anthony Fantano&#x27;s channel (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;user&#x2F;theneedledrop" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;user&#x2F;theneedledrop</a>).')
