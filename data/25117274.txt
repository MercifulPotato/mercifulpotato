The big problem is that people are bad at reviewing restaurants.  Everyone has different assumptions and standards, so the rating is generally meaningless.  I see things like &quot;1 Star.  Server gave me a dirty look after I didn&#x27;t tip them, because I don&#x27;t believe in tipping.&quot;  In cases like that, the problem is you, not the restaurant!  For things as subjective as whether or not the food was worth the price, you have to provide supporting evidence (&quot;show, don&#x27;t tell&quot;), and while professional reviewers do this, amateur reviewers never do.  There is no way to use the data to make a good decision, and it seems even less possible to use the data to decide &quot;which restaurant should I go to right now&quot;.<p>To some extent, all reviews are like this.  I cringe when tech reviewers measure WiFi routers and tell me about throughput (that comes at the cost of latency), or Amazon reviewers bought the completely wrong product and obviously didn&#x27;t like it.<p>I hate to say it, but I don&#x27;t think reviews are &quot;a thing&quot;.  They make people feel good and probably drive more sales (&quot;it had 5 stars, so I bought it&quot;), but I don&#x27;t feel like reviews have ever saved me time.  I wish I could stop seeing them.  (Maybe I should write a Chrome extension to remove them.)')
