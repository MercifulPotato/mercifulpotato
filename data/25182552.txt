Morgan being inherently political doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s a net positive for them to start to take public stances on cultural issues, and it only serves to conceal their real political impact.<p>I think there&#x27;s a strong argument to be made that –– even given your premise of all startups being inherently political –– we&#x27;re better off for them focusing on their tangible contribution to the world and not obscuring it with politics-as-PR.<p>And if their &quot;contribution&quot; has a primarily negative impact, political or otherwise, it&#x27;s arguably even worse to be a culture in which they can reach for cover under cultural politics unrelated to their bottom line.')
