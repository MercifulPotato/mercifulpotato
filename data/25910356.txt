It&#x27;s true that the PA case is the only one where Giuliani was stupid enough to repeatedly invoke fraud in arguments despite it not being in the allegations or evidence in that case, thereby getting questioned by the judge on that point, and thus being forced to admit his arguments on those points weren&#x27;t germane to the actual lawsuit he was discussing (similar, though different in detail problems were endemic to the Trump&#x2F;Kraken lawsuits, like broad claims of counting irregularities in lawsuits in one state being supported by detailed allegations specifying specific facilities in another state.)<p>&gt; And part of this is a problem specifically because they never really got to have a trial and do discovery and all of that.<p>False. A number of the election cases went to trial (6 out of 54 tracked on Wikipedia reached a final verdict after trial, and 1 is listed as trial ongoing, though that may be out of date).<p>&gt; But if the cases get dismissed on procedure then you have one side saying &quot;all your cases were dismissed so shut up&quot; and the other side saying they never actually got their day in court and nothing to ever reconcile them because both statements are true.<p>Well, procedure matters. Especially when you deliberately delay claims you believed you had simply to prevent the availability of simple remedies. If you have a problem with cases dismissed for gross procedural failings, take it up with the people who bungled the procedure <i>in dozens of separate cases</i>.')
