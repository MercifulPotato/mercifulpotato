At least, that&#x27;s typically part of CPU design courses. This is  the game that has allowed Apple to make a major leap in a short amount of iterations, and other CPU designers should become better at it. We can discuss all kinds of optimizations, but before we throw them in a model there&#x27;s little we can say about their effectiveness, while the model is a very cheap way to learn more.')
