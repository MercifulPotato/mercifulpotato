Restricting us to young people would probably reduce the denominator of &quot;300&#x2F;19740000&quot; enough to counteract the fact that the exponent of &quot;69&quot; is reduced.<p>In fact, if you assume that people are young for x% of their lives, and x% of black people are young, this exactly cancels out and you still get `0.001048` odds of being killed by police.')
