It’s about one teaspoon of Nescafé Gold instant coffee in about half a liter of hot water (yeah, I like that it’s instant and am not hooked on to gourmet coffee or having the best coffee ever).<p>I quit that habit for nearly a year, but it didn’t have any effect on my mildly high blood pressure (monitoring regularly). So I resumed it. I don’t have any withdrawal symptoms like headaches or anything else when I’m off it for a few days or even weeks.<p>I have no idea how to estimate how much caffeine (in milligrams) that one large mug has and what effects it has.<p>I do know that the morning coffee’s alerting effect lasts till late afternoon or evening. I have tea in the evening and that also has some effect on wakefulness.<p>So I’m left with the feeling that whether or not I have coffee in the amounts I’m consuming, it doesn’t make a big difference. Maybe it’d be good to quit it once and for all. But I just don’t have enough information on why I should and how it would benefit me, considering several reports that go back and forth on the benefits and harms of coffee that happen to crop up every few months.')
