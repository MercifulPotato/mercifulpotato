I happen to know a few relevant to my fields of interest. They are memorable to me because they state complex ideas in brief, understandable ways. Rather than trying to learn a bunch of laws for the sake of knowing laws, look to your field for the important ideas and you&#x27;ll often discover that someone has written formulated a &quot;law&quot;. Most folks know Murphy&#x27;s law, a general one, perhaps Occam&#x27;s razor, and there&#x27;s also Sturgeon&#x27;s law and Godwin&#x27;s law. In computer science you have Conway&#x27;s Law, Brooks&#x27; Law, and Moore&#x27;s law.<p>You probably already know quite a few laws, just not that they have names. &quot;Power tends to corrupt; absolute power corrupts absolutely&quot;, and &quot;Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic&quot; come to mind.')
