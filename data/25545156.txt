And every.single.time I order online and hit the checkout button, it pops up asking me if I want to add an extra large tub of it to my order!<p>I order Domino&#x27;s on occasion just because my kids like it, and the online ordering process is great, but I&#x27;m not a huge fan of their pizzas TBH. I find them very greasy, and strangely the quality seems to vary from time to time - sometimes the dough is thicker, sometimes it&#x27;s a little undercooked etc.<p>Also the pricing in the UK is weird. The official prices are actually pretty expensive, but there are <i>always</i> vouchers for 30% or whatever off. Annoyingly, this means I always have to buy more than I want to qualify for the voucher, because it ends up being cheaper to buy more.')
