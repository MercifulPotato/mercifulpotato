While comparisons can still be drawn between human and FSD drivers using the same (incredibly unsuitable) tires, handicapping the system doesn&#x27;t provide a great measure of its prowess or challenges in &quot;snowy conditions.&quot;<p>A bit of an aside, but few driving-related topics grind my gears more than people who live in snowy&#x2F;icy climates driving with cheap (or just bald) all-seasons and complaining that their car &quot;isn&#x27;t good&quot; in the snow so they need a bigger 4x4, which is of course subsequently kept on stock all-seasons for only a marginal improvement.')
