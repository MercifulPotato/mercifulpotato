Item(by='retsibsi', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606264416, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25199186, text='&gt; Aldi had great success posting &quot;hauls&quot; until they were caught astroturfing.<p>Is there a decent rundown of this anywhere? I tried a couple of google searches but didn&#x27;t find much.<p>(I often get the feeling this is being done by various companies, especially on Reddit, but I find it hard to distinguish between astroturfing and sincere consumerism. Especially when they are probably working in combination: astroturfing to set the tone, then genuine community members jumping on the bandwagon and acting as unwitting accomplices. So I&#x27;m interested to read case studies wherever it has provably happened.)')
