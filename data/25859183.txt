You conveniently ignore addressing the many other sources I cite that indicate otherwise. You are closing your eyes and supporting a false atrocity.<p>&gt; Here&#x27;s what China says is extremist:<p>I literally said that cases of wrong conviction exist and that I condemn wrong convictions. I literally said that I don&#x27;t agree with their way of using too broad strokes. In your zeal to see nazis everywhere, you completely ignore everything I said that indicates otherwise.<p>While spending so much time accusing me, you still refuse to condemn the US war on terror and literal concentration camps at the US border. Now why&#x27;s that?')
