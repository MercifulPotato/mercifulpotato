End of story.<p>People made insane money with Bitcoin, Ethereum and others. People then dropped lots of other &quot;coins&quot; that eventually no one cared about. &quot;Blockchain as useful technology&quot; is the story to sell the next &quot;coin&quot;. Employing a couple of devs and funding a few blockchain startups is trivial money in this context, often sponsored by &quot;believers&quot; (who got rich in the early days)<p>Blockchain tech comes with inescapable complexities and problems: bugs and security issues can&#x27;t be fixed in blockchain programs. Any trivial action on the blockchain requires <i>mining</i>, i.e. the very thing that&#x27;s done with specialized hardware in areas where energy is cheap.<p>My last point seems to be tangential, but do try it yourself with a small project on a private Ethereum chain, using geth, web3.js, there are good tutorials out there. Usually when you try out a fancy new tech you &quot;get it&quot; after a while, but I definitively did NOT see any way this is feasible.')
