Then when I got stuck at home, I dug out my old kinesis but it was just too much effort to press those keys, and the cursor keys were just too far away. I could feel the muscles in my arms complaining.<p>But the pronation and ulnar deviation was a pain, so I bought another one, so now I can angle them perfectly for each hand. If you want to try it you&#x27;ll need karibiner [1] so that the cmd keys work across keyboards.<p>I&#x27;m still using the magic mouse because I found click-drag with the trackpad to be shitty. Is there a trick to that?<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;karabiner-elements.pqrs.org" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;karabiner-elements.pqrs.org</a>')
