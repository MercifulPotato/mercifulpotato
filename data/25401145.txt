Would you have described RHEL this way?  If not, then you shouldn&#x27;t describe CentOS this way either.  CentOS took RHEL&#x27;s place in the chain.  Instead of Cent being downstream of RHEL, the two were swapped around.<p>&gt; <i>If you believe the changes are &quot;not all the much&quot; then you are clearly not in touch with the user base of CentOS, outside of Devs that is</i><p>Say what you will.  I&#x27;ve been using Cent since 2012 and currently run numerous workloads in production on it.  I&#x27;ve shipped SaaS products on top of it and have been responsible for widespread maintenance.  I&#x27;ve been a package maintainer for numerous packages as well.<p>&gt; <i>But for us Old School, OnPrem sysadmins running CentOS for Stability, and Long Term Support, CentOS is most certainly dead</i><p>I know plenty of old school on prem sysadmins who run CentOS for stability and LTS (I&#x27;m one of them.  I have 3 bare metal machines in prod at the moment running CentOS).  I may go with Rocky for one of those machines (it&#x27;s a router&#x2F;load balancer), I haven&#x27;t fully decided yet.<p>That said I agree with you somewhat, that is the one area where this change could be somewhat negative.  However, with CentOS being week and months behind RHEL right now, do you see that as a good thing?  Do you like having an unpatched system for days or weeks at a time when an embargoed security fix hits RHEL and has to wait for CentOS to build and distribute?  I don&#x27;t.  Security patches are top priority for me.')
