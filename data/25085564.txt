For few things yes (OpenGL or 32-bit depreciation); other things are simply not found in the new releases (Kerberos Ticket Viewer, TWAIN). Then there&#x27;s a middle ground, where there is a window of few months to make significant architectural changes to your product (see VPNs and personal firewalls).<p>So excuse me, I&#x27;m going to look for a new release of Cisco VPN that works with Big Sur. Of course, it is customer&#x27;s VPN, and they don&#x27;t care that their vendors might use Mac, so no help from them, it is my problem now.')
