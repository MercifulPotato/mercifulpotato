What&#x27;s why I&#x27;m saying I&#x27;m lucky it wasn&#x27;t logged as substance possession. Also by arrested I mean handcuffed&#x2F;put into a car, but I wasn&#x27;t taken to a jail. I was just written a possession fine&#x2F;piece of paper.<p>I think the answer to your question is I was not affected. As I&#x27;ve taken jobs that had to do security checks to get in and I got through. I guess it depends what they&#x27;re looking for.')
