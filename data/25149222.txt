While I agree to those who say that people are being irrationally offended, I see banning of word master as exactly what would a master do.<p>Not only methods are silly, because it seems a paradox to me that enforcing unfair policies makes happier those who were victims of unfair policy enforcement. (Oh, wait, no paradox here, just human nature), but what concerns me much more is enforcing of US culture. Companies eliminate words master, black, and others like offensive ones, but they may not be offensive in other cultures. Even more, replacements may be even more offensive. Why questionable fear of offending some of 40 million black U.S. people by just using a word, without any intent to offend anyone is enough to enforce some country-specific culture based policy on 7 billion people?')
