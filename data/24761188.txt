I was around for all that history, and that is exactly my point. Savannah, bitbucket, and SourceForge all added support for git later because they had to. They added support for git because git won, not because it failed.<p>Also, please look at the article I cited about Microsoft. That was not just a  simple swap. Microsoft could not use git as-is because of the way they use Version Control in general. Instead of sticking to their existing system, they implemented additional functionality for git so that git would work in their environment. That is a vote of confidence for git, because they believed it was better to add functionality to git.')
