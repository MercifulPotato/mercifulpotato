When the TPAA died it was pretty clear the Chinese were rubbing their hands in glee.  Trump had handed them the Trump card in trade negotiations, as it were.  This is from 2017:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rymndp.wordpress.com&#x2F;2017&#x2F;01&#x2F;26&#x2F;us-withdrawal-on-trans-pacific-partnership-is-it-dead-already&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rymndp.wordpress.com&#x2F;2017&#x2F;01&#x2F;26&#x2F;us-withdrawal-on-tra...</a><p>It&#x27;s funny how it&#x27;s all turned out.  Trump ditched the TPAA, and along with it all those onerous copyright laws everybody hated.  So we got a nicely watered down version.   China steps into the void.

Our prime minister called for an investigation into the origins of COVID-19, right after Trump intimated it was bio-engineered by China and they were engaged in a cover up.  Right now China is engaged in what looks to be genocide against their Muslim population, the Uighurs, egregious breaking of agreements with the UK over Hong Hong, threats to Taiwan, destabilising &quot;Island Building&quot; in the South China Sea, and we choose to take a principled stand over a ... conspiracy theory.<p>I don&#x27;t know what it feels like in NZ, but we Ozzies feel like we are living in interesting times.')
