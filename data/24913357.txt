It seems like you&#x27;re saying that Twitter is not a &quot;provider...of an interactive computer service&quot; because it is choosing what is on its platform, even though in section 2A it specifically provides protections for such providers to &quot;restrict access to or availability of material that the provider...considers to be obscene...or otherwise objectionable&quot;. If it is not allowed for a platform to remove content they find objectionable, then why call it out as protected here?')
