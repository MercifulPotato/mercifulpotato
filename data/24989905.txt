And yet we have one system of casting and tallying votes, presided over by one federal electoral commission, which reports to the parliament and not to the government. It was set up in 1920 and worked out very well for us, delivering 100 years of bullshit-free elections.<p>Sometimes countries adopt different laws and you cannot unequivocally say one is better than the other.
