As you mention, you&#x27;d need to roll your own multi-SIMD-instruction rsqrt newton iteration complex loop, and use it after the first SIMD call.<p>That&#x27;s really sad. There is hardware to perform Newton iterations on Intel CPUs, that&#x27;s how that instruction is implemented, but the ISA only exposes this hardware via the &quot;do a 14-bit rsqrt operation&quot;, which means that you can&#x27;t really use it to increase precision if that does not suffice for your app.')
