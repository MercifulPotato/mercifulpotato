Robinhood accounts are <i>by default</i> margin accounts, and their documentation describes this in an incredibly misleading way (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;robinhood.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;en&#x2F;support&#x2F;articles&#x2F;robinhood-accounts&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;robinhood.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;en&#x2F;support&#x2F;articles&#x2F;robinhood-accou...</a>):<p>&gt; When you sign up for a new account, you’ll automatically start with a Robinhood Instant account, which is a margin account. This means you’ll have access to instant deposits and extended-hours trading. You also won’t have to wait for your funds to process when you sell stocks or make a deposit (up to $1,000).<p>I stand by my claim that margin accounts necessarily require forced liquidation, but this is pretty indefensible.<p>-----<p>If the stocks were bought on margin it&#x27;s entirely non-objectionable. Forced liquidation is a well-known practice that&#x27;s fundamental to margin accounts as a concept - without it, a margin account is just an unsecured loan, and nobody&#x27;s going to offer the average margin trader a low-cost unsecured loan for stock speculation.')
