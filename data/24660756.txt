It feels scary to see that all these NN APIs are appearing around the fact that we cannot talk to DSPs, NPUs, GPUs, CPUs under a same language. By creating such highly-specialized APIs it feels like &quot;giving up&quot; on ever accomplishing that.<p>Decades ago, compiler developers solved dealing with multiple CPU architectures, by creating languages that succinctly expresses their common traits: Doing arithmetical-logical operations and accessing memory. Languages like C abstracted us from CPU registers, stacks. Optimization passes like vectorization abstracted us from different ISA extensions.<p>Now it feels it&#x27;s the same issue all over again.\nIs it really hard to simply express: `x&#x27; = W*x + b` and let the compiler target the CPU&#x2F;GPU&#x2F;NPU as needed?')
