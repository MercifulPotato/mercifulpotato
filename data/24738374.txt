I mean, why not? You will notice the effects of going without it much sooner than going without food, for example.<p>Personally, I totally buy that it could be as bad as (or even worse) than smoking. How much bad stuff has happened due to lack of sleep&#x2F;quality of sleep that we just discount as due to something else entirely?')
