Item(by='E8DVHXqR', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602075481, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24707193, text='&gt; I think it is quite likely that we as a society would be better off without any kind of copyright or IP.<p>I agree with that. IP also doesn&#x27;t make any sense to me from a philosophical perspective. I don&#x27;t understand why making one thing once should give me a monopoly on making things that are similar to that thing.<p>The fact that the question of how similar a thing must be to fall under my monopoly is so arbitrary and ill-defined also leads to an enormous amount of resources being wasted on litigation and designing around the law.<p>Non-disclosure agreements are sufficient to allow an inventor to be first to market. They should not be able to use the government to enforce a monopoly after that.')
