Once you leave the roughly egalitarian youth and college phase where everyone is roughly at a similar level (at least in your bubble), roads start diverging and money and status become more important than people especially idealistic nerds would imagine. The world is a cold hard place that doesn&#x27;t give two shits what happens to you, whether you can make a living, provide your family or not.<p>I don&#x27;t mean to say that you have to enter the rat race and keep up with the Joneses and burn out. I just mean that money and status are these dirty words that are taboo to admit caring about in some circles, but it is money and status that earn you freedom and the ability to not give a fuck what people who you don&#x27;t respect think about you. It is the only thing that will make annoying people you don&#x27;t care about still act as if they respected you so you can concentrate on all the people and things you do care about.')
