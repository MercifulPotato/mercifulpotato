So if they do move they will attempt to sell for the privilege of renting the unit, at the time this could range as high as $50k, the landlord and previous tenant would split this &#x27;fee&#x27;. What&#x27;s incredible is that for the right apartment in the right part of NYC amortized over a few years, this was a great deal for the new tenant.')
