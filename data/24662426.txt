With c-section it&#x27;s ~$20k to the patient. ~30% of all births where I am are c-sections. These prices do not include <i>any</i> other treatment to the mother or child, only the delivery fee. I assume these prices include medicaid&#x2F;VA patients as well, but I cannot confirm. <i>Likely</i> that means people not under government insurance are paying more than what I stated, but I&#x27;d go with those numbers with a gun to my head.<p>So, the simple act of having children in my part of the US is quite expensive.')
