Item(by='nbzso', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608763903, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25520510, text='Kitsch (&#x2F;kɪtʃ&#x2F; KITCH; loanword from German)[a][1] is art or other objects that, generally speaking, appeal to popular rather than &quot;high art&quot; tastes. Such objects are sometimes appreciated in a knowingly ironic or humorous way.[2][3][4] The word was first applied to artwork that was a response to certain divisions of 19th-century art with aesthetics that favored what later art critics would consider to be exaggerated sentimentality and melodrama. Hence, &quot;kitsch art&quot; is closely associated with &quot;sentimental art&quot;. Kitsch is also related to the concept of camp, because of its humorous and ironic nature.')
