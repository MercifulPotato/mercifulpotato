If threading is done well, it will reduce wall-clock time, so I agree that threading could come out ahead.<p>What I was trying to get at is that if two languages perform the same task, but one of them uses multi-threading to accomplish it, &quot;wall-clock time&quot; is extremely likely to be a misleading proxy for power consumption.<p>It boils down to the fact that a CPU using all of its cores uses more power than a CPU using only one of its cores. This is easily checkable by listening to the fans on a fully loaded desktop PC, or by using software like &quot;Core Temp&quot; which can display CPU power consumption on some CPU models.')
