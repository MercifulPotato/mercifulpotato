I also agree that authoritarian dystopias can be driven not just by governments, but also by powerful corporations.  I don&#x27;t really see too much of an important distinction between either.  This banning is effectively authoritarianism - just not perpetrated by a government (directly - but possibly indirectly to appease the new administration&#x2F;govt by a large corp).  I think we should be just as concerned about this as if it were perpetrated by a govt.')
