A swapped out hashing algorithm would have been proving the same thing <i>and</i> would have allowed you to test important things like 3+ collisions and two sets of collisions.<p>Anyone who demanded the real hashing algorithm in this case doesn’t understand how hash collisions work and what problems you need to solve when using hashing. Your “100% accurate test case” serves very little value.<p>It’s the same as requiring a real person perform the checkout workflow in your shopping cart integration tests. It’s “100% accurate” but it’s a massive waste of resources and provides terrible coverage of the many other edge cases.')
