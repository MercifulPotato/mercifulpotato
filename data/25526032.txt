As someone who straddles the programming &#x2F; visual arts world (I write plugins for 3D modelling software) I actually spend most of my time having to use &quot;low resolution&quot; (1080p or 1440p) because I&#x27;m dealing with complex polygon models with tens of millions of polys and scenes with sometimes thousands of objects in them. You get a similar problem with games or doing video editing. It also doesn&#x27;t address the problem that there&#x27;s a limit to people&#x27;s visual acuity (especially as they get older as I&#x27;m rapidly discovering at 40) so you still have to make icons &quot;bolder&quot; and change details as the article addresses as they get smaller to make them more &quot;readable&quot;.')
