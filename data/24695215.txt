It&#x27;s three inflatable pillows and they attach in various shapes with velcro.  What is so ingenius about it is you can blow them up inside the space you need for arm or foot support- they&#x27;re great for long haul flights but I also recently dug them out of my travel bag and used them as a footrest and arm rest for when I am working on the couch.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Flypal-Inflatable-Blow-Up-Cushion-Flights&#x2F;dp&#x2F;B074T9CP81&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Flypal-Inflatable-Blow-Up-Cushion-Fli...</a>')
