I&#x27;m honestly very surprised to hear it referred to as &#x27;smallish&#x27;.. At most I&#x27;d say 100TB is about middle of the road now days for media horders and small for media content producers.<p>Now my buddy that worked on the CEPH storage backed at CERN would laugh at any of these numbers... but that&#x27;s a different ballpark all together..')
