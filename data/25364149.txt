This would be helpful when the origin is hosted by an inflexible third party, or as a time saver to quickly switch between environments without needing to modify other parts of the infrastructure.<p>Example 1: A third-party service does not support custom domains, only responds to &quot;Host: my-company.saas-helpdesk.com&quot;. For a clean user experience, I want &quot;support.my-domain.com&quot; to reverse proxy to &quot;my-company.saas-helpdesk.com&quot; while rewriting the Host header to their origin as &quot;Host: my-company.saas-helpdesk.com&quot;. (I realize CSP headers and all sorts of pain might happen here - perhaps not the best example - but would be great flexibility to have around)<p>Example 2: My startup&#x27;s origin only responds to &quot;Host: beta.mydomain.com&quot;, and the developer with access to its code is on vacation. I want to release my product. I point &quot;www.mydomain.com&quot; to the IP hosting &quot;beta.mydomain.com&quot; but since that origin does not respond to &quot;Host: www.mydomain.com&quot; - it does not work. I need a Host header rewrite.<p>Thank you for your time!')
