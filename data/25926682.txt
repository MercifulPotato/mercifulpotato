Want to throw vastly different things into a single array (sometimes not even knowing <i>what</i> type those things are)? No problem, it just works.<p>This type of quick&#x27;n&#x27;dirty throw-away coding would be a lot less convenient if Python would force a strong static type system on me.<p>If Python is used for &quot;real projects&quot; with more than a few thousand lines of code, worked on by a team, static typing totally makes sense. But there are a lot of everyday tasks where this just gets in the way.')
