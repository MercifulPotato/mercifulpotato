I couldn&#x27;t understand why (free work is free -- is everyone insane?).<p>After a bit of experience (and receiving this offer regularly) I realized why my offer was always declined. The process of onboarding a dev is long and takes a toll on the existing teams productivity (it&#x27;s often a worthwhile toll). The process to onboard an intern&#x2F;free worker is roughly the same as a &quot;normal&quot; employed dev (unless the dev you&#x27;re employing has identical past experience, which is very rare).<p>From the employer&#x27;s perspective, it&#x27;s often not beneficial to onboard someone that&#x27;s explicitly looking for a full-time role elsewhere.')
