The regulators always have a chance of being captured by the industry or just plain incompetent.<p>We have a culture of people not feeling the negative repercussions of &quot;bad actions&quot;. Buying multiple homes was irresponsible, mortgage brokers immediately selling every loan is a moral hazard and Wall street levering up on CDOs were all problems. All of them deserve blame BUT the hedge funds and mortgage brokers got bailouts and the home buyers didnt. That smells like BS to me and anger at the people that allowed that to happen, hedge funds and bankers included, looks justified to me')
