Item(by='gruez', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606187012, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25194551, text='&gt; Last time I checked, bigotry was bad in general, not just when applied to those without power.<p>You&#x27;re invoking &quot;it&#x27;s bigotry!&quot; as a reason why we shouldn&#x27;t do this. Why do you think bigotry is bad? Is it bad intrinsically (aka &quot;bigotry is bad&quot; is an axiom), or is it bad because of its effects? If it&#x27;s the latter, does the reasoning apply when applied to organizations with voluntary membership?<p>Furthermore, I don&#x27;t see why it&#x27;s bad to hate on an organization and&#x2F;or its members based on the conduct of its other members. Let&#x27;s say Acme, Inc is known for sales reps with high pressure sales tactics. Is it bad then, if I ignore a cold call from an Acme sales rep on that basis?')
