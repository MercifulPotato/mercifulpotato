Item(by='Amezarak', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607597012, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25368491, text='&gt; it is entirely just a scheme to subvert our democracy.<p>If our democratic systems were transparent, verifiable, and understandable, it wouldn&#x27;t be possible to &#x27;subvert&#x27; our democracy in this way. The fact is that our democracy has already been &#x27;subverted&#x27; whether or not any fraud occurred (and surely <i>some</i> did, just as it does in every election in American history; the only question is the scale - was it late 1800s scale or late 1900s scale - most people on HN would agree it was probably late 1900s scale, that is, minimal.) But the system is set up in such a way that we cannot actually prove anything. We just have to accept what we&#x27;re told, because democracy.<p>The election systems in each state have their own problems. In Georgia the problems are with the tabulation, with absentee ballots, with chain of custody. I am not saying fraud <i>did</i> occur. I am saying that because of the problems I just mentioned, it is impossible to prove if fraud occurred or not. And things should not be that way.<p>At any rate, all you mean by &#x27;subverting democracy&#x27; is &#x27;decreasing faith in our institutions.&#x27; And I honestly don&#x27;t know how anyone can look at the past few years and trust any of our institutions.')
