(They wouldn&#x27;t sell disposable in-ear headphones either. No exchanging batteries) But if it wasn&#x27;t about money, they would&#x27;ve added a coupon&#x2F;code to buy a charger because the product is useless without one...<p>Just because the actual action can also be spun in q environmental friendly way doesn&#x27;t mean the company actually did it for that.<p>They didn&#x27;t want to include a charger and just used the environment as an excuse so they can argue all criticism away')
