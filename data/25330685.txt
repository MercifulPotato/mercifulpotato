Be it Android or iOS.<p>On the Android side it seems like there was a huge push for documentation some years ago but due to the sheer size and scope it seems like many things just never got updated and new things got the &quot;Gotta go Fast&quot; treatment. It&#x27;s always very frustrating reading an official &quot;How-to&quot; article telling you to do one thing and when you click through to the underlying system&#x27;s documentation you notice that this is no longer how you do it.<p>On the iOS side I can&#x27;t understand how anyone figures out how things work. Maybe veterans know enough to decipher 4 word descriptions of a function argument and a random list of exposed function names but I certainly can&#x27;t. e.g. How anyone figured out how ReplayKit works from the &quot;docs&quot; is beyond me. There is a WWDC video and hopefully some sample code you find in some repos but good luck with that...<p>I can forgive a lot of peculiarities of a system if I can at least figure out the what &amp; how in the documentation&#x2F;guides.<p>There are documentations for rather complex systems that I thought were absolutely amazing, e.g. the MS Hololens. So it is at least possible.')
