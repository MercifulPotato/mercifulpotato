At the same time, Observer B observes particle B at a spin down.<p>Observer A&#x27;s observation of a spin up means observer B must see a spin down.  However, the two observers are restricted at the speed of light to communicate this to each other.<p>It would initially seem like there is a instantaneous causal impact based on observer A&#x27;s observation. But that&#x27;s not the case.<p>I tend to think it was predestined what each observer  see, but that leads to all sorts of philosophical questions.<p>I hope I did this topic justice, I find it quite interesting but have no background in it.')
