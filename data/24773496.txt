I were very skeptical at the practice first but oh boy, the sudden freezing shock really do wake some survival instinct inside you out, and your mind becomes really sharp. Until you keep doing it to a point of dizziness reminiscent of certain highs. If you are going to try cold shower, ice lake bath with sauna is also a experience worth trying out!<p>It didn&#x27;t help him get out of depression, but sure did energize him more for a brief period of time in his life. (until his routine collapsed)')
