I back it up with Google One&#x27;s 2TB family plan where we have a common family photos (wife, and I)and my 11-year old daughter learning to shoot. The Google Photos is more because Apple has no correct implementation of sharing&#x2F;collaborating between the family members.<p>- Stingle is costlier than Apple or Google&#x27;s plan.<p>- It does not say anywhere that this is open source and I can host it myself, plugged in with a storage such as AWS S3 or Wasabi or any other cloud that I can backup&#x2F;store etc.<p>So far, NextCloud[1] seems to be the best bet with PhotoSync[2] keeping a local&#x2F;cloud backup. I need the ability to share photos with an expansive network of families&#x2F;relatives on different platforms such as Android, Windows, Mac, Linux.<p>I haven&#x27;t found any other services and am beginning to believe I have a weird and different needs than most.<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nextcloud.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nextcloud.com</a><p>2. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.photosync-app.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.photosync-app.com&#x2F;</a>')
