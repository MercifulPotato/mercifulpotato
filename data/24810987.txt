You&#x27;re not helping anyone if you invent an entirely new script that everyone has to learn from scratch, and that doesn&#x27;t even have extant keyboards. Latin script is the only choice that makes sense -- most people worldwide already have at least some familiarity with it, and it has excellent universal hardware and software support. Nothing else even comes close.')
