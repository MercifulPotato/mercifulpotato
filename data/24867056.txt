Writing more code (and being conscious of it) makes you a better engineer. You&#x27;ll run into more issues that you will fix and, hopefully, remember.<p>2. If you&#x27;d take the art example and say &quot;Paint 20 cubist pieces&quot;, and then transfer that to &quot;Write 20 authentication servers&quot;, each iteration you&#x27;ll benefit from what you learned and be able to &#x27;clean up&#x27; the code. It&#x27;s essentially writing 20 PoCs where each PoC improves on the last one.<p>EDIT: Writing more versions also allows you to explore more ideas without fear. If you have to write &quot;one good version&quot; you&#x27;ll be less prone to exploring &#x27;exotic&#x27; ideas. So you&#x27;d benefit from that as well.')
