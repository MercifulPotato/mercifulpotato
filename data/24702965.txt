Item(by='Jach', descendants=None, kids=[24704757], score=None, time=1602022469, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24700237, text='Over the 16 years from 1998 to 2014 where FAANG is even relevant, small business share of GDP declined from 48% to 43.5%. (Their dollar amount has grown 1.4% annually vs. 2.5% for large businesses.)<p>Is 43.5% too little? Or perhaps it&#x27;s too high? Across the EU, the figure I found has 99% of all enterprises employing fewer than 250 people, whereas in the US it&#x27;s 98%. For enterprises with 1-9 people employed, in the US it&#x27;s 67%, vs  88% in France, 93% in Czech Republic, 78% in UK, 61% in Germany...<p>I don&#x27;t think this paints a dire picture for small(er) independent businesses. Why stop consolidation now? What numbers would we need to see to loosen up on consolidation restrictions again in the future? In other words, what is your model here? What values should trigger action? Given a value, what should we be able to predict? Then we can go look at random other countries and see if the model is any use.<p>On a more general side of discussion, before breaking up big tech companies, I&#x27;d sooner break up big government. In a few months regardless of who wins the election, there will still be someone roughly 50% of the country despises who is going to claim to rule me and try to control my destiny from the other side of the continent. Why any rational person would want such a situation is beyond me, even if you genuinely see yourself as a Federalist.')
