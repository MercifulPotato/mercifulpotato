No ad-hominem, no insults to the developers etc... The backlash against systemd was unacceptable because it ended up targeting people and not the technology. Writing an init system shouldn&#x27;t net you death threats.<p>Beyond this, and not unlike systemd, flatpak has been pushed hard down people&#x27;s throat by powerful entities within the ecosystem, so it&#x27;s not surprising that in both cases there has been some intense backlash. I also personally think that in both cases it&#x27;s warranted.')
