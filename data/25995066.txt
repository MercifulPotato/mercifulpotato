There are few physical couplings you can make with your transmission system or steering wheel. But with software, your couplings are essentially unbounded. This permits radically unsafe and unmaintainable software, where an equivalent physical system likely wouldn&#x27;t even move. The nearest, in physical engineering, is electrical systems. But even then you <i>still</i> have to drive power through a constrained system and either can&#x27;t power everything or set something on fire.<p>This forces a practical limit on how you design physical systems. A kind of simplicity often falls out as a consequence. But in software, complexity still reigns supreme <i>because it can</i>. Without a deliberate effort, it is easy to develop a complex system that is hard to maintain, hard to verify, hard to validate, and hard to extend.')
