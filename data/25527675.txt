Really? The service packages the dealers sell in Australia are tricky, especially condition-based engine oil change WTF). Self and trusted mechanic friend can take good care of the car (thanks to realoem, newTIS and bimmerPost, BimmerCode etc.).<p>I didn&#x27;t even buy (one-off A$395, LCI became subscription and later scraped) CarPlay for my original F87, because I bought F87 for driving pleasure, the engagement &#x2F; communication with the car while driving it, don&#x27;t have a spare hand to deal with the buttons or screen to be honest, not even music when doing spirited driving (50% of the time).<p>I like the classic FR models with straight 6, missed a used 1M coupe (colleague&#x27;s, gone while hesitating spending 65k buying a used car), ended up with a compromise, OG F87 (not bad, probably the best that money can buy at that time with everything standard except heated steering wheel). It&#x27;s like 3.0 CSL, 2002 Turbo, E30 M3(straight four), E46 M3, 1M Coupe with the right size, proportion, front kidney grills (not like the new M4&#x27;s), what timeless design should be like.<p>Nowadays when looking at the modern BMWs on road, hope I can have a HUD to filter those :shrug.')
