You want an ICE car, you can keep your ICE car or buy another used one.  I am sure when it comes to it, there will also be a thriving niche market to keep these cars roadworthy for even longer than the normal 15-20 year lifespan.  That also probably includes aftermarket modifications to make the cars safer.<p>I&#x27;m also sure at some point someone somewhere might be inconvenienced by decisions like this, but we are going to have to just accept that if we want to combat climate change.  Maybe you object to it for a political or ideological reason.
