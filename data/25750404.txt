To me, censorship very clearly means an active effort to go out and eliminate a particular type of speech or a particular speaker. That means going out and finding that speech or speaker and shutting them down, everywhere.<p>In this instance, a platform decides, effectively &quot;we refuse to host your ideas, go elsewhere.&quot; Facebook and Google and Twitter aren&#x27;t going out of their way to scrub these people off the internet; they are just kicking them off their own platform.<p>You might consider this part of the &quot;cancel culture&quot;, but it&#x27;s not censorship.')
