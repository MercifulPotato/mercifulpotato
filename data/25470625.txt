Item(by='bird_monster', descendants=None, kids=[25471551], score=None, time=1608318248, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25468092, text='#1 is not at all objective. I would say a world that revolves around deception, fraud, sex work, black market body modification is definitely in the realm of &quot;Mature RPG&quot;.<p>#2 was mostly a lie<p>#3 Meh. You level up, you customize your character based on perks and skills. You get items that you can customize. This one seems fine.<p>#4 Is fair I think. Stealth + hacking + fighting + talking. You can build your character to be your exact playstyle. You can do several playthroughs and have totally different styles.<p>#5 I think is fair, although I might not call it &quot;gigantic&quot;. There are a bunch of weapon types, a lot of upgrades, and then a whole world of body modification and quickhack tools to play around with.<p>#6 is obviously a lie, given the launch.')
