We actually think about what we are building as very much &quot;Do-It-For-You&quot;.<p>Your feedback is making me think that we&#x27;re not doing a great job of making clear the importance of the role of the professional interviewer in what we create for our customers.<p>Separate from the important logistical aspects of our service that other contributors mention on the thread, our customers continue to share with us that the role of the professional interviewer is just really important.<p>This space that gets created between professional interviewer and guest makes it possible for the guest to go beyond that first question about, say, the relationship between two people, and get much deeper into particular periods in each others lives when that relationship has really mattered, and also sharing makes sharing lighter moments a lot of fun.<p>I&#x27;ll just say that the art and skill of the follow up question is real.<p>I&#x27;d also say that if reading a bit about what we are up to inspires you to interview your mother&#x27;s closest friends about her and their relationships, that means a lot to me and please go for it. Also, let us know how we can help!<p>Feel free to email me with any questions you might have as to how to best set things up: contact@heyartifact.com')
