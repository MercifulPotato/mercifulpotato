There have been some (minor) gains on disclosure. Somewhat better progress on data selling&#x2F;sharing&#x2F;security. But, no real gains on consent, which is a big part of the regulatory effort and this specific case.<p>From experience, a lot of folks were waiting to see what Google&#x2F;Amazon&#x2F;FB&#x2F;etc were doing and using them as examples of what to do. These fines should help apply some downward pressure now that the regulator has explicitly called out this illegal behaviour.')
