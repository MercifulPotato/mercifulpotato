There&#x27;s extensive, detailed and super-useful documentation for pretty much all the commandlets available... but it&#x27;s not installed by default. Get-Help ... will happily tell you that you need to download help if you want to see any details beyond command signature. <i>Who in their right mind though this is a good idea?</i> Such documentation should be shipped with the default install.<p>I have it on the top of my mind because it bit me twice in recent month. I had to do some PS work on some VMs that didn&#x27;t have Internet access (beyond RDP). Sure, I can Alt+Tab to a browser on my machine, but at this point, why even have Get-Help? Contrast that with Emacs experience, where everything is documented, and documentation is easily accessible, off-line, and by default.')
