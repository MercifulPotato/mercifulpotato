Lua doesn&#x27;t have arrays, it only has tables, and both 0 and 1 are just keys, and having a 0 key is totally a thing you can do.<p>Tables can be used as lists or dicts or arrays, but, critically, the way you use them is already different (see e.g. pairs vs ipairs, being able to reference string indices with the &quot;.&quot; operator but not numeric indices, and whether using # does something stupid), so feel free to index them differently too. The only operations that care in Lua are ones that apply to either listish tables or dictish tables (insert, pairs, ipairs, the stupid footgun # operator) but are irrelevant to arrayish tables.<p>So if what you want is an arrayish table, go for it. Give yourself a key 0. If you want to start your array at 0 because you want to use modulous cycling, do it. If you want to start at 0 because you want to collapse multi-dimensional arrays into a single dimension, knock yourself out. Lua doesn&#x27;t care.')
