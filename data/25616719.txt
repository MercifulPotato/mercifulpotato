I remember I bought the first Google pay smartwatch Mobvi Ticwatch Pro.<p>Used it once to pay for dinner and jogging a few times and found it to be not useful as I keep going back to my smartphone which I am not keen to carry while exercising.<p>I&#x27;m hoping that Smartglasses won&#x27;t be a flop but can&#x27;t help but feel we are no in a plateau of really incremental innovations moving the screen from desktop to our pockets now to our wrists, our glasses and perhaps if Elon gets his way our brains in the future.<p>Still would want one tho as it appears it is very light unlike many major brand ones that seem so bulky and large on my tiny wrists')
