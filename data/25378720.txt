(At least, most of the userland is, they do use newer kernels.)  Which means it&#x27;s competing against CentOS 7, not 8 or Stream.<p>Curiously, Amazon only supports it till June 30, 2023, a year less than RHEL7&#x2F;CentOS7. It will be interesting to see what they plan to do for Amazon Linux 3, with the latest CentOS news.')
