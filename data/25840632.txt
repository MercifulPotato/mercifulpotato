Working from home. 1hr outdoor&#x2F;exercise a day. No more than 5km from home. We had pretty strict rules. I went for a walk around the block with my mate once a week and spoke to my family on zoom once a fortnight and that was about the extent of my social contact for a large part of 2020.<p>I managed pretty well. I&#x27;m a naturally introverted person, which is perhaps a good trait to have in this situation. I&#x27;m already used to spending a lot of time by myself and I have things I like to do. This is key, I think. I spent long hours making DJ mixes in Ableton and playing records on my hi-fi. That&#x27;s a creative place for me and it was very satisfying to have the time to bury myself in it.<p>I wrote code, not heaps, but I played around with a few things.<p>I dug up some old&#x2F;remake computer games (Half Life Black Mesa was by far the best)! I watched a bunch of old films I haven&#x27;t seen in years, and a few bits and pieces on Netflix. I read books. I went for a 1hr walk every day and enjoyed the sight of trees and the sound of birds. I said a sincere thanks and smiled with my eyes at the people who staff the stores I shopped at once&#x2F;twice a week. They have a hard job and I think it&#x27;s important to convey gratitude to them.<p>I&#x27;d be lying if I said it was all fine, there were definitely days when I was bored stiff, depressed or otherwise not in a great place, but it was helpful to remember that everyone was in the same boat, and my sacrifice, along with everyone else&#x27;s, are what is going to pull us through.<p>Keep your chins up. Especially you guys in the USA. What a mess you have to fix over there. I hope this year is productive.')
