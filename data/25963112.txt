Since GME has such high volume in the past few days, its not really hard at all to find shares right now).<p>You&#x27;re right that the borrow-rate is also important to look at, but the short-float doesn&#x27;t necessarily correlate with the borrow rate. You absolutely can&#x27;t state facts like:<p>&gt; With this much short interest the borrow fee must be close to 100% APY.<p>That&#x27;s... just not how this works.<p>EDIT: I looked up some public information: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;iborrowdesk.com&#x2F;report&#x2F;GME" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;iborrowdesk.com&#x2F;report&#x2F;GME</a><p>Seems to be 35%&#x2F;year right now for GME shorts. If a GME short borrowed at $300, the stock price needs to fall to $200 by 2022 before they lose money. Do you really think GME can be propped up above $200 for a whole year?<p>If they short sold months ago at lower borrow costs, they&#x27;ve basically would be in the position to wait it out longer than most bulls who are just messing with 3-month call options.<p>&gt; There&#x27;s really no good way to wait it out for the shorties.<p>Selling ITM calls (and maybe hedging slightly by buying an OTM call) seems to be the obvious bear trade that would be doing well under these circumstances. The theta on these call options are ridiculous. That brings theta over to your side.')
