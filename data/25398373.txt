You take something physically natural then sample it at a given interval to get logical data within certain parameters.<p>The security of such a system is not in the mystery of the physical object, but the sampling scheme. Apropos of the news, just like it isn&#x27;t important so much who people vote for, it&#x27;s who counts the votes that matters. The security of both lava lamp RNGs and PUFs are subject to an analogous sampling dynamic. So are biometrics.')
