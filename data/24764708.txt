Has limited scope but still applies to SaaS usage.<p>Also, for the record: if you _are_ considering LGPL, you should consider EPL or MPL license instead. The reason is that Apache Foundation and Eclipse Foundation are not happy to allow LGPL dependencies in their projects, while EPL and MPL are also copyleft with a limited scope just like LGPL.')
