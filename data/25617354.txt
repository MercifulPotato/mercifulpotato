In fact, I think the OSM total fraction of errors will exponentially decay towards some non-zero fixed fraction of errors. That&#x27;s because, on average in the long term, the world probably changes at an approximately fixed rate (relative to total mappable features in the world) and OSM is updated&#x2F;corrected at a fixed rate (relative to fraction of mappable features that are wrong or missing). Even given the benefit of a lot of time, the OSM can never catch up with a mapping service that updates faster because that other service will have a different equilibrium.')
