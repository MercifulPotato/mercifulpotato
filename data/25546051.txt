I drive a Tesla, my wife drives a Bolt, and we have an F250 for towing the travel trailer, hauling household stuff around, or going somewhere that charging infrastructure is going to be inadequate (haven&#x27;t really run into that yet, but the pickup is our catch-all).  I can&#x27;t see going back to ICE cars as daily drivers, but it&#x27;ll be quite a while before we don&#x27;t have at least one in our household.  Especially as long as we continue to own the RV.')
