From that source-code, you could derive a source code X for: &quot;Print all the computer programs which HAL would list if HAL were commanded: &#x27;Enumerate every computer program which you know to be an intuitive ordinal notation&#x27;&quot;. Since we&#x27;re assuming HAL is obedient and honest, all of X&#x27;s outputs will be intuitive ordinal notations, so X itself is an intuitive ordinal notation: you could say it notates &quot;the ordinal of HAL&quot;. So this innocent-looking exercise in fact includes the most ambitious possible projects you could imagine, even &quot;Design a perfect superhuman AGI&quot; :-)')
