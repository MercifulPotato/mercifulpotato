I&#x27;ve looked at them both extensively as I would love to move off Heroku due to pricing. DO App Platform is still really immature and lacking in a ton of areas. Render is much more polished from a usability standpoint, but AFAIK they don&#x27;t have any sort of High Availability offerings and have had significant downtime recently.<p>Heroku, on the other hand has been a hassle-free solution for my company over the past 7 years, and short of a few outages (which were actually the fault of AWS from what I remember), it has been absolutely reliable.')
