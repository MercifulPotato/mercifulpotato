It&#x27;s not an appeal to authority, but more a rebuttal of you affirmation that HN is full of &quot;non frontend people&quot;<p>1. I have a passion for front end, I have a PhD in Human Computer Interaction.<p>3. I am the cofounder and CTO of a company whose main product is based on CSS-in-JS (Emotion, Chakra UI)<p>2. I really like Tailwind and used it on several production projects.<p>4. So I know very well both of these approaches. I know their advantages and drawbacks.<p>5. In my comment I state the sad truth about this particular project: It combines the worst of both approaches in terms of performance, without any added value as compared to these approaches. Slow build AND slow runtime, without any added modularity.<p>This approach is objectively bad and this is why people react like this.<p>And to be constructive: If you want to use tailwind, use tailwind and you will have performant runtime but less \ncustomizability. If you want to use CSS-in-JS, use it and you will have customizability, but slower runtime. Engineering is trade-offs, but twin is still the worst of both worlds.')
