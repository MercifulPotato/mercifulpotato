Fetching is tricky also because you&#x27;re likely to get blocked from sites it you&#x27;re too aggressive.<p>To justify all that expense, you need a lot of users, but it will be hard to get those users because there is 20 years of &#x27;search = google&#x27; to compete with. Yahoo search user testing from 10+ years ago found that users would prefer search results displayed with Google branding over search results with Yahoo branding, regardless of the search results.   Maybe it wouldn&#x27;t be so bad if it&#x27;s Google vs a new hip name, but you have to somehow cultivate that hipness. Bing doesn&#x27;t have it, Amazon tried doing websearch and quit pretty quick (but maybe it&#x27;s used for Alexa?).<p>You&#x27;d realistically need to build out an advertising platform too. Using Google&#x27;s ad platform while trying to compete with their core market seems like a bad idea. Using Microsoft&#x27;s ad platform is probably not going to a good experience, but maybe you can start with it.')
