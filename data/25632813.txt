I had some feedback on the copy, though, that I hope isn&#x27;t just me being a pain in the a$$.<p><pre><code>  &gt; Are my notes safe?\n  &gt; We are committed to protect your information. Your data is stored on our secure servers and we use SSL encryption to protect data transmissions. Your notes are for your eyes only.\n</code></pre>\nSo, my first instinct when I read this was: &quot;No, then.&quot;  I apologize for jumping to sarcasm, simply because short of asking you to bake in end-to-end encryption, the fallback is to honestly state the situation.  Though, I&#x27;d keep that sentence in the middle and ditch the rest.  For those that might care, that&#x27;s clearly <i>not</i> end-to-end encryption[0].  Hopefully they know enough to understand that &quot;secure servers&#x2F;SSL&quot; means &quot;the server, somewhere, sees the actual data&quot; ... just like most of the rest of these sorts of apps.<p>For me, incidentally, the security you provide would be fine.  I&#x27;m more interested in a note&#x2F;to-do&#x2F;calendar app for my family with easy sharing&#x2F;tracking for the kids -- this doesn&#x27;t appear to be a goal of your product, so it&#x27;s probably not right for me at this time.<p>[0] Yes, you could simply say: &quot;There&#x27;s no end-to-end encryption&quot;, but then you could just use my original, sarcastic, answer and clearly this page is meant to market the product to people.')
