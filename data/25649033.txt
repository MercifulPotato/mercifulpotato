IMO you&#x27;d need a very good reason to keep any data related to such studies secret, and thats only if the data being kept secret isn&#x27;t  meaningful to the reproduction and verification of the results. Knowing who is X data point is most certainly relevant to independently verifying whether or not the data of the study is accurate, so i have a very hard time seeing how that should be kept secret.')
