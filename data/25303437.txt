Selfishness as a virtue?  I dont think leadership and charisma translate well to the digital platform, I think leadership is an analog process, you&#x27;ve got to be able to read the room, but we dont get into the same rooms anymore, we discuss politics on facebook and twitter.  Grandpa can&#x27;t teach his grandchildren how to behave if the children only talk to Grandpa on Facetime.  Our communities are missing the human connection - a necessary connection if we&#x27;re going to cooperate to fix our society.')
