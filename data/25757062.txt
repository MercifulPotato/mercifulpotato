Mine is that if the <i>best</i> you can say about a position is &quot;it&#x27;s not illegal&quot; then you&#x27;re on shaky ground. I.e. it&#x27;s legal, but unconvincing. It doesn&#x27;t mean you should be censored, it just means your position probably lacks merit if you can&#x27;t mention anything else that&#x27;s good about it.<p>&gt; <i>Your literal description of it is a red herring, a typical clever Monroe construction to avoid criticism</i><p>At this point I have to ask: you are aware I&#x27;m not the author of xkcd, aren&#x27;t you?')
