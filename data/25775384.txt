Then I want the author to have a long established solid reputation.<p>In practice, that approach does not work very well.  First, nearly nothing in the media meets such standards.  Second, even with the high school standards, it is still too easy to manipulate, deceive, or  lie to an audience.<p>My view of deception in politics is that it stands on a foundation of the audience wanting only headlines or very short articles.  Then, writing deceptive material is easy.<p>It would appear, then, that at least for now, stopping the deception in politics would be easy since the deception depends on just no more than short news articles and, thus, should be easy to debunk for the fraction of the audience willing to read some material a little longer and more complete.  At this point, until the means of deception react, there may be some potential via such longer materials.')
