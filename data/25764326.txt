TP-Link, Netgear, and a few others suffer this problem.<p>What happens is that when a wifi client moves from one AP to another, the old AP doesn&#x27;t update its device table, and the client becomes unreachable from other clients on the old AP. This only matters on networks that use a lot of LAN comms  (Sonos, AirPlay, etc), but it makes certain APs  (and extenders) unusable on those networks.<p>Two that work right are Ubiquity and Eero, fwiw.')
