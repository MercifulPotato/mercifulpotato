If anything, the people who use GitHub are more willing&#x2F;most likely to misuse bugtracker for not just support requests but also general discussion and comments like this.  It seems like there&#x27;s a (non) issue like this that gets linked at least once a month on HN.  I click through, get annoyed with the person who opened it, read the maintainer&#x27;s response, get annoyed with their endorsement&#x2F;encouragement of the idea, close the window, and then file it away in my mind or my bookmarks or both as an example of how annoying it is to try to collaborate with people whose platform of choice is GitHub.<p>Post this stuff on Twitter, or a mailing list, or a discussion board.  Or at the very least, be productive and file a bug that says something like, &quot;I wanted to express my gratitude for this project, but the README doesn&#x27;t link to any public venues for general discussion&quot;.  You know: things that at least attempt to pass themselves off as legitimate bugs?  Or just don&#x27;t do any of that and keep posting this sort of thing on GitHub--but in that case, please kindly also curb your and your colleagues&#x27; whinging in all future instances where you find that someone has chosen not to host on GitHub and, upon with being asked to, they say &quot;no&quot; and point to things like this as being among the reasons why GitHub users can&#x27;t be trusted to make responsible use of project infrastructure.')
