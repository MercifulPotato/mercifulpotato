A couple of expansions:<p>- Tech is seen as the easiest way to the middle class in many emerging economies, notably India and China. Tech orientated third level institutions are an industry of their own in India due to the sheer level of demand for it.<p>- Skilled immigration is one of the most favoured tools of most globalist western governments in their fight to destroy the middle class.<p>- Remote work will continue to grow, the pains associated with async work and time differences will be mitigated against, hence a (more) global labour pool for the same jobs. Why pay an American dev $100k plus benefits when I can readily pay a Chilean dev $20k with fewer, if any, benefits.<p>Tech companies have been clamouring for the above for at least a decade now and we&#x27;re really starting to see strides being made in it.<p>I should note that the 10 years I mentioned above was an optimistic estimate.')
