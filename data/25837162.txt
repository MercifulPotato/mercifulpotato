Even if this content is fine, there is certainly some content on GitHub that violates copyright and Microsoft would want safe harbor protections in those instances.  They therefore can&#x27;t completely abandon the DMCA.<p>My understanding is that in order to continue participating in the DMCA the recipient needs to act on all requests.  That doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean they need to take down the content, just that they need to respond to requests.<p>There is also no penalty setup within the DMCA for sending a request in which the response is that the content is not in violation.  The only part of the DMCA that sets up penalties for the requester is if the requests are made in bad faith.  That basically would require Microsoft to show the MPA is malicious in their requests rather than incompetent.  That can be difficult to prove.')
