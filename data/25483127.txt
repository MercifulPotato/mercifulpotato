The owner is claiming indifference as to whether it is sold at their chosen value or not.<p>If that&#x27;s only fair market value (in the rest of the market), the owner is indifferent to owning the asset at all and is just inadvertently hoarding it. The economy works better for everyone if the owner is encouraged to sell to whoever values it most highly.<p>If the call option is called in (above the owner&#x27;s valuation plus costs), an auction could be triggered, avoiding the arbitrage of first dibs.<p>Overall, this is a hair on the back of a nit. The law should be that you pay tax on your global wealth - avoiding and evading tax is already a choice that people make. It&#x27;s nothing new.')
