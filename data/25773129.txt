You couldn&#x27;t say certain things on the radio. If you wanted to publish something particularly inflammatory and demeaning, the only outlet was to find some fringe press or do it yourself, because it would simply be unacceptable anywhere else.<p>Free speech just means the government isn&#x27;t going to prosecute you for saying something. That&#x27;s it. Free speech doesn&#x27;t mean Random House <i>must</i> publish your manifesto to all things awful. It also doesn&#x27;t mean a private company is obligated to publish your derogatory tweet. Or for a company to host your website chock full of hateful language.')
