The question is, does this material have two superconduction modes: one at low temperatures and pressures, and another at high temperatures and pressure?<p>The idea would be to create a superconductor with a pressure&#x2F;temp curve that is amenable to the pressure&#x2F;temp curve of the starting sequence of a fusion reactor.')
