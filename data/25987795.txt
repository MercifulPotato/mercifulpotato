But this reality is created by ecosystem of our society. If you suppress highly creative individuals who don&#x27;t want to deal with BS, it&#x27;s gonna suck for you too. We live in a highly connected world. Changes take years, but even from purely egoistic point of view, to say that suffering of a group of people does not affect you is plain wrong if you think about it long enough.<p>What do you care about people in North Korea? If the country was doing well, maybe they would  have the biggest semiconductor fab. Or maybe you would be using some great open source that came from there.<p>I agree that there is no point shouting at the clouds when there is no action that you can take to fix the problem. But in some cases you can take some action, even if it&#x27;s as little as discussing the issue here which makes it slightly louder which could fix the problem, or deciding that you don&#x27;t want to use Apple because of it etc.<p>Personally I keep thinking about decentralized web of trust  which could make app stores deprecated or at least create a market of app stores. <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;comboy.pl&#x2F;wot.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;comboy.pl&#x2F;wot.html</a> - I&#x27;m working on a better version and a github repo.<p>And yes, impact of your actions, unless they are really great, is likely very small, so you can just be completely egoistic and world won&#x27;t be much different. But this works on all scales. If you are not trying to make people around you happy then you live surrounded by unhappy people. So I guess what I&#x27;m suggesting, is that this approach will not make you happy, and I&#x27;d like you to be. And while internet stranger words have low value for you, it&#x27;s an input that may affect later output.<p>You may not necessarily be optimizing for happiness, but if your utility function is not aligning with the most popular one in this case (people seem to want great work to be well rewarded), it would be nice to give us a glimpse of it, to put your statement in a context which makes sense.')
