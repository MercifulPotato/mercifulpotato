Yes, I know about Cygwin and WSL and the rest, but if you’re a run of the mill Windows developer then your life is centered around Visual Studio and NetBeans and PyCharm and <i>maybe</i> Powershell and <i>maybe maybe</i> cmd.exe if you’re a greybeard.<p>That vim and bash and all of these terminal-driven ways of developing are the unique privilege (and I do say that unironically) of working with *nix systems.<p>That’s not to say Windows devs don’t use vim, but in my (limited) experience, it’s about as common as using a gas-powered generator to charge your Tesla.')
