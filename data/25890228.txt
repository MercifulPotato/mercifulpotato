Colleges are basically scammers at this point. The whole benefit of going to college is being able to meet like-minded smart, young people like yourself. Remote college isn&#x27;t a thing and never will be. College is about people, as much as it is about learning. The unfortunate K-12 and college students are learning this the hard way.<p>Personally, I don&#x27;t think that remote is here to stay. I think working will be augmented by remote tools, but it cannot be replaced by remote. Humans just aren&#x27;t robots and they need community, and work is the biggest source of community after college. To me, online college is a complete joke and is not what students after high school need. It&#x27;s just not healthy.  Humans need interaction in person, and they do their best work when they are working with people who they see on a weekly basis, especially young 20-somethings.<p>This whole thing is becoming evident as people are starting to really just not care for the lockdowns at this point. Parks in SF are a complete shitshow because people <i>want</i> to be out and about. You will never be able to force them to be purely remote, and after covid, if your company is purely remote, you will not attract the best young talent, period. You might attract older folks, but you know you want young talent.<p>This whole thing makes no sense.')
