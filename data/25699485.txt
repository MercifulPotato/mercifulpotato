That means unique, distinguishable silhouettes that also tell you at a glance where everything is moving in a shot. Pointy designs make that work excellently.<p>As for the real world: there are plenty designs that are not pointy and flying: every satellite, the ISS, the lunar lander... however, all the designs that interact with earth&#x27;s atmosphere have to respect aerodynamics. Thus, just about every ascent vehicle becomes pointy. Landers are different. The Soyuz return module doesn&#x27;t look particularly pointy, for instance.')
