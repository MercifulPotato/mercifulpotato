Bards Tale had a character loader that would prompt you to insert your character disk to load characters from. It turns out that using other non Bards Tale disks (i.e. &quot;Batman: The Movie&quot;) would yield corrupted characters, some with excess hit points or unusual items which could be given to your existing characters.')
