Most suites I&#x27;ve been in recently are either Linux or their IT departments tell me they&#x27;re planning on moving to windows boxes (two of my regular post houses already have). These are large facilities and the resolve trend is definitely in that direction.<p>In the home market where this might be even more popular (most post facilities and freelance pro colorists already have &quot;secret sauces&quot; that we use regularly), the vast majority are on windows in my experience.<p>There&#x27;s another popular Russian film emulation plugin similar to this that is also Mac only, but they have plans for win&#x2F;linux in the next few months because they&#x27;ve found they are hitting a limit in their potential market.')
