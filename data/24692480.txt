Clearly a hard drive, ram replacement, and video card replacement are acceptable, CPU if it happens to be replaceable, keyboard, mouse, monitor.  Really the only thing that might remain is the motherboard.  But if you kept <i>that</i> and replaced anything else, shouldn&#x27;t that could as still being a Mac?')
