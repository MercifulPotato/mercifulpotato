Exception are: models and global services Ã nd helpers..\nAll the rest is kind of module grouped. And usually modules are dictated by use cases. Users, transactions, function1, function 2... Dont afraid to copy paste code in multiple places. Once it will mature and you will get clarity on functionality you will make it global or semi global and stop asking where to store it. If you don&#x27;t know, then likely you need more time to think about it ;)<p>Of course i admit that always there are situations when you feel sorry for naming it bad.. i.e. db table names.. but thats called expirience.. more years you spent on coding more abstract  and proper name you will give to you class, folder, component, table, module and etc..')
