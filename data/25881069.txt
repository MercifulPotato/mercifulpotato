The Apache Commons OSS project emerged on June 20, 2007 [0] as a way of standardizing the need for reusable Java components and libraries, slowly killing the market of paid components.<p>Or, components are bought as part of an ongoing subscription to a large catalog containing thousands of components [1][2]—think of it as a company-wide Safari Books subscription but for software components.<p>As part of the business model, component designers and developers were paid royalties in additional to the one-time monetary payment for developing each component, with the top 25 royalty earners collectively making as much $458,792.31 over a multi-year period [3].<p>0: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;commons.apache.org&#x2F;charter.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;commons.apache.org&#x2F;charter.html</a><p>1: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;software.topcoder.com&#x2F;catalog&#x2F;c_showroom.jsp" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;software.topcoder.com&#x2F;catalog&#x2F;c_showroom.jsp</a><p>2: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.topcoder.com&#x2F;tc?module=Static&amp;d1=pressroom&amp;d2=pr_021808" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.topcoder.com&#x2F;tc?module=Static&amp;d1=pressroom&amp;d2=pr...</a><p>3: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.topcoder.com&#x2F;tc?module=ComponentRecordbook&amp;c=royalties" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.topcoder.com&#x2F;tc?module=ComponentRecordbook&amp;c=roy...</a>')
