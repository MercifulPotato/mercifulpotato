When it hangs I don’t even have a jumping off point for Google. I can only search “foo hangs during install” which almost always results in issues that are not the problem I’m experiencing because usually the most common reason isn’t the reason the majority of the time. “Foo hangs during ‘reticulating splines’” usually has far more useful results.')
