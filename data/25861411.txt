Item(by='TeMPOraL', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611249857, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25861311, text='Common Lisp had something like this for ages in CL-PPCRE library, with the added benefit of not having to monkey with &quot;.end()&quot; and whatnot, because s-expression syntax guarantees you always know what is enclosed by what.<p>Still, I came to the similar conclusion as you. It&#x27;s sometimes nice to check a descriptive format if needed (CL-PPCRE can take a &quot;standard&quot; regex and translate it to its tree-based verbose notation), but it&#x27;s a chore to type that up and it still requires you to understand how the grammar works. It&#x27;s much easier to work with the standard notation.<p>And I mean - what&#x27;s the big problem here? Regexes are so common and so useful that, in my opinion, any self-respecting developer should learn them to the point they feel comfortable with reading and writing them, with a manual on hand. If you want to make it easier to read, just split it up and comment it, be it with &#x27;x&#x27; modifier or with string concatenation and your programming language&#x27;s native comments.')
