It is metadata and so is the syntax information. It&#x27;s derived from text or from something else (comparison of two text by VCS), but not added there manually. Markup is normally metadata added manually, although a markup language can be used for both manual and automatic metadata.<p>So we have a source and some associated metadata that is crafted manually. I don&#x27;t see this to differ much from other cases when we need to manually sync two distinct files (e.g. C source and header files), so I don&#x27;t quite understand the issue, I guess.')
