Readability is definitely worse when using this method. It doesn&#x27;t mean it can&#x27;t be circumvented with good naming.<p>Overall though this method basically solves the problem with technical debt I described above.<p>The root of all dependencies come from free variables. So if you get rid of free variables and turn your functions into combinators, then all your logic is modular.<p>If you get rid of all variables then all your code has to be combinators.<p>Perhaps the point free style goes to far in terms of readability. Maybe just switching to combinators is a good middle ground. In layman&#x27;s terms for the readers who don&#x27;t understand this means don&#x27;t even use pure functions in classes. Just use functions.')
