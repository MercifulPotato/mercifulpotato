A nuclear power plants scales up or down in less than an hour and works whether it&#x27;s sunny, rainy, snowing, windy or dry. If you build five times more solar panels, you have five time more panels not running when it&#x27;s not sunny. We can&#x27;t store it either, because we would then need to build such large battery farms that it would be both dangerous and impractical. Not to mention that our current batteries have absolutely dreadful efficiencies and lifetimes.<p>Additionally, the current CO2 emissions over the lifetime of a solar panel are absolutely horrendous if you do not live in a place that is sunny most of the time.')
