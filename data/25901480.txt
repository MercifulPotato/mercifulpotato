I guess an analogy could be that depending on the weight distribution and drive train in your car, it will have tendencies to oversteer or understeer when you go too fast into a turn in bad weather, or something. All cars have different behaviours and tendencies in these extreme circumstances.<p>So the 737Max would not &quot;pitch up&quot; in most normal flying, this is under high AoA situations, like a tight overspeed banking turn I think.')
