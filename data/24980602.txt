The systemd-resolved.service itself reads the systemd.network config files. This is what people mean by tightly coupled. But more importantly, you&#x27;re telling me what it does currently, not what it&#x27;s going to do tomorrow.<p>Suppose it did currently only interact through a stable D-Bus interface. What stops them from adding some new interaction and supplementing or replacing the existing one with it? You&#x27;re left with a guarantee that systemd-resolved will continue to support the old API that systemd-networkd may stop using.')
