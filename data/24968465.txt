In the past we just called them crazy people but now &quot;crazy&quot; and &quot;politics&quot; are joined at the hip.  For me it was relatives who started believing 9&#x2F;11 conspiracy theories.  Then Obama was a secret muslim.  Then climate change was a &quot;China hoax&quot;.  Then came rants against vaccinations.  Today, masks are a democrat tool to wipe out old people.  The final inevitable descent into madness will be flat earth.  That hasn&#x27;t come to them yet but it will.  Not wanting to witness that final plunge, a few years ago some of the younger members of the family actively disconnected from them.  We do not invite them to family gatherings and stay away from those at which they may appear.<p>It is a cliche, but it is about the kids.  We don&#x27;t want the new generation hearing speeches about how chinese people are out to destroy democracy, or how teachers are all liars because schools teach &quot;the climate hoax&quot;.  There is only so much crazy we can mitigate.')
