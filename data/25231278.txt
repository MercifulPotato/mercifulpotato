That might be the movement that spurs public interest for things like this app. I&#x27;m not sure of the quality of the original stock film, but it could be used to make a new high def release. I actually convinced my instructor in undergrad to show it for a &quot;history of science&quot; course. Perhaps the BBC could officially open up the rights entirely so that it can be used as a general teaching tool (might be near impossible - but the music, often a major rights hurdle for these aged rereleases, seems like it was all originally composed for the show). I would love a video like this to be augmented - something akin to the pop-up video series. You could link or show associated information during playback. I actually had something like that as part of my Master&#x27;s thesis final project. It could potentially be an engaging learn-from-home project.')
