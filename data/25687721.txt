It also varies a bit by team, but I&#x27;ve worked on many teams over the last 5.5 years here, so I have a decent perspective on what&#x27;s normal and how things evolved to this point.<p>Engineering is distributed around the world, so it happens in a highly asynchronous way centered around GitHub issues, the vast majority of which are in public repos. Slack and Zoom are used, but if they&#x27;re used to make decisions, the recording is saved for others to consume and the decision is documented on GitHub.<p>Meetings are discouraged, but not non-existent. To give some context, I&#x27;m a manager of two teams and this week I had 4.5 hours of meetings (including 1:1s), which is pretty normal. When I was an independent contributor on a single team, I often had weeks where I had a single 30 minute meeting.<p>In practice today, I suspect an engineer at Elastic will spend an average of ~2 hours a week in a meeting, with a few spending a great deal more than that and others spending less.<p>This culture is demonstrated top-down and has been a common thread from the early days, through the IPO, and continues today.<p>Edit: We also have a general philosophy of features being done when they&#x27;re done rather than when we reach some arbitrary date. This doesn&#x27;t mean we don&#x27;t have timelines (we have ~2 month long release cycles), but if we can pair down scope to make a release, we will, and if we can&#x27;t do it then we&#x27;ll just move the feature to the next release instead.<p>We&#x27;ve codified a lot of the philosophy that feeds into this workflow here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.elastic.co&#x2F;about&#x2F;our-source-code" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.elastic.co&#x2F;about&#x2F;our-source-code</a>')
