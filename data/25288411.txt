Item(by='Timpy', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607000681, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25282504, text='My point is more related to kanji learners than it is kanji etymology.  I understand that some things have etymological meaning, but it&#x27;s much more useful to me as a learner to just see it as a pictograph.  It&#x27;s pretty common for learners to make a mnemonic out of the kanji and tie it to the kanji&#x27;s meaning.<p>木 is a great intro kanji because it simply means &quot;tree&quot; and if you let yourself believe it looks like a tree it&#x27;s easier to remember.  You can start playing with combos like 林 meaning &quot;woods&quot; and 森 meaning &quot;forest&quot;.<p>相 is a combination of 木 and 目, tree and eye.  The article pinpoints its meaning as &quot;physiognomy&quot;.  相 is an extremely common kanji.  My translations may be a little awkward, but these words are more frequent in Japanese than my translations might suggest:<p>相手 Tree-eye, hand: &quot;the person you&#x27;re talking to&quot;<p>相談 Tree-eye, conversation: &quot;consultation, getting advice from someone&quot;<p>首相 Neck, tree-eye: &quot;Prime Minister&quot;<p>相撲 Tree-eye, slap: &quot;Sumo wrestling&quot;<p>It&#x27;s really hard to pin down the meaning of this particular kanji.  Eventually I realized I was missing the 森 for the 木.  &quot;Physiognomy&quot; is basically meaningless to me as an English speaker&#x2F;Japanese learner because now I have to work to remember the English meaning as well.   I decided to stop thinking of this kanji &quot;physiognomy&quot; and start thinking of it as &quot;tree-eye&quot;.  Tackling large problems systematically is exciting for me but I have to remind myself &quot;making mnemonics for each kanji&quot; is not the goal, &quot;being able to enjoy myself while immersing in Japanese text&quot; is.')
