And even if you worked in a different part of the company, you weren&#x27;t allowed to contribute to or participate in other peoples&#x27; game-related projects unless everyone involved worked for Amazon, and if you did work on a game side project (which Amazon would own,) it had to use AWS for its online features.<p>That&#x27;s not how you hire creative talent. It felt insulting, and I think their pearl-clutching put off the sort of people who might have been able to make them some real hits. Their failure to break into the industry does not surprise me; it always had a painfully stodgy &quot;hello, fellow kids&quot; kind of feel.')
