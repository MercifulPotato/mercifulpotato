I remember a person creating short term virtual holographic keyboards and reconfiguring them along progressing with some task, traveling in space. The author of it? - I&#x27;m not sure yet - could be Orson Scott Card?<p>I guess that boring patent could be about simulating such keyboards on some displays - and there no need for that: you can get same result with state of art (in SF) just closing one eye and adjusting POV.<p>Projection keyboards are available already and can provide feedback like displaying adjusted layout. Is this patent about not allowing to configure them?<p>The case that pressing a key result in displaying set of other options which you can press too it&#x27;s called a menu in UI and is already mostly being made on pixel arrays (like touchscreens) and you can have different menus with different tools for different tasks.')
