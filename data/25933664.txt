So coming onboard can involve a lot of what amounts to mind reading.  Sometimes things that actually are not the least bit obvious seem obvious to the senior person, so they may indicate (inadvertently) in their tone of response to a question about them that it was a dumb question.  And so that makes the new dev try harder to figure out what the assumptions are without asking.')
