The code was pretty simple if you&#x27;ve ever written a maze-solving algorithm.\n(Hint: What happens if you follow either side of wall for the entire maze?)<p>In theory, this would be useful for truck drivers or prioritizing passenger pickup locations.<p>But now, I use it as an example of overengineering and overoptimization.<p>In practice, the main concern should be reducing cognitive load on the driver. Additional instructions, rules that can be potentially broken, inconsistencies in logic, all of it poses a substantial risk.')
