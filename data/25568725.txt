I assume that your other more technically detailed posts are also very valuable to the experts on the field, but it&#x27;s great that you shared something like this that&#x27;s more accessible to people with less knowledge on the topic. I can only hope that if more people understand the challenges involved in a field, maybe it will also become easier to get them on board and be more open minded and less reluctant to change when new solutions are explored and transitions are needed to continue making progress.')
