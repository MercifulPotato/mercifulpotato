Item(by='ska', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603998203, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24934004, text='&quot;nominal&quot; billable time, so it&#x27;s a combination of things but also included client ability to pay, client acquisition costs (depending on speciality, consults may be free for example), etc.<p>I think time estimation is pretty hard in a lot of legal work also, you may be prepped for 60 hours work over then next two weeks and then a client phone call derails it entirely.  It&#x27;s not always easy to replace that time.')
