Honestly, the `--HEAD` part may not even be needed anymore.<p>Realize the problem with homebrew isn&#x27;t brew itself right now on the M1. I have absolutely zero doubt (go read the issues) the maintainers want to support it properly and be done with this kind of noise. The reason they can&#x27;t or don&#x27;t is because a lot of shit is broken <i>still</i>. They can&#x27;t safely let you go all willis-nillis installing ARM packages because they&#x27;re broken.<p>Installing stuff from source, yourself, isn&#x27;t hard if it&#x27;s going to actually work... 99% of it boils down to:<p>1. git clone whatever_it_is\n2. .&#x2F;configure --prefix=&#x2F;usr&#x2F;local&#x2F;bin\n3. make\n4. make install')
