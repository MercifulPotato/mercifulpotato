Dozens of millions of Americans have lost faith in the 2020 election. The only concern from my perspective is to stop the obvious bleeding: we must stop the false anti-election rhetoric before it poisons the minds of even more.<p>The lies are winning right now. Be it masks, election fraud, mail-in ballots, or whatever. My sister&#x27;s father in law believes that COVID is a hoax, I have coworkers who don&#x27;t think masks help and my mom thinks Obama is a Muslim born in Kenya. I&#x27;ve seen enough lies, and I&#x27;ve lost faith that these people can have their vision cleared with the truth. My sister thinks the vaccine may hurt more than it may help and is avoiding the vaccine.<p>Its clear that misinformation is running amok and nothing is stopping it. The naive &quot;debate with them&quot; perspective goes literally no where, have you ever tried?')
