People are usually placed on the dev list if they don&#x27;t meet expectations, and placed on a PIP if their performance does not improve. I&#x27;m guessing it reflects poorly on managers if they devlist someone shortly after hiring them.<p>During my time at Amazon, I know only one person who was placed on a PIP and he was kind of a bad engineer. But I have heard stories of managers abusing the dev list to meet org-level dev list quotas.')
