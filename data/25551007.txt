I don’t think they will take advantage, not for a decade or three minimum. The Tories were foolish enough that they thought Brexit was a path to prosperity to begin with, and Labour is allergic to anything not owned by the state, at some points proposing expropriations in the power sector which were exciting enough to get pension funds to move money to special vehicles in Asia with treaties saying the UK won’t expropriate their holdings.<p>The biggest macro thing would be free trade treaties with markets like the US and Asia (obviously including China, but elsewhere too) and streamlining regulatory standards to be efficient - not to be all “oh no the big capitalists will exploit everyone,” just better targeted and less bureaucratic; you can glimpse this in the way the UK was first to approve vaccines for covid.<p>But all that has to compete with maintaining trade access to the EU and that’s a huge barrier if it remains and a huge loss if it doesn’t.<p>What’s supposed to make startups and tech more competitive there now? Maybe if the Euro collapses in a banking crisis somehow (?!?) but I’m not seeing it.')
