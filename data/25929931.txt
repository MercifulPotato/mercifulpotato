The CBO shows them mostly as flat since 2002. And while net interest may have stayed flat recently that is because interest rates are historically low. We are borrowing more money than ever.<p>See <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cbo.gov&#x2F;publication&#x2F;56910" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cbo.gov&#x2F;publication&#x2F;56910</a><p>Debt as a % of GDP has been rising since 2000. Our ability to fund our government has been lacking every year since 2001, typically with a deficit each year between $500B and  1.5T a year. We are fortunate to have super low interest rates so that our net interest payments stay low while we spend an incredible amount of money we don&#x27;t have. Part of the health of the economy now depends on excess government spending (which we can&#x27;t raise enough revenue to fund). So when interest rates rise, which they will do in time, our net interest payments will rise as well.<p>While our net interest payments rise, our ability to cut government spending or raise taxes seems unlikely to be able to match it. Furthermore, your assertions that economic growth will cover the rise in interest payments does not seem to be a given to me. We have had solid economic growth over the last 20 years, however, our ability to fund our government spending has not changed at all. See the year after year deficits we always run.<p>CBO estimates that by the end of the decade, net interest payments will double compared to today, reflecting the thought that we are enjoying historically low rates currently: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cbo.gov&#x2F;publication&#x2F;56542" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cbo.gov&#x2F;publication&#x2F;56542</a>')
