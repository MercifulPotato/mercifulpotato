These machines use the same batteries as every other piece of contemporary tech.<p>Spot can walk about for 90 minutes top and the more it needs to do (e.g. running additional sensors, performing autonomous functions, etc.), the shorter its battery life will be (I&#x27;d guess around an hour is more realistic).<p>Bipedal prototypes like Atlas wouldn&#x27;t last that long.
