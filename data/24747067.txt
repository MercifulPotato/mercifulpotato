My understanding is that the web version (the only cross-platform option, with app support on mobile devices) is not really equivalent to the desktop version (it&#x27;s more equivalent to Memrise or Anki, lacks the incremental reading and other features).<p>And that was a non-option when Anki was created many years ago. At least Anki has plugins, though, which let you add quite a few capabilities to it bringing it more in line with SuperMemo.')
