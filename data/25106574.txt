Packages target x86-64 microprocessors to assist performance on modern hardware. A ports&#x2F;ebuild-like system is also provided for automated source compilation, known as the Arch Build System.[28]</i><p><i>Arch Linux focuses on simplicity of design, meaning that the main focus involves creating an environment that is straightforward and relatively easy for the user to understand directly, rather than providing polished point-and-click style management tools â€” the package manager, for example, does not have an official graphical front-end. This is largely achieved by encouraging the use of succinctly commented, clean configuration files that are arranged for quick access and editing.[29] This has earned it a reputation as a distribution for &quot;advanced users&quot; who are willing to use the command line.[30]</i><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Arch_Linux" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Arch_Linux</a><p>And then on the other end you have Distro&#x27;s like Mint, or Ubuntu:<p><i>Mint is designed for ease of use and a ready-to-roll out-of-box experience, including multimedia support on desktops. The operating system is easier to install than most Linux distributions. Mint includes software required for e-mail and online functionality as well as support for multimedia content, whether online or from a user&#x27;s own files and physical media</i><p><i>There are several different desktop editions of Mint, including Cinnamon, GNOME, XFCE and KDE, to best support various hardware. The operating system is also provided in an alternate Linux Mint Debian Edition for those that are more familiar with Linux. That edition is said to be less intuitive and user-friendly but also faster and more responsive.</i><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Linux_Mint" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Linux_Mint</a><p>I started with KDE, then went to Mint, Ubuntu, and some other distros like Manjaro that I&#x27;ve been tinkering with lately.<p>You can see a good list of all the distro&#x27;s here (current and upcoming):<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;distrowatch.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;distrowatch.com&#x2F;</a>')
