Like most other console PPUs of it&#x27;s day, due to bandwidth&#x2F;etc the normal &#x27;flow&#x27; is to have a background and a series of &#x27;character&#x27; sprites preloaded into VRAM and then shuffled around (this is why in some &#x27;busy&#x27; games you would see clipping or game elements disappear on early consoles; too many sprite objects for the PPU to keep track of.)<p>To that same end, I&#x27;d be curious to see what could be done like this on Genesis&#x2F;Mega Drive hardware')
