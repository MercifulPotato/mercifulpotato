I&#x27;ve never really fought with &quot;cpan&quot; but have had huge fights with node and python packages.<p>The old school &quot;cpan&quot; command has not been recommended to be used for nearly a decade now. Maybe that is your issue?<p>Everyone just uses cpan-minus: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;cpanmin.us&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;cpanmin.us&#x2F;</a> or &quot;cpanm&quot;. It will install anything, if you have write access to the installed perl location, it will install globally, otherwise it installs packages into &quot;~&#x2F;perl5&quot; then just do something like &quot;export PERL5LIB=~&#x2F;perl5&#x2F;lib&#x2F;perl5&#x2F;&quot; in your bashrc.<p>Or maybe you are talking about having to compile code in certain packages? Alot of stuff using ssl has C code which links against openssl which is always a pain.<p>Not sure what other issues you might be alluding to... There are some &quot;packaging&quot; tools to try to bundle and pin libraries, kind of like venv for python. I&#x27;ve never messed with them though. We just compile the latest perl binary and install all our needed cpan modules globally. Never worry about pinning since nothing is ever updated on cpan anymore...')
