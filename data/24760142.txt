I submitted it 6 days ago, but it didn&#x27;t get much attention. Unlike the author&#x27;s method of manually setting up shortcuts for the most used words, ibus-typing-booster learns your most frequent words and then it&#x27;s just a matter of typing a few chars followed by space, which inserts the whole word.')
