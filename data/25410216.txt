The dashed line (which indicates where cars are supposed to cross over the sharrows) are way too late. If you actually crossed at the marked location, you would barely have enough time to make the on-ramp. And that&#x27;s under ideal circumstances â€” if the pavement is wet or you&#x27;re in a top-heavy vehicle, it would be very unsafe to wait until the dashed lines appear.<p>I actually once saw someone cross at the dashed lines and then take the on-ramp, and my first reaction was &quot;whoa, that guy just careened across traffic to make his exit&quot;. Then I realized that he had actually waited for the dashed lines to appear. But when you do this (locals don&#x27;t), it makes you look like a lunatic.')
