I have been really trying to get better at emacs, for example, but it still feels clunky a lot of the time so I only use it for org-mode. I also switched to VS Code and honestly don&#x27;t see what the hype is about - but does that mean I just need more training? From who? (&quot;If brute force isn&#x27;t working, use more of it!&quot;)<p>Hardware: I bought a gamer laptop (for use with Ubuntu) recently because it had a GPU, but was shocked to discover that I never got used to the keyboard. Again, I thought that I would get better, but it really hasn&#x27;t. Fortunately, my Kenesis keyboard &#x2F;was&#x2F; something with a continuously rising learning curve (I&#x27;m not hopeless, contra the evidence above!)  But now I&#x27;m doing a lot of work in Looker which tries to do extraordinary things in the browser, but brings my machine to a crawl. My Mac-using coworker says it&#x27;s less of an issue for him, but I can&#x27;t quite bear to drop $2k just for that one application. That said, the value-of-my-time-over-1y calculation suggests I should. But does &quot;good computer&quot; just mean a Mac?<p>Monitor: What would be a good monitor buying guide? I&#x27;m happy with mine now but don&#x27;t know what any of the specs mean for the future<p>Chair: This is like the definition of &quot;YMMV&quot; but how would you go about evaluating chairs, esp in the covid era?<p>Standing desk: I&#x27;ve been procrastinating on this one because while I understand how to measure things, I foresee myself visiting a half dozen diffent sites with different ways of representing the size&#x2F;specs of their desks and getting pretty overwhelmed. And that would be the hardest thing to return.<p>Quality noise cancelling headphones: OK I guess I have no excuse here.<p>Thanks again, you&#x27;ve already forced me to think through several mental blocks and realize they are real but entirely surmountable. Any answers (from anyone) to the questions above would also be appreciated!')
