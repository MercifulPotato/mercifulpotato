The following are all ways you can stand out for a junior position:<p>- Attending a university that is hard to get into and has a strong CS program<p>- Having an impressive GPA<p>- Winning academic or software-related awards<p>- Having commendable accomplishments in software-related &quot;extracurriculars&quot;, such as hackathons etc<p>- Whiteboard coding ability<p>I&#x27;ve done numerous junior interviews for FANG companies.
