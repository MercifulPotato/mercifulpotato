Like, I didn&#x27;t make up the shit about pizzas, man. Sometimes some things are just fact.<p>I&#x27;m sure it must be very convincing that I am in cahoots with CNN weather because we both think it&#x27;s a sunny day in San Francisco today. Or maybe Big Calendar and I are conspiring to decide that today is Nov 15, a Saturday. After all, we&#x27;re saying the same thing. Coincidence? I THINK NOT!<p>And who cares if <i>you</i> don&#x27;t believe any of this. It doesn&#x27;t really matter. The SNR is everything. One guy here or there is a speck of dust on the vinyl.<p>Now, if you&#x27;ll excuse me, I have to go attend to my master. His nictitating membrane is giving him some trouble this morning.
