It&#x27;s increasingly common for security-conscious organizations to watermark documents to identify who accessed it. See, for instance, how the Intercept &quot;accidentally&quot; burnt a source by publishing her raw documents about Russian meddling in the 2016 election.<p>That said, the New York Times has some level of credibility, and the Post doesn&#x27;t. You can&#x27;t simply demand that the Post be treated with a level of respect just because you agree with its slant. Perhaps if the Post published the email metadata which would instantly prove authenticity I&#x27;d feel a bit worse for it. Until then, though, I&#x27;ll continue to assume it&#x27;s just trying to launder a smear campaign, whether that smear campaign originated from foreign intelligence services or domestic slimeball political operatives.')
