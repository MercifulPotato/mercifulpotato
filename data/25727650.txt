You could have a mangled connector with poor quality cabling and in the worst case, the image would degrade, have ghosting and maybe miss a color channel or two, but you could still get your message on screen since the analog receiver will try to lock on to any signal it gets regardless of how poor the quality is, while with digital, it either works or it doesn&#x27;t, there&#x27;s no middle ground, and with connectors that have seen much usage it tends to not work more often than it does. If the protocol handshake or something else fails from the start it&#x27;s game over. Analog degrades much more gracefully.')
