In theory a display ad network has all the user web browsing behavior so should have a good user profile. So the ads should be almost as targeted. However the ad format is very different and I believe that benefits Facebook greatly in terms of smaller businesses (more constrained creative so less work, interactive, can respond to users, etc.).<p>edit: Also, a display ad shown across the web will never blend in with the style of every webpage it&#x27;s shown on while a Facebook ad will inherently do so.')
