As I understood it, the dock randomly switches between different voltages depending on load, while portable mode uses plain old USB-PD with a consistent charge. While you can use the dock with Apple&#x27;s 61W charger, it&#x27;s not really recommended, since it can still get bricked with a software update. The 87W&#x2F;96W charger isn&#x27;t safe for the dock at all.')
