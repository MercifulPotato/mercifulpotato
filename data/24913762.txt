Item(by='webmaven', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603846199, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24909856, text='Dunbar&#x27;s number isn&#x27;t about &quot;strong personal connections&quot;, it is the approximate number of people that the human mind can keep track of in terms of their identity and relationship to you (and vice versa) and to each other[0].<p>Anyway. If you expect everyone in an organization to have strong interpersonal relationships with each other, you&#x27;d probably top out at something like a dozen at most, and that&#x27;s really pushing it. Eight or nine is a lot more reasonable, which, coincidentally, is about the size of a two-pizza team.<p>If you use the &quot;two-pizza team&quot; as an organizing principle (assuming a balanced tree), you can extend this to eight teams of eight, plus their eight managers, plus a ceo, with a total of 73 people, which is probably the point where relationship fatigue sets in and you can&#x27;t claim to know everyone in the org even casually, unless you start dropping external relationships and the company <i>is</i> your social circle.<p>[0] If any. Just because two people both know you doesn&#x27;t imply that they know each other. But <i>if</i> they do, you would probably know that and know what their relationship was. If everyone in the group had non-trivial connections to everyone else, the number of relationships in a group of 150 is over 11k.')
