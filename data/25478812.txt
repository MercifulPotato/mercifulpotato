It&#x27;s a form of &quot;charity tax&quot; that depends on wealth. However, your scenario does not hold, the government will not force you to sell your company or any shares it in, because those are not subject to Zakat (at least not directly). Gold and silver over a minimum amount are taxed at 2.5% per Hijri year, while produce is taxed at a different percentage.<p>Taxation of company shares depends on many things, such as the debt ratio and value of products the company owns. It&#x27;s very possible to owe only a tiny amount, or none at all, while still doing business and making money. This is the superior approach which has proven to work if you look at history.')
