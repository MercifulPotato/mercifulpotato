Haskell is such a fundamental shift in thinking, perhaps the only way to learn real application is to make something with it. But I would still maintain every language at least has a highly simplistic example of why certain features work well. In fact, my curiosity reignited by this discussion, I found this video series[1] on youtube which somehow made is 100x more clear where Functors, Applicatives and Monads are to be used. The tree example is pretty abstract, but it helped me connect these features to my work. I still don&#x27;t know how to get most use out of it, but I think I get the USP. Still have the question about how haskell is helping here, because I can write a hidden state changing function in Julia if I want.
