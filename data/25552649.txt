A Docker container is designed to ignore the system and builds its own environment.<p>If you run a Docker container on a Mac or Windows, you are now running 3 operating systems. The host OS, the VM, and the Docker image.<p>This is not the same as a Mac App. Literally, figuratively, or hypothetically.')
