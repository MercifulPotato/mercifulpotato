Not once. Not twice. 38 times. There are clips of him condemning white supremacy as way back as 2000s when he wanted to run for President through a Reform Party ticket but instead decided to abort it last minute when he came to know that David Duke joined the party. Please tell me why Trump needs to condemn white supremacy 38 times and still be called a racist while Biden gets a free pass? Let us be frank here: you have an opinion of Trump based on what media has portrayed him to be rather than actually having done your own research. Or maybe you just hate the guy which is perfectly fine. But you can&#x27;t say that he only condemned when he received backlash. He literally quit a Presidential race when he came to know that David Duke joined the Reform Party for Heaven&#x27;s sake! What more condemnation do you need?<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Bd0cMmBvqWc" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Bd0cMmBvqWc</a><p>&gt; The old adage is than when white supremacists believe youâ€™re one of them you might as well be.<p>Biden sang eulogies for an actual KKK recruiter who was incidentally also a Democrat Senator and not one media house took Biden to task the way they did Trump. Heck, even the current Vice President Kamala Harris called Biden a racist on the Presidential Primary Stage! Then she happily went along with him as the VP candidate!<p>But yes, orange man bad!')
