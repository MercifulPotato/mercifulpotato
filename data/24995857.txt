Item(by='wahern', descendants=None, kids=[24996105], score=None, time=1604553399, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24995586, text='&gt; The parties never address or even acknowledge the criticisms about them.<p>The Democratic party did address and acknowledge criticisms in 2016, which is why the party leadership put their thumbs on the scales for Clinton over Sanders. Indeed, it&#x27;s why they have super delegates to begin with--to prevent a Trump-like nominee. But doing that burned them.<p>The Republican leadership also tried to push back against Trump, at least very early on, but everybody fell into line fairly quickly once it became clear Trump was the front-runner.<p>At the end of the day a party can&#x27;t simply wish away its fringe subgroups. At best it can occasionally give their leaders a cold shoulder, like Pelosi did with Ocasio-Cortez.  For Democrats the cancel culture fringe and (much larger) equality-in-outcome movements cause tremendous difficulty in keeping moderates from straying, yet there&#x27;s no easy way to assuage those moderates&#x27; fears.<p>The Republicans can keep winning with their white majoritarian populism even in a diverse America because the criteria for being &quot;white&quot; is rather flexible, especially for non-African Americans. For the plurality of Americans who have very short term memories, and who perceive everything as a zero sum game, the easiest default choice is choose what would be good for the &quot;white&quot; majority, or at least what they image it as. So long as minorities, particularly latino and asian, make <i>some</i> minimal progress--and with a growing share of the population that&#x27;s inevitable--the GOP can continue to coast on their fear, uncertainty, and doubt strategy. &quot;White&quot; and majority will be synonymous in perpetuity. Republicans don&#x27;t have to change, and with Trump they finally figured that out.<p>People keep repeating this mantra that the parties don&#x27;t reflect the majority of Americans when what they really mean is that the parties don&#x27;t reflect their own concept of America and American sentiments, and their own <i>particular</i> <i>set</i> of preferences. Even when we can all agree on general goals--liberty &amp; justice for all--what matters are the particulars, and Americans have pretty radical and divergent ideas about the particulars. For example, most people agree we need stronger job security, especially for blue collar, semi-skilled labor. But the word &quot;union&quot; has become a dirty word even among many Democrats, and conservatives have preferences for &quot;less regulation&quot; and the &quot;free market&quot; at least as strong as they do for job security, preferences which are fundamentally contradictory.')
