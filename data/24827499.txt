Some years ago I visited a home in the U.S. southwest where the owner complained that they were the surprise victim of a flood within a year of purchasing the house. It seems that they had no idea that their house was positioned in the dead center of a wash. I don&#x27;t think they even knew what a &quot;wash&quot; was. Even after the flood.<p>I took them outside and pointed to the road coming to their driveway.<p>Me: &quot;See that embankment you come down about 40 feet from your driveway?&quot;<p>Them: &quot;Uh-huh.&quot;<p>Me: Turning to the left, &quot;See that embankment that goes up about 50 feet past the other side of your house?&quot;<p>Them: &quot;Yeah...&quot;<p>Me: &quot;Doesn&#x27;t it kind of look like two river banks with no water in between?&quot;<p>Them:&quot;Umm... But there _is_ no water.&quot;<p>Me: &quot;That&#x27;s because it hasn&#x27;t rained in over 100 days. 360 days a year, this will be dusty dry.&quot;<p>Them: &quot;Exactly&quot;<p>Me: &quot;There are more than 360 days in a year.&quot;<p>Sometimes, nobody thought to warn you because it was painfully obvious. Like the rattles on a snake. Unless you&#x27;ve never heard of a rattlesnake before.')
