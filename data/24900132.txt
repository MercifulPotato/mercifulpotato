Item(by='ch4s3', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603740118, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24899695, text='&gt; Separately I view Twitter as breaking section 230 free speech regulatory agreements in meddling with what they &#x27;publish&#x27;<p>Section 230 isn&#x27;t an agreement, it&#x27;s a section of the Communication Decency Act.[1] There is no prohibition on the publisher &quot;meddling&quot;, or moderating. Section 230 was specifically carved out to encourage voluntary content moderation on the nascent internet.<p>It states that hosting or republishing someone else&#x27;s speech does not make you the speaker, even if you moderate. Which is to say that just because Twitter locks down accounts or stops a link from being shared, they still are not the Speaker (legally) of anything their users post. That&#x27;s it, that basically the whole thing.<p>[1]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eff.org&#x2F;issues&#x2F;cda230" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eff.org&#x2F;issues&#x2F;cda230</a>')
