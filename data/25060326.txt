For a single term, Google translate returns all possible translations of a word and then it gets hard to choose which translation best fits our required context.<p>For example, the word &quot;Save&quot; is used for saving a file or some data. But it also has other meanings depending on the context. Then it gets hard to choose which translation suits our use case.<p>With Open Translation, I want to make i18n easy by listing accurate and verified translations for commonly used phrases and terms in software, such as error messages, buttons, labels, etc.')
