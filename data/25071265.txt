REI, for instance, organizes events sometimes free or low cost. You can meet people through that and start doing more hiking or camping outside the REI (or whatever org you start with) events.<p>And try to become the organizer of events. That was when my social life really turned around. I stopped waiting for invites, and started doing the inviting. In my prior city there was a First Friday event downtown with lots of live music and art shows. I&#x27;d invite people out. Or I&#x27;d organize a dinner and a movie night. I know a lot of these things aren&#x27;t feasible right now, but as you start to build up a social network, consider doing this. It&#x27;s a lot more  pleasant (be prepared for some events to fail) to have made the plans (be it a pickup soccer game, a hike or camping trip, a night out on the town, a board game night in) than to be waiting for others to make them for you.')
