For example I would prefer to add anti pollution systems to my paint factory, because I live in town too, and I just don&#x27;t want to pollute.  It would raise the price of my paint $1&#x2F;gal, and not enough customers will chose a product just because it polluted less.  Many of my competitors feel the same.  If we all do it everybody benefits and nobody suffers relative to their competition.  This is even more important in cases where the customer <i>can&#x27;t</i> signal through the market, e.g. electricity generation.  These can benefit incumbents but not necessarily hurt new entrants, especially when they are cap ex rather than op ex (e.g. minimum wage rather than an additional piece of equipment).<p>There are many bad examples as well, some of which raise a floor asymmetrically.  For example FB, or at least their CEO, is willing to have the CDA&#x27;s section 230 abolished because they have such a dominant customer base and enough cash that they believe they would be able to afford to do the resulting government mandated controls and fight any lawsuits, while a new entrant would not.')
