Biologists are not seeking to &quot;establish&quot; it, but to refine it and place it in context with evolution by sexual selection, by genetic drift, by mutualism, and by other influences less well characterized, not least epigenetics, which acts at the scale of individuals.<p>I.e., lots of &quot;mechanisms&quot; are known. None contradicts any other. What mix is responsible for a change is often hard to tease out.<p>Darwin wrote about both natural selection and sexual selection.
