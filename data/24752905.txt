If your motivation comes directly from learning the concept itself, you may be right that studying it directly is more effective. But for many, trying to do that because it&#x27;s &quot;better&quot; will lead to worse outcomes when they end up not completing the study.<p>Calling it &quot;an excuse to slack off&quot; ignores that different people&#x27;s motivations are different.
