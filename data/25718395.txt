They use the programming language and tooling they&#x27;re familiar with. I do also wish that there wasn&#x27;t so much of a move to webify everything, particularly since web dev is so prone to constantly changing fads and dependency sprawl. It tends to lead to code&#x2F;software that breaks all the time.')
