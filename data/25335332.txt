Their dominance in their sectors seem more resulting from, if anything specific to point to, legal factors, than geography or any particular natural resource&#x2F;phenomenon.<p>Why make movies and software in California, one in the south and the other a bit more north?<p>The founding of Hollywood was just as random as the events that &quot;caused&quot; the rise of the Valley. What if Griffith had gone elsewhere? What if Edison hadn&#x27;t enforced his patents, causing the exodus across the country to make movies out of his purview? Similar climate&#x2F;environs&#x2F;affordability elsewhere, why not AZ, NM, TX, GA, FL?<p>This is a lot different than, say, the reasons for North Carolina to eventually beat New England in textile production, or why the Rust Belt is where it is, or why rail and shipbuilding was big in the Northeast but not so much space and auto manufacturing. It&#x27;s more like why the appliances that are made in the U.S. are mostly made in the south.')
