Many people are willing to help in my experience but either don&#x27;t because of lethargy or fear.<p>For example, some people in an estate in London got together and started planting flowerbeds to make the estate look really nice. Because everyone was involved, you can imagine what happened when some people from another estate came to damage it (hint, the locals stood up for themselves and their hard work).<p>Work out what makes your neighbourhood &quot;most dangerous&quot; and target some of that. Perhaps lobby for more streetlights, clean up some areas, pool some cash to help fix up someone&#x27;s house.')
