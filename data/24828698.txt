When I feel good, I read what I wrote when I wasn&#x27;t and reflect.  Next time I&#x27;m feeling not well, reading how I dealt with the situation in the past helps me from dwelling on negative thoughts.<p>* I make notes about effective actions that help me feel better (physically and mentally) so I can take action without thinking too much.<p>* I write about what I want to do do in the future when I am feeling better.  This helps to keep me positive and also helps me make effective use of the good times.<p>For context, I have to deal with eczema that can get pretty bad at times.')
