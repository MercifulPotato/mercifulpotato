Cloud hosting was a way out of that conundrum.<p>But surely it&#x27;s only a conundrum if the primary goal of a software project is for a single company that has the same name as the software project to exclusively make money by selling hosting and&#x2F;or support for that software <i>while still using an open source license to attract a community of developers to work for you for free</i>. I&#x27;d argue that this conundrum is easily resolvable: either have an open source software project for which anyone can sell support and hosting, or have a software company that develops proprietary software and sells it and related services.')
