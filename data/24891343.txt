SML&#x2F;NJ does support this as an extension but since no other implementation does you effectively can&#x27;t use it if you want decent performance (that SML&#x2F;NJ doesn&#x27;t really give).<p>I&#x27;m also pretty jealous of OCaml&#x27;s modular implicits, just because it saves you typing the module name before an operator (i.e. MyModule.+ vs just + implied by context).<p>It also kinda sucks that operator precedence is defined at the module level and cannot be exported. You have to always redefine a library&#x27;s operator precedence yourself.')
