I don&#x27;t fully understand how the previous section creates a requirement to use deterministic programs, so I could use more explanation on how that requirement is established.<p>Second, a very simple concrete example of what one of these programs would look like would be immensely helpful. After re-reading the article a bit I have a mental image of a program that contains a long, compressed string and a decompression algorithm that somehow models the system you&#x27;re interested in. I can imagine how you might get a useful interpretation of probability from the decompression system, but there are enough open questions there that I&#x27;m not sure I have the correct interpretation.<p>Hope that helps!')
