Imagine if noone was saving money (or if it ignorable), this spending you get has to come from somewhere, so you need to cut something to spend on my widget.<p>Actually, savings are at an all-time high right now. People aren&#x27;t spending because they&#x27;re waiting for the pandemic to be over. It&#x27;s true that the poor are living paycheck-to-paycheck, but that&#x27;s generally true in normal times as well. In the pandemic, more people have become poor, but by no means has literally everyone become poor. Most people are still working, and the ones who are working, are saving.<p>Even in normal years, when the economy is good, there are always people saving.')
