Dakboard works as a SaaS solution without their custom hardware, the free option is way too limited. HA is more for home automation though and Magic Mirror&#x27;s actual purpose is to mount the display behind a two-way mirror (thus the &quot;Magic&quot; part)<p>I&#x27;ve got a cheapo chinese dual boot Atom Windows&#x2F;Android tablet mounted on my kitchen wall with an analog clock, our shared family calendar, Netatmo data (indoor+outdoor) and weather forecast. Works like a charm.<p>If it wasn&#x27;t so crappy I could use something like Kiosk Browser[1] to have it use the front-facing camera and only turn the display on when it detects motion. Now I just use Tasker to turn the display off at night and dim it during evenings.<p>A bunch of people are just mounting old computer monitors on the wall and using a Rasperry Pi (Zero&#x2F;2&#x2F;3&#x2F;4) as a kiosk-browser. The Wife Acceptance Factor is a bit lower on those though. Most likely you&#x27;d need to disassemble the display and add some fancy frames.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;apps&#x2F;details?id=de.ozerov.fully&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=US" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;apps&#x2F;details?id=de.ozerov.full...</a>')
