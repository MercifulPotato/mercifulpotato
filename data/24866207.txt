But that’s almost always because the designer had to resolve some ambiguities present in the <i>grammar</i>.<p>The question is, did the designer resolve them deliberately or accidentally? And were they resolved in an ergonomic way?<p>The grammar fragment “expr :: IF expr THEN expr ELSE expr” is ambiguous. If I write a statement like the example, I expect (from 60 years of language tradition and simple ergonomics) a language author to choose to resolve that ambiguity by associating an ELSE with the nearest IF. Telling your puzzled users “it’s not ambiguous, it <i>always</i> goes with the farthest IF!” isn’t going to make them happier. It also won’t work to say “well, + has higher precedence than &#x2F;, but that’s OK, it <i>always</i> does that”. Those are just bugs in the language design caused by a bad resolution of ambiguity.<p>If you use a tool to flag the ambiguities in your grammar, then you can be sure all the resolutions in your parser are deliberate and not accidental.')
