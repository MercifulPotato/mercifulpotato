Others have suggested creating &#x27;art&#x27; but, personally I find a phone screen far too small for drawing on.<p>If you want to &#x27;create&#x27; with your phone, why not use the feature it has which is actually as good as [and in some aspects better than] the equivalent &#x27;proper&#x27; equipment. ie. the camera.<p>I&#x27;m a keen amateur photographer and have actually sold my SLR and compact cameras and now use my phone for 100% of my photography. It may lack some of the capabilities of my proper cameras, but [like most modern phone cameras] it&#x27;s very good indeed and light years ahead of the equipment many of history&#x27;s greatest photographers had access to, in their time. And, as the famous quote says; <i>&quot;The best camera is the one you have with you&quot;</i><p>[and who of us leaves the house without our phones, these days?]<p>Next time you&#x27;re thumb-twiddling somewhere, why not set yourself a photography project to kill the time:<p>* Find and photograph &#x27;faces&#x27; in everyday objects<p>* Pick a random word [for example off a billboard] and take photos on that &#x27;theme&#x27;<p>* Pretend you&#x27;re a news photographer and record &#x27;stories&#x27; on your journey to wherever you&#x27;re going<p>* Photograph some everyday objects from weird angles and see if your mates can recognise them<p>* Try and find some &#x27;beauty&#x27; in decay; dilapidated buildings, rubbish, grafitti, etc.<p>....and so on.')
