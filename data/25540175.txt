This is America&#x27;s version of Uighur internment camps.<p>Let&#x27;s not even get started on the hundreds of thousands of deaths America has been responsible for around the world.<p>It&#x27;s hard to deny that - at least in the last 50 years (i.e. carefully avoiding Great Leap Forward and Cultural Revolution) - America has probably spread more misery and death around the world than China.<p>However. The thing that I think is important to push on, is that in America, and in other free countries, there is open dialog on these issues. Reporters report on war crimes, millions take to the streets to protest, people take their leaders to account, politicians are voted out.<p>Granted, history has shown that we have not been very successful at stopping these injustices, despite freedom of the press and democracy... But could they have been even worse without those freedoms? Yes. We know this because we can look at the awful record of authoritarian regimes in the 20th century.<p>So I think it&#x27;s more effective to not take the bait and pretend that the west is nowhere near as bad... Instead focus on the accountability that democratically-elected governments in free societies have, as opposed to single-party states like the PRC.')
