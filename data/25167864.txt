If I am later trying to make a model to get the best estimate of &lt;stat&gt; by looking at a bunch of other people&#x27;s measurements I will get a more accurate answer if more digits are contained.<p>When someone presents a state like 26% without the ± it&#x27;s at least excusable, since it&#x27;s avoiding making people think that 25.68% was short hand for 26.68% ± (0.005 ± 0.005)%, but when we&#x27;re including the ± there is no good reason to chop off digits.<p>I do like the comment someone else has about reporting this as a range instead of with a ± sign, i.e. &quot;-14.74 to 66.1 percent&quot;.')
