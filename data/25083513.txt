Item(by='acoard', descendants=None, kids=[25085324], score=None, time=1605282862, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25080376, text='True, but I&#x27;ve seen many projects that use both GitHub and JIRA (i.e. not BitBucket).  Those work totally fine for issue tracking, project management, etc.  It&#x27;s the same amount of friction for what you&#x27;re proposing.       The main thing you are missing out on is a UI for merging and PRs, which is nontrivial but not a moat that can keep a monopoly afloat.<p>Of course if JIRA shut down that&#x27;d be annoying too, but I could re-create my project in another project manager.<p>To me, the bigger impact is things like GitHub Actions and your CI&#x2F;CD pipeline.  Issue tracking and PRs don&#x27;t seem like big issues to me.')
