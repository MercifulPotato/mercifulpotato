The people traditionally given diplomatic immunity are representatives of a country, and they have it so they can carry on their work. Diplomatic immunity is not absolute, and can be voided at any point, or the receiver can be announced as persona non Grata and expelled.<p>Like, think how in the old times it was traditional that messangers carrying news from one kingdom to the other were untouchable, they had free passage and it was a very bad idea to harm them in any way.<p>In more practical terms it&#x27;s so that countries which aren&#x27;t on best of terms don&#x27;t use their diplomats as bargaining chips. It would be super easy for say Russia to arrest an American diplomat on fake charges and just keep them in jail(or you know, the other way around). Diplomatic immunity prevents that - it basically says that as long as you are on a diplomatic mission you are immune from prosecution in that country, and for good reason.')
