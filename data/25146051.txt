Yes, we all know it is commission. The iDevices are in effect portable computers. As Android and Sailfish run devices show us, nothing should stop Apple from allowing us to install and run softwares from outside their app store. The only reason to do so is to control our devices (they can disable any app, or even the whole device and make it unusable) and ofcourse greed to also gauge even more money from other  developers.<p>The comparison with other closed devices, like gaming consoles, just attempts to divert focus away from Apple who is the most abusive in its attempt to control and dictate the apps that run on its platform. Obviously if developers are unhappy with Apple and Microsoft and Google&#x27;s App store, they are also unhappy with the closed systems of consoles. And yes, what developers are criticising and demanding from Apple also applies to everyone else too.')
