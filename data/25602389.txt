I deliver for Postmates and I really think that most of the customers don&#x27;t really understand that they might be ordering from a restaurant that isn&#x27;t partnered with Postmates.  The knock on effect is that often the menu isn&#x27;t really correct, so the customer gets their order &quot;wrong&quot; and calls the restaurant to complain.')
