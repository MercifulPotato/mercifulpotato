Luckily for me, I already an IT job so I wasn&#x27;t in a rush, I had found another shortly after, and I read their contract and told them not so kindly, to fuck themselves. There are a few companies I have seen that do this process as well, where they have a steep &quot;quitting fee&quot;.<p>So my experience with Revature, I am not sure if I even applied to them or if they scraped my CV off of Indeed at the time. The &quot;job interview&quot; was a 20 minute phone call. It included a painfully easy trivia type quiz with 5-10 basic programming questions &quot;What is the differences betwee == vs === in Javascript&quot; level questions. The recruiter said &quot;Wow great, we would like to hire you&quot;. The contract was for $50k a year, and with $25k quit clause if I left the company for any reason before 2 years for anyone but one of their clients, AND this was in DC so a painfully low salary. So basically I they put you through a short training program, find you a job as a contractor, they make &gt;$50k a year selling you as a contractor, if you leave before your slavery is over they get even more money, if you leave for the company you are working they probably get even more money. I told them no, they tried to hard sell me telling me it was normal, I told them to fuck themselves and to not call me again.<p>I could see how someone desparate for a job might fall into this. Total Scam and those companies should be forcibly shut down by the government.')
