Item(by='cpeterso', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606928455, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25276803, text='&gt; The cells used to start the process came from a cell bank and did not require the slaughter of a chicken because cells can be taken from biopsies of live animals.<p>I wonder how many different chickens they sampled from the cell bank. Does their entire product trace back to a single &quot;Eve&quot; chicken sample from the cell bank? For comparison, I read (in &quot;Diet for a New America&quot;, I believe) that one ground beef hamburger includes cells from about one thousand different cows.<p>If they just need cell samples, I wonder how different the process would be to grow human meat in a lab. There might be a niche novelty market for &quot;human burgers&quot;!')
