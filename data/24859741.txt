Tire rubber dust&#x2F;oil&#x2F;windshield wiper fluid etc. There is no such thing as an emission-free car. Also gray energy emission (embodied energy) is completely ignore as allays. If we compare average emission per mileage per car over the whole lifetime EVs are just as bad as any other car. The only way to change that is if cars stop being parked 99% of their lifetime. Environmentally the worst thing for a car to do is not being in use. It means more cars are build than work is there for them. Thats how we actually waste resources and pollute completely unnecessary.')
