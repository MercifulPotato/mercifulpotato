I think self-driving cars are way over-hyped, and I&#x27;m not expecting them to be real level-5 automation for 10-20 years. But I think trucking is different. There is a lot of work to be done, but we can cheat a bit.<p>The first cheat is to only automate the long-haul portion. As anybody who has driven cross country knows, long stretches of American highway barely require you to be conscious, let alone skilled. The truck pulls over before needs to get on city streets and a human driver gets in.<p>The second cheat is what Waymo is doing. If the car doesn&#x27;t know what to do, it slows or stops and asks for help from a central driver that plots a path through the hard part for it. This works for trucking because network coverage on highways is very good.<p>The third cheat is to work around the limitations. If the weather is going to be bad, the truck waits or takes an alternate route. If it gets into trouble like a freak snowstorm, it either proceeds very slowly or just stops until either conditions improve or a human driver can get to it.<p>This approach isn&#x27;t perfect automation, but it will significantly drop labor cost right away, and it gives you a lot of road-miles to iteratively chip away at the problems.')
