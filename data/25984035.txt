The mid-month injection shows how dire it was and how margin calls work. Hedge funds like Melvin typically use monthly accounting, so typically you can only add&#x2F;withdraw capital for the first of the month. But margin calls are fire drills, all the sudden you get a phone call saying, &quot;We need another $3 billion in equity or we liquidate your account&quot; and you either sell stocks like mad (though even in this case I don&#x27;t think it was an option) or pray you have a white knight sugar daddy like Griffin&#x2F;Cohen to write a check literally overnight. Melvin had no choice but to cover, they couldn&#x27;t start doubling down it doesn&#x27;t work that way, they&#x27;d be done, and actually some of these stocks like GME were so volatile that it might even eat into the prime (but really the clearing broker).')
