But other chips (eg IBM) regularly challenged them on speed despite relatively tiny volumes and budgets. And of course years earlier the Itanium debacle + exponentially increasing fab costs (favouring volumes) killed off most of the RISC competition.<p>Trivia: Simultaneously to the previous Mac ISA transition, Apple acquired PA Semi who had a power efficient and fast PPC chip. Then, Apple decided to go to Intel anyway instead of betting on their new in-house chip. Discarding their newly acquired highly acclaimed chip design, they put  the newly acquired semi team to work on the A series of chips instead.')
