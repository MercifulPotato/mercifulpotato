Yes, if you slice the multivariable data just the right way to extract the conditional %, the increase would be the same. Screening more women won&#x27;t make the conditional percentage go up.<p>However, if you are just a nurse, observing # of women coming in, and # of confirmed Down babies coming out... Screening more women will mechanically make the # of confirmed Down babies go up. And that&#x27;s what the rate <i>is</i>, it&#x27;s a count.')
