There&#x27;s different networks and plug systems but there&#x27;s some federation of maps and you can pay with credit card at most.<p>Compared with Tesla, in the US there&#x27;s just way less chargers of two kinds for other EV owners: fast chargers (which are mostly useful as long-ish pit stops for long road trips), and destination chargers (things you can plug in overnight at your hotel or wherever it is you&#x27;re sleeping.<p>There&#x27;s plenty of slow chargers (so called level 2) in downtown areas but those barely give you a courtesy charge. You&#x27;d have to stay plugged in overnight to get any meaningful range out of those, but they tend not to be located where you sleep.<p>Add to that the fact that whatever stations there are tend to be unreliable, and taking even a 200 mile road trip carries its lot of unwelcome surprises.<p>My understanding is that in Europe Tesla is on a path to join the other cars&#x27; standard because the situation is reverse. My hope is that in the US long term as well, they will be forced to join forces (realizing that I might as well hope for Apple to join the USB charger bandwagon for their phones)')
