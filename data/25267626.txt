The focus is on 100% correctness. As I wrote in the post: &quot;Over its 35 years in existence, SQL Server has evolved to meet a wide array of use cases. When first made available on GitHub, Babelfish won’t be able to handle every use case, but will be able to tackle the most common application scenarios. Most importantly, Babelfish will meet the correctness objective. That is, if Babelfish doesn’t yet support specific SQL Server functionality, it will return an error to the application, rather than defaulting to PostgreSQL behavior. Why? Because, again, developers (and the enterprises for which they work) must be able to depend absolutely on the correctness of SQL Server compatibility.&quot;<p>At launch Babelfish will be able to handle - with 100% correctness - the main semantics you&#x27;d want. HOWEVER, as you said (and as mentioned in the post), there&#x27;s a large surface area, and a &quot;long tail&quot; of functionality that needs expertise from us <i>and</i> others to cover. So to do this right, it needs a community. It will be great for many use cases right from the start, but to ensure it&#x27;s great&#x2F;perfect for <i>your</i> use case...well, that just might take your help. Please work with us on this.')
