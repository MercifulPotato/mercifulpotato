We&#x27;re offsetting by 3x every bit of CO2 this creates via Cool Effect.<p>Is this really how this carbon offset thing works?<p>You release a bunch of greenhouse gases - but it&#x27;s &quot;OK&quot; because you pay money to some organization that might eventually plant some trees (or use your money to buy&#x2F;rent fossil-fuel-burning machinery to orchestrate the planting of trees)?<p>Seems like guilt-avoidance to me.')
