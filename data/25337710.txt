I think the terms with the buyer will be that the buyer can&#x27;t spam the participant, so I guess the only benefit will be if buyer can correlate with other advertisement profile and will be someone like some big contextual advertising company. Even for them, correlating say 1% of the users and maybe increasing their CTR by few percent is worth going this much huddle. All I know is most of the ads that I see sucks and there is likely much more easier to fix that than hoping tinder have my data on intelligence and would use that.')
