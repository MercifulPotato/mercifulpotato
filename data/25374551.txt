It’s tiny even when not compared to the garbage we put into the atmosphere, mine tailings, oil spillage, etc. Nuclear fuel is highly compact and you only have to change it every 6 years, that’s about 16 changes in a century. What other fuel source can compete with that and have the same energy output. As for accidents and deaths just compare the numbers to any other power source. More people fall off ladders installing solar in a year than have died from nuclear accidents.')
