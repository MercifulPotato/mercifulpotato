Alternatives have always given great privacy (spinach), but little in the way of a replacement for the &quot;candies&quot; that Facebook offers.<p>Facebook is <i>incredibly</i> valuable, and can afford to hire vast armies of engineers and psychologists, all dedicated to getting their &quot;product&quot; (that&#x27;s users) to make themselves more &quot;productive.&quot; Think farmers, giving hogs higher-protein, better-tasting food.<p>Until alternatives can provide a better &quot;dessert&quot; experience, and only offer spinach, then the vast majority of users won&#x27;t come to them.')
