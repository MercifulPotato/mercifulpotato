I suspect it would be pretty low. I wonder if most people would even notice that the setting had been turned off?<p>We use the opt out model all the time to justify why users don&#x27;t actually care about tracking -- we say that they&#x27;d opt out if they did care. But I feel like we all mostly know that an opt in system would also not see much use (that&#x27;s the reason why ad networks are so opposed to them), and I don&#x27;t know why we don&#x27;t consider that to be evidence that consumers probably don&#x27;t value targeted ads very much at all.')
