That doesn&#x27;t come for free, though it tends to always look like 100% upside until you actually use it and see the trade-offs it makes. Ruby on Rails also used to attract a lot of comments like yours until people realized the trade-offs.<p>Btw, if Flutter makes the web dev paradigm look bad, then I wonder what you think of the iOS&#x2F;Android&#x2F;desktop client paradigms where you don&#x27;t even get much choice like you have on the web. Like using Core Data&#x27;s &quot;ORM&quot;.<p>You&#x27;re essentially hoping Flutter spares you from ever having to drill any deeper than the Flutter abstraction on each of your deploy targets which simply doesn&#x27;t yet match reality. And of all the client dev experiences, it&#x27;s the web that has the options closest to Flutter, so it&#x27;s not the one I&#x27;d damn first.')
