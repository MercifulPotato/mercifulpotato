I would argue that the feedback doesn&#x27;t question the authenticity of the e-mail, but instead, the narrative being pushed that isn&#x27;t fully supported by the e-mails.<p>The closest they came to suggesting that the e-mails were not authentic were these two points, addressing Greenwald:\n&quot;You spend quite a bit of the piece explaining why authentication efforts have been more than sufficient to satisfy any reasonable requirement of verification, but a key reason news organizations have cited for their lack of full confidence in the documents is their inability to access the hard drive; your draft does not mention that. It is hard to report on and authenticate an archive you do not possess.&quot;<p>&quot;And I do think you should treat the origin story of the hard drive – that it came from the Delaware repair store – with a bit more skepticism. It’s true that nothing has emerged yet to significantly undermine it, but it remains a very strange story surrounded by many unanswered questions.&quot;<p>Reading the editor feedback as a whole, I think they were totally fine with Greenwald claiming that the released e-mails are authentic.')
