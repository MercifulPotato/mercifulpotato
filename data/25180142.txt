Literally, if you study hard enough, you can go to an elite school if you want, full stop (source: did this myself.) The root of whatever &quot;problem&quot; may exist is mostly that kids from wealthier backgrounds are more often pressured by their parents to do the studying necessary to get into such a school.\nIn my experience, everyone complaining about elite admissions is either a self-hating old-money grad of such a school, or is salty because they got a mediocre SAT score.')
