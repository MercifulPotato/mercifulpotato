Part of what makes AWS&#x27;s cli reasonably fast is that it uses several threads to make sure to use as much bandwidth as possible.  If I limit AWS&#x27;s tool to one thread on a box with plenty of bandwidth, it turns my upload down from around 135 MiB&#x2F;s to around 20 MiB&#x2F;s<p>Not sure if that&#x27;s all of it, or even the majority of the slowness.')
