Duct tape and the like actually often would fail, and air would just start moving around the filter. For good airflow through the filter I really had to give the air little other choice.<p>I&#x27;m curious if it would&#x27;ve worked just as well had I filtered the air on the &quot;in&quot; side of the box fan... keeping it attached would&#x27;ve been much easier, but I&#x27;m not sure if there&#x27;s any forces that would make &quot;pushing&quot; air through the filter work better than &quot;pulling&quot; air through the filter.')
