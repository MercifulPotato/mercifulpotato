Don&#x27;t use the app.  So simple.<p>---<p>I bet your first response to that statement isn&#x27;t positive - Now reflect that this is <i>exactly</i> what Apple is saying to developers.  &quot;Don&#x27;t want to use our store? Don&#x27;t release on iOS.&quot;<p>Because right now, if you use an application on iOS, you are not a customer of that application.  You are an Apple customer who happens to use a product resold by Apple.<p>Now - I have no problem with you preferring that arrangement, and I&#x27;m certainly not suggesting removing the Apple app store.  I&#x27;m just saying it feels a tad like bullshit.  Maybe entirely like bullshit. Actually - Nope, it&#x27;s just bullshit.')
