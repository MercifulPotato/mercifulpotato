I work for my employer. Do you see the difference?<p>Imagine hiring a plumber at twice the market rate, and instead of fixing your toilet, they start cashing your checks while making demands and telling the world on twitter that you’re abusive and racist. Who would tolerate such nonsense? Nobody.<p>This isn’t about criticizing an employer anyway. She could have discussed her concerns with them in a civil way. But that was not her goal. She is a narcissist, and there’s no winning with those people. They need an enemy in order to prop themselves up as righteous, and anyone will do. Working in good faith is a fool’s errand.')
