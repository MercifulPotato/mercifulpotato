(I guess the herd immunity threshold is just 1&#x2F;R0, because R0 times this threshold would need to approach 1. But I am not an expert....)<p>But, the R0 is not static. It is the number of average new cases one infected case causes. This also depends on what people do, how their housing and working situation is, and so on. If people practice social distancing and hygiene measures, this number is lower, therefore, by definition, the R0 is also lower. Because behavior is not static, the R0 is neither.<p>In other words, the R0 also depends on collective behavior - and so does the herd immunity threshold.')
