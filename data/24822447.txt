Item(by='marta_morena_28', descendants=None, kids=[24825666], score=None, time=1603068920, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24822277, text='The main difference though is that gravitation (probably) doesn&#x27;t have a mass of its own, while EM fields do. Plus, matter does not react to EM fields in the way it does towards gravitation. I.e. light is not &quot;pulled&quot; by EM fields. However, these are technicalities. If all matter reacted to EM fields the same way it would to gravitation, would that make EM fields no force either? Or put another way, gravitation act universally on all particles, while EM fields do not. That necessarily has consequences when it comes to relativity. However it seems odd to argue that general relativity would exclude gravitation from being a force. If it acted only on a subset of particles, it would likely be in the same position as EM fields, and suddenly become a force again?')
