Would it be meaningfully different if it were used in avionics, or industrial safety systems?<p>The <i>dmc</i> compiler does something similar to this, but more generally, without singling out life-support and implanted systems: <i>Do not use this software for life critical applications.</i> [0]<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.digitalmars.com&#x2F;download&#x2F;dmcpp.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.digitalmars.com&#x2F;download&#x2F;dmcpp.html</a>')
