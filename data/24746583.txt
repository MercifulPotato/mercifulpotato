I used to work for Diebold on ATM&#x27;s, and we had some research that proved that:<p><pre><code>  - people want to take out money from the machine\n  - once they have their money, the activity is complete\n</code></pre>\nWe found that if we provided the card back before the money, they stopped leaving their card in the machine.  This is because the &#x27;activity&#x27; was taking out money.')
