The thing that makes me suspicious is an absolute demand that things have to be taken at, and discussed at, face value.<p>The existence of malign intent is hardly mysterious. It&#x27;s like the Firesign Theater skit with a political guy declaring, &quot;And you can believe me. Because I never lie. And I&#x27;m always right.&quot; Part of the gag is that the guy picked to read the line is capable of delivering it really, really convincingly. You go, &#x27;wow! He really means that… hey waitaminnit…&#x27;<p>I think it&#x27;s interesting to see these tech giants react to a repeating pattern of using direct manipulative lying as a weapon. It fits with some of my &#x27;singularity&#x27; theories: corporations are like aggregate people, and AI is a still higher level than that, and it&#x27;s neither easy nor desirable to use these newer forms of intelligence to replicate the worst follies of the individual human.<p>At some point, tolerating the wilder excesses of the individual &#x27;cell&#x27; will kill the &#x27;host&#x27; organism, which if it&#x27;s a corporation depends on living humans, if it&#x27;s an AI depends on living human societies. If you&#x27;ve got an AI that isn&#x27;t really an AI and is just a large informational weapon, or a corporation that isn&#x27;t really an aggregate person and is just the intentions of one human expressed through power, there&#x27;s no constraint on the actions of the larger more powerful entity. But if you have the larger organism (whether it&#x27;s a corporation or a proper AI with a broad enough awareness) it&#x27;s going to eventually resist self-destructive actions even if they&#x27;re expressed in a complex way. I see this as YouTube as a larger organism recognizing it is being used as a weapon and trying to protect itself against future punishment or diminishment by preventing itself from being used in a particular way.')
