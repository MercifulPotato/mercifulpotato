Lower-income households had incomes less than $48,500 and upper-income households had incomes greater than $145,500 (all figures computed for three-person households, adjusted for the cost of living in a metropolitan area, and expressed in 2018 dollars).<p>Although, I would not agree with equating the above to middle class.  In fact, I would simply never use the word &quot;class&quot; as it&#x27;s utility in a discussion is zero except to evoke an emotional response, in my experience.')
