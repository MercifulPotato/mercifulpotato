If Facebook is purposely going through the PERM process with these employees, it is actively working to remove those un-equal terms. After the PERM process, the employee is free to leave and not remain with the company until they can adjust status.<p>I think they meant the special PERM &quot;benefit&quot; for employees is used as a carrot to attract temporary workers who may or may not ever get it themselves. You can&#x27;t leave because you&#x27;d lose your advantaged insider status.')
