Why not November 4, or December 3, or January 14? Why now, 2 weeks before an election. It reeks of political motivation.</i><p>There are more types of political motivation than just vote seeking, and the timing is certainly political. If there&#x27;s any time to get Biden and&#x2F;or Harris on the record regarding whether they will continue to pursue the complaint is now. There will be no motivation for them to do so after the election no matter who wins.')
