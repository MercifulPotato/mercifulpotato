VTOL-planes fly as a plane, they do not have hovering endurance, barely a few minutes at the most, just for take off and landing. So they cannot perform missions that require hovering capabilities. A hybrid multicopter has the advantage of longer-endurance, traditionally exclusive of planes, while still keeping all the advantages in simplicity, ease of use and versatility of multicopters.')
