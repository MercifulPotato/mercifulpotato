However I would not recommend betting big on it. GCP as an extension of google has the same problems, they are way too big to care about small companies. They change their minds every now and then without upfront notice and kill things or deprecate them. Support is hard to reach.<p>In any case, think for your own self what you care about. There are tradeoffs of each cloud providers. I’ve found AWS provided me with a human touch and cares about my problems. Never quite used Azure (their portal is too complex).<p>In my mind, Google’s gonna be Google. They value automation and algorithms over human touch. It’s in their DNA. It’s what their hire for.')
