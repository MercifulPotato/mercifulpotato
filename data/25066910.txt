It doesn&#x27;t now, never has, and never will own the market nor does it desire to sell cheap enough machines to do so.<p>- Given that you can&#x27;t add ram after the fact and 256GB is anemic the cheapest laptop that is a reasonable choice is $1400.<p>- The cheapest desktop option is $6000 with an 8 core cpu or 8000 with a 16 core.<p>- The average end user spends $700 on a computer<p>- We literally have marketing numbers and a worthless synthetic benchmark.<p>I think it entirely fair to say that the new macs are liable to be fantastic machines but there is no reason to believe that the advent of apple cpu macs marks the end of open hardware. Were you expecting them to sell their cpus to the makers of the cheap computers most people actually buy?')
