Who do you think they are? Are we not talking about America? The constituents are the companies, not the voters.<p>Seriously it is frustrating watching the US from outside. Watching how American just let themselves getting screwed over again and again and again. Only to ask for more. The paranoia about government and the praise of capitalism is so strong in America that people will rather embrace crony capitalism with a warm hug than do anything that means you risk getting called anti-business, job-destroyer, socialist, communist or whatever.<p>There is not democracy in America anymore. It is the same &quot;system&quot; as Iran. Sure you get to vote, to retain the illusion of choice. The mullah&#x27;s deciding on who gets to run has been replaced by the 1 percent, the donor class. You are allowed to vote on whomever they approve of.')
