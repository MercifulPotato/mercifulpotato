Item(by='dragontamer', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612020255, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25969775, text='&gt; You claimed that SASS was a SIMD instruction set, which is false.<p>Well, they execute 32-at-a-time SIMD, do they not?<p>There are tricks to split up the execution mask and execute 1-at-a-time, 2-at-a-time, 4, 8, 16, or 31 at a time based on if-statements or thread-locks or whatever. But a &quot;SASS&quot; instruction of &quot;R1 = R2 + R3&quot; is implicitly executed across a 32-wide warp if its execution mask is set as such.<p>----------<p>EDIT:<p>Lets put it this way: If you see a &quot;SASS&quot; assembly for R1 = R2 + R3 in isolation, how many adds take place on that clock tick?<p>Somewhere between 1 add, and 32-adds. No more than 32-at-a-time. Seems pretty SIMD to me.')
