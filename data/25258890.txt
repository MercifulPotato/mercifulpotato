They could also go off package at the expense of power, a good tradeoff for a desktop system.  The die size is also small compared to competitive processors (120 mm^2) so they can certainly add more cores.  I think with a larger cost budget they&#x27;ll make the high end sing.<p>I don&#x27;t mean to pick on you as you&#x27;re not alone in what is a very natural skepticism.  However, it is somewhat amusing to watch the comments about the M1 over time.  When Apple announced the M1 based products many critics were crying impossible, faked, rigged benchmarks, etc...  Now that the products have proven to have performance at least as good as claimed, lots of people are suggesting this is some kind of low end fluke result and the higher end systems won&#x27;t be so great.  Just wait.  I think we are seeing a tipping point event where RISC (fueled by great engineering) is finally fulfilling its promise from many years ago.')
