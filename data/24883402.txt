Even if they <i>had</i> been given the pain meds, you move the shoulder <i>slightly</i> to see how well the pain medicine is working, if it’s not working well enough (= patient shows evidence of significant pain), you give <i>more</i> pain medicine. But it’s hard to get to some level of analgesia that can control the peak of the pain that will happen during joint reduction, but also not cause respiratory depression.  That’s why personally I give sedation to my patients instead of just pain medication, that’s what <i>I’d</i> want if I had to have the procedure done.<p>But if in fact it was the orthopedic team that did the reduction, they are not trained to give the same level of sedation as emergency specialists or anesthesiologists. So there is a temptation on their part to give some dose, <i>not</i> titrate to effect, and then just “get on with it” to save time. What they <i>should</i> do, and do in fact do in my institution, is have the emergency medicine doc give sedation, and then they can happily do their procedure without torturing the patient... Or the emergency docs do the sedation <i>and</i> reduction, which we tend to do for patients who don’t require other inpatient orthopedic care.<p>[Edit: \nAlso, Bellevue is a residency training site, so this was probably a first or second year resident (they are the ones that most need the experience of shoulder reductions)\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;med.nyu.edu&#x2F;departments-institutes&#x2F;orthopedic-surgery&#x2F;education&#x2F;residency&#x2F;rotations" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;med.nyu.edu&#x2F;departments-institutes&#x2F;orthopedic-surger...</a>.
