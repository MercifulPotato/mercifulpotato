It likely isn&#x27;t true now. I was forced by my parents to apply for admission to TJ and was accepted. I ultimately refused to attend despite the great pressure from both my parents and school officials. I know several people who were in the same boat as I was but gave into the pressure and attended hating doing so. This would have been during the same time period you attended.')
