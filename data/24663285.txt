I don&#x27;t disagree with anything you said here, but it does not seem it contradicts what I am trying to say. Probably my article was a bit unclear on this point.<p>The connection between freedom of speech and privacy was just an example of how privacy affect other rights, too. I used it because I did not want to be too abstract. I used just one example, because I did not want to write too much on this. I wanted to write something that could be shared and read by a few people, rather than just hardcore privacy enthusiast.<p>Actually I really like your observations. Frankly this is another way (maybe a better one) to say what I was thinking:<p>&gt;Privacy is about denying other people the information that they may use to obtain power over you in some way.')
