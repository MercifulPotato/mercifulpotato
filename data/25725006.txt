Item(by='flamble', descendants=None, kids=[25727224], score=None, time=1610343404, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25724450, text='Yes, the &quot;left&quot; represented by the Democratic party &#x2F;s.<p>Every single thing you&#x27;ve listed is controlled by capital, not by the left. Tech, Hollywood&#x2F;Media, Social Media, News, and payment processing. Academia is a very partial exception  (google &quot;Koch brothers university funding&quot;).<p>Do you think that any of the organizations that constitute these groups are run by social activists? These are overwhelmingly multinational corporations. They care about nothing but profit and the preservation of the status quo. They will appropriate rhetoric about identity politics insofar as it is a good marketing strategy, but they never make a move which is not motivated by their bottom line, which is why none of the tech giants acted against Trump until he threatened the orderly continuation of the system in which they&#x27;re all invested.<p>&quot;Left&quot; media is a tiny, powerless fraction of the media. MSNBC and CNN toe the line of the DNC, a right-wing clique that represents only the interests of finance capital, and which, because it has comprehensively rejected any project of improving people&#x27;s lives in any material way, has been forced into a politics of performative culture war posturing. Any leftist challenge to the status quo can be quelled by capital&#x27;s complete capture of the media apparatus and government.<p>When you say &quot;the left&quot;, it&#x27;s very clear you mean social progressives, and nothing else. You&#x27;re conflating co-opted woke capitalism with leftism, the same way countless liberals do.<p>You are however, absolutely correct about the coming repression that will be directed against the populace. It will be mostly directed against the left, as has always been the case, but we will definitely begin to see greater brutality in general as the overall immiseration and precarity of the average person continue to ratchet upwards.<p>In tandem with this, we&#x27;ll see ever-increasing social policing of culture-war nonsense, as the social unrest continues to play out in a make-believe symbolic realm completely detached from material reality. People will of course continue to believe that it&#x27;s &quot;the authoritarian left&quot; or &quot;the bigoted right&quot; that is ultimately to blame, depending of which flavour of news media they consume, missing the symbiotic relationship between two parties that both represent nothing but the short-term financial interests of capital.')
