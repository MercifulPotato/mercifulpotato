Twitter and Facebook have repeatedly taken the position that there&#x27;s no need to reform section 230 or otherwise strongly regulate their moderation, because they&#x27;re very dedicated to the idea of free discourse and would never abuse their power. If they now feel that free discourse is dangerous and shouldn&#x27;t be allowed, they should let the country know that so that we can make regulatory decisions accordingly.')
