And that meant that they could be loaded in whatever manner best suited the whole ship. The details of which might not be known at the time when the container was booked.  The carrier might be able to reserve “interior” or “top level” spaces for a different prices, but with shipments being loaded&#x2F;offloaded at different ports, the logistics of loading can be quite complicated. If your container need to be offloaded at the first of three ports, you probably couldn’t have the option of an interior space. Or if you had an extremely heavy container, that should be loaded in the lower part of the ship for safety.<p>My guess is that the orchestration of how containers are loaded is complex enough that the order of stacking is best left up to the shipper and adding cost&#x2F;location optimization to the equation might make things too complicated. The containers should be loaded in the manner that is the safest and most efficient for unloading.')
