You can do this by leading a small group of people (2-4 engs), but also by working as an individual, so I don&#x27;t think leadership skills in that sense are required for L5.<p>2&#x2F; Usually managers are quite good at coaching for this transition (things get harder going from L5 =&gt; L6 and further on). Try to find a team that is seeing some growth and with a manager you enjoy talking to. Managers with some experience (2-3 years) are better at figuring out what gaps you need to fill to get promoted.<p>3&#x2F; Also try to figure out what type of team you will be successful in. For introverted people often product teams are not a great fit as they require tons of coordination to ship anything: you might have to work with a designer, a content strategist, a product manager, and a data scientist for a typical L5-scope project. Infrastructure &#x2F; backend teams can offer better opportunities for people who want to grow as individual contributors. I know many senior engineers (L6+) in infra teams who aren&#x27;t tech leads leading large teams -- they are simply strong engineers who can solve complex problems on their own.')
