There&#x27;s a definite slimey feeling to any of their conversations regarding work. I overheard 2 people from different agencies trying to one-up each other with their stories of how much of their client&#x27;s money they spent on ridiculousness. It wasn&#x27;t about how they could save their client money and then spend it in other areas. One person I met that worked in ad tech and I told him the efforts with extensions&#x2F;private mode&#x2F;vpn&#x2F;etc to block as much of ad tech as possible. He was totally aghast that people would go to that much effort to block their &quot;harmless&quot; tech. Yet another Kool-aid drinker. I have a feeling chatting with any G&#x2F;FB employee would be similar.')
