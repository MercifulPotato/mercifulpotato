Telling them that I lost my job only got one offer to extend at a discounted rate.  But what really worked well was this:<p>NYT: &quot;Can I ask why you want to cancel your subscription?&quot;<p>Me: &quot;No.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s not on their script, so the operator just took care of it immediately.<p>On the plus side, at least you can speak to a human being at the Times pretty quickly.  Good luck getting through to anyone at the Albuquerque Journal in under three days (&quot;It looks like you&#x27;re calling from a cell phone. Let&#x27;s continue this conversation by text!&quot;).')
