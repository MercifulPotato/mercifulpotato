If the requirements themselves are complex then expecting the code to be simple just doesn&#x27;t make sense. Also piece of code would look simple to a person who has been working on it for long time and has the background knowledge vs a person who is new to the system.<p>Another thing to remember is that software systems are built incrementally i.e for each new requirement the developer have to figure out &quot;how to implement this new requirement in this given code base with minimal changes&quot; and this eventually will lead to complexity (unless you want to do big refactor on each new requirement).')
