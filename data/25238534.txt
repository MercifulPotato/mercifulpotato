Item(by='dragonwriter', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606581380, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25232989, text='90s (Windows 95 and later, or any version of MacOS) personal computers weren&#x27;t easier to use in any dimension than modern ones; 80s pre-PC ones, and DOS PCs, were only in a weird masochistic enthusiast sense where it took less work to get to a prompt for an fairly obscure and limited programming language&#x2F;CLI, but more work to actually do anything significant with it.<p>Any given hardware platform tended to be a more stable target over it&#x27;s lifetime in the pre-PC era, which is a kind of simplicity (not really ease, but once you&#x27;ve climbed the learning curve the ground isn&#x27;t shifting under you.) OTOH, any given hardware platform was likely to fade into irrelevance sooner and if you wanted to swap to something with decent current support more of what you learned would be irrelevant, so even that stability was of fairly limited utility.')
