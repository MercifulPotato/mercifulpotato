Here&#x27;s the second download link for &quot;AutoHotkey&quot; on google: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;autohotkey.en.uptodown.com&#x2F;windows" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;autohotkey.en.uptodown.com&#x2F;windows</a> - wtf is uptodown? They even train you to get used to that classic subdomain spam that malicious websites use. Another example were various driver tweaks&#x2F;hacks or anything else a gamer or power user might want to do. Always from a shady mirror website that trains you to run .exes from any website that shows up in search.<p>It was a breath of fresh air to get WSL + Debian up and running on Windows so I could rely on apt-get.<p>The Microsoft Store is surprisingly bad, not having anything you&#x27;re looking for, but plenty of apps that claim to be that thing or would confuse people who don&#x27;t know any better.<p>Normal users are really being let down from a security standpoint in computing, in general.<p>macOS has similar issues with websites like macupdate.com, but it&#x27;s slightly farther along with its much more compelling app store library. My girlfriend is a UX professional and the only few apps she uses outside of the app store is Chrome and Sketch. It definitely feels like this approach is moving in the right direction that can satisfy most people and power users as well.<p>And for completeness, I would think a GUI over linux repos like Synaptic is also nice for normal users. I have one not-so-technical friend on Linux Mint where I saw them using whichever GUI to grab packages.')
