It&#x27;s also preloaded and unremovable on Android.<p>Microsoft advertises edgium on Windows and makes it unremovable.<p>Apple only allows webkit and safari clones on their platform.<p>Firefox even if it&#x27;s the best browser in the world would have the same problem that Linux has. Namely that Linux may be better and fit the needs, but people aren&#x27;t going to bother installing it. Just look at Windows 10 and how many people are pissed at various aspects from telemetry, updates, ads and still these same people can&#x27;t be bothered to flash Linux. Linux has something like 1-2% of the desktop market.<p>The other issue with (2) is that R&amp;D into Firefox will not return money. Not unless they choose to basically switch to blink and offload the R&amp;D costs onto Google. Heck Microsoft themselves did the same because they realized the R&amp;D costs weren&#x27;t worth it.<p>If Mozilla wants to stay alive, it needs to diversify and find a niche not dominated&#x2F;controlled by Google, Microsoft and Apple.')
