I had the exact same thing when I got my first full time job and I thought it was a unique problem. You made me feel way less crazy. I’m pretty much over it now, and like you, I had to set some new goals &#x2F; ambitions to find a new “path” now that all my college ambitions had been achieved.<p>Learning to meditate was also a game changer. I do it every day before work. Also, talking to a therapist helped me realize I had been being way too hard on myself for too long. Learning to take pride in my accomplishments was another critical factor.<p>I hope a lot of people see your blog post. Thanks again for putting that together!')
