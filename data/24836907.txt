It used to rely on cars, just like most countries. It&#x27;s still far from perfect; there&#x27;s still loads of places where there are not enough options.<p>Car-only places is considered restrictive. Similarly, kids should be able to do things on their own. Seems nowadays kids rely on their parents to move them around. That&#x27;s pretty crazy IMO.<p>Any other country could do the same. Also people in Netherlands complained that &quot;government is going after cars&quot;, etc.')
