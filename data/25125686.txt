Though Apple would always <i>like</i> to make a profit, of course.<p>It&#x27;s a combination of a halo car and a triple whopper.<p>A halo car is a statement of intent from a car company. It&#x27;s showing off &quot;here&#x27;s all our coolest stuff, and the direction we think things should go&quot;, while being impractically expensive and bought by almost nobody. By putting out the fancy new Mac Pro, Apple reassured professionals that it cared about them, and presumably that&#x27;s making people less likely to nervously shift away from the platform even if all they actually need for their own work is a laptop or Mac Mini.<p>The triple whopper, famously, mostly existed to be a conspicuously more-excessive product that made the double whopper look more reasonable in comparison. If the Mac Pro exists at $6k base, buying a reasonably specced out iMac suddenly looks downright responsible!<p>Both of these things are good for Apple&#x27;s bottom line.')
