If one party flips on an issue, the other almost immediately flops.<p>At this point, the Republicans are mid-flop towards election security, while the Democrats have made statements which will be very hard to back out of, so I think we&#x27;re seeing the fish flipping.... You can even see this in action, as every single one of these posts is trending toward negative infinite upvotes, where just a few months ago, they would have been trending towards upvotes. Even a mild pointer to a textbook on cryptography summarizing a cryptographic protocol is now at zero.<p>I&#x27;ll be delighted to be proven wrong, though. Democrats will control both chambers and the presidency. If I see crypto-secure voting, I&#x27;ll be delighted. I just don&#x27;t see it. At this point, Democrats are firmly in the voting-is-secure-nothing-to-see-here camp. I understand why given the unpleasantness in DC, but it is, as a point of fact, not secure.
