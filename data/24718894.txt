I am a PHD student in  visual data analysis and I have plenty of experience using matplotlib. I have seen a lot of possibilities developing with matplotlib (object oriented or state-driven) but still, I would like to know if there is a well organized course teaching all fancy concepts and features like subplotting, grids, interactivity and so on.<p>Can someone recommend such a course ? I would be very thankful!')
