The less diversification a business has, the more vulnerable it is in case of issues (e.g. the fiasco that is the new fab process sizes), market demand shifts or other external events (wars, tariff &#x2F; trade wars, pandemics, economic crises).<p>Intel is now trading that revenue stream for a one time cash injection, probably to get back on their feet regarding the mentioned new fab processes - but if that bet fails, they&#x27;re out of all the money they spent AND don&#x27;t have that revenue stream anymore.<p>In my opinion this is a dangerous short-sighted move driven by bean counters with next-quarterly-only incentives...')
