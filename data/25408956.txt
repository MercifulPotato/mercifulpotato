Item(by='SilasX', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607885156, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25407087, text='&gt; For example, it&#x27;s more likely you&#x27;ll say something like &#x27;give candy to these kids&#x27; or &#x27;wash these cars&#x27; than &#x27;give a piece of candy to each kid&#x27; or &#x27;wash each of these cars.<p>True but for more complex instructions, it’s common to say “do these things for that kid, then do that for all the kids”, which is pretty much a for loop. I can’t speak to how common this was in lay speech before programming was common though.<p>(There was an earlier thread about this but algolia’s search UI suddenly became a pain to use on mobile and it’s too tedious to find.)')
