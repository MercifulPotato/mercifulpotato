There are very few details about the methodology used in this survey, so I don&#x27;t think I have much to say about the validity of the poll results.<p>But regarding whether journalism is more dangerous now than it was 10 years ago (around the time I left journalism) ...<p>There are some journalists who cover breaking news and put themselves in harm&#x27;s way, and for them, the danger to their health and safety will always be a part of the job.<p>But for the vast majority of journalists, the biggest danger of their job is the business environment, which has been on a downward trajectory for decades, and the distrust of the media, which has picked up over the past five years.<p>In other words, if you look at journalists as a whole, the vast majority of whom are toiling away for low salaries at media outlets that are struggling to turn a profit, the biggest threat is not that they&#x27;re going to get physically hurt but that they won&#x27;t be able to make ends meet, or won&#x27;t have a job next month.<p>I have spent nearly 20 years keeping tabs on proposed new business models that might be able to allow journalism to flourish again -- worker cooperatives, benefactor-supported models, independent bloggers, etc. -- but unfortunately so much of the existing journalism infrastructure is tied up in mega-corps, and it&#x27;s going to take a LOT of work to act against that momentum.')
