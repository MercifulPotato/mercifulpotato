The sea is absolutely loaded to the hilt with things that are incredibly toxic, completely inedible, or entirely unpalatable. There’s a ton of fish that we do eat, naturally, but there are tons of things in the sea that you shouldn’t touch, or that have to be handled carefully lest it kill you.<p>That’s funny because generally speaking ancient humans preferred seafood over hunting mammals, both because that allows you to be stationary, and because mammals have a disturbing tendency of hunting you back.')
