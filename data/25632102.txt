In this case, those outsiders are young people breaking into the industry or trying to move up the ranks within Google. Before going all-in on unions, consider if you’re ready to start making it harder for Googlers to get fired or make it more difficult for someone to get promoted based on their work rather than seniority (number of years worked).<p>At this point it’s not even clear what the union is demanding or what they expect to change. Google already has industry leading pay and benefits, as well as a reputation for some of the most reasonable working hours in the industry.')
