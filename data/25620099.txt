I&#x27;ve been using Keepass2 with a smartcard for a long time now. I don&#x27;t like that all passwords are unlocked at once, but the DPG approach seems to act the same way. The DPG approach also requires that if I update my &#x27;amazon&#x27; password I have to remember that I&#x27;m on &#x27;amazon3&#x27; or whatever version.<p>I&#x27;d really like to figure out a way to have Keepass or a similar system only unlock one password at a time. I think I can do this using the smartcard by encrypting each password individually using the card, but I&#x27;ve been too busy to learn the plugin system.<p>This way I can only open my password manager on a trusted system, since the entire key database is open. I suppose this is also equivalent to the DPG approach, assuming you use an obvious name for each website (i.e. amazon, google, ebay, etc.)')
