I often get accused of being rude in my writing because I am direct. I&#x27;ve known lots of people (especially devs) that don&#x27;t really understand that their phrasing might be interpreted as rude. If someone is clearly just lobbing insults, that&#x27;s one thing, but we also have obligations to be charitable when interpreting others, and that charity often involves couching their expression as an attempt at being &quot;politely informative.&quot;  I would also say: unless it&#x27;s flagrant, learn to deal with it. It&#x27;s important to be able to deal with people, and that involves dealing with unhappy people, people who are stressed or at wits end, and so on. It goes both ways.')
