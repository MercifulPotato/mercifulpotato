Thats something that has bern there pretty much for ever &amp; has all the hard &amp; dirty depsolving issues long solved.<p>Also I can use it for all software regardless of what laguage it&#x27;s written in, not to mention having to learn  multiple half-baked package managers per laguage!<p>And lastly any non trivial software project will need dependencies outside of the world of its own package manager anyway, so why not go all in properly with rmp&#x2F;deb &amp; make everything easier for your users &amp; your future self.')
