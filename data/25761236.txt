For one, kids haven&#x27;t been taught to teach themselves - and most kids aren&#x27;t interested in learning anyways because they don&#x27;t see any incentive.<p>Schooling has traditionally used social pressure and a present authority figure to ensure students actually participate. Online, both of those are basically gone.<p>Technically, there&#x27;s actually potential benefit to guiding a student into becoming self-reliant in terms of schooling (and so, obviously, in work &amp; life). Also, we&#x27;re all aware that there are countless great resources for learning online. The crux of the problem is really how to incentivize it.<p>I think the solution involves:<p>1) Getting a curriculum (solved by the school)<p>2) Finding good resources for learning it (takes some digging)<p>3) Incentivizing the learning<p>4) Keeping track (some kind of online tool like Notion maybe?)<p>Maybe a good incentive is to simply have suitable rewards for completing tasks and getting good grades. Pair that with embellishments to the curriculum - like say, you get to learn some extra stuff by watching Bill Nye - and I think you can get a kid to want to learn.<p>I learned Calculus entirely online and aced my exam, but that was after failing it and becoming desperate to move on. Negative incentive clearly worked for me, but I don&#x27;t recommend it.')
