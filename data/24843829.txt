No extra circuitry is needed.<p>Two-phase cannot do that when the phases are 180 degrees apart; opposite polarity is as good as a single phase. It would work if the two phases were 90 degrees apart.<p>A two-phase motor operating on single phase (or 180 degree two phase) needs to generate the 90 degree phase signal with extra circuitry.<p>Three phases is also smoother power delivery and even loading compared to two.')
