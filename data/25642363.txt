Unfortunately I can definitely see how Google wouldn&#x27;t be able to distinguish this from low quality affiliate spam.  Also, I agree with &quot;the UX does not make the user want to continue exploring the page they landed on&quot; - if I were you I&#x27;d invest in improving the design.<p>As for &quot;dramatically increase the word count, add more photos, add overviews of each product instead of just a single line or two pulled from reviews&quot;... don&#x27;t do this!  If I wanted all that junk I&#x27;d just read the Amazon page.  I agree that there is probably room to add a bit more information about the products without ruining what makes your site cool but don&#x27;t abandon your vision.')
