With it you can add your own button that &quot;does stuff&quot; and it was just some VB code. Keep in mind I am a C++&#x2F;Java&#x2F;JS&#x2F;TS dev but I loved the extensibility of tools that let you extend and customize with code. This was generally before HTML forms had the ability to copy-paste images and just be &quot;uploaded&quot; like you can in, say, confluence today. Before that you kinda had to publish things the hard way, safe the screen shot with a file name, add it carefully to your Post and then just keep messing with the HTML a bit.<p>So being an instructor of both a C++ and a Java class in the early 2000s I wanted a way to quickly publish course content for the students - complete with screenshots out of the IDE. LOTS of screenshots. So many pictures that it was eating a lot of my time to carefully save each and name the file, etc.. So what I did was build my own micro PHP CMS that supported a small REST API that lets you post the HTML and images together. I added a button to word that takes a Doc file and saves it as HTML, and then for all the related image files, it would go and automatically upload them to my custom CMS. So yeah, took me a good 12 hours during a couple weekends to get that working, but after that I was able to get articles posted up for the students very quickly, with thousands of pictures - because with word I was able to use screen shot tools in the clip board and then just PASTE them into the doc file.<p>I mean now days many wikis with a WYSIWYG mode now support native paste. But that was just one example of how awesome adding a bit of code to random stuff helped me.')
