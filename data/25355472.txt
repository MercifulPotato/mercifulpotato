RHEL is 11-13 years total, Windows is... I&#x27;m guessing my grandkids will be using some form of Windows 10. CentOS is, and always was a community &quot;best effort&quot;, with some serious delays occasionally (not often, but it happened).<p>A RHEL server license starts at $349, I have to assume that&#x27;s at least an order of magnitude (or two or three) less than the cost of your software based on the technologies involved (sounds enterprise-solutiony). In other words a rounding error overall.')
