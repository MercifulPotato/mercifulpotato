But after that the Republican Party decided to seize on the rift created in the <i>Democratic</i> Party when LBJ <i>also</i> backed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (which was essential to it being passed into law, because Republicans didn&#x27;t have a veto-proof majority backing it) to subsequently, starting particularly in the 1968 Presidential election and continuing thereafter, to target the white racists (particularly concentrated in the South) that were disenchanted with the Democratic Party on that issue, in order to make sure that that split wasn&#x27;t temporary as it was when the Dixiecrats revolted over Truman&#x27;s integration of the military. And to do that, they started pandering, and have ever since, to the racism of the disaffected group they were courting.')
