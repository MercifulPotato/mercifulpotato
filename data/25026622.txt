I find CPU performance to be very good if not quite equal to the native Linux setup I had previously. I don&#x27;t run IO heavy tasks daily, so no comment on that. I do develop things that require a much newer Linux kernel (eBPF&#x2F;XDP) so I also have a couple more VMs on Hyper-V, and finally remote machines with proper NICs (that I wouldn&#x27;t really be able to have on my laptop anyway) - yet still, the whole setup feels very convenient and snappy.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t run a production server on WSL, that sounds like madness. It <i>is</i>, however, a great development environment for me, where I have almost everything I needed from the Linux side, along with allowing my laptop to do 8 hours on battery on Windows as opposed to 3 on Linux, sleep working properly, wifi not needing an occasional reboot to start working after wakeup, etc.<p>So my anecdote vs your anecdote: it works (great) for me.')
