I agree completely with this. I spend my days working on US healthcare data and seeing how crazy it is while I use the NHS for my actual care.<p>But the US system is tricky because while it is an huge mishmash of layers of middlemen and clearing houses taking a slice of the pie, those layers also employ a huge number of Americans across the country. It would be extraordinarily difficult (both logistically and politically) to rip all that out in one fell swoop. I feel like the only possible way to bring in socialized medicine in the US would be a gradual expansion of opt-in &#x27;Medicare for All&#x27; or something along those lines.')
