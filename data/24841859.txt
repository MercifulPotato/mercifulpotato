For example in 10.0.0.0&#x2F;23 you&#x27;d have<p>10.0.1.0&#x2F;32<p>As a perfectly valid IP address.<p>Also, routing an entire block allows you to use all of the IP&#x27;s in said block. So there are ways to do it efficiently, but with routing a block that block is not considered on-network and thus doesn&#x27;t have a broadcast address nor can it use one.')
