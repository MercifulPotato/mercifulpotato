I&#x27;ve definitely left companies before instead of just switching teams because it felt like I had a tough time explaining that my wanting to switch teams wasn&#x27;t the manager&#x27;s fault and it was easier to explain wanting to switch companies instead without making it seem like a personal affront to the manager. I&#x27;m wondering now if I wasn&#x27;t giving my old manager enough credit for taking bad news well.')
