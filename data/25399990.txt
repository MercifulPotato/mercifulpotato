The graph in your linked tweet shows that a mask mandate went into effect on July 3, then a spike occurred, which hit a peak on July 12th.  That&#x27;s consistent with the interpretation I mentioned.<p>It doesn&#x27;t make sense to use the day after a mandate takes effect as a reference, because there&#x27;s roughly a 2-week period between when a person catches COVID and when they exhibit symptoms or require hospitalization.  The July 12th is a little less than 2 weeks after the mandate began, enough time for anyone who already had the virus before the mandate to exhibit symptoms.<p>As for the 2nd link you posted, graphs like these are useless without additional context on what was happening in those communities at the time.  We don&#x27;t know if people were actually following the mandate or not, how frequently they were taking their masks off, whether they were engaging in other behavior which would put them at risk for COVID exposure, etc.  Until you can control for those variables, it&#x27;s hard to take these graphs as evidence that masks don&#x27;t work.  Indeed, mask mandates will be useless if enough people don&#x27;t follow them, or if people attend a super-spreader event in their area, or if any number of other things happen.  That&#x27;s... kind of my point.<p>You claim that &quot;If mask mandates worked, they&#x27;d have a clear impact on incidence graphs&quot;.  How do you know they <i>didn&#x27;t</i> have an impact on incidence graphs?  It&#x27;s entirely possible that the spikes in those charts would have been even more severe without a mask mandate.  There are hardly &quot;no results to show for&quot; masks, as you say.  Indeed, the first tweet you linked to is someone replying to exactly that kind of evidence.[1]  The TL;DR is &quot;The governor of Kansas issued an executive order requiring wearing masks in public spaces, effective July 3, 2020, which was subject to county authority to opt out. After July 3, COVID-19 incidence decreased in 24 counties with mask mandates but continued to increase in 81 counties without mask mandates.&quot;<p>&quot;Masks don&#x27;t work at all&quot; is a pretty bold statement considering the sources you posted are a collection of Twitter accounts belonging to people of unknown expertise.  But don&#x27;t listen to me, I&#x27;m not an expert either.  Listen to the people who do this kind of thing for a living and who know what they&#x27;re talking about.  They know more than we do about their chosen field.  There is a general consensus among serious experts that masks do work.[2][3][4][5][6]<p>Or if appeals to authority aren&#x27;t your cup of tea, here[7] is an explanation of <i>how</i> masks work, specifically how they help filter and trap particles which carry COVID.  If you still believe masks don&#x27;t work, I&#x27;d love to see your rebuttal to the specific points that this NY Times article makes.  I&#x27;m open to being proved wrong.<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;mmwr&#x2F;volumes&#x2F;69&#x2F;wr&#x2F;mm6947e2.htm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;mmwr&#x2F;volumes&#x2F;69&#x2F;wr&#x2F;mm6947e2.htm</a>\n2. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;d41586-020-02801-8" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;d41586-020-02801-8</a>\n3. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;mmwr&#x2F;volumes&#x2F;69&#x2F;wr&#x2F;mm6947e2.htm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;mmwr&#x2F;volumes&#x2F;69&#x2F;wr&#x2F;mm6947e2.htm</a>\n4. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mayoclinic.org&#x2F;diseases-conditions&#x2F;coronavirus&#x2F;in-depth&#x2F;coronavirus-mask&#x2F;art-20485449" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mayoclinic.org&#x2F;diseases-conditions&#x2F;coronavirus&#x2F;i...</a>\n5. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.umms.org&#x2F;coronavirus&#x2F;what-to-know&#x2F;masks&#x2F;wearing-mask" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.umms.org&#x2F;coronavirus&#x2F;what-to-know&#x2F;masks&#x2F;wearing-...</a>\n6. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ucsf.edu&#x2F;news&#x2F;2020&#x2F;06&#x2F;417906&#x2F;still-confused-about-masks-heres-science-behind-how-face-masks-prevent" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ucsf.edu&#x2F;news&#x2F;2020&#x2F;06&#x2F;417906&#x2F;still-confused-abou...</a>\n7. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;interactive&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;30&#x2F;science&#x2F;wear-mask-covid-particles-ul.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;interactive&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;30&#x2F;science&#x2F;wear-...</a>')
