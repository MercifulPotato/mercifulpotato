Itâ€™s the biggest clusterfuck I have ever had to deal with. Unless you are a Microsoft Gold Partner and you simply buy every shit which your Microsoft Account Manager tells you then you have no reason to use Azure. Unlike the Google Cloud or AWS, Azure has not a single service which is unique or good in any particular way. On the other side, they have many services which are uniquely so bad that they are unusable in Azure.<p>Example of unique services in the GCloud: Spanner, Firestore, BigQuery,...<p>AWS: Face recognition service and other neat things<p>Uniquely fucked up in Azure: Functions, Web Apps, Storage, Application Insights (FML!), ... many many more')
