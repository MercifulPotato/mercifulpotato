Ranking posts according to some unexplainable algorithm which includes things like keyword extraction, often &quot;selfishly&quot; to favor engagement, has proven to be far from benign. I think it&#x27;s quite reasonable to say that as a platform exerts more of this control it should also assume more responsibility. If you&#x27;re not prepared to take on that responsibility, stick to strict chronological order and&#x2F;or <i>user defined</i> priorities.<p>I don&#x27;t particularly like it when Facebook (for example) buries content from my actual friends and family beneath posts that it thinks might be more engaging. They&#x27;re usually wrong, BTW; the moment I recognize it as an algorithmic promotion I scroll right past as quick as I can. They <i>certainly</i> shouldn&#x27;t be showing me stuff from pages and groups I never expressed an interest in. If I want to find new sources I&#x27;ll ask. If they do those things, they <i>are</i> acting as editors and publishers, and should be treated as such. There are still problems to be solved around groups people have already joined and ads and privacy, but if they&#x27;d at least stop pulling <i>every user</i> toward more extreme content - effectively recruiting for the worst of the worst - that would be positive.')
