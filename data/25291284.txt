Fighting it only makes the product more valuable, and the cartels more powerful.<p>In the Netherlands we have really good experience with legalisation. Cannabis is legal and hard drugs (or substitutes) are provided to long-term addicts only. It drives prices down, reducing black market profits and thus the power of cartels. Promotes legal vendors to abide by rules (or they&#x27;ll lose their license) and makes it possible to have checks on the products to make sure they&#x27;re safe, not mixed with real toxins. And the lower street price reduces crime around drugs (like theft, addicts stealing to pay for their hit)<p>Banning drug use by force is a US pipe dream. It&#x27;s impossible. All it provides is a pork barrel for drug agencies, weapons manufacturers etc. It escalates the price. They haven&#x27;t made a dent in the 40 years of the war on drugs. When the demand doesn&#x27;t cease, all you do is make the product more expensive and the ones that provide it more powerful.<p>PS: I never used drugs of any kind (except alcohol ;) )')
