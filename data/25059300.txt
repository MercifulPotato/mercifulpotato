He was going to be executed. He told the Japanese officer ordering the execution something to the effect of &#x27;You can kill my body but you can never kill my spirit. If you kill me, I will haunt you.&#x27; and they actually stopped the execution.<p>I wish I could remember his name or the documentary I saw that included him. There were other remarkable aspects to his story. Quite the example of sheer determination to survive.')
