Much of the early universe had conditions that were not as stable and favourable as the last 4 billion years.<p>I also think distance and time is preventing us from detecting any other like us, but I&#x27;m pretty sure some exists somewhere out there. It&#x27;s just that the reality of physics (even with more knowledge) prevents easy travel and contacts.<p>Another thing is that we have barely looked at the sky. The SETI project is very underfunded and most other projects have just recently started looking for planets and signatures that can indicate life (not intelligent life). Many think we have surveyed all of space in as much detail as our current technology allowed but we are _far_ from that.')
