It’s been feasible to do on-device for years[0][1].<p>&gt; That&#x27;s quite simple to check for.<p>It’s also quite simple to check that it happens, if you have a Google phone. It’s been done in front of me last year[2]. It’s been demonstrated to happen by other people than me, so you don’t have to rely on my word here[3].<p>&gt; a single person, ever, would have been able to furnish evidence of how this actually works.<p>I don’t think it’s easy to show how this works under the hood, since speech can be recognized on device and devices communicate with remote services very verbosely over HTTPS (probably with certificates pinned to prevent MITM) making it non-trivial to distinguish that traffic from background network activity. Recognized speech data doesn’t have to be communicated in real-time, in fact it would make sense to wait and batch it with other requests for efficiency.<p>(There’s a technical paper[4] that summarizes research in this direction as of 2019, and turns out it’s not trivial to definitely prove or disprove based on network activity.)<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ai.googleblog.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;03&#x2F;an-all-neural-on-device-speech.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ai.googleblog.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;03&#x2F;an-all-neural-on-device-sp...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;better-programming&#x2F;ios-speech-recognition-on-device-e9a54a4468b5" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;better-programming&#x2F;ios-speech-recognition...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25622659" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25622659</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vice.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;article&#x2F;wjbzzy&#x2F;your-phone-is-listening-and-its-not-paranoia" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vice.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;article&#x2F;wjbzzy&#x2F;your-phone-is-listeni...</a><p>[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;link.springer.com&#x2F;chapter&#x2F;10.1007&#x2F;978-3-030-22479-0_6#Sec16" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;link.springer.com&#x2F;chapter&#x2F;10.1007&#x2F;978-3-030-22479-0_...</a>')
