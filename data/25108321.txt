When the X-Ray came back clear, and a blood test showed high Uric Acid they were stunned.<p>Still, I had no further symptoms for several years. Then I had another, then it became a yearly thing and now I&#x27;m on Allopurinol permanently.<p>My doctors insist that I cut down my drinking (I don&#x27;t drink), my consumption of red meat (some, but not much) and a variety of other things which mostly don&#x27;t apply to me.<p>It&#x27;s in the family history - everyone on the male side of my family going back generations has had it. A great-something grandfather had attacks so bad that anyone even walking <i>near</i> his bed was threatened with a grisly end. I can certainly sympathise.<p>Trying to walk with a gouty foot is painful enough, but it&#x27;s made worse by how inconsiderate so many people are - so many people will walk into you, people on bikes, skateboards, one-wheels, etc ride directly towards you. Which makes you brace, slightly in the event they don&#x27;t swerve-away, which triggers another burst of pain from the bracing.<p>An uncle who has to use a walking stick at times complains of the same problem of appearing to be invisible to people on the streets, and of people brushing past and knocking against the walking stick.')
