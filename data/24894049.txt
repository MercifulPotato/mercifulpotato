I frequently catch myself doing it too.<p>It is clearly not in the interest of most people for functionality that youtube-dl offers to be illegal. In fact, most of the time it isn&#x27;t <i>really</i> illegal, in a <i>de facto</i> sense, since it is never acted upon and prosecuted.<p>However, sometimes a shady organization such as the RIAA acts upon this legal grey area and tries to push the needle in its own direction. When people then say &quot;There is actually nothing wrong with this, this is definitely not illegal.&quot;, they are actually making a political statement without realizing. They are really saying: this <i>shouldn&#x27;t</i> be illegal because it makes no sense that it is so. Since people actually hold all the power, this act makes this the reality in a way, but in order for this to completely materialize, the will of the people must first be focused so that it is reified into law.<p>The other problem is that the world is not the US and there are many jurisdictions where circumventing copyright protections and&#x2F;or downloading a media file for personal use are not problematic at all. This fact also often seeps into the discussion, but sometimes only implicitly, so people often talk past each other.')
