I thought &quot;people who don&#x27;t care about themselves eat unhealthily&quot; was a bit of a no-brainer. I started a clinical psychology course on EdX recently and the first exercise was Common Advice. They went on the say the only useful common advice to give to a depressed person is to tell them to go for a run, as that was the only correlation supported by evidence. A RUN! That&#x27;s so unhelpful that it&#x27;s actually a common joke between the depressed people that I&#x27;ve met. If you can&#x27;t get out of bed, you aren&#x27;t going to be able to go for a run.<p>Similarly, if you ruminate on horrible things every time you stop and think, you&#x27;re going to want to go on your phone late into the night until you&#x27;re so tired you can go straight to sleep. If you don&#x27;t even know if life is worth living, it&#x27;s quite hard to avoid eating that bag of chips. I thought these were obvious, but perhaps it&#x27;s not to people who&#x27;ve never experienced depression. Perhaps the reductionist view, as unhelpful as it is, plays into it too.')
