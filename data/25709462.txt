That seems pretty darn simple.<p>&gt; Consequently, the media mislabeling of the reign of terror campaign this summer doesn’t legitimize destroying communities because a few people were pissed off and corporations attended to add an air of legitimacy to it.<p>Engaging with any subjective representation of the protests I <i>am</i> talking about is outside the scope of what I&#x27;m willing to discuss—for those who&#x27;ve been subjected to it, I can&#x27;t compete with the right-wing media&#x27;s firehose of disinformation. My point about fatalities per participant-day stands as a metric of the violence during last summer&#x27;s protests compared to the riot last Wednesday, and you can take it or leave it.')
