Yet copyright law lags here.  My own opinion is that Controlled Digital Lending should become the norm, because it closely mirrors the way we already deal with lended print materials.<p>I know the Author&#x27;s Guild and most of the major publishers oppose CDL because they see it as a threat to their profits, but I feel more optimistic.  We already know that the lending model for print works just fine, and I see it as no more than a threat than that.<p>It may be the case that a hybrid model is possible, where libraries can either purchase an ebook at full price and practice CDL, or license it if that&#x27;s more cost-effective. Chances are that licensing will still make sense for all but the most in-demand works.')
