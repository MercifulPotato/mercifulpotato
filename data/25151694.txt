At the moment in Rust I can&#x27;t implement a type &quot;FIFO of depth N&quot; where is a generic, static parameter. My only choices are implementing &quot;FIFO of depth n&quot; where n is provided dynamically at runtime (and implemented internally using something like a VecDeque) or a completely fixed depth FIFO type that I need to duplicate for every depth (FIFO32, FIFO16, FIFO10 etc...).<p>If you require very high performance a dynamically checked FIFO can incur a fairly large overhead when a well optimized static FIFO can implement most operations in a couple of opcodes at most.')
