You&#x27;re generally matched against playes with a similar rating, and someone using a computer heavily would drastically inflate their rating. Which also increases the chance at detection significantly.<p>Computers are scary good at chess, it&#x27;s not exactly invisible if you use them to cheat. If you&#x27;re a beginner it&#x27;s also quite hard to understand <i>why</i> the computer makes certain moves, so if you just sprinkle in some computer moves in your game it&#x27;s likely you might just fail to capitalize on those moves because you don&#x27;t understand their purpose. The computer also plays some quite non-human moves at times, which is also likely to draw attention if someone is cheating a lot.<p>I&#x27;m not saying people don&#x27;t cheat online in chess, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s anywhere near prevalent enough to ruin the game.')
