It&#x27;d be interesting to know the scenario planning that went on before FB decided to place these ads:<p>1. What&#x27;s the risk that it backfires?  It&#x27;s pretty much guaranteed apple will respond if there&#x27;s any sense of negative apple sentiment (i.e. FB&#x27;s ads gain any meaningful traction).  Apple is on pretty strong ground I&#x27;d imagine: &quot;Here&#x27;s why we did what we did - let us explain what FB is doing...&quot;.  So FB&#x27;s ads might actually create an escalating war of words that has the side effect of increasing consumer awareness of tracking.<p>2. It&#x27;s such a material risk that FB have to do something, even given the backfire risk<p>3. FB is so resolute in it&#x27;s belief that what it&#x27;s doing is fine, and society just needs to suck up the reality of a post-privacy world<p>4. Something else.<p>Whatever the answer (and it&#x27;s probably far more nuanced than any above), it&#x27;s clearly hurting them.  Can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m sorry about that.<p>--<p>EDIT: fixed typos')
