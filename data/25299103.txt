Even the US (and most other western countries) doesn&#x27;t recognize taiwan as a nation for the purposes of WHO&#x2F;UN membership, so what&#x27;s he supposed to do? Try to make a political statement and say &quot;taiwan is a country too!&quot;, and piss off china in the process? What would such a statement achieve?<p>&gt;praises China<p>That&#x27;s also expected of an organization that&#x27;s basically reliant on other countries to cooperate (provide infection numbers, virus samples, etc.). Praise is cheap, and scolding China is counterproductive. China&#x27;s heavy handed measures to contain the outbreak might be a gross infringement of civil liberties, but from a public health perspective it was highly effective.')
