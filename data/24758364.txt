I had a web proxy written in Haskell some years back that implemented online, nested HTML and JS rewriting and injection, and I <i>was so close</i> to getting modern web apps like Facebook and Gmail to render perfectly. Server side rendered sites were feature complete, but sites using a virtual DOM required care to proxy out DOM builtins like createElement and setting attributes, and that surface area is quite large.<p>For sites using chunked transfer encoding, it worked on a chunk-by-chunk basis, as opposed to blocking until the entire document had been transferred to the proxy. The additional latency was just the time to parse a chunk. Orders of magnitude better perf than any of the web proxies that many of us on HN used as kids to subvert school network restrictions, and much better compatibility.<p>It&#x27;s a little sad my project never saw a release, but I would be very excited to see a company ship something very similar or even better.')
