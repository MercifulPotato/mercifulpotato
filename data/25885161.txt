The one thibg stands out the most (and is only referenced once, compare to multiple times for their grievences) is that they&#x27;re not looking to host one event a year on a Sunday, they want to allow racing 22 sunday&#x27;s a year (out of 52). Given the track is closed for many months of the year, I&#x27;m guessing what they&#x27;re really asking for is every week from April to september. Combined with the move from Tuesday to Thursday unmuffled for 20 weeks, it really means they want to change a race track which is a hobby track into a 4-day series for 5 months of the year.')
