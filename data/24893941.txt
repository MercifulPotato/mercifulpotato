What kinds of businesses tend to win?<p>Businesses which benefit Google and Google insiders. That means big corporations which Google has long term advertising deals with, VC-backed startups which Google plans to acquire at a discount and other businesses which have a connection to Google insiders (startup of the project manager&#x27;s friend, ...). I&#x27;m not suggesting that they tweak the algorithm to benefit specific websites (they probably don&#x27;t), but they tweak it to favor certain characteristics which, on the whole, benefit Google and Google insiders. Don&#x27;t forget that Google employees are not a representative sample of the population by any measure.<p>What kinds of businesses tend to lose?<p>Businesses that are not affiliated with Google or Google insiders. Independent projects.<p>The reason why people at Google don&#x27;t acknowledge that this is happening is because the harm is literally being inflicted on those businesses which are in Google&#x27;s blind spots so they don&#x27;t even see the problems... Except on rare occasions when they are shocked to realize that 50% of the population voted for Trump.')
