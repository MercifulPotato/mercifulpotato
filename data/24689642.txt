This approach allows you to instead target the items that you <i>don&#x27;t</i> want to constrain.<p>Additionally, as a more specific issue, the static-site generator that I use renders markdown such that images are inside a paragraph, so your approach wouldn&#x27;t work at all for me.<p><i></i>Edit<i></i>: As an aside, that&#x27;s a super fun site! Lots of neat little UI easter eggs.')
