I reviewed for NeurIPS this year, and almost all of the ethics sections consisted of vacuous stuff along the lines of &quot;uh, I guess...being efficient is good, might save some energy? and our method is pretty efficient, so that&#x27;s nice&quot;.<p>I think a system where area chairs skim abstracts and solicit these ethics paragraphs where they seem necessary -- so, not for the billionth paper obtaining pretty bounds for some variant of convex optimization -- makes more sense.<p>I know that &quot;think of the machine learning researchers!&quot; is not a take that engenders sympathy, but we&#x27;re probably talking thousands of human hours spent writing these things. It&#x27;s not nothing.')
