I&#x27;d like to get an electric car, but there&#x27;s no infrastructure anywhere near my area. My coal-addicted government (Australia) is definitely not making it a priority.<p>Electric cars are unsuitable for lots of people currently and do have significant negatives. If the infrastructure was there, then great. But it isn&#x27;t.<p>I wasn&#x27;t actually talking about electric cars though.
