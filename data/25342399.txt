If it were true, we should be closer to the median -- if not below it -- then we are.<p>I&#x27;m not honestly sure where you&#x27;re going with the Prohibition comparison; your anecdotal examples seem to be &quot;they&#x27;re telling you to follow these restrictions but they&#x27;re not following them themselves,&quot; which, okay, I guess, but they&#x27;re still just anecdotes. Is this &quot;they TOLD us not to have liquor during Prohibition, but there were county commissioners who were SNEAKING INTO SPEAKEASIES!&quot;? I mean, sure, probably, but the comparison kind of breaks down at that point. Prohibition was based on a puritanical moral panic; our current pandemic-era lockdowns are based on a very real, highly contagious lethal disease.')
