The deal made with communists in 1989 made sure that:<p>1. Communist party members never answered for their crimes, and were free to continue their political careers.<p>2. Compromised communist judges continued their service in courts, effectively granting communist scumbags immunity for their crimes. Crimes which included stealing huge amounts of money, which then were used for point 3:<p>3. The only two private TV networks, as well as biggest newspaper were owned&#x2F;controlled by former communist intelligence officers. This was a great propaganda platform.<p>You see, that&#x27;s a downside of peaceful revolutions: you never get a chance of permanently getting rid of your former rulers. Had generals Jaruzelski, Kiszczak and maybe two dozens other top ranking communist been executed in 1989 we might have avoided this mess.')
