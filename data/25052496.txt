The 12 core parts have 2 cores lasered out due to defects. If a particular node is low-yield, then it&#x27;s not super uncommon to double-up on some parts of the chip and use either the non-defective or best performing one. You&#x27;ll expect to see a combination of lasering and binning to adjust yields higher.<p>That said, TSMC N5 has a very good defect rate according to their slides on the subject[0]<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.anandtech.com&#x2F;show&#x2F;16028&#x2F;better-yield-on-5nm-than-7nm-tsmc-update-on-defect-rates-for-n5" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.anandtech.com&#x2F;show&#x2F;16028&#x2F;better-yield-on-5nm-tha...</a>')
