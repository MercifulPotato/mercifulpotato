We have complexity theory that tells us the metrics definitively. This just means for algorithm complexity formal rigor has been established.<p>For areas where we use the word &quot;design&quot; or &quot;best practices&quot;  or &quot;code organization&quot; it&#x27;s mostly people just randomly guessing things because there&#x27;s no quantitative metric to tell people whether or not a guess is actually better or worse. What&#x27;s the Big O of FP vs. OOP? Who knows?<p>Nobody is clear about what is being measured here. What makes a &quot;bad design&quot; bad and what makes a &quot;good design&quot; good? Once we figure it out you will see that the word &quot;design&quot; will largely exit the field and be replaced with something along the lines of &quot;calculation.&quot; It is better to &quot;calculate&quot; the best way to organize code rather then to &quot;design&quot; it because the word &quot;design&quot; is a synonym for &quot;random best guess&quot;.<p>The lack of formal rigor or some statistical metric means we can go into circular arguments about these topics forever.')
