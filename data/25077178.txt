And that code is easy to optimize, because it&#x27;s easy to make changes when you have a decent test support.<p>Now this software won&#x27;t be as fast as what&#x27;s possible, if that is needed the optimizations will turn it ugly again in many cases, but it will be decently fast. This all starts with good design, proper intuition about which algorithms to use, and a good dose of creative problem solving.')
