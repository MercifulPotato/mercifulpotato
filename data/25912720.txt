Neither of which they have much control over.<p>I would be more worried if people at Signal were not thinking about this, debating the issues and reflecting on the direction of their product.<p>I thought the article (despite the over-egged headline) was interesting and not particularly hysterical.<p>What I don’t see here is anyone actually suggesting they compromise E2E or any of the fundamentals of the product that we like in Signal.<p>I feel strongly that Signal needs to stay moving in the direction it’s heading - which is to be a no-bullshit, secure, E2E encrypted, reliable and open platform with none of the data-hoarding of its rivals.<p>I do not see any harm in Signal self-reflecting <i>in particular</i> in light of recent events.<p>A “head in the sand” approach seems worse. I’m surprised by the cynical comments here so far. How about we take a charitable read of this?')
