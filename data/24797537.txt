To have power over others, tell them what to do. Due to monopolization and centralization, there are fewer and fewer spots to do it in a constructive way (found your own company?).<p>Except if you claim that you&#x27;re offended, you&#x27;re suddenly given the right to control what others say. If you claim that you are fighting racism&#x2F;sexism&#x2F;etc, you&#x27;re shielded from 90% of critique. So this &quot;safe haven&quot; has attracted all kinds of opportunists that just enjoy attacking others to feel better about themselves.<p>Look at your typical BLM protestors. It&#x27;s not Black doctors protesting against being treated differently from White doctors. It&#x27;s unhappy people from both races that have found an uncriticizable cause to justify their own disappointment in life.')
