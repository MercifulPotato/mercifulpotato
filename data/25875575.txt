With video chat you can read facial expressions, cut down on overlapping speech and interruptions, etc.&quot;<p>this just screams &quot;citation needed.&quot;<p>a planar, poorly lit, relatively low resolution video image doesn&#x27;t provide enough detail to read expressions nearly as well as you can in person. it&#x27;s actually much easier to misread expressions over video than just listening to voices, because we can focus much more on voice and it requires much less bandwidth to provide roughly equivalent clarity as speaking in person. long distance discussions, debates, and negotiations have happened just fine for decades without video.<p>as for interruptions, millions of years of social conditioning seems to suffice at allowing us to negotiate overlap adequately. besides, simple technology like a wish-to-speak signal can be employed if need be (though they&#x27;re unnecessary).')
