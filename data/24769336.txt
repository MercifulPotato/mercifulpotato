Different parts have different attractions.   When I met my wife we both lived near by Fairfax &amp; 3rd, which meant I could walk to her apartment.  What didn&#x27;t occur to me at the time was that we lived close to each other because we liked a lot of the same things and had similar life priorities.  In retrospect location was a sorting mechanism that worked great for us.')
