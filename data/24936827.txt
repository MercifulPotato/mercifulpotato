Everyone has an angle and everyone is using their platform to push their angle. But personally I don&#x27;t feel I have a hard time determining truth to a high degree of accuracy. A well-honed power of Inference to the Best Explanation is a superpower in today&#x27;s disinformation economy. Truth has a way of fitting together cleanly without loose ends and without unexplainable coincidences. Fabricated stories have rough edges and requires leaps of faith. These leaps are easy for true believers to make, which is why the media environment seems so splintered.<p>Train your ability to model the world and judge whether new information fits with the current model or requires substantial revision. This is a powerful guide to whether the new information is true. Of course, this requires you have the ability to dispassionately analyze information and judge how well events fit together. If you&#x27;re a partisan or an emotional thinker, IBE won&#x27;t do you any good. The truth is available for those who are capable of dispassionate analysis.
