If government wanted rules, they can just legislate directly instead of delegating to a regulator.<p>Large motivation to create regulatory bodies is expertise and focus on one (or more related) subject, and these regulatory bodies often simply recommend to the government&#x2F;legislators and do the management the law mandates.<p>IMHO this &#x27;suggestive&#x27; mode of operation is not usual outside of finance.
