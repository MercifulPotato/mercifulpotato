But they said sold in the past year. I dont know how anyone else would interpret it, but in financial and analytics that is very clearly implying unit sold.<p>Your [1] is Laptop with Tablet, total Laptop market is about $100B, although this year we might see a sharp increase cause of pandemic.<p>Let say there are $10 Gaming Laptop market.

So your hypothesis of &quot;All Gaming Laptop&quot; would be faster than M1 gives you roughly 3.3% of the Marketshare. Not too far off 2%.<p>And all of that is before we put any performance number into comparison.')
