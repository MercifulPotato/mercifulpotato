Constant game of whack-a-mole that everyone quickly grew tired of. Also more indexes increases the slope of the line for insert operations as data size grows.<p>Another solution is tombstoning data so you never actually do a DELETE, and partial indexes go a long way to making that scale. It removes the logn cost of all of the dead data on every subsequent insert.')
