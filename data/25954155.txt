It may have additional benefits that you point out such as quickly computing if you&#x27;re inside&#x2F;outside or being able to more easily deform the shape (through any number of procedures including slicing), but you&#x27;d probably use a density grid instead of a SDF if you&#x27;re dealing with anything volumetric, such as clouds or smoke.<p>&gt; You don&#x27;t. I didn&#x27;t notice render times, but &quot;interactive frame rates&quot; would be lacking.<p>Yeah definitely, poor wording on my part.<p>&gt; Most SDF primitives and their compositions are not analytic (from use of abs, fract, etc). Differentiation by finite differences is most common. Few are using automatic differentiation. I don&#x27;t quite follow how back prop would produce the surface gradient, but I doubt it would be faster than these methods.<p>I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;re talking about the same thing, I&#x27;m not referring to the surface gradient when I say differentiable rendering.<p>Both differentiable rendering with an SDF (i.e. SDFDiff <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;1912.07109.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;1912.07109.pdf</a>) and with a neural SDF(DIST <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;b1ueber2y.me&#x2F;projects&#x2F;DIST-Renderer&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;b1ueber2y.me&#x2F;projects&#x2F;DIST-Renderer&#x2F;</a>) use automatic differentiation to compute the gradient of the rendering&#x2F;image-generating process. Section 3.4 in the DIST paper discusses where back prop comes into all of this. Basically your surface is defined by the weights of some neural net (i.e. a neural SDF) and you need to know the gradient of your image with respect to those weights.<p>For a variety of reasons, these surface representations are easier to handle than triangle meshes which break certain desirable properties for differentiation and require extra care as a result (see edge sampling <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;people.csail.mit.edu&#x2F;tzumao&#x2F;diffrt&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;people.csail.mit.edu&#x2F;tzumao&#x2F;diffrt&#x2F;</a> for an early example of the challenges of doing differentiable rendering with a triangle mesh).')
