In the last few days I have done that. I used to have a favorable impression of it (perhaps based on ignorance?). But I think that, at least nowadays, it&#x27;s not a terribly serious source -- a lot of polemicism and ideological edits, and its statement of purpose is explicit that it wants to have &quot;snark&quot; to make the articles &quot;less boring&quot;. I think we might be debating something which is more the domain of teenagers when I suspect we&#x27;re both at least in our 30s.')
