But scientists point out they don&#x27;t know how effective it is, and&#x2F;or how long lasting it is.<p>It&#x27;s very clear newspapers have been way to casual with admitting natural immunity.<p>If you want some fairly clear evidence of this, if you were gonna ask a 1000 people whether they were immune if they got the virus and recovered from it, I suspect 999 of them would say yes. And you wouldnt get those numbers if newspapers were stating the opposite.<p>What the rest of your comment ignores is that we actually don&#x27;t know whether people who are immune, can nevertheless transmit the disease. Furthermore, false positives do exist.<p>In fact, even people who are vaccinated will be advised to wear masks, because we do not know whether the vaccine prevents spread, or if it only protects the vaccinated. The Pfizer and Moderna trials did not factor this in their testing at all. I am not sure about the AstraZeneca one, but their trials have had a lot of issues anyways. And no other vaccine&#x27;s trials have been completed yet.')
