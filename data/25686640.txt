Chat history sits somewhere between speaking IRL and sending letters (but to be clear, is not a simple combination; it&#x27;s its own thing) and nobody burns their letters when they move to a new house.<p>People <i>do</i> burn their letters for valid reasons (or use more naturally ephemeral media like phone calls, talking IRL, or Signal&#x27;s disappearing messages) but those reasons are orthogonal to moving house or getting a new phone.<p>In any case, if people want to save chat history, the appropriate response is to support that requirement rather than to tell users that no, we&#x27;ve decided that they actually do not want to do that.')
