Most people use Gmail&#x2F;Google for personal life,  maybe MS email&#x2F;calendars for work life which is not particularly sensitive data.<p>&gt; Microsoft may be seen as less privacy-invading than Google or, alternatively, scolded for all the ads, Cortana being creepy, them pushing everyone towards Bing, and requiring internet connectivity for playing simple games that used to come with Windows for free.<p>Showing ads in Windows doesn&#x27;t mean they&#x27;re personalized to you or based on any data. Cortana being creepy?? MS wants to push their own search engine, really??<p>Bigger picture, Microsoft&#x27;s business model has historically never been reliant on ads. I don&#x27;t see why they would move into collecting data when they have no need to and there is so much cultural backlash against it.')
