Write durability does not matter, SSD manufacturers reduce rewrite count with every new generation in the name of the cheaper prices and users are happy to accept that downgrade (see Samsung 980 Pro vs Samsung 970 Pro for a recent occasion).<p>The odd thing about rewrite count is that it shrinks very quickly the bigger your drive is. In the past you used to have a 128GB boot SSD and install a few games on it. This meant that you constantly deleted and reinstalled games on that low capacity SSD increasing the rewrite count.<p>Nowadays you can get 500GB SSDs for a decent price. If you can install every game then you might never have to rewrite data on it through uninstallation&#x2F;installation. A lot of files are only written once and then never changed. With greater capacity you can have more &quot;write once&quot; files.')
