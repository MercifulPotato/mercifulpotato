I&#x27;d be happier if we could reach the high levels of countries like Sweden and Denmark, but we&#x27;re nowhere near the bottom of the list.<p>Anecdotally: I&#x27;ve noticed a sharp increase in cynicism from the young people I mentor. Most of it can be traced back to social media, especially Reddit. There&#x27;s a strange trend where young people are convinced that they understand how the world works based on hyperbolic Reddit clickbait that hits the front page. It&#x27;s bizarre to have young people try to lecture me about how companies are evil, managers are manipulative, HR is out to get them, and that ghosting a company is totally fine because the company can fire them at any moment, all before they&#x27;ve even graduated and entered the workforce.<p>I spend a lot of time educating young people about the importance of professional reputation, how to watch out for their own interests without assuming the worst from everyone, and how work relationships aren&#x27;t inherently exploitative. It&#x27;s an uphill battle against the onslaught of social media cynicism, though.')
