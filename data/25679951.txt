The main thing is that how would you know if there was election fraud? There would be some evidence. You might see poll workers acting strangely around ballots. You might have ballots without a proper chain of custody. You might have reports by poll watchers that they weren&#x27;t allowed to do their jobs. Well, all of those are present. So we have reason to suspect there might have been vote fraud. Its that simple.<p>&gt; That’s very interesting, why don’t you trust people to be honest?<p>Because they are capable of dishonesty so there&#x27;s no reason to assume they are trustworthy. The same reason I lock my door at night and use long passwords on my accounts.<p>&gt; I personally believe in the good of people, that &gt;90% of people are good people who want to do the right thing.<p>My understanding of human nature leads me to consider that naive. Please don&#x27;t take offense, I&#x27;m just being forthright.<p>&gt; So when people without skin in the game or anti-Biden people say there was no election fraud, I trust them.<p>Thats a different kind of error, how would those people be in a position to know if there was fraud?<p>&gt; This is why I believe Raffensperger. But I’d be very interested to hear why you don’t trust people you don’t know?<p>Because they haven&#x27;t earned my trust. They haven&#x27;t shown any reason to be trustworthy. People lie and cheat all the time. Sometimes they even lie, cheat, and steal when its easier and more productive to be honest. Since people lie cheat and steal, if you show me a person, I&#x27;m going to be aware of their potential to lie, cheat, and steal. Its that simple.')
