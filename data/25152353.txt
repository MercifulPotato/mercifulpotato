Item(by='veddox', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605809360, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25150885, text='&gt; But the real issue still stands: Bio is hyper complex and it takes a long time to get used to the nomenclature and ideas.<p>That is exactly the point, which I believe the article author either glossed over or didn&#x27;t fully appreciate.<p>I have a B.Sc. in general biology and am about to get my M.Sc. in ecology. I do scientific work at a university and read (ecological) research papers every day. Out of curiosity, I just followed joshuamcginnis&#x27; advice and did the Google Scholar search.<p>I failed to understand the first three items that came up.<p>The basic principles of biology are usually not actually that complicated, at least when you compare them to particle physics or compiler design or stuff like that. But biology is still hugely, hugely <i>complex</i>, because you simply have <i>so many</i> interacting parts - and yes, you only really understand it when you know about an appreciable fraction of those parts.<p>That is why they spent the first 1.5 years of our degree simply drilling knowledge into us as fast as we could absorb it. Because it&#x27;s only once you have a broad overview of how everything works, that you can start to grasp (and reason about) how anything works in detail.<p>Biology is fascinating. There are millions of cool things to learn and yes, most teachers could probably do a much better job of teaching it. But if you really want to <i>understand</i> it, you just have to put in the effort.')
