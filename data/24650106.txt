I&#x27;ve never formally trained myself in woodworking and I&#x27;m pretty good at it. I could definately replicate what this guy did if I had the time and money. My wife and I have a book collection that currently lives on eight 2.5 metre high by 1 metre wide Oak bookcases that fully line two walls of our living room (which we call the Library). Each unit has 8 shelves (so 64 metres-ish of book space). All built by my fair hand.<p>The trick is to plan, and to plan well. being able to mock things up in a basic CAD package is a must. I use an old copy of Sketchup (the offline version) and it does me.<p>After that it&#x27;s tools. Bad tools make for a bad job. If you can, spend money on good tools, but only buy what you <i>need</i> for that job.  After a few years, you&#x27;ll have a workshop full of nice kit that enables you to tackle anything. Once you learn what your tools can do, you suddenly realise how many projects are now accessible. It&#x27;s a bit like getting a 3D printer and realising how many things you can now build or fix!<p>Finally, <i>measure twice and cut once</i>. This is your mantra. Accuracy is everything.  If you are not sure, cut the wood slightly too big and trim off until it fits - it&#x27;s easy to make a bit of wood smaller, it&#x27;s impossible to make it bigger.<p>I&#x27;ve also designed, built and fitted our kitchen (that&#x27;s all Oak also), and the desk units in the study (where I&#x27;m typing this) plus numerous other projects to long to list.<p>If I could give up IT and do woodworking everyday, I would.')
