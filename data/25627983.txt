Gtk is maintained and he only said it has few maintainers.<p>Calling the adwaita theme “cringey” seems silly to me. The latest Mac default style is very similar. Windows “native” look and feel is a joke. A ton of popular apps don’t care about native look anyways they just want their branding.<p>Qt just tried to pull some crap again with their licensing too.<p>I appreciate the author because I like nim and gtk development. He even fixed an issue for me last year when I was trying these bindings out.<p>I don’t agree with his slightly pessimistic view though. There are a lot of new  people learning it right now spurred by the new phones and mobile Linux desktop ends.<p>It’s true the main appeal is to people who like their default styling and the gnome desktop')
