Probably more like the original Macbook Air.<p>The original Air created the class of ultrabooks which made the bulky Windows laptops at the time obsolete for average users.<p>The new M1 Air has created a class of laptops with ultrabook bodies, but remains cool to the touch under load without sacrificing much in performance and having 16+ hours of battery life.<p>Like the original Air the new one has basically made every ~$1,000 Windows laptop obsolete. Even really nice ones like the Dell XPS 13 have worse battery life and performance while reaching CPU temperatures as high as 100 Â°C.')
