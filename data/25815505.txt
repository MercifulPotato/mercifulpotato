I find playing against programs very frustrating, because as you tweak the controls they tend to go very quickly from obviously brain-damaged to utterly inscrutable. Win by a mile or lose by a mile, don&#x27;t learn much either way. Sometimes there&#x27;s a very thin band in between that&#x27;s the worst of both worlds: generally way above my own level, but every once in a while they&#x27;ll just throw away a piece in the most obvious possible way. If a human did that I&#x27;d interpret it as toying with me, or taunting.<p>This kind of program seems like it would be much more satisfying to play just for fun, and perhaps (with a bit more analysis support) better still as a coaching tool.')
