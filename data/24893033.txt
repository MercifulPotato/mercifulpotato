If you don’t like Twitter’s policies, don’t use their website.<p>On one hand yes, but on the other, does that also apply to other services? Can I open a shop only for &lt;insert skin color&gt; people only and claim that if you don&#x27;t like it, go somewhere else? How about other categories, protected or otherwise? As a society, we already agree that there are some freedoms that private businesses are denied, and for good reasons, because when taken to the extremes, you end up with this: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Nur_f%C3%BCr_Deutsche" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Nur_f%C3%BCr_Deutsche</a>.<p>&gt; A social media platform banning certain content is different. Just as we have alt right media sources such as Breitbart, nothing is preventing you from starting your own social media platform, with whatever content you want or don’t want.<p>Not really - you can start your own media outlet and selectively run the stories you want, that&#x27;s fine. But if you just regurgitate user-generated content, IMO you better be really careful about applying your own rules consistently and in a transparent manner.')
