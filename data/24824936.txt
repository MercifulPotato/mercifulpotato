The data haven&#x27;t been lost because of a bug in some 3rd party code.<p>Data security and safety is always a process, there is no magic bullet you can buy and be done with it, with no effort of your own.<p>The swiss cheese model shows this - some of the cheese layers are safeguards put in place by the vendor, the others are there for you to put in place (e.g. the various best practices, safe work procedures, backups, etc.) If you don&#x27;t, well, you are making the holes easier to align because there are now fewer safety layers between you and the disaster.
