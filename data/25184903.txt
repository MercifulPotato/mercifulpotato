I understand basic genetics mechanisms and how mrna works inside cells. In shot form, I assume the modified mrna strands are floating through the blood stream. What happens after the injection?<p>Btw .. I think public health needs to start educating people on how these things work in order to get high coverage. I am alarmed at the number of highly educated people I know who seem suspicious. This fear is just borne by a lack of understanding and can be corrected IMHO.')
