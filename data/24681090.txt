Potholes for miles, yes. Rail that breaks down daily, yes. Water systems that are one bad rain away from poisoning everyone or flooding a million people out of their homes, yes.<p>&gt; <i>They can&#x27;t point to one city or town and say this city is no more because they couldn&#x27;t afford their infrastructure.</i><p>Literally every city I look at can&#x27;t afford upkeep on its infrastructure. They sidestep this by just not paying for all of the needed maintenance and only ever dealing with the worst emergencies using state and federal emergency grants. That&#x27;s very much not the same thing as everything being peachy.<p>&gt; <i>In that time we haven&#x27;t really seen any municipality go bankrupt</i><p>Only half of states even allow municipal bankruptcy by law, and _many_ cities require more money to come in from outside than they are able to generate themselves.')
