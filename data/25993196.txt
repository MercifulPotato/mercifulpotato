I still have depression, but starting on ADHD medication all-but-removed my most frequent trigger.<p>I had the same issue!<p>I told my prescribing doctor this same thing and she trusted me enough to try out Adderall before SSRIs again. Turns out my hypothesis of my depression + anxiety largely being tied to my sense of productivity was right.<p>After going in for an EKG check-up on orders of the prescribing doctor, I found a fairly benign heart issue that the cardiologist believes may be the cause of my &quot;panic attacks&quot; (eg: my attacks may be heart racing -&gt; panic, not panic -&gt; heart racing!)<p>All of that from just treating &quot;I feel bad because I get nothing done&quot;.')
