This is open at the ISA, PCB and software level, not the chip RTL.<p>Still, it is a step forward.<p>For something more open at the RTL level, I&#x27;d look at Precuror (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.crowdsupply.com&#x2F;sutajio-kosagi&#x2F;precursor" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.crowdsupply.com&#x2F;sutajio-kosagi&#x2F;precursor</a>) right now.<p>Speaking as someone at Beagle, we see this board as an important step to more openness in the ecosystem, especially helping software developers improve the state of open source for RISC-V. It is also just a really cool board. Beagle will do more to try to get more openness at the RTL-level moving forward, perhaps even with FPGA boards at an interim step. The shuttle services are starting to make releasing a new chip design in reasonably modern nodes more possible.')
