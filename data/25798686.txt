What you&#x27;re describing is the type of front-end development that goes on at the organizations that actually develop these frameworks.<p>The vast majority of front-end development outside of that world is misguidedly trying to mimic that complexity on their static business informational page they maintain with a duct taped mess of bad practices everywhere.<p>Now if you take a look at development outside of front-end and go to some large non-tech, mid-sized, or small business you&#x27;ll probably also find poor practices (from my experience), but nothing like the mess I see in these \nsame  organizations trying front-end development now.')
