I have a Model 3, and after I read your comment, I <i>tried</i> to block my view of the speedometer with my right hand and couldn&#x27;t do it. I tried sitting closer and farther back, higher and lower. I tried every position on the steering wheel. I flared my elbows out. I tried to imagine my hands and wrists were twice the size. I just don&#x27;t see how this is possible. I&#x27;d love to see a POV pic from your friend that illustrates the problem. For my money, having the speedometer on the central screen makes it <i>more</i> visible. My view of a conventional dash is always partially blocked by the steering wheel.')
