New theories are usually rejected and ridiculed until&#x2F;if they develop enough evidence behind them to sway people.<p>Some careers are destroyed. Some scientists are only vindicated posthumously. The process can take many decades.<p>Scientists, like most humans, are not that open-minded and are subject to the same group-think blind spots. I think if we could get better at being open-minded as a species, we&#x27;d make faster progress and better ideas would win out more often. This is as much true in society at large, or business, as it is in science.')
