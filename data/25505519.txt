Google is an advertising company <i>not</i> an IT company. Yes they use and create a lot of technology but they don’t get paid for any of it. They get paid for advertising. They’re an advertising company and they do their best advertising for themselves. Their public image is a very carefully crafted one. I interviewed with them years ago and they are very fake, Disneyland type fake. It was clear that things were very deliberately set up in a way to make a particular impression. It wasn’t the obvious things like a company’s logo in the lobby is put there to make a deliberate impression that you’ve arrived at the correct company which is obvious and served a clear purpose but small things that aren’t meant to be noticed. Just one of many examples, I was waiting in a lobby for my next interview. It was a fairly standard corporate lobby except I look to my right and there’s this purple, Dr Seuss looking phone. Something you’d find in a toy store. The initial impression was, “oh those kooky Google engineers. One of them must have thought this would be cute and brought it in”. It looked like it had never been touched and probably hadn’t. The thing is if you went to another building you’d find the same stupid purple phone. Someone from HR went out and probably bought a dozen of these things and spread them about.<p>That wasn’t the only thing. That kind of crap was everywhere if you looked for it and I’m willing to bet that kind of crap and thinking went all the way to the top.')
