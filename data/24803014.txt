The laptop was lost in 2019, but the emails are from 2015. At some point they were on his company&#x27;s mail servers, though whether they&#x27;re still there would depend on their mail retention policy, which in my experience is often as short as 2 years. Even if they do still have it, going from campaign to Hunter Biden to ??? to IT personnel can take awhile.<p>&gt; Who gave them this role? I certainly didn&#x27;t and I will donate to anyone who supports taking this role from them.<p>I mean, if you&#x27;re on Facebook&#x2F;Twitter&#x2F;etc, you are giving them this role, it&#x27;s just a tradeoff you find acceptable for convenience.')
