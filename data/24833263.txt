I honestly have to say it&#x27;s my number-one most hated software program in my life.  Exceeding even the sins of Adobe and Microsoft.<p>It made most of the collaboration work I was trying to do &quot;here, let&#x27;s just send a file&quot; that&#x27;d be trivial on AIM&#x2F;MSN&#x2F;etc, into an huge ordeal (oh, I guess we better use a pastebin - er, whoops, that&#x27;s too big for the pastebin, better set up our own ftp to transfer stuff)...  Just tons of things that were trivial matters on other platforms were serious work on IRC.<p>And to top it all off - to add insult to injury, it had frequent, <i>invisible</i> quality-of-service errors.  It wouldn&#x27;t have been so bad if they were obvious, but they were completely silent &quot;failures to send messages&quot;.  Only much later, when I had some bouncers and was logged into a server on multiple accounts, did I realize how bad the QoS was - entire chunks of conversations would just fail to get sent in some cases, leading to spectacular miscommunications, and just honestly screwing up some basic human&lt;-&gt;human conversational expectations (often making many people seem really rude).<p>That&#x27;s the thing that just boggles me - it wouldn&#x27;t be so bad to have a really awful, rudimentary UI if the underlying service was reliable - if there was any tradeoff making it worth it - but it wasn&#x27;t a &quot;you get this bad part in exchange for this other thing being better&quot;.  It was just all bad - terrible reliability, terrible UI, broken features, etc etc.<p>---<p>The worst part was getting gaslit by other project members desperately trying to pretend it was anything but garbage.  If we want open-source software to be great, then the very first &quot;step one&quot; we need to buy into is doing an honest take on what we&#x27;ve already got, and not trying to pretend a Trabant is a Tesla just because it&#x27;s on the open-source team and it&#x27;s all we&#x27;ve got.  That is: we must not evince loyalty to a terrible program simply because it&#x27;s the only OSS&#x2F;Decentralized&#x2F;etc entrant into a field.   If it&#x27;s trash, acknowledge it&#x27;s trash and get to work building something great that fits the ideology.<p>Because otherwise something like Discord will win, decisively, and adherents to [xyz_progressive_software_ideology] will lose, and lose really badly because they&#x27;ll be decades behind the curve, rather than neck-and-neck, or even, ahead (as firefox was for a while back in the IE days).<p>That attitude is the achilles heel of OSS.  It&#x27;s why we can&#x27;t have nice things.')
