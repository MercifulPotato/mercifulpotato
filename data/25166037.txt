Where you live inside the U.S. has a huge impact on how &quot;new&quot; the available medical equipment is and how &quot;knowledgeable&quot; your local experts are.<p>What&#x27;s more, most insurance is not generous. The insurer becomes the rationer of care by requiring value interventions before more expensive ones. Essentially any interest a state has in reducing costs an insurance company also already has. The main difference is that the insurance pool is probably healthier than the &quot;everybody&quot; pool.<p>Lastly, even if it is true America&#x27;s system features better cutting edge medicine, I really doubt making the system less profit motivated would affect global health innovation. Perhaps a bit but quickly governments would realize they are going to have to invest in research more rather than purchase innovations from the U.S. This may actually increase the value proposition of research because there would no longer be a single locus drawing all competition for specialized labor.')
