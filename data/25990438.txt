Item(by='sriku', descendants=None, kids=[25990871], score=None, time=1612198786, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25979036, text='The comparison seems fair .. in the sense that property tax serves to cover the cost to society of the property existing, just as &quot;IP tax&quot; would be to cover the cost to society of protecting the &quot;IP&quot;.  Looks like such a tax would also separate the concern of protection, from the concern of exploitation of the IP. But I can&#x27;t imagine how one would tax created IP .. at least in property, there is some sense of &quot;market value&quot;, which is anybody&#x27;s guess when it comes to IP.<p>edit: Maybe IP can be assigned &quot;shares&quot; in wealth injected into the market?')
