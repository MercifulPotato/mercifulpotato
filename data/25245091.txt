The problem is not the advice given... But that you have not provided enough information or inputs into the calculation.<p>How old are you?\nWhere do you live?\nWhat are expenses and costs where you live?\nDo you have other sources of income?<p>You should hire a financial advisor or planner versed in these matters. More than anything they are behavioral coaches who will tell you what you can and can&#x27;t do.<p>You should build an annuity calculator in a spreadsheet and add conservative growth assumptions and agressive spending assumptions where you may have unexpected medical expenses for example.')
