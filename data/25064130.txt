It took over 8 weeks and by the time it was done it was at least 1-2 weeks overdue.  And a lot of the work was done between 10pm - 2am when everybody was asleep, which took away from my sleep!<p>I&#x27;m still glad I built it (now that it&#x27;s done!), but yes, outsourcing it certainly would have been the correct choice.')
