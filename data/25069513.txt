Back when it was in effect, it bled these writedown-refusers to death.<p>Unfortunately it got repealed by Zero Interest Rate Policy.<p>In a sense, that&#x27;s what interest rates are: they&#x27;re the penalty function applied to stuborn-refusal-to-write-down.  If rates are too high a bunch of startups get killed needlessly by capital asphyxiation.  If rates are too low (like now) you get zombies.')
