An inscrutable, black-box ML model has. While such an algorithm could ideally predict protein folding in any case, it can&#x27;t explain anything about why, and therefore can&#x27;t really advance the science.<p>An analogy might be that if you trained an AI model on billiard balls, it could become really good at telling you where a ball will end up when you hit it, but it could never tell you that the reason is that f=m*a, meaning it will do nothing to advance the science.')
