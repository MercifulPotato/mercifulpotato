Only over the last few weeks has this hope been thoroughly squashed.<p>&quot;The Swedish experiment&quot; which was not based on precaution but more on hopes has definitely failed.<p>It doesn&#x27;t stop a lot of Swedes from sticking to the official narrative (with a fervor), but it should not fool anyone by now.')
