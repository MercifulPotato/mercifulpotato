Look at why drunk driving is a much larger problem in the US than other places.<p>2. Is there stuff we can do to fix the discrepancy in the US.<p>3. Can the perpetrator of harm in society be a part of fixing the harm they have done, and preventing more harm in society.<p>I think punitive justice is just the easy way out and never addresses the roots of the problems.<p>For example, imagine instead of jailing people for 15 years, we used that money to subsidize lyft&#x2F;uber rides of 18-25 year olds when they were detected to be near bars.
