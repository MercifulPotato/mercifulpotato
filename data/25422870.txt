Defer doesn&#x27;t give you anything that you can&#x27;t already do. In your last four code blocks, you demonstrated three alternate ways to implement the functionality you want without defer. Defer is just a slightly different, arguably nicer fourth way to implement the same code.<p>Language features should be orthogonal. A new language feature should add something that is not possible or extremely painful to do with the existing language features. I just don&#x27;t see how these minor syntax adjustments warrant a new feature, especially one with as much complexity and corner cases as this defer proposal.<p>(The real answer to &quot;why defer?&quot;, of course, is that the authors need it to implement panic&#x2F;recover. This proposal should stop masquerading as a defer mechanism for C and instead call itself what it really is: exceptions for C.)')
