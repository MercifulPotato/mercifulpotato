They took credit for VOD sales that hadn’t happened but were just optimistic projections. Your point still holds though that there are different checks and balances between public and private organizations. Public checks are at the voting booth, private (publicly traded) companies checks are at the stock exchange. Your claim is no different for public orgs, the time-scale is just different. It’s like challenging for an example of an unsustainable govt keeping its prominence for centuries. Unsustainable practices eventually have their reckoning regardless if they are public or private.<p>Are there examples of governments hiding account details that are illegal yet allowed to continue once uncovered?')
