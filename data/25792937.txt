Most reviews I see on Youtube discuss gaming performance and not things like having multiple VMs, docker &#x2F; Kube clusters, IDEs, emulators, open at the same time.<p>Processors I am considering are -<p>AMD Ryzen 3900x (12C,24T) 540 USD\nAMD Ryzen 5900x (12C,24T) 765 USD (least preferred)\nAMD Ryzen 5800x (8C,16T) 560 USD\nIntel i7 10850K (10C,20T) 520 USD (not GPU required)<p>My work primarily involves Java, Android &amp; DevOps running etc. I usually have multiple VMs, docker containers running at the same time for testing on various OS, things like pihole, pfsense etc. I am not from the US, so this is really expensive purchase that I am hoping to use for 5-8 years.<p>Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks.')
