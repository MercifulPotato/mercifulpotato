I already anticipated your issue with naming being that few people used named cells&#x2F;ranges -- again, it&#x27;s not even in a menu or ribbon, it&#x27;s present at all times, what else do you want? Not &quot;the way it&#x27;s taught&quot;? Well, blame your teacher.<p>&gt; You have to have variable names in Python<p>sure, but `(i, j, k)` isn&#x27;t any more descriptive than A1 or B7 or CQ85759. `intOrderTotal` may seem better initially, until the summer intern creates `intOrderFinalTotal` (after tax) and `intOrderAllInFinalTotal` (after shipping and tax)<p>&gt; every cell in a range has its own unique formula<p>you could use array formulas, or were you never taught those either?<p>&gt; it&#x27;s not the default behavior, takes extra steps,<p>Creating a Python virtual environment is not the default behavior, and it takes extra steps. So does using any packages beyond the standard library. So does source control. Or running Jupyter. Using classes, or type hints, or imports, are all not the &quot;default&quot; of one long script in a single file.<p>Excel isn&#x27;t superior to Python, or the best tool to solve every type of problem. Excel has its place, Python has its place. But your specific little nitpicks here are a reflection of the user (who I presume is you) not on the tool itself.')
