I&#x27;ve posted no ad-hominem.  I did however pointed out the following facts:<p>* blog posts and general social media blurbs posted by anonymous or pseudo-anonymous users are not references.  They are somewhere between tertiary sources and bullshit made-up nonsense.<p>* the use of the &quot;grannypuncher69&quot; handle was intended to illustrate how ridiculous it is to pass off random social media posts made by anonymous&#x2F;pseudo-anonymous users as authoritative sources.<p>* Primary sources, or at most secondary well-established sources, are the only acceptable forms of references, specially regarding scientific and technical subjects.<p>* if no primary or secondary source exists then it&#x27;s pretty clear that the original claims are bullshit.<p>If you have a hard time following this then I&#x27;m sorry to tell you but your problem is linked with your inability to substantiate your claims, not your need to spin this fact into personal attacks directed at those who point any of the gaping holes in your reasoning.')
