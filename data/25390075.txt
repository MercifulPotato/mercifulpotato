It&#x27;s not a good thing that huge swaths of the population are dying. We won&#x27;t be inherently more resilient to diseases in the short term just because all the vulnerable people are dead.<p>For one, we don&#x27;t even understand all the long term effects of having COVID as it is: there&#x27;s heart damage, lung damage, brain damage, extended fatigue, and that&#x27;s just what we&#x27;re seeing evidence of now. [0]<p>If another disease like COVID strikes in a couple years, it could still tear through the surviving population and cause similar long lasting effects. The thousands that&#x27;re suffering a terrible death daily, separated from their families and straining our healthcare systems to the breaking point--their deaths are not somehow making our populaitons safer from another disease.<p>EDIT: your analogy also supposes it&#x27;s somehow the old&#x2F;vulnerable populations that&#x27;re the reservoir for the virus in our populations, when data indicates the opposite: it&#x27;s far more likely younger populations are the carriers&#x2F;vectors for COVID, especially since they are more often asymptomatic (w.r.t. acute effects) than more vulnerable chunks of the population. Future bugs will have plenty of population to travel through.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mayoclinic.org&#x2F;diseases-conditions&#x2F;coronavirus&#x2F;in-depth&#x2F;coronavirus-long-term-effects&#x2F;art-20490351" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mayoclinic.org&#x2F;diseases-conditions&#x2F;coronavirus&#x2F;i...</a>')
