On most big interstates it&#x27;s perfectly fine, even through mountain ranges, and it&#x27;s known in advance which highways don&#x27;t have it. But even then, you can just use satellite systems such as Starlink as a backup.<p>Questionable economics for keeping people on-call? No, it&#x27;s quite economic, because one on-call person can provide coverage for a wide area.<p>Criminals? This is an unserious idea that&#x27;s always brought up in these discussions. Why not break into containers at ports? Why not break into dry vans stored at the back of warehouses overnight? If the idea is just that criminals will break into unattended cargo vans, there are manifold opportunities to do this already, and the small amounts of property crime isn&#x27;t a serious issue.<p>Anyway, it&#x27;s covered by insurance.<p>Conversely, the advantages are numerous:\n * Much faster cross-country freight. No sleeping, no work-rules, no need for team drivers.\n * A safety profile that may even be better (no falling asleep).\n * Lower costs. \n * Better availability. At times, it is very difficult to schedule a truck to arrive, depending on how tight the market is. It&#x27;s easier to flex equipment availability up and down than truckers.<p>Many large shippers will see this as an important area to focus on and money is being poured into this today.')
