Item(by='MathematicalArt', descendants=None, kids=[24932358], score=None, time=1603987799, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24929633, text='The following is a link to the Mathematics Subject Classification [1]. There are thousands of lines, with each line being a different area of specialization in the disciplines of math. Every time you think we are close to &quot;running out&quot; of ideas, things to do, or things to learn, I ask that you pull this up. Even if we limit to mathematics and don&#x27;t talk about things like agriculture, psychology, and so forth, you have so many possible things to do with your life that even if everyone picks one thing and specializes in it, there will still be something unique for you to explore. Consider that something like machine learning is largely applied statistics, optimization, linear algebra, and a few other things and then look at this list with those things omitted! There is still a lot left. We are nowhere close to having worked on all the interesting problems or running out of things to discover.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cran.r-project.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;classifications&#x2F;MSC-2010.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cran.r-project.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;classifications&#x2F;MSC-2010.html</a>')
