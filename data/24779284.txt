But one way to start is by integrating this _within your VPN_ such that network access + credentials alone are not enough. With Boundary you could do this by setting up firewalls on the end hosts to only allow ingress from Boundary worker nodes.<p>Eventually you can migrate towards Boundary nodes (or similar technologies) being the public ingress instead of a VPN endpoint.<p>(Edit: clarified that I meant firewalls on the end hosts, not on the VPN or elsewhere in the network.)')
