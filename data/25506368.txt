But... There is an absolutely thriving market for keyboards and mice.<p>For both, conglomerates like logitech and microsoft are selling both what you describe as &#x27;crap&#x27;, as well as higher end stuff that tries to care about quality. Possibly not in the way you think is most important, but certainly a Logitech MX Master3 keyboard retailing at &gt;$100 is not a cheap piece of crap. The letters aren&#x27;t inked on, for example, thus ensuring they don&#x27;t rub off particularly easily. Not a feature that is advertised or is likely to show up in a review. The kind of quality move that doesn&#x27;t make sense if the market is just &#x27;assholes selling crap to idiots&#x27;.<p>Keyboards are even more interesting; a lively indie market for custom-built usually mechanical keyboards, supported by parts manufacturers where price isn&#x27;t particularly important.<p>I agree, though - the webcam market is quite a mess. So, what&#x27;s the explanation for that? Why do keyboards and mice not fall under your &#x27;assholes selling crap to idiots&#x27; rule?')
