Do I send two files then make text? do I add one picture at a time?).<p>I hate to say, it makes it really hard to try to make&#x2F;support&#x2F;extend plugins.<p>(For those curious, I have been working to add MMS support to libpurple: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;source.puri.sm&#x2F;kop316&#x2F;purple-mm-sms" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;source.puri.sm&#x2F;kop316&#x2F;purple-mm-sms</a> , so that the Pinephone can have MMS support).')
