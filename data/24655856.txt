Citizens should be allowed, and even encouraged to seek out educational programs when they feel like they need it, instead of society telling everyone when and where they must complete which programs before they are &quot;certified&quot;. To take it one step further, I believe this type of forced certification process only helps create the ever-expanding footprint of idiocy we see in our world today.')
