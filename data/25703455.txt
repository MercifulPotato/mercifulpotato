It&#x27;s a tool for doing biblical research using the original languages. It provides the usual morphological tagging and parallel versions (with Greek&#x2F;Hebrew, including the LXX but I&#x27;m not interested in just pumping it with rubbish data that a lot of bible sites like doingâ€”I&#x27;m doing a PhD, I know what data is valuable).<p>The real value proposition is the way that searching works. I have the BHS (the standard Hebrew edition) tagged with parsing and syntax and, critically, searches respect syntax. That means you don&#x27;t have to search for words within n words of each other or within the same verse; you can search for words in the same clause. Finding Hebrew idioms is a lot easier like this.<p>My research is in the Old Testament so this is only true of Hebrew right now but I&#x27;m doing a lot of work rewriting the backend which will make it easier to import new translations and search any of the tagged data.<p>I am quite proud of the UI. It&#x27;s React with MS&#x27;s Fluent UI components, though, and I feel like it&#x27;s a bit sluggish (but my server is also slow).<p>But hey, I use it as my primary interface for working with the Hebrew so it serves my purposes. I also made some tutorial videos to onboard intrepid users (there&#x27;s a button in the toolbar to take you there), which I feel like makes it a &quot;real&quot; project, now :)')
