Public transit must match the city. Mid-sized cities like Nice or Denver will have light rail systems. Smaller cities like Boulder will have buses. Buses get a stigma in North America but they are good because the initial cost is low so it&#x27;s easy to get routes with the magical &lt;= 15 minutes between buses which is needed to attract &quot;casual&quot; riders.<p>Something no one brought up is the recent-ish idea of bus rapid transit (BRT), which solves the problem of not having exact change, because who does these days? BRT gives some of the advantages of rail like fare machines and dedicated right-of-ways. Albuquerque (which is far too small for a subway) just put in its first line.')
