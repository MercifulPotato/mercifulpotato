Zakat is a form of wealth tax that applies to money over a certain minimum amount. For currencies, it&#x27;s 2.5%. So if you have $1M sitting in your bank account for 1 year, then by the end of the year you owe $25K to charity. Different percentages apply to other wealth&#x2F;estate (like farm produce or cattle).<p>It&#x27;s an extremely fair system, that does not punish people from making high wages (there is no income tax in Islam), and pushes people to invest into the economy. It also does not inherently cause inflation like today&#x27;s fiat money. It&#x27;s quite sad to see that humanity keeps refusing to learn from the past.')
