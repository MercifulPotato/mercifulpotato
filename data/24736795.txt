I don&#x27;t want magic code. I want code that is simple and works in obvious ways.<p>&gt; You can even specify a version number<p>Sorry to be sarcastic here but wow, you mean I can even make sure that my code will not break at an arbitrary point in the future, when my dependency inevitably introduces a breaking change? Fantastic.<p>I understand that installing dependencies is a bit of a hassle. But really, once you have done it twice it takes seconds. And I would not want a mechanism that fetches dependencies as a side effect of my app running. I want to know what&#x27;s going on when my app runs. The fewer moving parts, the better. Often, it&#x27;s hard work to achieve this simplicity. But, at least in my experience, it pays off.')
