Item(by='bzbarsky', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606795418, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25255218, text='&gt; That sounds as if you&#x27;re steering close to a whiteboarding interview which a lot of people will claim isn&#x27;t great.<p>One major difference is that unlike a whiteboarding interview there are presumably clear expectations as to what one is expected to have learned in the class and therefore what topics the discussion will cover, and at what depth.<p>Another issue with whiteboarding interviews, specific to computer-related subjects, is being asked to write code on the whiteboard, which is a severely unnatural act in all sorts of ways compared to the way one normally writes code.  But an in-person assessment in a proofs-based math class, for example, would not have that problem.  Similar for a CS (as opposed to software engineering) class.<p>And in a software engineering class, the concept of &quot;test&quot; is pretty odd, for the same reasons that whiteboarding interviews are; I&#x27;d expect longer-term projects to be closer to the right evaluation tool.')
