The DevOps time for an app is so trivial. I actually just setup a .Net core app on Linux&#x2F;mysql.<p>My Linux experience is old and very limited. I have used AWS for years for other things (S3, cloudfront, transcribe, etc.).<p>Initially I setup an elastic beanstalk app&#x2F;separate mysql instance on my own AWS account just so I could quickly deploy (all new to me).<p>Then I setup the app on my client&#x27;s VM, had to configure Apache, .net core app, service, mysql, mailing.<p>I would say the elastic beanstalk stuff took about 3 hours (some problems with IAM and Amazon&#x27;s visual studio plugin, basically ended up having to use my master key). Setting up the VM server, plus a new way to deploying .net core apps and learning&#x2F;relearning much of linux took 4-5?<p>So no significant savings there.<p>Deploys are a few clicks from VS on EB, and take a little longer to the VM, but only because I haven&#x27;t bothered writing a script that I estimate would take me 1&#x2F;2 hour at most, in reality probably 5 minutes.<p>I have clients on (windows) servers that have been running for 10 years with little intervention from me (had to clear some space a couple of times as that client&#x27;s app saves large files just in case, but they are all backed up on S3 as well).<p>TL;DR; in my experience DevOps part of running a startup&#x2F;small enterprise app is basically trivial, a rounding error, compared to time spent on development.')
