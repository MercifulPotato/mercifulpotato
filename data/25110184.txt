I do play chess somewhat seriously and it&#x27;s similar mental labor as programming. And I can only do so much more serious mental work after a day at work coding. And I definitely could not commit to two hours of serious chess study every day. Maybe 30-60 minutes of games &amp; puzzles.<p>Playing a sport is completely different from playing chess, the physicality of a sport is at least different type of challenge.')
