(You can’t use proximity only since people walking by the bathroom will also trigger it) but in the current version this is instead solved by letting the user adjust the time it will play since last motion detected, and the side lights (acts as night lights during night) also indicate when the music is about to turn off so you don’t get a quiet surprise ;)<p>I have tested this myself for a year and it works great.<p>There are some features so that you can have it playing without the need for motion if you know you’re going to spend a longer time in the bathroom without moving (for example showering&#x2F;bathing).')
