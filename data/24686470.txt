No franchise. No middleman or supplier lock-in. No fixed rental payments.<p>Easy to pull in friends &amp; family labour if you need to scale, and if you miss restocking it&#x27;s no biggie. Nobody yelling at you. Flexible hours. Rarely have to talk to people except about new sites.<p>Actually not that easy to think of things with all those properties.')
