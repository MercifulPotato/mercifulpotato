I was recently trying to work out how I could do my media handling on the Linux Desktop (KDE). It didn&#x27;t just work. I tried numerous apps and all of them failed to meet my expectations.<p>My non-development tasks... those things in life I use a computer for... are just harder on Linux desktops or have a poor experience.<p>MacOS, on the other hand, has a great experience for most of these everyday life kinds of activities. Even for many business activities it&#x27;s better. Here I refer to the non-development parts of business.<p>If all you do is systems level coding than Linux is great.
