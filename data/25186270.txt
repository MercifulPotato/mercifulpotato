Because AMD is again cheaper and faster than Intel.<p>But it appears Apple can now afford to build their own CPUs that are better and lower power than either AMD or Intel. Not to mention PowerPC, which is still around in some form at IBM :)<p>It&#x27;s a no brainer for them. No one can screw them over now except themselves.')
