Among those three companies, only Apple requires you to tell Apple every app you install. Among those three companies, only Apple requires you to further associate your banking details with all that data collection if you want to develop apps for your own device.<p>That is not an honest commitment to privacy. The other two companies let you opt out of all data collection entirely on your devices.<p>You&#x27;re absolutely right that it&#x27;s not a close call.<p>To millstone because downvotes prevent me from replying: that is data that the users voluntarily gave Google (like their email and documents), and Google collects that data from its services on iOS as well. On Android, you don&#x27;t have to give Google any of your data at all. It even makes it easy to not send data to Google by letting you choose a default maps application, browser, etc. Compare to Apple, where you must give your location data to Apple if you want to know where you are on iOS, and there is nothing you can do about it. One is clearly worse. Making light of not being able to develop apps <i>for your own devices</i> without handing over banking details is something I never thought I would see on a forum for technologists.')
