But its impossible to tell if they&#x27;ve primed me to buy something later.<p>But just because I try to be vigilant and also try to block adverts, doesn&#x27;t mean that I should be ok with them having my data. Just because they haven&#x27;t figured out a way to trick me yet doesn&#x27;t mean they won&#x27;t later or that they won&#x27;t become even more egregious later. Besides, its a business model I find unethical, so I want to distance myself from it as much as possible, and them not having data on me is part of that.')
