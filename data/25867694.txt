But there are a lot of things going against the major outlets in this debate: a.) It&#x27;s a federal case so except for identities, most of the damning information against Twitter is out there b.) Major outlets such as NYT like to brag about the size of their newsrooms, but don&#x27;t seem to have the resources to cover stories of CP on Twitter and the lackadaisical attitude of its censors c.)
