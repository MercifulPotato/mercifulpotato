The correct result for round(5.5) is arbitrary. The reason that 6.0 is the correct answer is &quot;merely&quot; because that is what the IEEE standard says. That standard could have been different (round-to-nearest odd), but there is value in not lightly ignoring an existing standard.<p>Other cases are more clear cut. ceil(1e-10) should return 1. This seems non-controversial since ceil is defined as rounding up. Any number greater than zero and less than or equal to one should return one. And yet, some of the algorithms would return zero. That was probably the most serious of the errors.<p>How serious the errors are depends on how the functions are used, but I think they were all promoted as general-purpose-replacements so they could have ended up being used anywhere.')
