Your perception of capitalism is one that is framed as a winner takes all mentality that been sold to you by propagandists.<p>Capitalism is about free market trade. You provide something and people choose whether they want to buy it or use it. People add greed qualifier in there so they can frame it as something illicit going on.<p>The fact still remains that if people cared about their privacy (and there is no evidence they do), they wouldn&#x27;t use these sites.<p>Before it was done online. Store cards used to track purchases and spending habits in store in the same way that sites do today (however at a much greater scale) and customers were given vouchers in return.<p>In much the same way. Almost all the local stores have dissapeared to be replaced by large corps that can provide everything in super stores and in much the same way that is the fault of the consumer by not supporting their local stores.<p>&gt; For all benefits we yield from it, it&#x27;s still fair to call it capitalistic greed and notice the ethical failures the market strongly encourages.<p>No the failing is on us and the users of the site for using these services when we were warned by many people that this would be the case. Pretending otherwise is passing the buck.')
