It did change your writing since you had to hold it almost vertical, not as big a change as the increased speed though.  With a thin tip you could make small detailed diagrams.<p>[0] like this:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.blackrockgalleries.com&#x2F;product&#x2F;vintage-rapidograph-no-2-pen-19277.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.blackrockgalleries.com&#x2F;product&#x2F;vintage-rapidogra...</a>\nNote: does not actually take a cartridge, it&#x27;s a suction plunger assembly for liquid ink uptake, attached to the color-coded tip-size indicating band.  You may want a thinner tip than No. 2 and ink having different viscosity, solids content, and drying rate than used for engineering drawing.<p>not like this:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kohinoorusa.com&#x2F;rapidograph" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kohinoorusa.com&#x2F;rapidograph</a><p>not even this:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;yesteryearsfp&#x2F;status&#x2F;1016296550736293888" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;yesteryearsfp&#x2F;status&#x2F;1016296550736293888</a>')
