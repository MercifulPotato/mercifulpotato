Yes, fixed precision is great for accounting (like your bank statement) but when you&#x27;re making a predictive model of asset prices (or higher moments of price distributions) being off by 1 in 10^14 is not important (because your model isn&#x27;t that precise anyway!) and the performance you get from dedicated floating part hardware is well worth the &quot;loss&quot; of precision.<p>This wholesale dismissal of floating point for &quot;financial&quot; systems ignores the real business needs which might point you toward fixed or floating point numbers. Always ask yourself - do you need to know this number to better than 1 in 10^14? Are you going to find its square root at some point? Also remember that storing fixed point numbers usually takes more bytes than double-precision floats.')
