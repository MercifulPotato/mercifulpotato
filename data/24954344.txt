Do you mean customers of the VPN are attacking Microsoft?<p>I use mullvad and have used other vpns all the time with zero difficulty. The only service I can&#x27;t use is netflix and even they let me access my account just fine I just can&#x27;t actually play videos while connected to the vpn.<p>There is a huge difference between not allowing access to the service via vpn and banning an account by virtue of accessing the account from a legitimate vpn service. The latter is unusual it is not something anyone ought to expect from &quot;every major service&quot;.')
