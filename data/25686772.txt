Even then, just a fixed rate might not actually do it: don&#x27;t recall the exact numbers but just like some small percentage of the entire population earns most, there&#x27;s also a certain percentage who spend (or waste, depending on how you look at it) more of these sources and because they have the money anyway, making things more expensive will not hit them at all. Instead the lower end of society will take a hit. Which is of course part of the idea, but for some of them that might actually be the extra costs leading to not being able to pay all bills anymore or worse. tldr; I&#x27;m not entirely convinced yet, but it seems that to solve problems like this a system where those who use most pay extra (think: you wanna fille your huge pool with drinking water? you&#x27;ll pay)')
