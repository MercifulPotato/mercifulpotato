If you look at Cinebench, Handbrake, etc, they don&#x27;t show a comparative deficit.  And there&#x27;s even benchmarks that show the opposite: Intel waits too long to boost on battery for e.g. Blender and performance suffers in those benchmarks.<p>And, of course, short benchmark runs suffer disproportionately for those integrators who chose to put a delay-before-boost timer in to improve battery life.<p>Basically, Intel is grasping at any straws to show performance parity to AMD at this point... and now I will be even more hard pressed to take anything coming out of INTC marketing seriously.')
