Once the instructions (mRNA) are inside the muscle cells, the cells use them to make the protein piece. After the protein piece is made, the cell breaks down the instructions and gets rid of them.&quot;<p>&quot;Next, the cell displays the protein piece on its surface. Our immune systems recognize that the protein doesnâ€™t belong there and begin building an immune response and making antibodies, like what happens in natural infection against COVID-19.&quot;<p>&quot;At the end of the process, our bodies have learned how to protect against future infection. The benefit of mRNA vaccines, like all vaccines, is those vaccinated gain this protection without ever having to risk the serious consequences of getting sick with COVID-19.&quot;<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;coronavirus&#x2F;2019-ncov&#x2F;vaccines&#x2F;different-vaccines&#x2F;mrna.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;coronavirus&#x2F;2019-ncov&#x2F;vaccines&#x2F;different...</a>')
