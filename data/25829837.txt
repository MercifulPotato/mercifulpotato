While it may look like your doctor is just blindly Googling something, I would imagine they&#x27;re probably using it as more of a reference source (at least that&#x27;s what I often do). I regularly use radiopaedia.org just to look up a quick fact or find alternative examples of a diagnosis I&#x27;m working with.<p>It&#x27;s like Googling coding questions and reading a StackOverflow thread. Obviously no programmer is solely relying on StackOverflow to do their job as no physician is solely relying on Google, UpToDate, or any other resource. They&#x27;re simply quick references.')
