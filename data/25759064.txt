Thoughts?', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='I wanted to ask what the community thinks about graph databases today. I&#x27;ve worked with Blaze Graph and Janus and a few others but thought it might be worthwhile to ask what everyone else is using now that AMZN swallowed Blaze and created Neptune. I&#x27;d like to build an application that would leverage a user&#x27;s local graph in combination with a graph in the cloud and was hoping to use the same graphdb, but the more I think about this problem I suspect that there isn&#x27;t a one size fits all approach and I might be better off using something more industrial in the Cloud and something more lightweight for the local functionality--which led me to look at neosemantics... and so, here I am... what do you nerds think?')
