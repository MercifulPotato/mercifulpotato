I was looking for something like this for our seed round and really appreciate the objectiveness of just showing the slide decks, instead of it being the clickbaity &quot;10 great pitch decks for yadayada&quot;.<p>One point of user feedback though: the mobile view of the slides is a bit funnily cropped and difficult to distinguish the decks from each other.\n Would be nice with the primary slide highlighted, and then a view into the full deck if you click on it.')
