I would think that most of the really valuable work happens at JPL, what we need are more probes not ridiculously wasteful and expensive manned missions. In the face of vast social need we shouldn&#x27;t let the rich go there either they need to pay their fair share so we all can be healthy and secure together. You get far more scientific value from sending inexpensive probes compared to these vastly wasteful manned PR stunts.')
