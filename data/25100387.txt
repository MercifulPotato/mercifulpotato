I don&#x27;t actually use Twitter or Facebook, and I deleted my Reddit, so I&#x27;m not the one to talk. But my wife uses Twitter a lot and has managed to get into conversations that are very hard to keep civil. She has found several approaches that work without blocking.<p>1. Only enable notifications and DMs from mutual follows. People who get into pile ons don&#x27;t tend to follow their &quot;arch enemies&quot; to do so (because their followers would not like them to follow &quot;the wrong people&quot;). You have full control over who can pester you.<p>2. Walk away from conversations if your get harrassed, bored or annoyed, but be clear that you are doing it. &quot;This is going nowhere and it&#x27;s getting late. I&#x27;m muting this thread&quot;. Again, you have control. If you imagine getting into a heated debate in the pub, this is the equivalent of leaving the table to talk to another group. It gives you the ability to peacefully walk away, and deny someone the opportunity to keep arguing with you against your will.<p>3. Realise that people don&#x27;t change their minds during an argument. Always give them room to back down. A cornered animal will always lash out, and we are just animals.<p>4. Always be clear and civil.  Be generous. Don&#x27;t assume that people are acting out of malice.<p>5. In sometime is a toxic person who causes pile ons, quote tweets you, intentionally misrepresents you by cherry picking your comments out of context, doxes etc, block the fuck out of them.')
