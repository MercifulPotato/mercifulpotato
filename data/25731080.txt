The lobbyists&#x27; arguments are so flawed that anyone with half a brain or a bit of common sense should be able to say &quot;hold on, this is bullshit!&quot; and yet these people are swallowing it whole.<p>I&#x27;d have more respect for them if they outright turned around and said &quot;yeah we know we&#x27;re screwing you over but the lobbyists&#x27; money is too good to pass up&quot; but in this case they appear to be getting played without even realizing it themselves.')
