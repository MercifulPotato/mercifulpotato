That narrative is already in your head because it’s the prevailing belief system. Any criticism of humanity fits neatly into it.<p>Here are a few things we’ve done really well on IMO that don’t fit with the narrative:<p>All the nations got together and fixed the ozone layer.<p>We created the national park system and NWR’s with surprisingly large tracts of land.<p>Whaling is banned in the USA and many other countries AFAIK.<p>No more orca shows at sea world after black fish and it seems like we’re moving in the right direction with captive whales and dolphins?<p>Acid rain is way better. (That was a huge deal in the 80s)<p>We’re getting close to completely getting off coal as a power source (in the US)<p>A large portion of new power capacity is renewable.<p>Recycling looks like it doesn’t actually work well but it’s amazing that almost every household does it in an effort to help.')
