Item(by='benbjohnson', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611348151, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25875538, text='Litestream defaults to flushing out to S3 every 10 seconds but that&#x27;s mainly because of PUT costs. Each request costs $0.00005 so it costs about $1.30 per month. If you flushed every second then it&#x27;d cost you $13&#x2F;month.<p>Logical replication would have significantly smaller sizes although the size cost isn&#x27;t a huge deal on S3. Data transfer in to S3 is free and so are DELETE requests. The data only stays on S3 for as long as your Litestream retention specifies. So if you&#x27;re retaining for a day then you&#x27;re just keeping one day&#x27;s worth of WAL changes on the S3 at any given time.')
