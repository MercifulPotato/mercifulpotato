A lot of economic growth is simply much more efficient use of resources, ie less resources and much greater return. A couple of decades ago you needed a lot of expensive copper to connect a city with phone and slow internet access. Now all you need is cheap thin plastic for gigabit+ speeds.<p>A computer 70 years ago was an enormous contraption made of of literally tons of expensive metal components, while a raspberry pi zero has a tiny bit of copper, resin and silicon. The latter is vastly more powerful and cheaper.<p>Sure, growth can&#x27;t last forever, but we have a long way to go.')
