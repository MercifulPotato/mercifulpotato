There was a time where there was 4 or 5 languages (basic, Pascal, C, Fortran, etc...it was a small number) and it was possible to learn a significant amount of knowledge to operate in one or more of them.<p>Now I look at the cloud computing space where there&#x27;s hundreds of components, overlapping functionality, and nothing that easily helps me to determine what things are important to know, flash-in-the-pan fads, or long term career building skills.<p>But it&#x27;s the same in other domains as well. There&#x27;s too much Entertainment to hope to discover everything you might be interested in, there&#x27;s expansion in social communication...and my monkey brain is hyperventilating over it as the things that made me feel valued (that I could take pictures, edit video, write software) have been commoditized so that my skillset isn&#x27;t necessarily as spiffy as it used to be.')
