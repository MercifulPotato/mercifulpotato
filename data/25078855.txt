E.g.,<p>&gt; <i>Rumor: If a social media account claims an identity, the account must be run by that person or organization.</i><p>I could claim to be the King of France himself right here, right now, but that wouldn&#x27;t make it so.<p>As Buster (the rabbit) said: Someone would do that? Just go on the Internet and <i>lie?</i><p>As another example, the claim that a website outage <i>could</i> be caused by something other than hacking — is trivial to prove by thinking about it. High load — <i>particularly</i> on election night, likely the busiest night for an election site — can cause the site to go down.<p>Further, most of them are backed by citations, many to not CISA. Even if you think &quot;it&#x27;s a giant federal conspiracy&quot; many of the claims are still trivially fact checked by punching them into Google, where non-federal and non-governmental sources further back them up. (E.g., that voter rolls are generally public can be fact-checked that way.)')
