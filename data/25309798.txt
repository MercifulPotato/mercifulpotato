A mature ecosystem: Symfony is really really mature, all use case of a classic website are covered:<p><pre><code>   * easy &quot;admin&quot; generation -&gt; check\n\n   * easy styling of your forms (a guy already made a &#x27;tailwind&#x27; template, now I just do {{ form(my_form }}, and that&#x27;s it\n\n   * easy integration with webpack for my usecase with tailwind\n\n   * pretty fast load to the point that the backoffice feels like a SPA (no flickering)\n\n   * word-class ORM (Doctrine is just the best ORM ever, they really got right the &#x27;if you know SQL, you will not have to learn yet an other dialect, all our functions&#x2F;method use the exact same naming as in SQL , take that django ORM)\n\n   * once again word-class ORM (Doctrine make it very easy to use all postgres-only, or mind you, mysql-only feature, DATE_TRUNC , json operators, full-text search operators  etc. etc.)\n\n   * The documentation is not only encyclopedic , but also &#x27;cookbook&#x27; (i.e you can either go A to Z, or they have dedicated article &quot;how to have 2 database&quot; , &quot;How to implement a login through JSON&quot; , which are much better and up to date than googling &quot;how to X with framework Z&quot;\n</code></pre>\n2. PHP type system, sorry python but mypy just doesn&#x27;t make it, I love my typechecking at runtime, how many times good willing developers in python have put  `def myfunction(something: dict)` but it was actually not a dict, but a generator, and boom the next dev is mislead and introduce a bug<p>3. easy as hell to find developers, developers that likes to get things done and that are pragmatic (They know, I know, we all know PHP have shortcomings, do we joke about it? yes. Does it prevent us from moving forward ? no)')
