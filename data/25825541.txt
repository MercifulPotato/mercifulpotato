If each line is filled to 80 characters and a\ngiven line has n words in it whose cumulative length is k, then it\nneeds 80-k spaces distributed as equally as possible over n-1 gaps\nbetween the words. If 80-k is not a multiple of n-1, then there are t\n= (80-k) mod (n-1) gaps that need an extra space thrown in, and s =\n((n-1) choose t) ways to assign them, hence the possibility of\nencoding floor(log_2(s)) bits in each line. I did this project for fun\na long time ago and found pretty consistently a ratio of 137 bytes of\ntext needed for each byte of concealed data. You might squeeze in a\nlittle more by considering multiple lines at a time.')
