Let&#x27;s impeach him again, call all his supporters terrorists, and ban them from communicating!&quot; People like you and the Democrats seem desperate to cause more violence instead of de-escalating the situation with a peaceful, dignified exit. It&#x27;s a shame that you care more about &quot;owning Trump&quot; one more time rather than promoting peace, but I&#x27;m not surprised.')
