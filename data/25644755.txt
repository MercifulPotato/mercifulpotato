The link between these countries and historical Socialism (i.e. USSR) is so weak that the term Socialism just serves to scare and mislead.<p>We are talking about capitalist democracies with some government run social services, like health care and unemployment, for example. We are not talking about socialist or communist countries which have a dash of capitalism. The policies in these countries, like affordable healthcare and education are also very popular in America once you drop the BS &quot;socialism&quot; framing.')
