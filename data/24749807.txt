Maybe since Oxide mostly works with embedded, they have few dependencies and their compile times aren&#x27;t very bad? I know my primary complaint after working with the language for about a year is that most projects take over a minute to build. Of course, it doesn&#x27;t help that I keep moving onto larger projects xD but even small things like cargo-deadlinks and ripgrep take a while.')
