I was hoping to see a product I could use in a workstation e.g a 32 core one that would have single core speed better than Intel. From that perspective the launch feels dissapointning. I&#x27;ve been needlessly holding money as I need a new CPU. I will have to go with a top Intel one. I&#x27;ll try AMD next year maybe.')
