Hate is an emotion that is unquantifiable in the general sense but is used ad nauseam throughout the media without regard to it&#x27;s undefinable scope. Worse yet, it is used in laws that have incarcerated people base on some perceived level of &quot;hate&quot;, again which has never been defined.')
