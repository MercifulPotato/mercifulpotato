It still has OS9; I never installed OSX as I knew it would probably slow things down.  I never needed to connect the Mac to the internet.  If I needed to send&#x2F;receive files via internet I moved them via crossover cable to a laptop or PC that was connected to the internet.<p>People today, even more so than in the 2000&#x27;s, have multiple computers.  Would it still be feasible to have a Mac used for {music, cinema, graphics} that is not connected to the internet.  Certainly one would have other computers that were connected to the internet and moving files between computers on the local network, preferably via Ethernet, is much faster.<p>But the point of me telling personal stories is not to suggest anyone could&#x2F;should do the same things; on the contrary, it is to illustrate that &quot;one size does not fit all&quot;.  Today&#x27;s Apple chooses for the user, rather than letting the user choose.')
