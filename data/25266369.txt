But all of this does not matter because all modern protocols use algorithms that are safe from timing attacks.<p>If the master key was generated with a weak rng then the same would also be true for any ephemeral keys. That being said I doubt that any device capable of running signal is going to have a weak RNG.<p>Only the backup thing is possible but at this point the adversary can pretend to be you to your contacts anyway (and well, read your past messages). The easiest solution here is to not backup the signal directory.')
