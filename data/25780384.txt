I went through the (excellent) official tutorial in a couple days, skimmed parts of Sa≈°a Juric&#x27;s book, and felt reasonably confident diving in to actually writing code. Within a couple weeks I felt like I &quot;got&quot; OTP and idiomatic Elixir.<p>I do agree that, at least for somebody who uses Intellij IDEs exclusively, the lack of good first-party support sucks. I do most of my debugging via unit tests and &quot;printf&quot; because the Intellij Elixir plugin&#x27;s interpreted mode is just too slow for the debugger to be useful to me.')
