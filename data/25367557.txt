So on a risk-adjusted basis, that kind of trade isn&#x27;t too appealing unless you&#x27;d done significant research to show that the risk of bankruptcy or a buyout by a competitor at a reduced valuation was unlikely.<p>While you might have done that kind of research, the article implies (correctly, in my view) that the typical Robinhood user did not.
