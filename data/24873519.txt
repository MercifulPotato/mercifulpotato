But isn&#x27;t that where most real estate investing goes? Detached single family homes are mostly owner-occupied.</i><p>In terms of absolute deals? Yes. In terms of dollar value? Not even close, commercial property far exceeds residential property.<p><i>But then the tenant is paying correspondingly less rent, which means less taxable income to the property owner. It&#x27;s a wash either way.</i><p>Generally, no. That&#x27;s not how triple-net leases work. Tenant pays market value, and maintenance costs <i>on top of that.</i><p><i>It&#x27;s one of the two options. </i><p>In your hypothetical, sure. But in the real world, you don&#x27;t make enough money in rent from one property to use to pay a down payment on the other, and actual real estate investment companies don&#x27;t pay down the loans; they take out balloon mortgages and just pay interest on the loans until they sell (or refinance before the balloon). I&#x27;ve done this for enough real property investor clients to know how they actually think.<p><i>That&#x27;s evidence of what I&#x27;m saying -- when corporate taxes are high, people move investment from businesses to real estate. Making improvements to real estate is investing in real estate. Lower taxes and they stop because they make more to invest the same money in other businesses. </i><p>No, it&#x27;s not. Because <i>all</i> businesses make more investments in their businesses during periods of high taxes. And specifically in my example, I wasn&#x27;t referring to real estate investors, but companies that actually manage buildings with the intent of being landlords and making their money from commercial leases, not from selling their buildings.')
