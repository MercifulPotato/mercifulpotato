Sure there are fewer parameters, and we currently know of fewer requirements for these parameters. But who is to say a weak class of ECC private keys won&#x27;t be discovered in the future?<p>If you&#x27;re paranoid about what weaknesses might be discovered, I suppose using RSA+ECC is a option :)')
