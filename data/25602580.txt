Then you could write one liner bash scripts to do simple tasks like “download all images” or “delete script tags referencing spammyads.js”, all with nothing more advanced than find, cp, rm and mv in the shell. E.g.<p>cp html&#x2F;body&#x2F;*&#x2F;img&#x2F;.hero-img&#x2F;hello.png ~Downloads&#x2F;<p>You would need some clever way to express the DOM with ids and classes etc but it could be done with some subdirectory structure and long names, sometimes having multiple names for the same thing.')
