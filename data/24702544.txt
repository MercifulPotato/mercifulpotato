While it wasn&#x27;t the only thing that changed, giving them the choice has definitely had a positive impact on how much food gets wasted and how often kids come home hungry.<p>This year, I took it a step further by letting the kids &quot;order&quot; their lunches using a visual form on my phone. They absolutely love it!!!<p>I&#x27;m considering building an app to make this easy for other parents to do.
