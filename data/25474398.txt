The lyrics are legally distinct from the melody that they are sung to[1].<p>Weird Al licenses his parodies, both the lyrics and the music, but additionally asks for permission from the singer&#x2F;songwriter out of respect for the artists. Often the copyrights on both lyrics and melody are assigned to someone (or usually, corporate entity) other than what we think of as the “Artist”. He possibly (depending on the song in question) has a legal case for some of his lyrical parodies (Not so much “The Saga Begins”, but “Addicted to Spuds” is certainly a parody of love songs in general and “Addicted To Love” in that blast radius), but he plays the original melody, and that requires him to license his work.<p>Apropos but distinct: Figuring out the copyrighting entity, or if there’s a copyright at all, is itself a challenge: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Happy_Birthday_to_You#Copyright_status" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Happy_Birthday_to_You#Copyrigh...</a><p>[1]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.copyrightuser.org&#x2F;create&#x2F;creative-process&#x2F;going-for-a-song-track-1&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.copyrightuser.org&#x2F;create&#x2F;creative-process&#x2F;going-...</a>')
