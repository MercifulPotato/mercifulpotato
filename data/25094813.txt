But I have yet to see a schema system for JSON that isn&#x27;t just a crappy version of what XML can do.  Similarly, most ways of representing services turn into bike shedding on how to map to HTTP.<p>I will also add that as soon as you think you need complicated models at the API level, you are almost certainly setting a path to problems.  Yes, it is possible to come up with a place where sum types will make sense.  In most cases, though, you are better representing a flat set of data, and let a validation layer move things into distinct types, if you really need it.<p>I view this as everyone wanting a programming language where you control AST constructs.  Sounds great, but working with raw text&#x2F;data at a layer above will almost certainly be easier.  And you can use a compiler&#x2F;evaluator to get to things you can manipulate at that layer.  (Similarly, this idea that files are the bane of computer.  In stark contrast to my always just wanting a file that represents whatever I am wanting to move from one place to another.  However I want to make that happen.)')
