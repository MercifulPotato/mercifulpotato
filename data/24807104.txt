They form a significant portion of everyday text, and in fact necessary for constructing sentences properly in Japanese. For example, many&#x2F;most grammatical particles like &quot;of&quot;, &quot;in&quot;, &quot;to&quot;, &quot;from&quot;, are written in Hiragana. And foreign&#x2F;imported words are usually in Katakana.<p>Regarding the ease of pronunciation - I think the grandparent comment was talking about the sounds of the language, not about memorizing how to read and pronounce the text.<p>Japanese speech is composed of a fairly small set of simple sounds, similar to Spanish. Having taught both Japanese and English, I would say the latter has many more tricky sounds - like <i>th</i> in &quot;the&quot;, or <i>ar</i> in arm (especially how Americans say it). In contrast, if one knows the sounds of each Hiragana (consonant + vowel combination), they cover almost all of Japanese speech.')
