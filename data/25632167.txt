As it turns out, selling people on the idea of unionizing is much harder than it sounds. People weren’t even necessarily afraid of the company, they just didn’t want to be in a union.<p>They, too, gathered a small number of people at first, but the effort fizzled out when the initial enthusiasm didn’t spread beyond those few idealistic people.<p>In a company the size of Google, it wouldn’t be hard to find 230 people who would claim to be unionizing, but it doesn’t mean much when you’re talking about a tiny fraction of employees.')
