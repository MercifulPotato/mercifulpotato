They can abrogate the manager&#x27;s authority, but that would permanently undermine that individual. On the other hand, they can also choose to accept the subordinate&#x27;s resignation. They could try to transfer the subordinate somewhere else, but that&#x27;s also risky, and wouldn&#x27;t really address the ultimatum in this case.<p>Accepting a resignation achieves three separate objectives:<p>-resolves the ultimatum<p>-discourages future ultimatums<p>-preserves the status quo ante')
