Use that section to highlight why you&#x27;re worth the money.  Business case stuff is always good: reduced costs by X at company Y, or implemented XX which increased revenue, implemented scalable  X that allowed us to grow to Y.  Soft skills like mentoring, communications, customer focus, etc. are good as well.<p>You have some good stuff in the experience section, but I have to hunt to find it.  Put some of the best bits of that in the summary, to get me &#x27;hooked&#x27;. Like:<p>&quot;Experienced in IOS and Android application design and implementation&quot;<p>&quot;Built base app and API modules for company later acquired by IBM&quot;<p>Anyway - Hope this helps!')
