The capital costs just for these modules are almost certainly higher too.<p>The project risk as seen by investors (delay, cancellation for social or undiscovered geotechnical reasons) is higher too.<p>So: generating electricity is not a use for fusion.<p>Fusion may have uses in scientific discovery. But a putative fusion power plant would operate well inside the limits of our knowledge, for reliability and safety reasons, so it would be no help there.')
