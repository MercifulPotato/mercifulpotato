Item(by='DoreenMichele', descendants=None, kids=[25015899], score=None, time=1604760301, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25014996, text='<i>P.S.: DoreenMichele is a lady.</i><p>Googles <i>lady</i>:<p><i>a woman of superior social position, especially one of noble birth.</i><p>My maternal grandmother may have been a <i>lady</i> in that she was born into a low level German noble family that sold the title when they fell on hard times.
