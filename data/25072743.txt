So I&#x27;m just curious why would it have been made and how that played out.<p>&gt; Having worked there the JS ecosystem was a tremendous advantage<p>How so? And to maybe ground my question, in 2005 I&#x27;d have expected a switch to Java, C# or Scala. So what advantages were there compared to those for JavaScript?<p>&gt; Itâ€™s also important to keep in mind that Bloomberg is very willing to have their best developers go ahead and build actual tooling at the compilers (and language) levels to resolve issues they may face<p>That&#x27;s awesome, but from my read of the article, seems like a lot of fighting to rebuild things that Java just has. And now this whole move to TypeScript to backfill in types, again, it appears to me like maybe if they&#x27;d gone with Java, much less time would have been needed on the devs building their own tooling, compilers and doing massive project migrations.')
