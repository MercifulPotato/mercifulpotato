The battery life is now about 3-4 hours even if I&#x27;m doing dev work, but otherwise it&#x27;s still pretty good otherwise, for a 7 year old laptop.  I had a Sony Vaio back in the early 00s, and it started with running XP &#x27;ok&#x27;, and then... Vista, which made it dog slow.  My point being that I&#x27;m surprised that a 7 year old laptop is still &quot;good&quot;.<p>A new laptop isn&#x27;t critical to my work at the moment, so I&#x27;m happy to wait for an M2, if that&#x27;s what it will be called.  Looking at Apple timelines a new chip tends to be 1-2 years apart, and I&#x27;m fine with that.<p>I&#x27;m also reluctant to give up Magsafe, or at least have to buy a magnetic USB C connector.')
