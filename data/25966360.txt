If Gnome then the wayland support is already pretty decent with 20.04 and 20.10. (Gnome versions 3.36 and 3.38). The wayland situation on KDE Plasma is also improving with each new release and some other distributions (Fedora) are planning on switching their plasma session to wayland by default as well.')
