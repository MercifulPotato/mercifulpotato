If there was to be a super cheap&#x2F;free tier it also had to be rather limited in bandwidth, barely enough for e.g. remote school to remove these barriers. But if it was too good you&#x27;d essentially kill off private providers giving the government even more control over people&#x27;s communication. Right now they at least need to pass laws and face backlash to force ISPs to censor stuff. If your government was your ISP they could just censor whatever they want without much oversight since there&#x27;d be little competition left to challenge them. Private companies have at least some incentive not to do so (they&#x27;ll loose customers).')
