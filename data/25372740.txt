It all depends on the day to day stability of Stream.<p>CentOS&#x27;s key attribute, and what separated it from other enterprise-focused Linux distributions, was that it is (well... was) a binary-compatible clone of RHEL, and was supported for as long as its RHEL counterpart. This allowed the user to use CentOS as a free drop-in replacement when the requirements called for RHEL (e.g., when running proprietary enterprise software that only supports RHEL).<p>CentOS Streams is not a binary-compatible clone of RHEL, which makes it unsuitable for people who need that specific feature.<p>CentOS Streams may be perfectly reliable (note that this isn&#x27;t the same as being stable), but there are already many reliable and well-established Linux distributions to choose from if RHEL compatibility and length of support isn&#x27;t important, and few reasons remaining to choose CentOS.')
