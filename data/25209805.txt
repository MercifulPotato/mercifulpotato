CV then says he has been programming since he was 13.<p>I see this A LOT as of late. People are counting high school side projects as real world experience... but that is not exactly the same as on the job experience. I am NOT knocking the awesome work you did in high school, hell, as an EE person, I could say I designed circuits when I was 12, but I would never add 10 years to my CV or my blog by counting it.<p>Honest question: is this the new norm?')
