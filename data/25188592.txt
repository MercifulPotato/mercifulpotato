What is smaller, and what is larger? Is 1000 large? Is 5000 large? Is 1000000 large? If I want my comment to be capped at 5000 characters to encourage healthy discussions but prevent spamming, is it large?<p>* If a field has no &quot;known format&quot; and that&#x27;s where it draws the line between CharField and TextField, then why is the error C2006 still raised when TextField(max_length=5000) is used? Why does the validator recommend allowing anyone to insert entries of unlimited size?')
