It&#x27;s pretty open, and if their government&#x27;s motive is to just create a subset of the Play store that doesn&#x27;t have Chinese apps, why the hell would anyone use it?<p>And if the government is forcing the entire population to use its app store -- do they have the authority to do that? I thought India was a democracy with free speech.')
