The early forms of slavery and &quot;freed slave ruling class&quot; co-evolved and mixed with existing clan systems into a system of so called &quot;secret societies&quot; that are active until today. There is still a strong correlation of some of these societies with access to wealth and power (I guess this is what your question pointed to...). However the civil war with its war lord groups and the main political fighting fronts stirred this up further and created new inter-twined power-structures. Things are further complicated by a general fear to talk about them or investigate the exact situation (hence the name &quot;secret&quot; society). It was not uncommon to find someone who investigated and asked too many questions without a head in front of a government building. If I remember correctly, I even had to sign a contract before being deployed to never mention secret societies or ask or talk to anyone about them. The main criticism apart from inequality to access of opportunity and intransparency were that some groups still practice genital mutilation of girls and enforce strong extremely conservative initiation and gender roles as well as problematic medical practices and superstition.')
