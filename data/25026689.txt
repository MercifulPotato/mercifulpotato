Trump took low participation voters and made politics sport for them. The slogan &quot;make libs cry again&quot; - it&#x27;s not about what he can do for them, it&#x27;s about how he can hurt &quot;the other&quot;. That his supporters identified with him so much every attack against him they felt was an attack on them.<p>The rabid cult of personality that popped up around him has been highly disturbing to watch. Decking everything out in shirts, hats, flying his name as a flag, painting your house with his name, covering your vehicle with flags. The non-stop rallies and campaigning even after he was elected.<p>And no, before someone trys to compare, it was not like that with Obama. People were excited about him but it did not become an everyday identity alongside a never-ending campaign.')
