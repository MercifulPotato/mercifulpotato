At some point Apple decided that the translation layer would not be supported in the new OS (leaving 3 applications for me to unexpectedly stop working, as I had forgotten they weren&#x27;t x86 apps). Probably why they had pop-ups telling us the old 32 bit applications would stop working recently.<p>Apple could have made &quot;Rosetta 1&quot;   open source for enthusiast to maintain.  They didn&#x27;t.  I doubt they&#x27;ll do it now for Rosetta2.<p>Apple does this all the time, pushing aside the old to make way for newer stuff.  (MacOS before X, 32&#x2F;64 bit, a lot of my old iOS apps just stopped working with a note to contact the publisher).  My my old snow leopard machine stopped working getting updates from macOS and became useless,  but will run windows&#x2F;linux.  Software support requires endless maintenance esp on mac, and Apple limits support to the last 5 years (or so) of machines.<p>The &quot;WinTel&quot; (is that still a term window&#x2F; intel) machines seem to bend over backward for legacy applications to still run, which is part of their appeal (esp to business), but probably saddles them with technical debt.  The &quot;new&quot; cost of lower performing machines and shorter battery life, is software lifespan.')
