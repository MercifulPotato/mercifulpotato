The number of mergers they have had are what is significantly different. When the universe was younger and things were closer mergers appear to have occurred at a higher rate leading to higher rates of star formation. This in turns floods a galaxy with powerful UV light, which in large amounts doesn&#x27;t seem conductive to life.')
