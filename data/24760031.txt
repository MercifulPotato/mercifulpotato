Use Ubuntu, Linux&#x27; Windows, and it. just. works. Even nvidia GPUs don&#x27;t require you to install anything, let alone build or configure. The last time I ran into trouble, must&#x27;ve been the mid-aughts.<p>What I do see is techies confusing cutting edge distros such as Arch for &#x27;Linux&#x27;. When you&#x27;re running Windows, you&#x27;re not using an internal MS build either, so that&#x27;s the wrong comparison (which I see made often the techier people are). The proper comparison is Ubuntu LTS and Ubuntu LTS only.')
