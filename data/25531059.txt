One of which also caused an uproar.<p>I also prefer my security measures procedural, technical and layered. Like I said before, phishing simulations don&#x27;t really work for me at all... Currently many places where I do some work the security department have a large say in what happens, regardless of goodwill. Security measures always suck, are less efficient and cause no end of headaches, you mostly have 0 goodwill anyway.')
