The foliation is not detectable, it gives the right predictions, it is mathematically sound, etc.<p>But it does feel philosophically sketchy and not fundamentally relativistic. However, there is a paper <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;1307.1714" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;1307.1714</a> which explores how to derive foliations from the wave function itself and thus would be as relativistic as in theory involving the wave function.<p>The article also points to other articles with a variety of ideas how to deal with nonlocality in Bohmian mechanics.')
