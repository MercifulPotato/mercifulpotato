All three of those countries are nuclear powers.<p>- China has built the world&#x27;s largest navy in terms of number of ships, surpassing the US. Historically this has meant preparation for war. (See Japan and Germany pre-WW2.)<p>- European cities have had low-intensity incidents with Islam, but with more than 10% of populations being Muslim in some areas, there will be a call for Shariah (political Islam.) That means civil war. The only reason that&#x27;s been delayed is the huge amount of welfare being paid to their families (regarded as jizyah by migrants), which is being used to rapidly increase their population.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.britannica.com&#x2F;topic&#x2F;jizya" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.britannica.com&#x2F;topic&#x2F;jizya</a><p>- regarding the post article, the US doesn&#x27;t prepare for urban war because it doesn&#x27;t want to engage in that.
