While it&#x27;s true that Google, Microsoft, Facebook, and Apple are probably better at securing accounts than most other companies, there&#x27;s always the possibility that they can be compromised.<p>Another problem is that if your oauth provider decides to close your account for whatever reason, it may be difficult or impossible to unlink everything from it.<p>Not only do I create real accounts for any service I want to use, I divide them up among multiple separate email accounts, so that if one account is compromised, I limit the associated services that are vulnerable as a result.')
