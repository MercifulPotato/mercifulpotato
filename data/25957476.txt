We already had paying customers, and the company was doing OK, but there was always drive to do and more flashier things, rather than double down on helping our customers.<p>I remember the moment of epiphany when I realised that the company was <i>not</i> in fact working for customers, they were just a marketing sell to be able to attract more investors to grow the company even more.<p>While I was not naive even back then and knew that its mostly how the world works, I still felt the misalignment of incentives would generally mean I as a person would need to squeeze and disregard some people in order to accomplish the goals of others. Organizational incentives always win in the long run, however well meaning the people of it are. I&#x27;d much prefer to work for a client that gets its revenue directly from its customers, as that would mean helping them would help the company too.<p>I&#x27;m very happy that working in IT allows me to be a bit more picky in who I&#x27;m working for to enrich, and it was possible for me to leave, and be happy for it.')
