I find it especially abhorrent when an American President orders the killing of American citizens (at least 1 directly ordered with several other &quot;unintended&quot; murders) on foreign soil without their guaranteed 5th Amendment trial, which states, in part, &quot;that no one shall be &quot;deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of law.&quot;<p>&gt; Since 2009, the United States, in the conduct of U.S. counterterrorism operations against al-Qa’ida and its associated forces outside of areas of active hostilities, has specifically targeted and killed one U.S. citizen, Anwar al-Aulaqi. The United States is further aware of three other U.S. citizens who have been killed in such U.S. counterterrorism operations over that same time period: Samir Khan, ‘Abd al-Rahman Anwar al-Aulaqi, and Jude Kenan Mohammed. These individuals were not specifically targeted by the United States. -Attorney General Eric Holder, May 22, 2013<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.politifact.com&#x2F;factchecks&#x2F;2014&#x2F;mar&#x2F;19&#x2F;kesha-rogers&#x2F;four-us-citizens-killed-obama-drone-strikes-3-were&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.politifact.com&#x2F;factchecks&#x2F;2014&#x2F;mar&#x2F;19&#x2F;kesha-roge...</a>')
