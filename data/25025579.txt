Does ubooquity offer something more?<p>I’m missing something that can markup on PDFs and highlights&#x2F;notes on epubs dont sync back to the original file because iBooks has it’s own copy. But I haven’t found a clear solution to this yet - one app that supports reading both PDF and epub and will sync annotations back into the file or a server. Send me recommendations please! Can ubooquity help here?')
