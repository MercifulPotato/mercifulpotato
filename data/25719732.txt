That&#x27;s not exactly what I&#x27;d call &quot;set for life.&quot;<p>Also note their estimate is &quot;per person.&quot; Cruise lines price rooms for at least double occupancy so they&#x27;re actually saying you&#x27;ll need $200&#x2F;day, unless you&#x27;re splitting with someone who has their own money.<p>On top of cruise fees, you&#x27;ll need some budget to just buy stuff now and then. You might even want health insurance.')
