If I wanted to build a storage layer for a small private DC - is Ceph the way to go? ZFS? Or maybe there&#x27;s something else?\nI&#x27;d like to have storage details hidden away from storage layer so that applications can write to a mount or something similar - what is the best solution for such problem these days, if one needs resiliency and redundancy baked in ?')
