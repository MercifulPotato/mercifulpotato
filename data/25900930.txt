They also deliberately don&#x27;t on-board any new ones. This is the same strategy they used against Netflix if you recall - deliberately don&#x27;t upgrade the linecards at choke points to ensure Netflix packets get dropped. Netflix eventually caved (and raised prices) so we&#x27;re all paying for it on both ends: as ISP customers and Netflix subscribers. Who doesn&#x27;t like a bit of double-dipping?<p>They really really want to go back to the long-distance telephone days where people paid according to some kind of metering plan. That&#x27;s the whole push behind getting rid of Net Neutrality (which is how the internet always worked up to that point - so much so we had to invent a new term to describe what was taken away). Why invest in new plant, fiber, or equipment? Just stop upgrading or upgrade very slowly and let increases in data usage dump money directly into your pocket. A great gig if you can get it.')
