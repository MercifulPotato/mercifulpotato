(usually through continuing-ed programs at a local university or through local for-profit schools. I’ve heard—but have not explored this myself—that community colleges also tend to offer interesting courses at affordable prices — eg languages, business, vocational etc)<p>Some classes I’ve taken in recent years:<p>- Full (semester&#x2F;quarter long) courses: story telling, creative writing, Alexander technique,  languages (8 quarters and still ongoing), a history of Western civilization (a 3 quarter sequence)<p>- Once off classes: archery, calligraphy, flash fiction writing, editing, language classes on iTalki, history seminars, harmony singing<p>I also want to say that this is one of the main advantages of living in a big city [0] with major universities (in my case UChicago [1] and Northwestern) and specialty schools [2].<p>When I lived in a smaller city I couldn’t have taken a fraction of the course I’d listed above. Different strokes for different folks but for me, the creative energy of a big city calls to me.<p>(just for context, I have a full time job but no kids.
