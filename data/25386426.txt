The &#x27;sorry, but we thought leaving the source code for people to scrutinise was the appropriate level of disclosure&#x27; attitude doesn&#x27;t exactly inspire confidence they won&#x27;t make a worse &#x27;mistake&#x27; next time either.<p>If you really want to avoid being tracked, you probably want a more robust solution than simply choosing the browser vendor that&#x27;s least honest about its monetisation strategy, and you&#x27;re particularly unlikely to want to be getting browser history based feed recommendations from your browser vendor&#x27;s CDN anyway')
