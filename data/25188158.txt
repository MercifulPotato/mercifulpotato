It&#x27;s built into the business model and not really a &quot;subsidy&quot;.<p>I agree with you in terms that we shouldn&#x27;t view these companies as operating in a vacuum, I just don&#x27;t think the idea of the markets being propped up is the most congruent way of framing the discussion. Pfizer benefited along with most other publicly traded companies, irrespective of their COVID vaccine.')
