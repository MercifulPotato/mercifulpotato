It&#x27;s not just &quot;lol, 1 - 1 = 0, meritocracy is impossible&quot;.<p>The underlying principal, as I understand it, is that it&#x27;s unreasonable to think for example, that mark zuck literally does millions of time more work than say, a senior software dev at a middle size company, or a farmer. Yet zuck is compensated as such. We can recognize the &quot;unique&quot; value facebook creates by giving unique compensation, but should that compensation really be x1m times more than the farmer?<p>Reworking wealth distribution is the goal - not rewarding everyone equally for everything in some meme level paradox.')
