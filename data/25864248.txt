Why require the user to copy&#x2F;paste at all? If you meant &quot;Ensure that the user hasn&#x27;t copied quotation marks as well&quot;, then we&#x27;re back to it being application logic.<p>If I&#x27;m understanding correctly that the primary benefit is that there is a checksum, then there are already many solutions for this in common use - base58checksum, as used to ensure the validity of Bitcoin addresses, comes immediately to mind. I wrote an implementation of that quite a while ago: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;lyndsysimon&#x2F;cryptocoin&#x2F;blob&#x2F;primary&#x2F;cryptocoin&#x2F;base58.py" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;lyndsysimon&#x2F;cryptocoin&#x2F;blob&#x2F;primary&#x2F;crypt...</a><p>Please don&#x27;t misunderstand, I&#x27;m in no way intending to be argumentative. I don&#x27;t understand the practical use of this project, which leads me to believe that there is a problem being solved that I lack the context to identify.')
