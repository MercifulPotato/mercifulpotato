Item(by='MauranKilom', descendants=None, kids=[25679297], score=None, time=1610061475, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25678702, text='&gt; I disagree, trump&#x27;s rhetoric works precisely because there is enough reasonable evidence to call into question your perspective on election integrity, and people are upset that it&#x27;s being ignored.<p>It is clear to me that Trump and his surroundings have no qualms about fabricating &quot;truths&quot; in whatever quantity fitting whatever narrative to match their aims. This has been the playbook from day 1, see [0]. It appears to work regardless of any underlying facts.<p>I fully admit that I am not privy to the perspective of and influences on Trump supporters at large and capitol stormers in particular. However, the idea that there is a meaningful bar of evidence to clear before his supporters buy into his statements appears largely unfounded to me. Otherwise our current reality would be incompatible with [0].<p>And let me be perfectly clear that virtually every human will believe a convenient &quot;truth&quot; at some point or another. But given the degree to which Trump&#x27;s entire sphere of influence has supported any outlandish, nonsensical or downright contradictory thought he expresses, I do not see how election integrity measures would have moved the needle in this regard. (Which is not to dismiss the need for them, just their influence on this attack).<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;graphics&#x2F;politics&#x2F;trump-claims-database&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;graphics&#x2F;politics&#x2F;trump-claim...</a>')
