We have an internal proto that describes the config of a gRPC service. We then have a library for all of our languages that turns that proto into a Channel that&#x27;s instrumented with everything from middlewares to low level socket settings (keep alive, idle timeouts, retries, hedging, etc). Makes our deployments super easy as well since every service is configured to talk to every other service in almost a 100% identical way.')
