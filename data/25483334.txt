Yet, when we imagine a king attended with every pleasure\nhe can feel, if he be without diversion, and be left to consider and\nreflect on what he is, this feeble happiness will not sustain him; he\nwill necessarily fall into forebodings of dangers, of revolutions which\nmay happen, and, finally, of death and inevitable disease; so that if he\nbe without what is called diversion, he is unhappy, and more unhappy\nthan the least of his subjects who plays and diverts himself.</i><p><i>Hence it comes that play and the society of women, war, and high posts,\nare so sought after. Not that there is in fact any happiness in them, or\nthat men imagine true bliss to consist in money won at play, or in the\nhare which they hunt; we would not take these as a gift. We do not seek\nthat easy and peaceful lot which permits us to think of our unhappy\ncondition, nor the dangers of war, nor the labour of office, but the\nbustle which averts these thoughts of ours, and amuses us.</i><p><i>Reasons why we like the chase better than the quarry.</i><p><i>Hence it comes that men so much love noise and stir; hence it comes that\nthe prison is so horrible a punishment; hence it comes that the pleasure\nof solitude is a thing incomprehensible. And it is in fact the greatest\nsource of happiness in the condition of kings, that men try incessantly\nto divert them, and to procure for them all kinds of pleasures.</i><p><i>The king is surrounded by persons whose only thought is to divert the\nking, and to prevent his thinking of self. For he is unhappy, king\nthough he be, if he think of himself.</i><p><i>This is all that men have been able to discover to make themselves\nhappy. And those who philosophise on the matter, and who think men\nunreasonable for spending a whole day in chasing a hare which they would\nnot have bought, scarce know our nature. The hare in itself would not\nscreen us from the sight of death and calamities; but the chase which\nturns away our attention from these, does screen us.</i>')
