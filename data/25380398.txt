Test unlimited sites as often as you want including local development sites to find and eliminate broken links, duplicate content, invalid HTML&#x2F;CSS&#x2F;JavaScript, insecure pages, redirect chains and 50+ other common website problems.<p>It grew from automating manual audits I was doing for client work. It was especially useful when I was making risky changes and big refactors to large websites where it was hard to predict which pages would break.')
