The ones that do, are looked at sideways and are a pain to work with due to interoperability issues with Word&#x2F;Excel and Docs&#x2F;Sheets (yes, they do exist).<p>Microsoft has also taken some pretty big steps forward over the last couple of years when it comes to document collaboration&#x2F;sharing. Most Office applications now allow for live sharing&#x2F;collaboration via the desktop apps.<p>There’s also the O365 web-based capability similar to Docs&#x2F;Sheets. Plus, these are integrated with other O365 products like OneDrive and SharePoint (laugh, but SharePoint is unlikely to go away anytime soon with enterprise customers).<p>I have yet to find a product differentiator that GSuite (or whatever they call it now) has over M365&#x2F;O365, except maybe sometimes price. On the other hand, Microsoft has a number of differentiators over Google’s products. Even with the price differences, Enterprise customers get significant volume licensing discounts and see cost savings through not having to retrain everyone from IT administrators to day-to-day users.')
