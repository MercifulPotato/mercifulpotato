The Hiptop (branded as the T-Mobile Sidekick) was <i>very</i> popular in the US - it was widely advertised on TV and &quot;all the cool kids&quot; had one. Literally kids - it was popular with a younger generation, and advertising played that up.<p>The hiptop unquestionably crossed the threshold into mainstream awareness at the time. It&#x27;s just been forgotten because the iPhone overshadowed it.<p>On a personal note, I had a few generations of Hiptop before I switched to the 1st gen iPhone. Yes, my first experience with the iPhone was memorable... but still not as memorable as my first Hiptop. &quot;You mean I have <i>the internet</i> everywhere??&quot; That was incredible in 2002. We just take it for granted now.')
