They can&#x27;t unilaterally revoke a Developer ID cert, they can only request that Apple revoke it.<p>That is literally how revocation works. There is no magic &quot;make this key no longer work&quot; function.<p>Revocation of a cert means telling the CA to revoke the cert. It is no different when the CA is Apple, than if it were Thawte, or Google, or LetsEncrypt. Revocation means telling the CA to add your certificate to the list they publish of no longer valid certificates.<p>Managing your certs if absolutely the responsibility of the developer. It is no different from any other cert - TLS certs, S&#x2F;MIME, etc are all the same. The only difference is the usage flags included in the cert.<p>&gt; Almost all known Developer ID certificate revocations are not the result of the developer&#x27;s own request but rather the result of Apple discovering malware in the wild and revoking the certs of the malware authors.<p>That is, apple has found evidence of key compromise, and so revoked the cert. For WebPKI CAs there is a hard requirement that the moment they receive any evidence of a key being compromised they are <i>required</i> to revoke within 24 hours, or risk penalization.<p>Again, Apple is acting no differently from any other CA.')
