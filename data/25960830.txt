Accessible at: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;doi.org&#x2F;10.1116&#x2F;6.0000743" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;doi.org&#x2F;10.1116&#x2F;6.0000743</a><p>The title of the article describing this research paper is very misleading.<p>Here&#x27;s the primary conclusion of the paper:<p>&quot;Moreover, the ambient temperature changes from 4 to 40 °C had no effect on S-RBD-ACE-2 ligand-receptor binding and minimal effect on the S-RBD protein structure (up to 40 °C), though protein denaturing occurred at 51 °C. Our results suggest that ambient temperatures from 4 to 40 °C have little effect on the SARS-CoV-2-ACE-2 interaction in agreement with the infection data currently reported.&quot;<p>Where I&#x27;m from, the temperature regularly drops to -25 °C in the winter, so this study does not generalize well. In fact, the final conclusion is so weak, it may as well be discarded: &quot;...results suggest...temperatures...have little effect...on the...interaction&quot;.<p>However, this study does prove that saunas and steam rooms kill SARS-CoV-2, as &quot;protein denaturing occurred at 51 °C&quot;, which is well below the average temperature reached in a sauna.')
