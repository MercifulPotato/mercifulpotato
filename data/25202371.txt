Consider jawline, height, and facial&#x2F;chest&#x2F;arm hair. This is all sexual signalling.<p>Now compare those same features between yourself (an Asian male) and the typical norms for non-Asian males. Most likely you can see some differences. It is really unlikely that you are a tall man with a wide squared-off jaw and the ability to grow a thick beard.<p>So I think that explains most of your trouble, and also why your Asian female friends have no trouble. For future reference when you get to the chat stage: your &quot;progressive and liberal values&quot; are probably ideal... for getting into the friendzone. What people seek in friends, and what people claim to seek in relationships, may differ from what people are actually attracted to.')
