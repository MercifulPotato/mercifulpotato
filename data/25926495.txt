Especially if you want to do work with that expands on findings on other papers that roughly look good &quot;trust but verify&quot; seems to be the way to go.<p>I&#x27;ve only recently dipped by toes into academic life in a lab, but it very much seems that PIs generally know which are the bad apples. E.g. when discussing whether some data is good enough to be publishable the PIs reaction was something along the lines of &quot;If we were FAMOUS_LAB_NAME it would be, but we want to do it in a way that holds up&quot;. So it seems like there are at least some barriers to how incompetence would hurt the whole field.<p>I&#x27;m also surprised that there is no mention of the PI in GP&#x27;s story. As it&#x27;s a paper published by the lab, it&#x27;s not just on the grad student &quot;to do the right thing&quot;, but even more on the more senior scientist, whose reputation is also at stake.')
