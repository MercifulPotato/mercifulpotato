That argument is as comically out-of-date as it ever was, with CI&#x2F;CAM devices (for SmartCard readers) being installed on every Smart TV and set-top box since the SD&#x2F;DVB1 times. Even though they argue they act in accordance with the majority, they know quite well that they&#x27;d loose a large percentage of their audience out of inertia alone when they&#x27;d be doing the decent thing and require SmartCards for those who actually want to watch their TV programs which, as far as entertainment goes, is mostly bottom-of-the-barrel palliative-care crime series plus expensive programs for corrupt sports (the good stuff is mostly on radio IMO).<p>But public broadcasters also have expansive web&#x2F;IP presence, and even use Facebook for public communication (ZDF), when in their news&#x2F;opinion pieces they rant against social media LOL.<p>Public broadcasters today seem just to create a self-serving and self-referential media presence for politicians, in these times of Coronavirus more than ever. Tonight, they&#x27;re going to push for even stronger measures including curfews (!) even though infections are going down; needless to say, without parliamentary participation. The whole thing is getting out of hands with irrationality fast right now.')
