Item(by='ashtonkem', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609181077, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25559945, text='&gt; Because it gets old listening to the same tired uninformed troupes[sic] from some random person on the internet that is just regurgitating misinformation.<p>Not to be harsh, but your frustrations are yours alone. Nobody else is terribly motivated by your pet peeves, and when you snap at people with &quot;stop it&quot; their response is going to be less &quot;they must be tired of something&quot; and more &quot;what an unreasonable &lt;bleep&gt;&quot;.<p>&gt; For people that actually live in San Francisco this is a real issue that affects our daily lives.<p>Living in a city does not give you exclusive right to discuss its issues, nor does it give you a monopoly on information about that city.<p>And by your own theory, you shouldn&#x27;t be talking about Vancouver, since apparently you do not live there.<p>&gt; Having some random person spreading more incorrect info is insulting<p>&quot;You&#x27;re wrong and shut up&quot; (paraphrased) doesn&#x27;t stop people from repeating what you perceive to be misinformation. All it does is convince them that you&#x27;re an unreasonable person to interact with. If you want to actually stop the &quot;misinformation&quot;, provide arguments. Because I guarantee you that nobody here will respect your preposterous order to &quot;stop it&quot;.<p>&gt; and actually potentially harmful to the people that actually live here and have to pay those rents like I do.<p>I know that there&#x27;s an increasing trend towards viewing speech as violence, but this is ridiculous. My opinion on rents in SF is not harming you, least of all because I have literally <i>no</i> power to affect policy in a city over 500 miles away from me.<p>And even if you still persist in believing that we&#x27;re somehow hurting you by talking about your city, then a dismissive attempt to shut down the conversation is doing you no favors, because you haven&#x27;t convinced anyone here that they&#x27;re wrong. They&#x27;ll just keep repeating what they believe after they&#x27;ve finished downvoting your complaints into oblivion.')
