Item(by='tom-_-', descendants=None, kids=[24659171, 24659199, 24659149], score=None, time=1601614559, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24658052, text='Spam PRs are frustrating but this rant just reads as petty and vindictive.<p>The author claims that he doesn&#x27;t &quot;want to cancel or shame him personally&quot;, which just rings of false humility considering he named the article &quot;How One Guy Ruined #Hacktoberfest2020&quot; and then chose to expose his Youtube name repeatedly, something even other frustrated tweeters chose NOT to do.<p>Here&#x27;s what CodeWithHarry did:<p>He created an example video of submitting a PR to an open source project that repeatedly reminded its viewers to make worthwhile contributions.<p>He then posted a lengthy response to again inform his viewers to NOT submit spammy PRs.<p>He&#x27;s acting responsibly and in good faith.<p>Does this deserve lynching by the twitter mob?<p>Edit: Yes, the video appears to be mostly about showing kids how to get free swag with open source contributions without too much concern for whether these PRs are worthwhile.  But the author of this post is absolutely trying to shame&#x2F;cancel him personally.')
