In past their “Aarogya Setu” app has been criticized for privacy concerns.\nNote that the people who complained about Google’s review policy aren’t indie Developers but big Players like PayTM who benefited immensely from demonetization mandate.\nClearly violating a policy that’s in place to protect the user and then complaining that your app got taken down is ridiculous. \nAgree, App Store review process isn’t perfect. There are mistakes in review process which get some apps wrongfully rejected. But I would rather have stricter policies than no&#x2F;questionable review process.\nAnother point is specific to this govt. The govt and the PM don’t exactly have a great track record when it comes to minorities, which makes such interference more scary.')
