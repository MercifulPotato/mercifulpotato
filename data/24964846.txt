I really love wanting to do a release, and watching my CI provider take three minutes to pull down a 30MB docker image, or &quot;npm install&quot; running at dialup speeds.  All while they&#x27;re billing you per minute -- they make money by not investing in their infrastructure!  I&#x27;d prefer to pay per byte transferred and CPU instruction executed -- if they make the hardware or network faster, the price stays the same, but they can do more work with their infrastructure.  And if you schedule less work, the price for you goes down.<p>But, it&#x27;s simply not done, and that&#x27;s kind of sad because slow CI is probably the biggest engineering time killer in existence.  Other than Hacker News ;)')
