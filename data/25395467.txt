Look at Reddit&#x27;s ban on toxic subreddits. They found that banning toxic subreddits reduced the toxicity in the website as a whole, and that &quot;post-ban, hate speech by the same users was reduced by as much as 80-90 percent.&quot; [1]<p>Your analogy only really works if you ban half the population from the US. Sure if you banned democrats or republicans from the country, then you could reduce tensions. But if you censor one side and keep them around, it&#x27;ll only inflame tensions.<p>&gt; I think YouTube made the right calculation that this will in fact _reduce_ tension and slow the momentum of this destabilizing movement.<p>Does it seem to you that tensions are reducing? If youtube did this after the 2016 election, do you think it would have reduced tensions?')
