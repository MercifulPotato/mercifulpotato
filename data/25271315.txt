I find it hard to believe that scientists who have specialised very narrowly in their domain will also want to be full-time software engineers too and choose one of the most complex languages on top of that. This just doesn&#x27;t scale beyond the few people who are really into it.<p>&gt; Köster, now at the University of Duisburg-Essen in Germany, was looking for a language that offered the “expressiveness” of Python but the speed of languages such as C and C++.<p>Rust doesn&#x27;t have the expressiveness of Python (even when you put expressiveness in quotes), it&#x27;s not even close. What you&#x27;re looking for is probably Julia (and Julia is already quite a bit more difficult than Python even if the syntax looks superficially similar).')
