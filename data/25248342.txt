Darcs is criticized for lack of soundness and potential exponential merge complexity -- which I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ve actually run into -- but that&#x27;s Darcs2.  I haven&#x27;t actually followed along, but I thought the development Darcs3 is an answer.  This may not be the place to ask, but can anyone compare the new Pijul and Darcs3?')
