They come with nice gatekeepers too, as long you do not step on toes.<p>What there are too little of, are venues for discussion of the _perfectly legal but not necessarily tasteful,  pleasant or genial things_. We have way too many walled gardens which are bent upon imposing their worldview on their patrons. We need a lot less of that.<p>Time and again we are reminded that taking away plentiful online venues for the discussion of things wont just make such discussions disappear or people holding unwelcome views go away for good.<p>In short, we need perfectly legal and lawful &#x27;cesspools&#x27; and fewer curated and coercive walled gardens.')
