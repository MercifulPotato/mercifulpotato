Based on their historical observations, it&#x27;s not illogical to continue sharing.<p>But policy has changed in 2020.  Now the data goes into databases with a physical consequence: temporary blacklisting from work, play, school, travel, even non-essential medical treatment.<p>This is why people who have already been contact traced (they are already experiencing and learning the consequences) have been reluctant to give the names of their close contacts, because they know personally the consequences that will be imposed on their contacts, facilitated by <i>their</i> disclosure of contact names.<p>Until people have this first-hand learning experience, it&#x27;s difficult to put the data in context.  Most importantly, being contact traced <i>does not</i> mean they are sick or will get sick from the (possibly symptom-free and false-positive PCR test) contact being traced, yet they and their contacts would be asked to pay an expensive price.')
