Taiwan is not recognized as a county by the UN! While the CCP is recognized as the legitimate government of China<p>Also China has been claiming control over Taiwan ever since they won the civil war, so is not true what you&#x27;re saying here that nobody has claimed Taiwan.<p>&gt; The fact that the CCP has a group of men with guns occupying China<p>Well.. first they were not a bounce of men with guns they had the support of millions of people in China! And the reason was pretty easy, the old government (that become the Komingtan) sold China to the west and Japan (look for Nanjing puppet state [1]) and they were not happy about it by any means! So yes, they had all the rights to start the revolution to fight a corrupted government.<p>But even if they were a bounce of random people, the Brits went in Australia with guns and all and claim &quot;this is mine now&quot; and as you can see nobody is complaining about it. Before that they went to the current American continent and claim the land as well with guns and all, guess who won?<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Wang_Jingwei_regime" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Wang_Jingwei_regime</a>')
