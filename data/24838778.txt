I can&#x27;t stand scrolling through pages of people telling me about the history of this thing they cooked while ads are popping up to get to the actual recipe.<p>And if anyone has any suggestions for better places online to look for recipes, I&#x27;d be happy to have them! I like Cooking for Engineers [0] but still usually use a book.<p>[0] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cookingforengineers.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cookingforengineers.com&#x2F;</a>')
