Germany was democracy in between 1918-1932 and it was forced to become one by their own enemies.<p>The incivility after 1918 was result of loosing war, result of anti-monarchy revolution, result of communist attempt for revolution and so on. It also had to do with rejection of democracy on principle. It had less to do with multiple parties existing or lack of two party system.')
