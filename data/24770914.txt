Item(by='xyst', descendants=None, kids=[24770960, 24770939], score=None, time=1602627058, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24767378, text='Can we talk about the hypocrisy of the recycling segment given that Apple is a known adversary of the “right to repair” bill?<p>All of this “net-zero” talk yet they have a system in place that makes it prohibitively expensive to repair slightly damaged devices (ie, bad battery) out of warranty. So, consumers are left to live with the problem, pay for the cost of the repair which ends up costing about 1&#x2F;2 to 3&#x2F;4 of a new phone, or just buy a new phone.<p>Of course, people could go to a third party repair facility, but Apple doesn’t provide these businesses with the replacement parts and software to fix their phones. In one case, the display hardware identifier is tied to the “True Tone” feature and changing the display will result in this feature not working. In another case, the TouchID is hardcoded to the device and can only be reset by Apple techs, otherwise the Touch ID feature no longer works.<p>I like Apple products in general, but this is one of the few cases where Apple can do better.')
