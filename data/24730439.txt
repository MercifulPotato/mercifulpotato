It was purely public health.<p>At the beginning of the pandemic, we thought we could trace and contain anybody with covid, thus ELIMINATING the virus. In this view, only healthcare workers need masks! If healthcare workers go without masks because every ordinary joe stocked up on masks and toilet paper, that means that healthcare workers get infected and become the spreaders, which is the opposite of &quot;containing&quot;.<p>The original PR was something like &quot;masks don&#x27;t work unless it&#x27;s an N95 mask and you wear it in a very specific way, and healthcare workers need those anyways so don&#x27;t buy &#x27;em&quot;. Yeah, I can agree it feels misleading now.<p>But in a world where we&#x27;re trying to literally ELIMINATE the virus, it makes sense: Wearing a cloth mask near someone with the virus COULD get you infected, so you&#x27;re better off not being in that situation in the first place.<p>Once it became clear that we couldn&#x27;t just have everybody stay at home until the virus is gone, the CDC changed their recommendation to wearing cloth masks. This was about 2 weeks into &quot;lockdowns&quot;, at the very very beginning of april.<p>I fail to see whats so bad about the CDC&#x27;s recommendations. From the point of view of public health (again, that&#x27;s what the CDC is. A public health agency), these recommendations make sense in context.')
