Our only other option is to not buy, and build in-house instead. Sometimes that&#x27;s worthwhile, but other times (like in the case of zoom) it still makes sense to buy the vendor&#x27;s product, even if you know that it&#x27;s not everything it&#x27;s advertised as being.<p>The real efficiency is found in having people who can determine which and if you should buy a vendor&#x27;s product, or if you should go in house. Specifically people who can see through the marketing BS and evaluate technologies without personal or hype bias.')
