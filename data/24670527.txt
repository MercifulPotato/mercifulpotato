Terrible idea in practice. graceful degradation goes out of window.  Why are you rewriting the browser rendering implantation in a JS engine? It is clever, and dumb.<p>For visual consistence just stick with templating model and SSR.  Also most tech people mostly turn off JS when they browse the web any way. React people, yes I&#x27;m looking at your!<p>In addition, as React&#x2F;Redux type of projects gets big, it is a nightmare to maintain. Yes I know it is all about the coder.  However, most front end developer (transitioning from jquery css&#x2F;html) do not have the needed programming skills to develop something like React.<p>I would say React is more computer science ppl who wants to do front end approach. If that is the case, just go with mithril (they have JSX). Stop this insanity of using React just because hipster sillicon valley ppl are using it cause it is trendy and get high paying jobs.')
