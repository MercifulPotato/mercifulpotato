I&#x27;d blame lifestyle changes and BPA far before I thought exercising normal &quot;gentlemanly&quot; restraint caused T to dip. Also, your theory doesn&#x27;t explain the anomaly of all the large muscular men who you can tell by physical appearance have high T and who are very kind and not aggressive. Bar fights have a lot more to do with environmental factors that influence behavior, like how they were raised, the same socioeconomic factors that contribute to violent crime, etc.')
