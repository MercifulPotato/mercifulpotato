Canonical is not that big, and doesn&#x27;t really do that well anyway (even assuming it&#x27;s interested). And because Linux is mostly hardcore devs and enthusiasts, it&#x27;s difficult to sell them any major change to the way things have always been.<p>One idea for example that sounded like a move forward is something like GoboLinux fs structure. But of course that will get ridiculed by most Linux greybeards because it&#x27;s not like things have always been. Some for something like NixOS. And that&#x27;s just of the FHS layer -- imagine the resistance to changes to more classic layers (e.g. the hate something like systemd still gets).<p>Apple can change things more easily because they can do it end to end, and millions of consumers don&#x27;t expect things to stay like NextSTEP forever, or care about strict POSIX adherence), but they still get all the hate on HN for many moves.<p>And of course nobody appreciates the hard work of moving e.g. 500,000,000 devices or more (iOS + macOS) to a new filesystem you have developed in the span of 5 or so years - but they notice all the baby issues that pop up (while similar issues to e.g. fs changes in Linux distros, with all the fragmentation, and &quot;DIY&quot; go unnoticed, or pinned to the user as responsible who switched from ext4 to something else etc.).')
