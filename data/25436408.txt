For example, Alaska is billed for the early warning and radar systems to detect Russian ICBMs, but Alaskans don&#x27;t really benefit from it because Russia would never bomb Alaska, and most of the jobs go to people shipped in from the lower 48 states, not Alaskans.<p>Likewise, Nebraskan farmers look like they&#x27;re on the dole with the corn subsidies, but the other 49 states benefit from lower and stable corn prices, so it isn&#x27;t clear why Nebraska would get all the costs accounted to them when everyone benefits from it.')
