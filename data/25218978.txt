Of course not. But I work mostly from home now. It would be great if I could ditch my laptop and have a desktop Mac for the bulk of my work, with the iPad filling the gaps.<p>But as things stand, I can&#x27;t run a web server, can&#x27;t run PHP or Node, I can&#x27;t even open dev tools in the browser without relying on a &quot;real computer&quot;. Which is especially stupid considering that, even though my &quot;real computer&quot; is a 16&quot; MacBook Pro that cost 3x what the iPad cost, the iPad is faster in many regards (and doesn&#x27;t burn the skin off my lap either).')
