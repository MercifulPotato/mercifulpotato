And also because they are not given access to enough information to be able to make an informed decision on whether the technology is safe to use, under what parameters.<p>Not to mention that the lack of accountability this creates for the company introduces perverse incentives - the company is getting free labour, and the more it hides about real stats, the more free labour it is likely to get.<p>This is all pretty well settled ethics - it is for the same reason that we don&#x27;t allow companies to run beta tests for potentially life-saving drugs. This is long settled both legally and ethically, and the self-driving case is essentially identical, so why reopen that debate?')
