Focus on learning computer science, computer architecture and networks as a foundation.<p>Learning all this technology without understanding the fundamentals is a waste of time.<p>Most certs are overrated. They don’t actually test your understanding that well. The people who care a lot about certs are people who you probably don’t want to work with. They’re just a way for the IT guys who run the cert programs to make extra cash. By all means, if your company is willing to pay for cert training get it but don’t waste too much time studying for them.')
