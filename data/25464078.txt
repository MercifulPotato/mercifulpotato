What a great idea! Why doesn&#x27;t everyone do that? I mean except for the employees of course. They can&#x27;t have companies staffed by employees they don&#x27;t pay for. Duh. Only Amazon and Walmart can have that, obvs. I mean who would be their employees? You? Not me. I guess we need something like a seperate class or group of people who have to be the underpaid employees so that the rest of us can enjoy being the employers without paying for it. We used to have that back in the good old days...<p>It&#x27;s almost like this is a stupid argument that there is no way to excuse, and no amount of indirect smoke &amp; mirrors or denial gets around that, and anyone even <i>trying</i> deserves to be among the first people rounded up for the new press gangs they think are so fair a great.')
