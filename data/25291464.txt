That means that data and software should evolve following different procedures, what heavily implies that you want different people working at them, or at least you want people to look at them at different times.<p>For that, you really want independent access controls and CI tooling.<p>Of course, you can&#x27;t separate much if you are a 1 or 2 people team at early stages of some project. And it may help you move faster.<p>But:<p>&gt; &quot;Rebuilding the database is as simple as executing one line bash loop (I do it every few minutes)&quot;<p>This denounces a very development-centric worldview where operations and maintenance don&#x27;t even appear. You can never rebuild a database, and starting with the delusion that you will harm you on the future.')
