Baldurs gate and Diablo are both RPGs but are pretty far from each other. Even Team Fortress could be classified as a RPG with the most pedantic reading.<p>That&#x27;s why we have additional classifiers. Diablo is an A(ction)RPG, Baldurs gate is tagged as D&amp;D and Classic on Steam, and TF2 is a multiplayer FPS (without the RPG tag because most people are not pedantic af).<p>As far as Roguelikes go, I subscribe to the belief that they pretty much have to be permadeath, tile based, procedural generation for levels and items. Most games don&#x27;t fit the bill, but so what, it&#x27;s good enough as a general guideline. Recently we also got the &quot;Roguelite&quot; term to describe Roguelikes that are not very Roguelike-y :)<p>Bottom line, why are people so up in arms about a tag that doesn&#x27;t even mean that much?')
