Item(by='skissane', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611480949, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25889331, text='One problem is that the IMF adjusts the currencies in the SDR basket over time. It would be feasible for a private issuer to offer something based on the current SDR basket. But next time the IMF reweighs the basket, they will have a problem. The reweighing operation is designed to not the change the value, but a private issuer that wanted to follow the SDR basket as it changes would have to move quickly in the market to reweigh its assets, and there would be a risk they would lose out in the process. (Maybe they could hedge against that risk, but that would incur an added cost.)<p>I think the biggest reason why this product isn&#x27;t offered, is there is no great demand for it. Anyone can do the same thing themselves just by buying the underlying currencies. But, investors probably would take more interest in genuine SDRs issued by the IMF than in some private company&#x27;s simulation of them. Real SDRs would have far less counterparty risk and operating expenses than such a simulated SDR would have.')
