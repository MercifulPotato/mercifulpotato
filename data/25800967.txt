I moved a lot of my contacts and several groups over to Signal. And this happened. I&#x27;m fine with the down time, I don&#x27;t have any urgent communication needs and if I did, there are other ways to contact people (SMS, email, WhatsApp, etc.). But I feel like I owe these people an explanation about this. An explanation where I say, &quot;Hey look, there are no guarantees this won&#x27;t happen in the future, but should still stick to this one&quot;. I&#x27;m not very good at writing and hoping to find something that I can use :)')
