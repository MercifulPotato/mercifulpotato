Power sources like plants or dams only produce so much. Even if you have bribed a corrupt grid operator to give you 100% of the output from a X megawatt coal plant for free, you&#x27;re still limited to X megawatts of hashing. If you can turn that X megawatts into 10*X megawatts&#x27; worth of your competitors&#x27; hashing, well, you just 10xed your profit.')
