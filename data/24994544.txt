It didn’t do them much good, a year later I read they had lost $60 million because you could go into their web banking system, and once authenticated you could access any retail bank account by changing the account number in the URL.<p>Years earlier I was at Chase Manhattan when they decided to hire at IT security role. The guy they selected was a tradesman who specialized in brickwork. Computer Security For Dummies was also his goto and it never left his hands. Most of our interaction with him was his trying to find “the NFS”. We told him several times that we didn’t use NFS but he was convinced we did and were hiding the NFS from him. He called all of us individually into meetings with him and our manager to try and get us to crack and admit where we had hidden the NFS but was unsuccessful - it was a conspiracy. He hired in a couple of consultants find where the NFS was but they couldn’t find it either. When I left he was having the network engineers trace all of the cables to see if we had hidden the NFS in a closet or under the floor.')
