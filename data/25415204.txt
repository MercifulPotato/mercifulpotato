Item(by='Cthulhu_', descendants=None, kids=[25415691], score=None, time=1607939796, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25415085, text='Same, but at the same time, it&#x27;s preparing for a future where the borders and international shipping may be impossible, where overpopulation means we can no longer use land for farming, and where farmland becomes unusable or at least unpredictable due to climate change. Plus something about colonizing space. It&#x27;s far future and dystopian, but not improbable.<p>Anyway, it&#x27;s not the most efficient way to grow food; I live in a country where they have tons of greenhouses. Also pretty energy intensive, but yields are great and predictable, meaning that despite being one of the smallest countries of the world, we&#x27;re the second largest agricultural exporter in the world. Basically we do a lot with what we have. Which is also (for me) a bit unexpected given that most of the areas I&#x27;ve lived in and driven through is grass for cattle.')
