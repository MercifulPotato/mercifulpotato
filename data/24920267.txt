Why was I manually going in, removing bad takes, and adding timestamps to the post? I was determined to find a better way.<p>Using the Web Speech Recognition API, Narration.studio detects which sentence you are saying, allowing you to retake previous lines, pause and take a drink, or chat to someone mid-recording. It will all get cut automatically.<p>Fine-tune the cuts in the editor, adjusting the start and end point for each clip, or the amount of time between sentences. When you&#x27;re happy, download your edited audio as a high-quality WAV file and grab the script - now annotated with a timestamp for each paragraph.<p>It&#x27;s all open source on GitHub, and the readme has more detail about the implementation, so go take a look and submit a PR! <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;stevenwaterman&#x2F;narration.studio&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;stevenwaterman&#x2F;narration.studio&#x2F;</a>')
