Sometimes it is a legit serious vulnerability, like shellshock or heartbleed, but a lot are just novices trying to get their 15 minutes of fame. I remember a few years back there was a &quot;vulnerability&quot; named GRINCH, where the person who discovered it claimed it was a root priviledge escalation that worked on all versions of Red Hat and CentOS. They made a website and everything for it, and tried to hype it up before disclosing what it was. Turns out the &quot;vulnerability&quot; was members of the wheel group being able to use sudo to run commands as root.')
