It was a really good OS for what it was.<p>I guess the moral of the story here is if you want to play with sharp knives you should have the option to. Power users who have been using computers for most of their lives shouldn&#x27;t be put on the same playing field as your 65 year old Aunt or Uncle who still thinks AOL is the internet.')
