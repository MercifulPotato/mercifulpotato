Why don&#x27;t we have something as easy to use as the DNS, but for authentication?<p>Imagine what authentication would look like, if we all started running is the same direction, instead of implementing our own authentication again and again. If we had something open source, that would allow you to sign in to all the sites you use, while completely protecting your privacy, so none of them know who you are.<p>This dream can come true. Technically at least. I&#x27;ve taken the the first baby steps with <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;promiseauthentication.org" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;promiseauthentication.org</a> which proves that this is possible.<p>But, for this to become a reality, we really need to start running in the same direction.
