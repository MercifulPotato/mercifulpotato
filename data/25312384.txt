A billionaire might have had an idea at the right time. For YC startups, the money comes from somebody else. Does having an idea justify to earn 100,000x the amount of somebody else who&#x27;s working 60 hours a week to keep their family from hunger? Comparing extremes here, I know.<p>I accept the fact that the market and law allow for this to happen, but I don&#x27;t have to respect billionaires for it.')
