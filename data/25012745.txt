Item(by='Retric', descendants=None, kids=[25012822], score=None, time=1604714507, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25011979, text='The absolute core gameplay mechanics of rogue like games historically was a combination of being strategic rather than twitch, resource management, permanent death, risk with randomized rewards, and progression.  A game like Slay the Spire fits that mold much more closely than something like dwarf fortress.<p>Being brutal is just an outgrowth of those basic mechanics.  Meaningful risks require meaningful costs.  Using an unidentified scroll consumes the scroll.  Fighting monsters consumes an unknown amount of resources to receive some benefit.  But, if you tone the game down to near safety then without twitch based tests it’s just wandering around freely.<p>Similarly, if you can memorize the layout or the meaning of a scroll for the next life, then that’s not a risk you’re taking.')
