Even though the goal at &quot;room temperature&quot; is technically met, it is misleading, because the goal &quot;room temperature&quot; meant superconducting under quite normal conditions to be of practical use.\nAnd when you have to apply that immense pressure it means we did not really come closer to superconducting in the normal world.<p>Still a success, yes, but probably not a milestone, unless that discovery leads to other findings, but I do not see anything indicating such.')
