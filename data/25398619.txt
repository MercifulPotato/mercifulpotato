I&#x27;m just a simple bear.<p>Thank you. Three (of your many points) stand out to me and are not receiving enough attention (criticism).<p>1. People are seeing more ads.<p>I&#x27;d love to see this quantified. Attention theft is another form of pollution, right? Just like we&#x27;re starting to quantify the impact of noise and light pollution on both our physical health and mental well being.<p>(I live a mostly ad-free existence. It&#x27;s always quite jarring when I step outside of my personal filter bubble. Like doing eldercare for my mom, airports, shopping, dining. TVs blaring every where. It&#x27;s surreal.)<p>2. advertisers are spending more<p>I don&#x27;t doubt that advertisers are spending more online. I would like to know (confirm) if overall ad spending has much changed.<p>Or perhaps the population of advertisers has changed. So some types of businesses are now advertising less, and others have embraced digital ads, and therefore make up the difference.<p>Personal anecdote: A sibling opened a neighborhood retail knickknacks (aka &quot;shit you don&#x27;t need&quot;) store. The performance of Facebook and instagram ads is surprisingly good. So I&#x27;m now certain that targeted ads are fantastic for at least some advertisers.<p>Or perhaps what&#x27;s considered advertising has changed. With the decline of brand based campaigns and rise of ad blocking, there is more product placement and payola (influencers).<p>I have no idea how non advertising marketing dollars are accounted for; probably something like surveying CMOs. I&#x27;ve skim read reports that marketing budgets as percentage of revenue has been stable thru the shift to digital.<p>3. ad performance is going down<p>This is very interesting.<p>I&#x27;ve long assumed that a huge fraction of digital advertising is fraudulent. Examples abound of Facebook lying, belatedly revising metrics downward, remarkable coincidences that errors always favor the aggregator, etc.<p>But maybe the bigger scandal is declining performance. I would totally believe this; diminishing returns and all that. We (society) are completely saturated, so excess advertising may even be detrimental. Worse example I can think of is political advertising.<p>--<p>Thanks again. I wish critics would better address all the points you touch on.')
