Off the top of my head, the frontend library supremacy* went something like:<p>- 2008 to 2012: Jquery<p>- 2012 to 2014: Backbone<p>- 2014 to 2016: Angular<p>- 2016 to present: React<p>And although there are serious contenders, React still seems like it has a solid lead over all others.  If it lasts another couple years, it&#x27;s been the dominant tool for longer than most.<p>* Based entirely on &quot;what I was hearing the most about at that time,&quot; not on any rigorous methodology.  There was still plenty of Jquery code being written last year and there are large, mature codebases out there in Backbone and Angular.')
