It all depends on your expectations. If you expect the same quality as expensive robust solid furniture, you will be disappointed. But if you want that type, you&#x27;ll need to pay for it.<p>There are also people who endlessly complain how uncomfortable it is to fly with low-cost airlines like Ryanair, but you can bet they will pick the cheapest low-cost flight for their next trip as well and complain again. If you want comfort you&#x27;ll have to pay for it. Otherwise, you get what you pay for. It&#x27;s still perfectly good for its function. Perhaps it gets a bit crooked or it&#x27;s kind of moving and warping when you open it, but whatever. It holds my clothes and books just fine.\nIf you want to, you can add further metal parts to strengthen the frame as well.')
