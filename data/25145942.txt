Things have gotten... weird... in the past 8yrs or so. 13 yrs as a SWE here. Self taught in tech, programming since I was a freshmen in highschool, majored in business in my undergrad but stuck with tech for a career. What&#x27;s next is the big question. I enjoyed my last gig, 4 years at a startup, massively more than I do now at at an &#x27;elite&#x27; tech company where I&#x27;m 5 yrs in. It&#x27;s just so fucking annoying and tedious. The only problem is I need to stick it out for 5 more years or so to be financially independent and work for myself. What kills me is the knowledge that if I played the game properly, I could already be there. Now, I have to decide on if I throw away 5 years, or eject and take the risk to do my own thing now. I&#x27;m giving it one more year to make that decision. At this point, I feel like it will come down to a coin flip, where I will pray for whatever side is the eject button while the coin is mid air.<p>What&#x27;s your plan if you quit tech?')
