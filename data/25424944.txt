I was instantly in enormous pain, but able to hobble around.<p>Later that night, I was in so much pain that I literally could not walk at all.  I was laughing and crying at the same time, it was ridiculous that I was in so much pain over a TOE. Not even the big toe at that.  I had to crawl to the bathroom to pee.  Luckily it just took another day and I could hobble on it again.')
