The problem is that Windows sets the PCIe address space wrong and then it can&#x27;t properly talk to the GPU anymore. It happened during one of those large Windows feature updates last year. You can find setup and documentation on egpu.io, goalque is the author. (it&#x27;s called something like automate-eGPU EFI)')
