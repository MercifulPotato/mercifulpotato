I&#x27;m looking to transition into management or sales, as coding has become less fulfilling for me and I&#x27;m a bit of an extrovert. I&#x27;m hoping to leverage what I&#x27;ve found is generally a rarity in the industry -- experience&#x2F;understanding of both platforms (Android&#x2F;iOS).<p>Is my experience of value any outside of coding? Is there a path I should be looking into that others have possibly made? Any feedback genuinely appreciated!')
