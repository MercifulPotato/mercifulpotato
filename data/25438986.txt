Which results in the bad cruch periods, since you can only delay so much once you&#x27;ve stamped that date on it. This happens all the time, but this is an exceptionally bad example.<p>On the one hand, I wish companies wouldn&#x27;t do this kind of crap, but on the other hand, the consumers need to be more responsible. This game has already made back the development costs, so all this backlash will probably amount to nothing. It&#x27;s harsh to say, but gamers will seemingly believe anything the marketing machine tells them hook line and sinker.')
