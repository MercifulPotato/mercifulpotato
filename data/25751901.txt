If most people don&#x27;t believe that they can have economic mobility then they simply won&#x27;t even bother. In order to get many people to bother and try you need to convince everyone that it&#x27;s possible, even if, in practice, few will manage to. It&#x27;s a first step, a stepping stone.<p>Of course, besides convincing people that it&#x27;s possible you need to have an economy that makes it possible. So that would be the second step.')
