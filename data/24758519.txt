Our current stick-built construction <i>IS</i> pre-fab by an older reckoning.<p>I guess its a matter of how much is too far?  Windows come as a unit. So do some doors. Certainly the appliances do. Nobody has to get a tinker in to make the toaster. Even so, sometimes there are hitches.<p>I think we have to iron out the order-to-fit issues (wrong dimensions, wrong fuel, mismatch color or design) when done by rushed workpeople on a schedule. Fix that, and you could go much further without trepidation.<p>For now, my house was stick-built from a drawing (not an architect) and mostly correctly.
