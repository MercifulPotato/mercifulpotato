I recently helped a customer to move from Docker EE to OpenShift.  They were frank about the pain points they experienced and why they were moving.  It really came down to competition.  K8s solves the problems they were having in a better way.  Now with so much momentum behind K8s, nearly everybody is re-platforming their offerings on top of K8s.')
