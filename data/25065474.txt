At our previous companies we were on both sides of the classic systems design interview, and found the remote experience to be far from ideal. We were frustrated that existing tools didn&#x27;t support real time cursor and shape movements, easy access to common symbols used in software engineering, and a dashboard for managing the interview experience. The world has found itself having to adapt to remote work because of COVID-19.<p>The effects on remote interviewing are watered down experiences conducted through google docs and google draw. These options are far from ideal, require less complex questions to be asked, and lower the overall integrity of the systems design interview. We weren&#x27;t the only ones who had this problem. Today we&#x27;re launching DesignPad beta to uphold the quality of systems design interviews across the industry. A painless and fair evaluation is deserved by both the company and interviewee.<p>Our goal is to provide you a fully functioning platform to conduct system design interviews remotely without compromising the integrity of the interview.<p>Here is a DEMO of our beta! <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;m.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?feature=emb_title&amp;v=V2EijbEVWmI" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;m.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?feature=emb_title&amp;v=V2EijbEVWmI</a><p>What can it do? Realtime collaboration (shapes, text, arrows, cursor locations) Suite of shapes commonly used in engineering design Fully functioning dashboard equipped with archived rooms, screenshots, and scheduling Mobile support, touch through phones and tablets are natural to whiteboarding, fully supported on DesignPad!<p>How can I get started? 1.
