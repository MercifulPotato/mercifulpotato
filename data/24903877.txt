Saint Joseph and Stevensville schools are extremely good (like at least private school in the bay area good). Beach life is great in the summer and the fresh water lakes are great if you are into sort of the fishing sort of outdoors. Houses are cheap with a huge amount of lawn (this can be viewed as a downside too).<p>That said, it is the midwest. You should like watching football and basketball. You should be ok hanging out with Republicans but it is only R leaning, not a crazy MAGA area.  There is not a ton of bars and restaurants and church is a major factor in a lot of people&#x27;s social lives.  (But kids soccer games, super bowl parties, etc. are too.)')
