A kid can explore the wilderness with her dog on a Saturday and not be expected until dinner. Crime is much less of a concern where there are far fewer people. The air is cleaner, the sky is darker, wildlife is all around. If she skins her knee or gets lost, she gets to deal with it herself rather than having an adult on tap. This breeds more independent people with hard earned self confidence. She can watch and help her parents do a bazillion things around the house that they&#x27;d dial up a contractor for in the city.<p>In my experience this is very common in cities too. It&#x27;s the suburbs that prevent it.  I don&#x27;t have kids yet, but in my (very urban) neighborhood it&#x27;s extremely common to have kids out and about on their own. It&#x27;s generally seen as being very safe.<p>When I talk to coworkers with kids in the suburbs they&#x27;re much more worried about letting their kids run around without adults. To be fair, it makes some sense: cars are one of the biggest killers of kids, and they&#x27;re a much bigger risk in the suburbs (where most streets are wide and fast) than the city.')
