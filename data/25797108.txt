Item(by='skrebbel', descendants=None, kids=[25800338], score=None, time=1610747957, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25795099, text='Dang, I&#x27;m.. a bit confused. The comment did not strike me as either flamebait nor nationalism (and I also didn&#x27;t see any replies, either here or on the original, that took this &quot;bait&quot; and made a flamewar).<p>I posted it in good faith because I found it a witty highlight of the misery that a reader must ignore to be able to consider a story like this a feel-good tearjerker.<p>Obviously the comment is a <i>commentary</i> on a specific aspect of American culture, and obviously it takes some poetic liberties (such as suggesting that American culture is a singular thing at all, or that this is only an American thing, or using swear words). But it&#x27;s not an <i>attack</i>. The way I read it, it neither idealizes nor rejects any country, and wouldn&#x27;t at least one of those be required for it to be nationalistic flamebait?<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, I have no beef with America and I strongly doubt the author has (I do not know them personally). HN is a US-dominated site run by an American organization. America exports a lot of a culture that I want a piece of (notably, SV&#x2F;startup culture, which HN is a fantastic conduit for). That&#x27;s what I&#x27;m here for.<p>Either way, I&#x27;ll refrain from reproducing this particular comment in the future. But we clearly have different frames of reference, and I might take some time to fully understand yours. I believed I was well in the clear wrt HN guidelines and norms with this one.')
