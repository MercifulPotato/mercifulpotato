It&#x27;s AWS here that&#x27;s basically &quot;stealing&quot; others work to resell it. But to the author Elastic should have reached out AWS and encouraged them to contribute back. The author didn&#x27;t even consider that AWS should have stepped up way earlier and offered to contribute&#x2F;pay back themselves.')
