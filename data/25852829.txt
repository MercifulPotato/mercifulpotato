I signed up for the beta and was thinking of planning a session with you for enrolment as you mentioned in your last email, hasn&#x27;t had time yet, sorry. Saw it here at the last HN post.<p>If it&#x27;s available now I&#x27;ll gladly use it. Since the Whatsapp thing a couple weeks ago even more of my contacts have spread out to different apps and it drives me nuts.<p>Pricing sounds good too, I know these bridges need work to maintain. I&#x27;ve tried to run them myself using the docker script but it&#x27;s not ideal. And supporting the maintenance is great.')
