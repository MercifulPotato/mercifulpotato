I did some digging and I _think_ this is where I first came across the idea of &quot;information density&quot; as a function of info&#x2F;syllables: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.researchgate.net&#x2F;publication&#x2F;235971274_A_cross-Language_Perspective_on_Speech_Information_Rate" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.researchgate.net&#x2F;publication&#x2F;235971274_A_cross-L...</a><p>The methods this paper employed may certainly be biased in a way that makes Japanese appear less information-dense than other languages.<p>As for the _written_ language&#x27;s density, that&#x27;s entirely different! You say that as written, translations come out to be about the same in Japanese and English, I assume this corresponds to roughly the same number of characters as well? If so, if we can believe the authors of the paper above that Japanese has less information-per-syllable, then perhaps Japanese writing&#x27;s syllabic&#x2F;ideographic writing system accounts for this handily such that the information density of _written_ Japanese is about the same as written English.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, I think you were agreeing with me actually:<p>&gt; Take a look at the front page of a Japanese newspaper and show it to an English speaker, they will think it&#x27;s &quot;crowded&quot;, but I bet if you translated it to English you&#x27;d see something that resembles a typical English paper.<p>What I meant here was that in terms of _written_ information density there are clearly significant gains made thanks to the writing system.')
