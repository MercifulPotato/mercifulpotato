When they confront Trump supporters, their mental model is that there are a few hundred people in that group who deserve &quot;consequences&quot; and that they personally are legitimate in effecting those consequences.  They frequently don&#x27;t leave the inner city and cannot really conceptualize tens of millions of people.')
