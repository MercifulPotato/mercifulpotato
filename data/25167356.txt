Crosstini &amp; Crouton do wonders to carve a good Linux environment out. Overall I&#x27;m for the most part fairly happy. It uses the Wayland display server now, which is fantastic. It&#x27;s a good product &amp; a pretty decent Linux.<p>But it&#x27;s still not &quot;the Linux Desktop&quot; in any way anyone from the past would have recognized, &amp; it stands apart from all the other Linux desktops, which stand together, even in their quite sizable differences. Some of the malleability &amp; libre-ness is missing. That&#x27;s ok! It&#x27;s still great. But still like a 10x  better version of WSL, &amp; not entirely like a Linux Desktop, as how Linux users would recognize.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.freedesktop.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Specifications&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.freedesktop.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Specifications&#x2F;</a>')
