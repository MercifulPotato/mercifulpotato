For the people who want an appliance-like computing experience, this type of curation is exactly what they signed up for. For people who want a tool-like computing experience, then managing their own security situation is part of what they&#x27;ve signed up for.<p>Neither side of this dichotomy is wrong (I know it&#x27;s technically a spectrum...). While you sound like someone who views their computer as a tool, plenty of people don&#x27;t. And I&#x27;m sure there are things in your life from which you expect an appliance-like experience as well, while other people may use tool-like versions of that same basic concept.')
