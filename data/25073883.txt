With that caveat out of the way, I will say that I absolutely love it after using React for about 5 years. Here is why:<p>1. It&#x27;s simple. The API can be read and fully understood in a day or two. The documentation is clear and their examples are simply wonderful. Seriously. Go through their tutorial (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;svelte.dev&#x2F;tutorial&#x2F;basics" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;svelte.dev&#x2F;tutorial&#x2F;basics</a>) or their examples (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;svelte.dev&#x2F;examples#hello-world" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;svelte.dev&#x2F;examples#hello-world</a>) or even their API docs (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;svelte.dev&#x2F;docs" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;svelte.dev&#x2F;docs</a>). It&#x27;s all well-crafted.<p>2. It has CSS modules built-in. You don&#x27;t need to install anything or configure anything. You insert a style tag, write some CSS, and your component gets style without stepping on global styles.<p>3. It has state built-in. It has a dead simple state protocol. You can even recreate a redux clone in about 20 lines (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;monad.fi&#x2F;en&#x2F;svelte-custom-stores&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;monad.fi&#x2F;en&#x2F;svelte-custom-stores&#x2F;</a>).<p>4. It&#x27;s compiled, which means it can do things other frameworks can&#x27;t. Which also means you get actual messages from the compiler telling you what you are doing wrong and what you should be doing. The messages I&#x27;ve seen so far from svelte are easily some of the best compiler messages I&#x27;ve ever seen.<p>5. Minimal edge cases. There are a few edge cases (e.g. arrays and reactivity), but it&#x27;s fairly easy to know when you&#x27;re hitting one.<p>6. Way more flexible than React. Event forwarding, event modifiers, boolean class names (i.e. class:large adds the &quot;large&quot; class if &quot;large&quot; is bool and true), ability to create generic actions that can be added to any DOM nodes. Animation support built-in. Variable binding, makes it a breeze to create any form.<p>Sapper is going away, but SvelteKit is being worked on. If you really need more than Rollup+Svelte.')
