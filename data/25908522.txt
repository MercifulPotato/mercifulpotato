My normal cardio is a standard treadmill at the gym, and I bought the C2 because a serious treadmill wouldn’t work at that location.<p>It has been really hard to get into the rowing thing.  I’ve never done crew so there’s no external context for me.  I find it’s a great way to get the heart rate up in a short time, but totally lacks the zone-out meditative quality of the treadmill.<p>If there were a rowing machine that had some built in motivator that would make me go use it every day for more than a few minutes at a time, and it shipped worldwide, I’d seriously consider it for my next country place.<p>My motivation problems notwithstanding, I will say I think the Concept 2 is a great machine and absolutely feels like it’s worth the price.  The fact I’d find the same machine in lots of gyms would be a plus if I could get over the hump.  So fitness-center ubiquity should also be a goal I think.')
