It is a fully feature functional build system where reproducible builds are guaranteed (This is unique with GUIX up to my knowledge) on any linux distribution. Safe-reliable distributed builds are also possible.<p>- Fine grain de-duplication of dependencies (libraries, frameworks) to save disk space<p>- Safe, unprivileged installation of binaries in a multi-user environment on a single machine.<p>- Atomic upgrade and rollback<p>- Allow multiple variations of the same package with different options &amp; versions installed in parallel without any risk of conflict<p>- Solves definitively all ABI breaks problem you encounter on traditional package manager, even with shared library.')
