Mainly, there ought to be a lot more textual content.<p>For example, rather than just a screenshot of the options menu for a given game, there should be tables listing all of the options and their possible settings. Rather than just an in-game screenshot, each UI element should be called out and detailed. For example, point out a health meter and explain what happens when the meter is filled, when it&#x27;s low, etc. Same with the menus. What are the elements and what do they do? And so on.<p>There are also links to general gameplay footage for any given game, but various UI elements should have their timestamps called out, or even get their own videos entirely.<p>I really like how easy it is to navigate the site. Everything is tagged well. There&#x27;s a lot of potential here.')
