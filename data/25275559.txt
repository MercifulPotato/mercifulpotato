I can even see how it might be done semi-accidentally by a bad engineering team.<p>An even bigger risk is corporate-owned mesh networks, like Amazon Sidewalk. It&#x27;s quite possible that TVs with Alexa support will end up also having access to this network, and will use your neighbour&#x27;s Echo to ship data back even without you knowing. Or even a built-in LTE&#x2F;5G transceiver.<p>Without strong regulation of privacy and consent, this will be a persistent and dangerous issue.')
