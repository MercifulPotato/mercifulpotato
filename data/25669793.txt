Item(by='hashhar', descendants=None, kids=[25670314, 25671011, 25670119], score=None, time=1610018578, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25669542, text='4K at anything below 43 inch is unusable for text without scaling.<p>27 inch 2K or 43 inch 4K are the sweet spots.<p>Here&#x27;s how you can check if your monitor needs scaling:<p>- Find out the DPI of your existing monitor and your desired monitor. For example, 24&quot; 1080p is 91.79, and 27&quot; 4K is 163.18<p>- Calculate the ratio: 91.79&#x2F;163.18 = 0.5625 (this means that on the 27&quot; 4K monitor everything is 56% of the size of the 1080p)<p>- Now take a screenshot of your monitor (at 100% scaling) and resize it to 1920x1080*0.5625 = 1080x607. View the resized image at 100%. That text will be the same physical size as on a 4K 27&quot; monitor set to 100%.<p>Without scaling, most people would find text too small on both 27&quot; at 32&quot;. You would need a display as big as 40&quot; to get the same density as 1440p on 27&quot; (~110 DPI). For most people, 27&quot; requires 150% scaling and 32&quot; requires 125%.')
