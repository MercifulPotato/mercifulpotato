They also have a <i>lot</i> of toolboxes and maths related functions that would really take a long time to find&#x2F;implement in Python.<p>MATLAB had another significant advantage over Python. Its plotting support is really really really good. Given how much time scientists spend making graphs it&#x27;s hard to understate how important that is, or how much better MATLAB is at plotting than Python or Octave (or Julia).')
