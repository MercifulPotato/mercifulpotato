I was thinking in terms of a continuous or largely continuous journey (such as walking to the shops and back) being 2 miles.<p>That said longer journeys can be treated as exercise. Why go to gym for an hour each day when instead you can spend that hour going to places you&#x27;re going to go anyway.')
