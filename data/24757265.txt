Driving any distance to drop off a ballot is more expensive than mailing it from home. It’s more likely that these people have consumed a lot of exaggerated news stories about the mail system and therefore think that dropping it off is safer. Meanwhile, we’re all getting the rest of our mail on time without exceptional delays.')
