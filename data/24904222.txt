It was the tiny sticking plaster the nurse applied after the injection to cover the site. That was the first time since leaving the clinic I&#x27;d even remembered I got a jab that day. I peeled it off, put it in the waste and went to bed.<p>A lot of the things that happen are psychosomatic, so those would happen even if it was saline (or, I suppose they might <i>not</i> happen if you believe it was just saline even if it was really the active vaccine) but there are effects above this baseline in some people some of the time.')
