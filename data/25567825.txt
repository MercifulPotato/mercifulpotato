So it&#x27;s more likely that big media will use it to more cheaply go after small infringers who won&#x27;t be able to afford defending themselves in federal court. But if you&#x27;re a small artist, and try to go after a big company, they&#x27;ll just reject the process and go to federal court, which the accuser can&#x27;t afford and we&#x27;re back at square one.<p>Anyhow, I hope I&#x27;m misreading this, or there&#x27;s missing details here, cause if not, this seems like a step in the wrong direction.')
