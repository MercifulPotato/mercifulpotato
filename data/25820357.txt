Lots of possible finite but unbounded shapes - i.e. a torus shaped universe would have no observable edge, and also wouldn&#x27;t be obviously wrapping around (you are at no risk of seeing light from yourself headed back at you from the other direction).<p>You can then twist those geometries up into all sorts of knots and strange shapes to get all manner of universes where there is no edge, but light paths don&#x27;t obviously loop back around.')
