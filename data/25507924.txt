If you had 10 trillion dollars and wanted to increase the chances of humans becoming extinct, what would you spend it on, seriously? Who gives a fuck if we&#x27;re breathing in toxic fumes all day or the planet is so hot we can barely walk outside?<p>Oh, I get it. Right, because there is one type of pollution and climate change due to massive amounts of CO2 <i>waste</i>, we shouldn&#x27;t focus on plastic <i>waste</i>.<p>The planet is choking our on waste products because people keep arguing about what our top priority should be. Uh, how about addressing <i>all</i> of these massive problems we created? But we won&#x27;t. Because replace &quot;microplastics&quot; with another topic and grab another internet troll off the shelf to argue we definitely <i>don&#x27;t</i> need to worry about that one; rinse and repeat until we are completely paralyzed, incapable of any action whatsoever.
