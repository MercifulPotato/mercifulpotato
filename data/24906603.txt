So what? A sane language already includes those constructs, and they&#x27;re known and understood by all users of the language without having to first read the documentation of some third-party lib (haha, just kidding, there is none â€“ read the code, dummy!).<p>I do not believe that novel control statements are any different from novel functionality.  A sane language already includes plenty of standard functions, but that doesn&#x27;t relieve the need for more.  New functions, like new control statements, may be poorly documented.<p>The fundamental power of computing is abstraction.  Functions, macros and control structures are all different types of abstraction.  The only way to build a successful, malleable large program is to abstract, and to avoid macros and new control structures is simply to require larger teams (because someone has to hand-write all the code which the computer could be writing for you) and more ad hoc approaches.')
