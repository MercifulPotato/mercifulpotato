So if you&#x27;ve ever &quot;payed manually&quot; with a check, even if you&#x27;ve never set up automatic rent payments, your landlord could still do the same thing if they wanted to.<p>I find it infuriating that no financial regulators or banks have ever bothered to address this. Mailing a check is basically equivalent to sending your login information over plain http to a site that doesn&#x27;t even hash passwords in their database. And the stakes are even higher than they are just about any online account you might have. But we&#x27;re basically forced to do it all the time.')
