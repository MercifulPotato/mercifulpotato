And thats it. You have no way of knowing if you are wrong or not until a filing shows up in court later and even then it is just part of an allegation.<p>Tether has a $17bn marketcap because about $17bn dollars were deposited into the Tether printer and are still there and that was true most of the time despite many people not wanting to believe it during the times that it was 100% true until ironically ceasing to be 100% true.')
