In color images standard Floyd-Steinberg tends to add noise and make whole images look fuzzy. Remapping error from high-error areas is diffused to low-error areas, which makes otherwise good areas look noisier. This is why graphics programs make dithering optional, because it is a trade-off: you either have posterization, but a cleaner look, or fuzzier images due to error diffusion.<p>In pngquant I have adaptive diffusion that is enabled only in areas of the image that really need it, so you still get dithered gradients, but don&#x27;t get as much noise added to the image overall, which makes it look cleaner and compress better.')
