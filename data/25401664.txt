Item(by='zemo', descendants=None, kids=[25403617], score=None, time=1607806789, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25400465, text='one of the surest signs that someone is full of it is that they have a long history of essays with no citations. PG&#x27;s essays almost never cite anyone else&#x27;s work or act as continuations onto a line of thinking started by another person. PG wants to discredit the entire concept of academia because he knows that his work does not actually stand up to scrutiny.<p>hehe, curious (perhaps deliberate?) examples. This is maybe all very plainly obvious to you, but: Foucault&#x27;s description of the panopticon, his description of discipline, and especially the continuation of this line of thinking by Deleuze&#x27;s notion of _societies of control_ is extremely relevant for people who visit HN. How these topics relate to the work that most of the HN community does is explored very fully in Alexander Galloway&#x27;s book &quot;Protocol: How Control Exists After Decentralization&quot; (here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mitpress.mit.edu&#x2F;books&#x2F;protocol" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mitpress.mit.edu&#x2F;books&#x2F;protocol</a>). Also I find it especially hilarious that the first &quot;BS&quot; word that he uses is hermeneutics; it&#x27;s almost as if he&#x27;s saying &quot;you only have my permission to take my work at face value&quot;.')
