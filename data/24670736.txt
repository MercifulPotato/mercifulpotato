The point is that there are two usable battery duration points: needs charge once a day, and doesn’t need charge for a long time (GP says one week, I believe it would be longer). If there are Android Wear watches that have batteries that last a week or more with comparable usage, then maybe you have a point; otherwise, it doesn’t make a difference.')
