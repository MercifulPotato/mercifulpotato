At the same time, if this becomes the default search engine on iOS it will force websites to comply with Apple&#x27;s demands unless they&#x27;re happy to lose out on a large chunk of potential customers with money to spend (as they&#x27;ve already demonstrated by buying an iOS device instead of Android).')
