But there are two things that you want to be true then “onboard graphics are a requirement” and “it needs to do dual screens at 4k60”<p>I still don’t hear an argument here for having it all in one package. There are APUs in the Ryzen series, they perform worse, but everything is a trade off, you can’t have your cake and eat it.<p>You can get new and adequate GPUs for less than 100eur which will do what you want and “won’t sit idle” because they’re taxed. This GPU would struggle with even 1 screen. I think you underestimate the load a desktop has on a GPU, 2D rendering isn’t “free” and can take a lot of CPU die space and add to the heat&#x2F;power delivery issues of a modern cpu.')
