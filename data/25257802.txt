Houses are far too expensive to even dream about, and uncertainty in continued employment incentivizes me to just save all the money I can while living as cheaply as humanly possible.<p>It&#x27;s not the best life, but at least I have some cash to fall back on when my at-will employment is terminated for no cause and I can&#x27;t find a job for a couple years. Or maybe my carpal tunnel syndrome will drive me out of the (extremely competitive) job market.<p>Either way, I&#x27;m not going to spend more money than I need to so I can have at least some semblance of &quot;stability&quot;. And I sure as hell am not raising another generation of wage slaves. This terrible way of life ends with me.')
