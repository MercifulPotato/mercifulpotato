They buy up office space in every major city, and then, rather than permanently stationing any teams there, essentially make all such spaces into private-access coworking spaces.<p>In these IBM offices, there’s cubicles, hot desks, and meeting rooms, all set up with runs of Intranet-accessible Ethernet + wi-fi + softphones; and you can either just drop in to work, or freely reserve any amount of these from the office’s concierge for days&#x2F;weeks&#x2F;months at a time — for yourself, or for your entire team, if you’ve brought your whole team with you to another city&#x2F;country to do a high-touch customer deployment or something.<p>At least in the office I went to (Burnaby BC), it was almost entirely empty most of the time. So there was plenty of spare “capacity” in this network for any random need a team or individual might have.<p>It’s a very nice model. Slap an API on it and you could call it “elastic office-space IaaS.” :)')
