When I type, I&#x27;m frequently pausing, going to other parts of the document, and deleting things I&#x27;ve already written. All of these actions I find more annoying when dictating. Not to mention some of the baffling Random capitalization Choices and, over&#x2F;under insertion of punctuation.<p>In general, I find dictation useful on my phone to take notes to myself. And maybe to send a message in a chat situation. But it just doesn&#x27;t work for me for anything slightly more formal &#x2F; long.')
