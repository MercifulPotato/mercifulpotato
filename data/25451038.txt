Don&#x27;t expect any sympathy from me afterwards, however, when you&#x27;re whining about how bad your head hurts.<p>What you describe is a problem the organization has created for themselves.

Stupid hurts.<p>As long as they&#x27;re only shooting themselves with the nailgun and no one else, I&#x27;m fine with &#x27;em doing it.
