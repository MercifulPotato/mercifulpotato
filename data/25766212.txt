However, I did buy some C# books which I never looked at.  Given that the books are now about a decade old, is there any point in keeping them?  Has C# changed enough in the years that the language is sufficiently different from what was created in the book that I might as well pick up a newer volume?<p>I tend to gravitate toward stability in languages.  Something of a flaw of mine.')
