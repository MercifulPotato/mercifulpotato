Item(by='AnimalMuppet', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606282621, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25206201, text='&gt; The disappearance of this &quot;surplus&quot; (and if you follow history, you know where such surplus typically went â€“ not the common people) was a blessing for all but the palatial elite.<p>Really?  You have the peasants producing a surplus that goes to fund the palace elite <i>and the military</i>.  Then the surplus disappears.  And what happens next?  The peasants plus the military kill all the palace elite, and live happily ever after?  Or the military takes everything that&#x27;s not nailed down from the peasants, and the peasants starve?  I&#x27;d say human nature (of the military) favors the second, and that sure isn&#x27;t &quot;a blessing for all but the palatial elite&quot;.<p>&gt; You underestimate human intelligence if you believe &quot;the Sea Peoples came and made a boo boo and everyone had no choice but to go dark for 400 years&quot;.<p>Yeah... um... I&#x27;d like to see your actual archaeological evidence for your claim here.  All you&#x27;ve said so far is wishful thinking.')
