I&#x27;m still using a 2012 rMBP, which was the first-gen retina version, and it&#x27;s held up much better than any other computer I&#x27;ve ever bought, partly due to OS support into 2020. I imagine Apple will stand behind this new generation for a long time as well.<p>The new M1 SOCs max out at 16GB RAM, which seems like a major limitation, but the timing and latency of this integrated RAM is probably much better than what you could otherwise achieve. Meanwhile, improved SSD performance will probably have a larger impact on the whole system. I remember when I bought a 15k RPM hard drive ca. 2005 - it was like a new computer. Upgrading the slowest part of the storage hierarchy made the largest difference.<p>One slight disappointment in the Mac mini is the removal of two USB C &#x2F; Thunderbolt ports and no option for 10G ethernet vs. the Intel model. An odd set of limitations in 2020.<p>Overall, at the price they&#x27;re offering the Mac mini (haven&#x27;t really considered the other models for myself), I think it&#x27;s ok to take the plunge.<p>- Sent from my Dell hackintosh')
