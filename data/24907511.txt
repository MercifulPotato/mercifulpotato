Item(by='ocdtrekkie', descendants=None, kids=[24907699], score=None, time=1603807454, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24907368, text='&gt; We don&#x27;t need an anti trust breakup of big tech.<p>This is a really bad take. The amount of Google&#x27;s power and control isn&#x27;t something a handful of HN users switching to Firefox can fix. Most people literally don&#x27;t realize there&#x27;s alternatives. There&#x27;s a silent majority feeding the Google beast, and they aren&#x27;t going to switch from the defaults. Tech industry members can set the tone, we can spread good behavior to our friends and family, but the government is needed to move the majority.<p>Bear in mind, everyone hates Microsoft (seems like sometimes anyways), they <i>did</i> face antitrust law, and still in 2020, they&#x27;re one of the world&#x27;s most powerful and valuable companies, and everyone still uses Windows at work. Which is to say, if we want to take Google down, it needs to come from every direction, and it needs to be incredibly harsh. And once Google is no longer running the web, stronger privacy and consumer protection laws need to be passed to make sure it&#x27;s understood that behavior like Google&#x27;s will never be tolerated again.')
