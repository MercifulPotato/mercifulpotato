I wish the whole debugging environment was even simpler though.<p>Binaries. Debug Symbols. Source Code.<p>I wish those three things could be trivially merged and split. For internal builds I want to deploy a single binary that contains symbols and source code. This way issues can be trivially debugged by anyone on any machine. For public builds I wish to split out symbols and source which can be hosted on a symbol server.')
