You&#x27;re not being paid to show up to work to virtue signal about the most fashionable wedge issue of the day. You&#x27;re not being paid to show up to work and sow discord by assuming moral high ground and vilifying the other side. etc., etc.<p>I do not see anyone in this thread advocating for anything that extreme.<p>&gt;&gt;In order to have an informed populace then need to be exposed to things, sometime controversial.<p>&gt; The political culture status quo at Bay Area companies is that this is an alt-right talking point.<p>I am not in the know about bay area culture but that does not match my limited view from the outside.<p>&gt; Conversation at work absolutely should not be a large mechanism for political discussion. It&#x27;s work. If there are political consequences because workers are no longer allow to virtue signal all day, then that speaks more about their weak mental state than it does about politics.<p>My focus on for this comment was not politic conversation in the work place but on how removing a large mechanism of knowledge and understanding transferal in the work place would have political consequences for society.')
