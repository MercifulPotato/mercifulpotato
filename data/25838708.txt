I&#x27;d also add some sort of exercise. It doesn&#x27;t have to be intense, and sometimes it&#x27;s not even about the physical benefits. Just the ritual and the focus on something other than work or current events and the various chemical things that happen with exercise might yield more mental benefits than physical. Getting outside makes it even better, if your circumstances allow that. It&#x27;s like getting good sleep (another important thing BTW). The difference won&#x27;t be immediate or dramatic, but over sufficient time you&#x27;ll feel just a bit better.')
