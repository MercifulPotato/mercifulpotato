But in implementation it&#x27;s much easier to detect the shape of the upcoming terrain using, say, lidar or regular old multi-camera disparity. Flat and following your map: that&#x27;s driveable. I&#x27;m guessing many take this approach, but it&#x27;s seeming more likely that Tesla does not, and instead trusts monocular or arrayed cameras to track objects though frames from detection-first regimes. Seems dangerous.<p>I&#x27;m glad you were interested.')
