Item(by='neilv', descendants=None, kids=[25081296], score=None, time=1605244312, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25076767, text='We should all have the problem of fearing that we&#x27;ve been coasting on our ridiculous good looks. :)  But seriously, as I think you meant your comments...<p>Videoconferencing seems to encumber both communication and charisma in some ways -- big and small, apparent and subtle.<p>For example, it seems like even slight latency or difficulty hearing people can make a very smooth interaction seem non-smooth.<p>And (as was exceedingly painful to me in a recent team meeting), none of the tools currently available would&#x27;ve come close to having a real-world whiteboard.  There have been CSCW research efforts at this for a few decades, but, in practice, at the moment, it&#x27;s usually just a dumb camera&amp;mic, and sometimes screen-sharing.<p>Maybe, in getting an impression of a person, people haven&#x27;t yet re-calibrated expectations for the videoconferencing media we&#x27;re currently stuck with?<p>And maybe there&#x27;s still some charisma projection adjustments that individual people can try tweaking, if they want, such with lighting, eye contact, lens distortion, etc.?  (As someone who once dabbled in studio portraiture, I&#x27;m aware of some ways I could look better on videoconf, but it&#x27;s been a relatively low priority, compared to countless other aspects of startup tech work.)')
