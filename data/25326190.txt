Now of course that amount won&#x27;t be paid (because he just graduated grad school with an art history degree) but there&#x27;s really no point in him saving any money if a debt collector can seize it at a moment&#x27;s notice.<p>I had a friend in high school who got cancer and had insurance.  At the 10th anniversary of his death his parents mentioned they were still paying off medicals debts accrued from that. They mentioned half of this was for experimental treatments that they knew were going to be  paid out of pocket for.  But half was due to  standard cancer care that insurance was arguing it shouldn&#x27;t pay for some reason.  Like the hospital using an out of network doctor without telling them type of stuff.<p>Similar things have happened to myself and my wife, where after  paying for care we receive a secondary bill 10 times higher than the first for out of network items we unknowingly consumed.')
