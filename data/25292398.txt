But I can&#x27;t currently find a cite for that on google, so maybe I was wrong!<p>It certainly makes sense to me that if you have to smuggle it, you&#x27;re not going to be smuggling beer cause the risk&#x2F;reward is so much better smuggling liquor. But sometimes &#x27;common sense&#x27; is not a good guide...')
