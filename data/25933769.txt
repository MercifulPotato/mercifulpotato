I&#x27;m deeply qwerty habituated and finding low enough actuation force switches to be comfortable depressing several has been a challenge^, so I struggle with them a bit, but they&#x27;re _enticing_.  \nI&#x27;ve been trying to come up with a good way to build one that I can reasonably comfortably and intrusively use against my leg (fabric with capacitve pads?) or as a keyglove or something - I like to pace around while I compose text or work out code, and want to try entry while I pace. I&#x27;d look like a madman, but that&#x27;s acceptable.<p>I&#x27;m yet to see an HMD that I&#x27;d be willing to do extended text manipulation on.  I occasionally consider the Microwriter model where you only have a line or so of display on your chorder, but I&#x27;m not sold enough on it to go through the hassle of building one of those little mini-OLED driven monocles.<p>^ BATs used Cherry MX Blacks with unobtainable custom springs.  Sub-miniature microswitches throw click is super obnoxious. Etc.')
