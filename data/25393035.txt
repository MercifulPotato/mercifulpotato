Other than the small (OK, small-ish, given Virgin Orbit) startups, most aerospace companies are leaving CA or not bothering to incorporate there.<p>So much modern aerospace technology historically comes from SoCal, and yet CA as a state doesn&#x27;t seem to care about hanging on to world-changing industries like it.<p>Your example about Aerojet Rocketdyne is telling.  They are contracting - I believe the Aerojet facilities in Sacramento are being divested if that&#x27;s not already done.  Boeing is divesting most of its Huntington Beach campus, and Rockwell in Downey is long-gone.  A lot of Space Shuttle Main Engine&#x2F;RS-25 work is done at their Stennis facilities or in Huntsville.<p>Aerospace in CA is not healthy.')
