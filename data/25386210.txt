I remember Tom Scott complaining about it on Twitter.<p>While the browser probably shouldn&#x27;t ask users if they want to donate to people that haven&#x27;t joined Brave Rewards, the money is returned to the sender (up to 3 months later, I believe) if the creator doesn&#x27;t join Brave Rewards. It&#x27;s not like they stole donations.<p>&gt; they have secretely added affiliate links<p>They did that with some crypto sites when typing the keyword&#x2F;URL in the search bar. I can&#x27;t defend the decision, but the code is on Github[0] and they admitted doing it as soon people pointed it out. And then reverted the change.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what to think about this monetisation strategy. What&#x27;s the downside for users? Is it worse than generating revenues by selling the default search engine to the highest bidder? And why is it wrong for browsers to do it but it&#x27;s fine when some search engines do it?<p>---<p>0. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;brave&#x2F;brave-core&#x2F;blob&#x2F;1cac2377c9a2d5e35873d4d3d74130336b86d062&#x2F;components&#x2F;omnibox&#x2F;browser&#x2F;suggested_sites_provider_data.cc" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;brave&#x2F;brave-core&#x2F;blob&#x2F;1cac2377c9a2d5e3587...</a>')
