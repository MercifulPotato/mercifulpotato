The difference is now we can easily find them and we also see just how government at all levels fails them. It isn&#x27;t because we have billionaires it is because politician serve themselves first and only bring up the poor when they need more in their own coffers which magically still never fixes the issue with the poor.<p>Look at it from this standpoint, what nations around this planet have unraveled? Even Venezuela somehow fell off the RADAR of many but that may because their social experiment showed the folly of too much government intervention. It also showed the world that the one percent of any country is truly their politicians.')
