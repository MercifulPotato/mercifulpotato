Because current welfare society over values looks. Undervalues other aspects of humans.<p>This is unethical, and will bite your decedents back in the ass even if it doesn&#x27;t bite you. You think your so good looking? Imagine if your grand son was in that place where he wasn&#x27;t that good looking. Would you want him to end up like that? Is that really fair to him.<p>Aren&#x27;t we supposed to make the world a better place? When we realize that some things are wrong?<p>You&#x27;re doing every man who does hard work injustice. You can defer the problem by importing women from 3rd world countries, but for how long?<p>Not only is it unethical, but immoral.<p>Remember, no matter how privileged you are, there is no guarantee that your decedents will have the privilege&#x27;. Even if you&#x27;re the most selfish man&#x2F;woman, it&#x27;s in your interest to advocate for it.<p>There&#x27;s no woman&#x2F;man who is a better human except for their character. We need to put incentives for these traits in humans. Not discourage them.')
