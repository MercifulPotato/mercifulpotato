I agree they’re unfortunate, but they’re hardly a show-stopper.<p>The real risks Apple faces, as far as I can see:<p>* Will developers do the needful for universal apps? That seems to be well underway, even among the giants.<p>* Will a lack of x86-64 Windows emulation prove to be a deal-breaker for too many users? I’d say that’s impossible to know, but I’m optimistic. (And if Apple once again is setting a trend for the industry, Windows itself may fully make this transition someday.)<p>* Will Apple be able to keep up with AMD and Intel in the chip race? Obviously early signs are promising.<p>Big risks, but mostly ones Apple can control, or at least influence. What other dangers am I missing?<p>Adding: the dependence on TSMC is obviously a risk, but I imagine Apple has some notion of what they can do if they lose that option.')
