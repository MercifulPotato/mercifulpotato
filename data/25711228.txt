Keeping Milo on and suggesting center-left content to his viewers would have been a better long-term solution, along with suggesting center-right content to viewers of extreme left content.  (Edit: actually, come to think of it, you&#x27;d want a mixture of center-right and center-left content suggested to both extremes, to make the medicine taste a bit less bitter.)<p>Deplatforming may be necessary for immediate threats, but it&#x27;s not a good long-term solution to the problem of polarization.  Long-term, deplatforming feeds the conspiracy theories and pushes viewers further from the reach of mainstream platforms.')
