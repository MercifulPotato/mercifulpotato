My experiences are of course anecdotal, but I think worth considering.<p>Tinder&#x27;s focus on photos is somewhat misleading. A picture is, famously, worth a thousand words. If you treat Tinder as a simple HotOrNot game, you will have problems. But a photo contains a lot of information about a person: what their interests are, what&#x27;s important to them, even whether they&#x27;re conscientious enough to seek out a good picture. When you put up a picture of yourself at your hobby, or traveling, or in front of your bookshelf, you say a lot.<p>My heuristic was this: I examined each photo that caught my eye with a thought about something I could say to them. &quot;Hey, I also visited City X!&quot; &quot;What a great fish tank. What do you raise?&quot; Even &quot;That dress is amazing&quot; is a truthful statement about something that makes me interested in them. If I didn&#x27;t have anything to say to them based on their photo -- maybe they&#x27;d be interesting In Real Life anyway, but at the very least I know that they&#x27;re not very good at thinking about how they present themselves.<p>I do wish Tinder had better support for what text it does have. I&#x27;m a person of words, and would like to know that they have at least something to say. It&#x27;s not presented by default and I don&#x27;t think they push people hard enough to fill something out.<p>Still... I started several multi-year relationships on Tinder (and Bumble). Humor and kindness are still found there; they start in the chat and quickly move into the real world. (Being a person of words I really liked long involved chats before we met, but apparently a lot of women have experienced being strung along, and there&#x27;s a push to meet up earlier rather than later. That tends to favor cities, where a lot of people are close by. The worst you lose is the time for a short coffee date.)<p>There are certainly plenty of difficulties, but I don&#x27;t think the photo focus is as bad as you&#x27;d expect. I found it no more unnatural than other ways of meeting people, which are also often very visual since that&#x27;s your first impression.')
