Much of the footage used in the film is borderline unwatchable without the post-processing used: hand-crank cameras meant wildly variable framerate, volatile &amp; unstable early film stock on the frontlines of a war exposed to smoke, dust, heat, cold and gas attacks, over&#x2F;under-exposed footage caught in the heat of the moment, the list goes on. What I&#x27;m saying is, you&#x27;d probably complain a lot more if you saw the original footage, or you&#x27;d skip most of it as unwatchable in its original form.<p>Finally, there&#x27;s an education factor at play. Young people deserve the best possible chance they can get to engage with their history, especially when it offers such a tremendously impactful lesson. And like it or not, I think 90% of people are going to be more engaged, not less, by well-curated, well-produced and respectful recreations of the past.
