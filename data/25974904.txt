The guy who started MyLife however, Jeffrey Tinsley, is a multi-millionaire who has successfully gotten venture capital funding-- and causes grief on an internet-scale.<p>I wish there would be more media take-downs of MyLife, Classmates, Radaris, other scummy operations. Even better, I would expect that GDPR rules put in place for the USA would put these people out of business?')
