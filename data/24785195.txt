Doses significantly larger than that <i>will not work</i> for most people. The effective dosing window for melatonin is narrow, so more is not better.<p>It doesn&#x27;t help that most melatonin available OTC in the US is in doses of 3mg to 10mg. This stuff is not useful. You need the 300 microgram pills, the 1 milligram pills, the liquid, or as a last resort the 3mg pills with a splitter.')
