It&#x27;s light, keyboard feels good, battery life is great. Echo the desire expressed in other comments here of wanting nicer &#x2F; higher res screens. But having been on Arch+xmonad&#x2F;dmenu&#x2F;i3 etc. before for a while then main-ing mac since then, PopOS on this laptop feels like a good convenience combo (Bluetooth setup etc. works easily) with something like Regolith. The hardware being actually supported the way System76 does it is comforting, esp. with the open source firmware code (I don&#x27;t ever do anything with that but it&#x27;s just comforting in some way I guess).')
