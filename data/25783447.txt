Item(by='__blockcipher__', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610662331, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25782992, text='&gt; If we can get the same benefits while also protecting open products from megacorps like AWS, that&#x27;s a better licence than a true open source licence<p>That&#x27;s your opinion, of course. IMO, there&#x27;s a type of magic that happens when software is under a truly non-restrictive license. You get a level of quality and reliability in the software that is unmatched by what you get with any proprietary equivalent.<p>Unfortunately, most people don&#x27;t really believe in FOSS. And that&#x27;s okay. But boy am I getting frustrated with these companies that are happy to preach about how &quot;open source&quot; is amazing, until someone else is making some profit with their software and then suddenly the (extremely vague) restrictive licenses start rolling out.')
