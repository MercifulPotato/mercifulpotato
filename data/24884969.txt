The only reason why you don&#x27;t have this in e.g. python is that iterators are often implemented as generators, so the &quot;own type of iterator&quot; is implicit. But I remember pretty much the same thing from my Java days, if you need to iterate you have to create an iterator type. It&#x27;s a bit less visible due to type erasure but it&#x27;s there nonetheless.')
