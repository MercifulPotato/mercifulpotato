It was his publisher who released it in stages. Interestingly he had a hard time convincing someone to print it at all:<p>&gt; A dispute with his publisher, George Allen &amp; Unwin, led to his offering the work to William Collins in 1950. Tolkien intended The Silmarillion (itself largely unrevised at this point) to be published along with The Lord of the Rings, but Allen &amp; Unwin were unwilling to do this. After Milton Waldman, his contact at Collins, expressed the belief that The Lord of the Rings itself &quot;urgently wanted cutting&quot;, Tolkien eventually demanded that they publish the book in 1952. Collins did not; and so Tolkien wrote to Allen and Unwin, saying, &quot;I would gladly consider the publication of any part of the stuff&quot;, fearing his work would never see the light of day.<p>- <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;The_Lord_of_the_Rings#Reception" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;The_Lord_of_the_Rings#Receptio...</a>')
