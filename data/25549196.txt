Honestly, I had no idea that the profession of actuary even <i>existed</i>, but I would have likely been rather good at it, having built my own primitive statistical laws as a kid playing with dice and taking grad-level courses in stats as an undergraduate.  And gracious did I ask the guidance counselors what was out there.<p>I entered college as a Nuke E, then rather quickly realized that (at the time), there wasn&#x27;t much of a career in it if you didn&#x27;t want to work in a submarine.  A guidance counselor could have clued me in to that kind of thing.  I switched to physics, as it would be more general, only to, after observing the actual lives lived by the faculty and the PhD students, that the competition was quite fierce for such meager stakes.  Noticing that my brilliant professors might have second jobs or rustbuckets to get to work, noting that a few of them were looking a bit threadbare, it was quite a shock.<p>Guidance counselors ought to have a lot of this information on tap.  Perhaps they do now, but at the time, it wasn&#x27;t available at my high school.<p>Perhaps we are drawn to this topic if only for the younger generations.')
