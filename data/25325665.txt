If one person makes $100k and 99 others make $1, insane super tax them down to $100 (include tricky stuff like bonuses or whatever)<p>Germany doesn&#x27;t do this and neither should the US.<p>&gt; Heavily tax nationally high salaries with a progressive income tax.<p>The US already does this, as the US does not have a flat tax rate for income tax.<p>&gt; Heavily punish tax dodging<p>Addressing symptoms not causes.
