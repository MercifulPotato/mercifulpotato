The situation for millennials and younger is even worse, as most of them have been frozen out of the housing market in regions where there are good jobs.<p>We all have cell phones now, but are we really better off if we (collectively) have so little time outside of work that we (collectively) don&#x27;t get to see our kids grow up anymore, or if we can&#x27;t afford houses anymore?<p>The other, other, thing to look at is that household wages have stagnated since the 1980s in comparison to GDP (see eg: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fred.stlouisfed.org&#x2F;graph&#x2F;?g=bOfK" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fred.stlouisfed.org&#x2F;graph&#x2F;?g=bOfK</a>) while unavoidable costs (e.g. housing, education, healthcare, communications) have exploded. There are lots more fancy toys available now than in the 1980s, but the median person has a smaller percentage of discretionary income to spend on them. I&#x27;m not convinced that taking away choice is a net positive.')
