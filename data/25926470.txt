Clearly some of that speech will be destructive, and harm people. I don&#x27;t think you want to advocate that those people who are being harmed should be unable to protect themselves from speech they see as harmful and destructive.<p>Neither side of this coin is a straight answer; you can easily poke holes in either by imagining the terrible consequences of the alternative. The answer IMO is people, groups, societies, should decide what&#x27;s constructive and destructive and converge on a balance that works for them.')
