(Not just talking about all the lying that is inherent in advertising, print ads suffer from that too)<p>They never were, they&#x27;re not like inert pieces of your magazine. They&#x27;re little pieces of software doing whatever the fuck it likes, control that you offer to semi-anonymous parties over <i>your</i> readers.<p>Imagine if a print newspaper didn&#x27;t just sell ad space in their print, but whoever buys the ad also determines what ink it is printed with. And the ink can be any substance! Sometimes it&#x27;s ink, sometimes it&#x27;s poop, sometimes it&#x27;s smallpox, sometimes it&#x27;s radioactive.<p>I mean, MOST of the time it&#x27;s really just ink, with only a tiny amount of aerosolized heroin, just your average respectable ads. But every once in a while, and there is really nothing to do but hope it happens to the other paper first, it&#x27;ll really harm the reader.<p>I mean you can&#x27;t really expect a news magazine to check all the ink its printed with right, just doesn&#x27;t scale.')
