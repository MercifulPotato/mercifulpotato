It means it&#x27;s impossible to use a computer to grade them. If you, as the student, are willing to ignore whether you get marked &quot;right&quot; or &quot;wrong&quot;, you get the full value of the instruction -- you make the attempt, Duolingo tells you what the sentence meant, and even though Duolingo can&#x27;t tell whether your sentence meant the same thing, you can.')
