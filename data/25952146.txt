Hurt people often pass on the pain to the newer members of any team (including families).<p>I did get the general vibe that this is some kind of a rite of passage -- the unsaid message of &quot;figure it all out by yourself or you&#x27;re not worthy&quot;. I also did get the vibe they are tired and overworked (hence they needed several new people in the team). But the strongest impression was of a formerly tight-knit team of people who are now forced to work remotely and who are begrudgingly admitting they need help, and were also strongly introverted -- to make matters even worse.<p>That mix led to the situation described previously: I got more and more paralyzed and hesitant to ask for help as time went by, and my daily efficiency dropped to almost zero.<p>The thing that hurt me was how annoyed the team acted when I asked every question. One nasty (but pretty normal) response was &quot;read Tilt docs&quot; and it really didn&#x27;t help me when it turned out that a special Python code line had to be put because my local k8s install refused to even initialize its network interfaces without much of an error indication until I drilled way down.<p>I did not feel any triumph when the guy I did a screen-share session with finally admitted that they might have thrown me into too deep a pit and that yeah, my setup turned out more difficult than theirs and that yeah, last they did it the cluster was smaller and easier to configure.<p>I never did once thought to say: &quot;HA! TOLD YOU SO!&quot; -- I was just very saddened.<p>It&#x27;s easy for one to give in to negative thoughts and to second-guess themselves but discussing with people -- including yourself -- in this sub-thread did give me more clarity and showed me that it wasn&#x27;t only me who was at fault.<p>Thank you.')
