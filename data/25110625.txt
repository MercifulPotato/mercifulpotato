Of course, that will be a problem with any distro on such a small screen. On a regular monitor it&#x27;s just a bit sluggish, but no worse and perhaps a little faster than the official OS. Plenty usable as a low-end desktop.<p>I don&#x27;t think it has even come close to exhausting 8 GB (looks like the 400 only has a 4 GB version?). I just wanted some head room there.')
