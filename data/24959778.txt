They need to  have psychological safety to outwardly “be themselves” - without burden to exert extra effort to unnaturally be different.<p>If you want to talk about severe extremes like preventing hate speech at work or not being allowed to practice nudism in the office, then fine, there’s worthwhile discussion of limits.<p>But if you want to say “no religion” and “no politics” just because you personally have the extreme arrogance to say “most humans” can’t discuss those topics rationally, then you personally are just an authoritarian thug - and this comes through strongly with the pejorative way you write about religious people, political people and what you personally deem to be “toxic.”<p>It is <i>far</i> more likely that you are the toxic element, hoping to repress aspects of employee culture for self-serving reasons that change the workplace into an environment you personally prefer at the expense of basic humanity and inclusiveness for others.')
