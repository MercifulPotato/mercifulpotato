Item(by='zinekeller', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611668469, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25915328, text='&gt; Once you have code execution as my user<p>The question is &quot;how&quot;? If you are indeed targeted by state-level attackers, there should be more precautions because you are actively attacked. However, I have stated that &quot;there are low-hanging fruits&quot;. I have written up a more extensive reply (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25914440" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25914440</a>) but the short answer is that you <i>can</i> actually prevent code execution on arbitrary areas on Windows. Upon further research, I now know that there is an analogous equivalent (and maybe competition) for Linux: AppArmor and SELinux. However, I will still see someone replying &quot;there is no solution to this mess&quot; despite having a solution, just unused by developers. It is made harder by <i>other</i> developers who by their choice makes security-conscious developers&#x27; lives harder.<p>&gt; We need capability-based privilege separation on network-connected machines.<p>Yes, you&#x27;re correct on that. But abandoning reliable-but-unused security for shiny new thing seems wrong on so many levels.')
