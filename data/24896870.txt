Item(by='eli_gottlieb', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603724476, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24896328, text='&gt;These diversity training people do use a different definition of racism then what you are thinking of.<p>Sure, but this only reinforces u&#x2F;rayiner&#x27;s point.  Nobody amended or replaced the Civil Rights Act.  No vote was held to enshrine a broader definition of racism as legally and ethically binding on all citizens.  Instead, a small clique of well-connected professional-class people are imposing this stuff top-down through their control of ostensibly private (but in fact, pseudo-private, often dependent on donations, subsidies, tax breaks, or public funding) institutions.<p>To my mind, the solution is simple: bring major public institutions back under full public governance and control.  No more &quot;we&#x27;re on private property&quot; rubbish from people taking tax dollars.<p>And, preferably, a fresh labor law enshrining protection for political opinions in the workplace that do not violate extent civil-rights laws.')
