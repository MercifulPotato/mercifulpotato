Not always best.  If you panels are near the batteries and near the load what you say can make sense (though I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if the charger had a AC step internally, that is clearly optional)<p>That isn&#x27;t what you would do for anything tied to the grid.  This is far more common (economies of scale mean the parts are cheaper).  There you would take advantage of AC&#x27;s ability to change voltage easily to allow the panels to be farther from the rest of the system. You would also want to use the grid as a backup for any system failures in the solar setup.<p>Eliminating steps isn&#x27;t always a good idea.')
