It took work to dig this hole, so it definitely has value. And I&#x27;m only digging one hole, ever, I promise.<p>I&#x27;ve also made a list of people who own the different bits of air in the hole. I&#x27;m using pencil and paper, but it works. If you give me some money I can write your name on there and you can &quot;store value&quot;. Later if you tell me to write someone else&#x27;s name, I can rub yours out and you can &quot;exchange large values&quot;.<p>If you or your friends want the money back later, I can give it to you. Probably... mostly. But don&#x27;t ask me for more money than you gave me in the first place, because I won&#x27;t have it.<p>p.s. I lied when I said I dug the hole by myself. I really dug up a billion tonnes of coal and used it to power a microscopic spaghetti noodle which dug the hole. For some reason this gave a lot of people confidence that my hole is the One True Hole.')
