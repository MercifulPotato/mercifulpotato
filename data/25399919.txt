The bricks are the SQL queries, the logic inside the container images you run, the data stored in the tables and storage buckets. Oh yes, and the business relationships and brand equity.<p>As long as you&#x27;re wiring those things together in ways you can replicate across cloud providers or in your own datacenter or on your own server in the closet, you&#x27;ve achieved the sweet spot in terms of deployment portability.<p>Running your own (Kubernetes cluster|database instance|pubsub system) on a cloud provider is crazy given that you now have at lease $150K+&#x2F;yr piece of overhead in the form of at least one (dev)ops person. Save that expense for when or if you decide your needs have become predictable enough that you can start building your own software&#x2F;hardware&#x2F;network infrastructure.<p>Unless advanced devops fu is an important part of your company&#x27;s mission or valuation, don&#x27;t do it unless its saving you a lot of money over the alternatives.')
