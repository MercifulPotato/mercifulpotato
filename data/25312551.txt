Microsoft wasn’t paying low wages and software people easily found jobs elsewhere but it still made Gates a billionaire.<p>Warren Buffet gave cash to companies he thought were undervalued and on hard times in exchange for ownership stakes. This worked out more frequently than not and made him wealthy without exploiting any labor (many of these companies paid&#x2F;pay solid middle class wages).<p>The Google founders are billionaires and their company has nothing to do with paying for cheap labor and up selling it.<p>Exploiting labor prices isn’t a business model that pays well enough by itself. In other words, companies that produce billionaires have to be providing more than just labor at a higher price than they paid for it.')
