Even if this is so, electricity doesn&#x27;t have colour - only voltage, amperage and frequency. My toaster doesn&#x27;t restrict me to use only electricity from a specific power plant. I can power it up even from a car battery, if I tinker with it a little. Similarly, a device like the Dash button should use whatever endpoint that implements the required API, and not be restricted to a specific provider.')
