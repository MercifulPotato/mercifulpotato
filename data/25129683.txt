But if you&#x27;re having a conversation about race, you would probably benefit from having black perspectives. Otherwise you convey an undertone that outcomes for blacks are for white people to choose. The message we want to teach kids is deeper than racism is bad.<p>This is vaguely addressed in the book&#x27;s pseudo sequel, go set a watchman, in which Atticus reveals a bigoted side opposing integration.<p>&gt; You&#x27;re projecting an opinion that people with different political opinions are just ignorant of the facts, which is itself ignorant. There are plenty of educated people who disagree with you.<p>I&#x27;m not saying people ignorant of facts, I&#x27;m saying they&#x27;re ignorant of nuance, and I&#x27;m saying this is a large chunk of people on both sides. Hence liberal perception of racism and conservative outrage. It doesn&#x27;t matter if educated people disagree with me. The fact that &quot;the continuation of power structures that make it systematically difficult for minorities to have equal levels of opportunity&quot; is the fundamental argument behind recent race relations conversations.')
