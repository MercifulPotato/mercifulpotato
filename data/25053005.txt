Mr. Biden ends the race up by more than eight points nationwide — the largest lead a candidate has held in the final polls since Bill Clinton in 1996. He’s up by at least five points in states worth more than 270 electoral votes, the number needed to win. Beyond that, he’s got at least a nominal lead in states worth 350 electoral votes, and he’s just a 2012 polling error away from a sweeping landslide of more than 400 electoral votes.”</i><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;live&#x2F;2020&#x2F;presidential-polls-trump-biden&#x2F;assessing-the-last-polls-before-the-election" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;live&#x2F;2020&#x2F;presidential-polls-trump-b...</a><p>Cohn&#x27;s polling leading up to the election:<p>Tuesday  Nevada   Biden +6<p>Wednesday  Michigan  Biden +8<p>Thursday  N.C.

Biden underperformed with hispanics and black from exceptions and likewise Trump did better with them than expected overall. And no matter what if you think someone the day of the election saying &quot;Biden Landside&quot; was possible, well...<p>You do you, but me personally, I&#x27;m going to go to someone else for opinions because that was such an exaggeration of reality that it seems like it had to be &quot;for effect&quot;.')
