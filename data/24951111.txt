I assume literally everyone, no matter their current career&#x2F;job&#x2F;education level, worked a menial job as a teenager. That&#x27;s because where I am from ALL teenagers were expected to participate in paid employment (and some were expected to help with the family&#x27;s bills) and where else are you going to work as a teenager? I wouldn&#x27;t ever consider bringing it up - I consider it very bizarre to bring it up like that, it would be like bragging about how you graduated college even though you went to public school growing up.')
