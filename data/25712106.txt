This inevitably leads their communities being banished and having to migrate elsewhere - where they can freely speak with whatever hateful, violence provoking or inciting comments they want - and they&#x27;ll continue to more strongly resonate in their echo chamber until they&#x27;re incited to violence by someone like Trump et al.<p>I also don&#x27;t understand what tech companies are preventing from being discussed? The issue with Parler is they weren&#x27;t moderating to delete violence inciting commentary - if Parler had done an adequate job of that then the app would still be accessible on those app stores.<p>More government control leads us more towards a CCP state, whereas the freedom of businesses to be relatively sovereign is a failsafe against potential tyranny - and where people are &quot;voting&quot; for the companies they support the governance of by buying their products, services - allowing them to earn revenues&#x2F;profit to continue existing; yes, there needs to be even more competition to prevent oligopoly behaviour, and there is policy possible to help with that - especially what&#x27;s needed is good data and network portability laws so people&#x27;s online life is easily mobile, as well I believe there needs to be a mechanism that extracts more value from businesses that gain benefit from economies of scale for various reasons.')
