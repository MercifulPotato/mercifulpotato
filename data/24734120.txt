And they were the first of the non-robinhood retail brokerages to break rank and offer 0-commission equity trades.<p>Example: I accidentally deposited a check into my IRA once. I called and explained I wasn&#x27;t sure what to do because 1) the check was post-tax money and 2) if I tried to fix it myself, would it count as an early withdrawal?.<p>The guy picked up almost immediately, said yep lemme transfer you, the &lt;something&gt; department has a button for that. I got transferred, still to a native english speaker, who sorted me out. A couple days later it was all fixed in my account. 10&#x2F;10.<p>I do all my banking with them and if they offered a 2% cashback credit card, I&#x27;d move that to them too.<p>Speaking of which, Citi (I have the doublecash) has been dreadful - my card # got stolen once, and they sent the new credit cards to my old address (that I still - for a bit longer - owned, thankfully) even after I specifically stressed, and confirmed multiple times, that I was 300 miles away from the address and if they sent them there, they&#x27;d sit in my porch for 1-2 weeks before I could get to them, and I would also not have a credit card to use.<p>They reassure me, even getting a bit snippy at the end of the call, that they&#x27;re sending them to the address I gave them (my parents&#x27; house) on the call. And since I&#x27;m such an important customer, they&#x27;re overnighting the cards.<p>Sure enough, the next day, I check my security camera and see a dang cardboard envelope that says CITICARDS all over it sitting on my old porch 300 miles away.<p>So I call them up, explain that they did exactly what I asked them not to do, and if they could cancel those cards and try sending them again, because I don&#x27;t have a credit card right now, and I&#x27;m trying to furnish and move into a new house and need to put about $10k of appliances purchases through the cards ASAP. They explain that, sorry, they need to wait a week or two (I was incensed and don&#x27;t remember clearly at this point) before they can do anything.<p>Luckily a week later when I rolled up to finish cleaning the old house, the cards were still there, albeit a bit damp.<p>In the meantime I&#x27;d applied for a Blue Cash Preferred (which gets 6% cashback on instacart!) and they had it to me overnight and dropped it on the doorstep of my new house which was a new construction and not even in some systems yet as a valid address. Their support as been good so far, too, though I haven&#x27;t had to call them but once so far.<p>(Thanks for coming to my TED talk.)')
