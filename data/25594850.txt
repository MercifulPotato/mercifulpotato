Metrics. Being able to see who&#x27;s doing what, and how quickly, and what still needs to get done. Being able to make charts and graphs and summarized reports for the next-higher level of management, so they can say that their team is productive and their team isn&#x27;t falling behind.<p>It also serves the needs of the companies, like Adaptavist, which have attached themselves to Jira to sell add-ons and generally bring the state of the software up to where middle managers (in my experience) think it ought to be out of the box.<p>I could imply that this is deliberate, that Atlassian is Not Adding some features to scratch the backs of those other companies, but That Would Be Wrong, I&#x27;m sure.')
