Anything where SEO is critical (most things these days), we use Laravel for (trying to move away from Wordpress), with some custom classes to help standardize important SEO stuff.<p>I haven&#x27;t had that experience with Hugo, but I pushed the files up to S3&#x2F;Github Pages&#x2F;Netlify and had them served from there.

I don&#x27;t understand why, with React, you need to install a 3rd-party dependency just to update your meta tags.
