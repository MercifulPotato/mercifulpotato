My career has very little in common with Carmack, but I think I achieved success with the same mentality.<p>I have non-techie friends who have toyed with learning to code, but they usually get discouraged after a few weeks. I try to encourage and mentor, but it rarely pans out. There&#x27;s a huge disconnect between what people are taught and how career progression works in the modern world. It&#x27;s enough of a gap that I struggle to connect &quot;Eloquent JavaScript&quot; or a similar 101 guide with actually getting someone a job.<p>I&#x27;m certain there&#x27;s a framework out there that could help learn and make a living in an emerging industry (outside of &quot;work your ass off and don&#x27;t get exploited&quot;), but there&#x27;s also so much garbage and bad guidance muddying these waters.')
