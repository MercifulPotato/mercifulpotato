Item(by='vidarh', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608281500, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25465030, text='A lot of products have extreme monoculture.<p>For another example, most ice machines for consumer use all use the exact same flawed mechanical mechanism.<p>Someone cut a few cents of the BOM by dropping detection of when the water tray had fully rotated, and instead the mechanism will eventually break due to repeated stress as they just run the motor a few seconds too long. For occasional use it works. For frequent use and you&#x27;ll easily cause them to break in the exact same manner each time after about a year.<p>Models keep disappearing, presumably because too many break within the warranty period, but then new ones with slightly different exteriors and the exact same broken interior mechanism appears. This has gone on for many years.<p>When I last bought one it took ages to find one that used another design, hampered by lack of pictures showing the tray. Finally did find one and never buying another brand again if I can avoid it.')
