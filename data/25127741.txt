You can talk about the economy all day long, but the fact of the matter is that if we all wouldâ€™ve taken this seriously and shut everything down, we would be through the worst of it already.</i><p>This is untrue to the point where it hurts. The reason it&#x27;s lasting so long is because covid-19 is a highly infection virus that&#x27;s already out in the wild, and it&#x27;s going to spread despite our best efforts to contain it until a vaccine is invented and deployed or until we reach herd immunity.<p>We are not gods. We can&#x27;t wave our hand at biology and make the virus disappear. We must take all necessary and <i>sane</i> precautions, and accept the consequences of our life.')
