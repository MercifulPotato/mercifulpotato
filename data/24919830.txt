It lets you more easily see how  development evolves in response to feedback. And the final state of the branch which gets merged leaves all the in-progress work that no one cares about behind only in Gerrit.<p>With Github&#x2F;lab&#x27;s model, if you force push your PR, you lose the ability to view its previous state and diff against that. Alternately, if you just keep adding commits, then the final branch that gets merged (unless you squash) has all the in-progress work which pollutes the repo&#x27;s history.<p>Gerrit also has a finer grained permission model, but I don&#x27;t care as much about that.<p>Gerrit definitely expects the user to understand how git works conceptually a bit more than Github&#x2F;lab.')
