They generally don&#x27;t degrade civilian morale enough to get them to surrender, and well prepared defensive positions are <i>incredibly</i> hard to render defenseless, even with modern weapons and seriously destructive bombing.<p>I don&#x27;t think that it&#x27;s necessary at the moment, but these decisions are a risk&#x2F;reward thing, and I think the Swiss are prepared enough to make the pain of invading Switzerland outweigh the relatively small gain.')
