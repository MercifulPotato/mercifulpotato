You queued a message to the port of the device &#x2F; disk you wanted, when the I&#x2F;O was complete you received a reply on your port.<p>The same message port system was used to receive UI messages. And filesystems, on top of drive system, were also using port&#x2F;messages. So did serial devices. Everything.<p>Simple, asynchronous by nature.<p>As a matter of fact, it was even more elegant than this. Devices were just DLL with a message port.')
