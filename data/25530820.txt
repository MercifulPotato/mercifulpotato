They&#x27;ve captured a huge portion of the smartphone market, but apple tv is only 1-2% of the market, and in many countries much less than that.<p>They don&#x27;t allow your phone to show Fitness+ on the TV through HDMI, nor through airplay. The phone screen is just way too small.<p>So what&#x27;s left are iPads, which can be a really great experience, particularly on the 12 inch pro, but it&#x27;s a shame they don&#x27;t allow Macbooks... I&#x27;m okay with the buy-in to some extent but man... A watch, phone and an apple tv is necessary, all from the same company, plus a subscription just to do a video-assisted workout that shows your heartrate on the screen? That&#x27;s a pretty insane proposition. Would&#x27;ve been great if they allowed more options or third-party stuff. Just casting from my iPhone would&#x27;ve been a good start, or casting on my macbook... Honestly it&#x27;s pretty ridiculous.<p>Happy Macbook, iPhone, Apple Watch and Airpod Pro user, otherwise.')
