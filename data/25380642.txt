Does HBC have some sort of argument why they shouldn&#x27;t be paying rent? I remember reading somewhere that anchor stores usually have clauses in their lease agreement that they don&#x27;t have to pay if the mall didn&#x27;t meet minimum traffic levels. Is this what&#x27;s happening here?<p>edit:<p>That seems to be the case.<p>&gt; In arguments that echo a similar case against another Toronto-area mall, HBC claims Coquitlam Centre has failed to maintain a “first class” shopping centre as stated in the lease.<p>&gt;That includes not upgrading the HVAC system to reduce the transmission of COVID-19, improving pedestrian control, upgrading washrooms and increasing the number of people responsible for health and safety at the mall, claims HBC.<p>&gt;HBC added that the landlord did not to provide “an environment that attracts substantial numbers of customers and encourages them to stay at the centre for an extended period of time” nor had it taken steps “to adequately market the shopping centre to respond to COVID-19.”<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tricitynews.com&#x2F;local-news&#x2F;hudsons-bay-coquitlam-reopens-forced-to-pay-half-rent-in-interim-ruling-3145061" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tricitynews.com&#x2F;local-news&#x2F;hudsons-bay-coquitlam...</a>')
