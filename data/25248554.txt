Item(by='nl', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606687713, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25242528, text='&gt; Because 3 months of diesel averaged over 5 years (hydro fails only once every 5-10 years, not yearly) already makes that less than 100%.<p>So average it over the year it happened, not 5 years? This seems a pretty reasonable thing to do. (But if you do average over 5 years it would also be reasonable to include the energy exports, in which case it is well over 100%)')
