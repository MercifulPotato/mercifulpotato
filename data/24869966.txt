They&#x27;ve been my main laptops since the iBook G3&#x2F;900 (prior to that I&#x27;ve used Apple as well, alongside other systems). So it&#x27;s going to be a solid 2 decades or so.<p>For most of that time I had Linux&#x2F;BSD&#x2F;Win&#x2F;Mac machines that I&#x27;d use for different things, the Mac being the &quot;personal&quot; computer first option. At some point Windows became unbearable and I simply stopped using down to the point I couldn&#x27;t justify maintaining a machine for it neither in the physical nor logical sense (even maintaining familiarity with what&#x27;s on them). This was roughly 2~3 years ago and being forced to switch to Win10 eased the decision to just EOL it.<p>Recently I&#x27;m doing most of my daily stuff on a Linux desktop machine (I&#x27;ve been a Linux user since the mid 90s) partly because of the lockdown. In the desktop, Linux has been the best experience for me for many years. Just not on the laptop for a variety of reasons. With Apple&#x27;s increasing anti-user hostility I think it&#x27;s time to deal with the mild problems and annoyances your typical Linux laptop is expected to cause.')
