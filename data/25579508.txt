That&#x27;s not a technical problem, that&#x27;s Visa betrayed you for whatever reason.<p>Arguably one of the options that would be &quot;considered insecure by browser standards&quot; is actually safer for Cloudflare sites, because you can&#x27;t attack it from the Web PKI. Cloudflare Origin CA isolates you from such an attack, bad guys would need to attack Cloudflare to get a valid certificate from them, certificates from another CA would not work if it&#x27;s locked down to Cloudflare Origin CA.')
