How does archaeology work in your mind, pjc50?<p>It&#x27;s centuries-old new media hype from landowners who realized their 200-year-old ruins wouldn&#x27;t sell nearly as well as 2000-year-old ruins. It&#x27;s everyone clinging to one man&#x27;s account of an event that happened millennia ago while ignoring the mountain that fell on them centuries ago.<p>It might be the world&#x27;s first tourist trap. Both eruptions happened and there&#x27;s stuff to see from both, yes, but 95% of what&#x27;s on display in Pompeii is from the more recent major eruption, in my opinion. The tools and buildings look so modern because they are so modern.')
