This feature has no dependency on a host operating system or even heap-allocated memory. That means async functions are available for the freestanding target.<p>Zig infers whether a function is async, and allows async&#x2F;await on non-async functions, which means that Zig libraries are agnostic of blocking vs async I&#x2F;O. Zig avoids function colors.&quot;<p>Nice! I had the impression that Zig wasn&#x27;t so simple as I&#x27;ve imagined it due to features like this, but this actually sounds like a lot of thought was put into this to adhere to Zig&#x27;s principles. Looks cool!')
