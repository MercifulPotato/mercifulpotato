(I haven&#x27;t checked but given their popularity, I&#x27;m sure their servers are not just in the US anymore.)<p>&gt; They can do sealed sender stuff all they like, but when 10.0.1.1 sends a 17-byte message and the server then sends a 17-byte message to 10.0.2.1, and a minute later 10.0.2.1 submits something to the server of 48 bytes and then 48 bytes are forwarded to 10.0.1.1... traffic analysis based on a tap of a Signal server isn&#x27;t rocket science.<p>True, though with a bazillion connections going in and out of Signal&#x27;s AWS instances every minute and additional domain fronting by AWS, the NSA would probably have to be inside the AWS datacenter to carry out their traffic analysis and even <i>then</i> it doesn&#x27;t seem like a triviality to me.<p>Compare this to someone hosting their own Matrix node (which you&#x27;re mentioning further down): In this case, it is clear that <i>every</i> message sent to that node has something to do with the node&#x27;s owner. More generally, reconstructing a social network in a p2p network (without onion routing or anything like that) is much easier than doing this in a centralized network where all messages get routed through a central location. There&#x27;s a reason why the guys from GNUnet have so far spent two decades on getting p2p right. (Though, of course, anonymity is just one of their concerns and not their only one.)')
