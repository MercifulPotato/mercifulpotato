There&#x27;s a lot of opportunity here for other online banks to capitalize on this market segment and gain a lot of very loyal customers.<p>The friends that I invited to Simple mostly all ended up using it as a primary bank and they all want to find someone new to switch to with the same features that they&#x27;ve come to depend on.<p>Personally for me, virtual cards for Pockets seems like the last thing I need to finally switch over, but I imagine I&#x27;ll stick with Simple until they announce actual end of service dates in the slim chance that they don&#x27;t actually shut the service down.')
