Profiles are the idea to combine extensions for specific fields. There are also special standard extensions that you can implement that overlap with the standard extensions for some special instruction.<p>If you want to only have core + popcount you can do that in your own core. The code will still be portable to all cores that have B extension. If there is a whole industry that needs that combination, it can just be its own profile.<p>There simply is no perfect solution for every possible solution. If you increase the core, you hurt those that have absolutely no use for some of these things.<p>RISC-V did an amazing overall job to find a combination of ideas to attempted to solve everything for all people but the reality is, no single thing they could have designed would not end up with some expert on HN explaining why the choice is wrong.')
