And only code is copyrightable, code requires to be executable on some machine.

I don&#x27;t know if this is possible to sue the government for, but like, how enraging is it if everyone for years clearly thinks they know the rules and all abide by some interpretation of it worth billions of dollars. Clearly the law needed to be revised a long time ago.')
