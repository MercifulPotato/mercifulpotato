The worst case scenario was already known to you - bankruptcy.<p>Nothing Google or their lawyers do would change that worst-case outcome, and if Google was aware you literally don&#x27;t have $72k, and might just declare bankruptcy and walk away, they&#x27;ll be much more eager to negotiate a more reasonable bill and settle your account. It&#x27;s exactly as J. Paul Getty said...<p>Very glad it&#x27;s being worked out and you will not have to go down that path.')
