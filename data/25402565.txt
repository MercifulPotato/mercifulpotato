I was put off from the beginning when she said the UI “sucked” or similar, didn’t know the author was a woman at that point. Believe me or don’t but that’s my story &amp; I’m sticking to it.<p>+1000 to the author for raising specific accessibility concerns and contrasting (no pun intended) the colour palates with those of other sites. The old “dark gray on light gray; tiny text” style (see: daring fireball of days past) drives me nuts.<p>I think the author makes fantastic points and it’s unfortunate that the somewhat mean spirited language distracts from those points, leading to <i>this</i> discussion rather than a more substantive one about accessibility. Not the end of the world either way.')
