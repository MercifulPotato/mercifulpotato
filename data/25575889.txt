The commonly stated purpose of the U.S. outsourcing to China was to 1. help lift it out of poverty and 2. bring it democracy through capitalism.<p>Goal #1 has been largely achieved and Goal #2 has been an epic failure. The U.S. should completely phase out outsourcing to China over the next decade. This would drive a huge acceleration of automated manufacturing in the U.S. which is the future anyway.<p>Companies like Apple could move all manufacturing to the U.S. over a decade if they wanted to. They have the money and the technology. But they&#x27;re currently addicted to cheap (and unethical) labor. They&#x27;re unlikely quit on their own, as long as U.S. law enables their addiction.')
