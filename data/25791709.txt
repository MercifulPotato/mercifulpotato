My Ryzen 7 4800H benchmarks very neatly in line with my Ryzen 7 2700X desktop (which is Zen+ so half a generation older.) Basically I give up very little switching between my desktop and laptop. Up until a few years ago I only ever gamed on my desktop but since I got this laptop (80W GeForce GTX 1660 Ti) 1080p laptop gaming is quite good.<p>Do you do PC gaming on Stadia or is that all Chromecast+TV type gaming?
