The show has some interesting ideas regarding advanced civilizations vs the primitive ones. One of which is called the prime directive prohibiting any star fleet from intervening with the evolution of primitive people.<p>In one of the episodes “who watches the watcher” the USS enterprise travels to planet Minkita 2 for a rescue mission and encounters a primitive species of humanoid. By accident, they exposed themselves and their technologies to the people there. Now, those people consider star fleet personnel as god. Without spoiling much, Jean Luc idea to refuse them this thought is interesting and worth thinking when it comes to our scenario here, don’t you think?<p>(I have to say that I am now big fan of the Star Trek series with Sir Patrick. How could I miss it all those years?)')
