They can still be idiots. Idiocy does not have an age limit.<p>&gt;&gt;  Inflation is measured in many ways, most often by looking at a basket of goods where the prices are relatively non-volatile.<p>Meaning you remove the items from the basket if it&#x27;s price jump too much ? so if you tamper with the items in the basket you can project(pretend) that the inflation is not happening.?<p>&gt;&gt; using the USD&#x2F;Bitcoin ratio as a yardstick for inflation seems very misguided, as Bitcoin is heavily speculated.<p>No it doesn&#x27;t need to be a yardstick as Bitcoin is not yet in full circulation in the economy but it&#x27;s growth indicates people are increasingly prioritising it over paper to store value.<p>Re: speculation, everything is a speculation, there are those who keep holding USD in cash and banks and keep speculating that the economic prophets will do the right thing to retain value in their chosen currency.')
