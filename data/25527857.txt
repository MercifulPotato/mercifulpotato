Mark Fisher decries a climate in which most people consider markets as the only possible solution for all problems in &quot;Capitalist Realism&quot;.<p>However, because these authors can just be upfront about what their beliefs are, they aren&#x27;t forced to argue for vague concepts like &quot;intellectual diversity&quot; and can instead be specific about the type of restrictions that are occurring and in the case of Herman and Chomsky even track them with real numbers, making for a much better argument.')
