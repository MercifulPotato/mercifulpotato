Worst case you might trade a little extra equity, but again that’s linear dilution often based on growth at the current rate.<p>PS: If your growing 10% per month it takes 6 years to go from 1 million per year in revenue to 1 billion per year in revenue.  It’s very fast, but hardly instantaneous. Keeping that up for 12 years means 1 trillion in revenue per year which is extremely rare. Growth will slow eventually, and when it does there are a huge number of things to optimize.')
