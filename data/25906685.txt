Yes their operation in Phoenix is heavily mapped and fenced, that doesn&#x27;t mean that their technology can&#x27;t and hasn&#x27;t driven in more improvised environment before, and I highly doubt the lumbar street example was mapped.<p>Videos recorded by the company will always be cherry picked by definition, since they would only post videos that show the technology in its optimal working state. And there&#x27;s always a driver behind the wheel checking everything goes right.<p>The reason Waymo is operating the way it does is they realize that they need to be 120% cautious, as ONE accident is all it takes to throw all their work a decade behind, jst like one accident is all it took to completely kill Uber&#x27;s self driving effort. So again, it&#x27;s not that they <i>need</i> a fully mapped geofenced area, it&#x27;s that they choose to use that for now.<p>Hell, Tesla themselves posted their first &quot;A to B&quot; video back in 2016, yet here we are 5 years later and from a high level, what they showed in that cherry picked video they posted isn&#x27;t much different to an average viewer, but no one would claim that they haven&#x27;t improved at all in the past 5 years.<p>This is basic anecdotal data vs real statistics. A video tells you nothing about where the technology is. Unless we can see real open data about miles driven and number of disengagements, there&#x27;s no way to tell if Tesla is doing well or not. So far Waymo&#x27;s numbers are an order of magnitude better than any competition.')
