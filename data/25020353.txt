Media outlets construct &amp; present narratives based on what they believe will get people to tune-in&#x2F;click etc., mostly a financial consideration. That content guides the audience&#x27;s beliefs in the direction of the narrative. Media outlets are then locked in to that narrative, and must present content that coincides with or pushed it even further, and the cycle continues.')
