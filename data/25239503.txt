I was aware that the question was about unbounded objects. I thought it would be easier this way because it&#x27;s hard to visualize intersecting 3D spaces correctly, so I wanted to show that picturing them as bounded volumes leads to the wrong conclusion by way of analogy to lower dimensional objects. I left out the null intersection case for brevity.<p>Thanks for the more thorough explanation!')
