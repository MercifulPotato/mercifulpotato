Is it the average feeling over time?  Is it the height of the peak?  Is it the low of the trough?  Is it the frequency of the oscillations?  Is it the slope of the transitions?  The predictability?  The unpredictability?<p>And where does &quot;job satisfaction&quot; come from?  Does it come from the work?  From co-workers?  From the outcomes of the work?  Or does it come from inside?  And if it comes from inside, how is it affected by your circumstances, which change over time?<p>What is job satisfaction for you?  If you have an answer to that question, do you think the answer would be the same for other people, or might it be different?')
