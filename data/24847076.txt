For my personal projects, I use GitHub Issues as a dumping ground for ideas, which automatically go into a &quot;Triage&quot; (inbox) column, which I go through and assign labels and priorities every week or month depending on the project.<p>The downside with GitHub projects is that you can&#x27;t automate based on labels so the issues need to be organised into columns manually if you have more than the simple one board with To-Do&#x2F;In-Progress&#x2F;Done columns setup. Though search and filters slightly helps with that.')
