Item(by='jkrems', descendants=None, kids=[25799114], score=None, time=1610759513, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25798562, text='&gt; If give someone enough constraints almost any patent will seem obvious.<p>That seems like a strawperson. The parent said that just given the very rough idea or (I would add) even just the term &quot;1 click buy&quot;, somebody could have created a comparable experience without any reference to the patent. That&#x27;s not &quot;give someone enough constraints&quot;. That&#x27;s &quot;let somebody overhear a customer mention the feature in passing&quot;.<p>Suggesting that Amazon wouldn&#x27;t have invented 1-click buy without patents seems incompatible with good business practices. All my conversations with other developers mentioned a single reason for patenting &quot;random&quot; features at this point: As a way to defend against other people&#x27;s patents. The only reason _not_ to create a novel feature was that it may be too close to something patented and a lucky lawyer may have argued that it was too close. If anything, software patents actively discourage innovation.<p>I&#x27;ve never heard of anybody implementing a feature by using a patent. I&#x27;ve never heard of somebody developing a novel feature to get a patent. Which means as &quot;patents&quot;, they are useless.')
