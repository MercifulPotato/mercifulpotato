He is saying that Roman insurrections involved the military, so this riot isn&#x27;t a close parallel to a Roman insurrection. US insurrections will involve the army too - that is what weakens the comparison with ancient Greece.<p>The Romans (and US) have professional, geographically dispersed militaries and the Greeks by and large didn&#x27;t. That completely changes the dynamic of how revolts happen.')
