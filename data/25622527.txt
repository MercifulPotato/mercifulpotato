Zig&#x27;s syntax choices are not arbitrary and great effort is made to ensure their consistency. Your complaints about the syntax aren&#x27;t that there is anything inconsistent or illogical about the syntax, just that it isn&#x27;t the syntax you&#x27;re used to.<p>That&#x27;s a valid reason to not want to use the language, but I don&#x27;t believe it is a valid basis for criticism and certainly doesn&#x27;t excuse the hostility of your comments in this thread.')
