What you cannot do is wear them ostensibly <i>if you&#x27;re acting as an official for a public service</i>. Teacher ? no cross&#x2F;kippa&#x2F;etc. while you&#x27;re teaching. Cop ? same. Mayor in the process of marrying a couple ? same again.<p>Parent helping teachers during a school outing ? you&#x27;re perfectly allowed to have such signs visible, you&#x27;re not an official representative of the French republic. Same goes in public places in general.')
