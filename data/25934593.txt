The holding the bag metaphor comes from a gang of thieves robbing a place and then leaving a patsy behind with all the evidence of the crime and none of the loot. Right now, in my opinion, a lot of the Robinhood faction of the gang are funneling into the vault thinking Joe Wallstreet is that patsy, not realizing that the savvy senior members bailed out an hour ago and the cops are about 2 blocks over and closing. There doesn&#x27;t have to be just one patsy after all.<p>The whole metaphor discounts the &quot;I just want the shortsellers to burn b&#x2F;c anarchy&quot; aspect that some people are claiming, which honestly I think is believed by very few and projected onto many more who really just want quick money.')
