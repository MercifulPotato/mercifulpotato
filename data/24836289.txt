C (and really any language probably) kinda feels like a different language with each few orders of magnitude in code size.  Rust feels a lot like forcing the structure of 10KLOC to 1MLOC C projects to me with sane defaults and more powerful versions of the same abstractions.<p>We&#x27;re not using string based macros, but hygenic macros.<p>We&#x27;re not using goto error, but instead RAII.<p>We&#x27;re not guessing if a function returns 0 or 1 on success and if the big struct we passed in as a pointer is valid on either of those, we&#x27;re using an ADT that makes it clear.<p>Slices mean everyone aren&#x27;t reimplementing 1000 morphs of the same buffer struct.<p>And the deeper separation between code and data that the fat pointers give you and how the more you go down OO principles, the less idiomatic it feels, really feels more like a giant C codebase than a C++ one to me.')
