It&#x27;s a pity that enthusiastic students end up there, often because they&#x27;re not given the right environment to thrive (e.g. a good lab and a supervisor that cares).<p>There isn&#x27;t much to say to respond to that, apart that it seems to me that, in a parallel universe, you might have had a more fulfilling experience, or you might have cut your losses and walked away sooner.<p>That&#x27;s the cruel aspect of the PhD. It really seems like a lot of important things are outside of one&#x27;s control, especially when it comes to important factors in mental health.
