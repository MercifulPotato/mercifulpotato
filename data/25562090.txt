It happened that I needed to install a new light fixture in the same room as the computer... can you see where this is going?<p>Well, I didn&#x27;t want to turn off the simulation, so I figured that if I instead just turn off the lights, then even without flipping the breaker for that room, I could be sure there would be no live wires leading to my new light fixture.<p>I was standing on a long stool and was about to start screwing in the light fixture to the ceiling wires with a lustre terminal and bam, I was hit with 220 volts.<p>I thought the only outcomes from getting electrocuted would be to either die or survive, but I discovered a third thing that can happen: I lost a bunch of color in my skin, and it never came back.<p>Lessons? Be careful with electricity, and try not to get too obsessed with Corewars.')
