All vaccines since then were produced entirely within the UK. Second, the UK paid for the development of those vaccines, the EU did not. Without the UK funding and the collaboration with Oxford, AZ was not even planning to develop its own vaccine variant, and so those facilities would not have been producing any vaccine at all.<p>Well, then why not disclose those figures like EU is asking? If it was only the initial order, how many doses of it? How many are currently be produced?<p>The EU paid whatever it had to pay to have 80 million doses in February, because that was the deal. Instead they are to receive 30 million, with little to no transparency around why and how many doses are being moved out of Europe.<p>&gt;As mentioned, the UK and USA paid to develop these products. The EU is expecting everyone else to pay the cost of development, and then just get the vaccine at cost when it arrives, and still have priority?<p>The EU also upfront money, to the point that AZ established a timeline and a number of vaccines to be delivered - 80 million doses by Feb. Or now some contracts have more value than others? Why doesn&#x27;t the UK release their contract to the public then?<p>The reality is that maybe EU should have locked production to EU like UK and USA apparently did. It&#x27;s all &quot;let&#x27;s end the pandemic together&quot; but apparently UK and USA want to deal with their problem first and let the rest of the world make vaccines for them.<p>&gt;Good luck with that. All the vaccine manufacturers are suffering shortfalls, and the UK is not reliant on exports from the EU. I hope that further vaccine production goes to countries that didn&#x27;t have the economic means to build their own vaccine supply, rather than those too short-sighted to build one.<p>Well now that the first batches that came from EU are delivered (and god only knows how many, because there&#x27;s no transparency) it&#x27;s easy to say that you don&#x27;t need EU production. Until the UK had no production it was good to receive from EU, now that it has some capacity you don&#x27;t need it more?<p>Yeah, really hope EU starts to crackdown on this. Either everyone contributes, or sanctions and restrictions should start to be applied.')
