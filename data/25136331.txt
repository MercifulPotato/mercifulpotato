It&#x27;s the same as the ones you do in hospitals or airports and not a rapid-testing kit which delivers results within minutes on your couch.<p>With the massive downside that it still requires professional handling to get a decent swab which most of the people aren&#x27;t trained for, thereby likely skewing the results (shitty swab = no detection).<p>In fact, this very same company has a testing center at Hamburg Airport.<p>(this is a very nice product by the way and certainly helpful aside from the cost, but it just isn&#x27;t the same category of test which this post refers to).')
