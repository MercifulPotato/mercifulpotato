When my girlfriend&#x27;s HP 4L died we looked for a replacement and we both wanted to print color images so I bought a Canon MX870 (&quot;multifunction&quot;, inkjet) in 2010.<p>I still have it and it still impresses me with how robust it is - the fact it&#x27;s a good document scanner and a fax is gravy. On its strength I bought a PRO-100 and the European analog of the MX870 whose model number I forget.<p>The PRO-100 sat unused for several years, and when I tried it again, it picked up and worked as though for the first time.<p>The assertion that inkjet is garbage sure isn&#x27;t borne out by my three Canon inkjets.')
