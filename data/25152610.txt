It&#x27;s a somewhat similar situation now in the US with a holiday that historically involved travel and large family gatherings, but I&#x27;m afraid that many government leaders have downplayed covid for so long that it&#x27;ll be hard to get any compliance at this point, especially in the worst hit areas, which at some places are in full-blown collective denial.')
