You have to create a custom read-only IAM role to absorb all the AWS events into NewRelic. But if you don&#x27;t put in your particular NewRelic customer ID in the policy, the policy allows any customer in NewRelic to add that AWS account to their own NewRelic account and ingest its metrics. Since you don&#x27;t have to include the customer ID in the role to make the integration work, it&#x27;s likely there are a lot of AWS accounts out there with misconfigured IAM policies allowing any unscrupulous NewRelic customer to view their metrics.')
