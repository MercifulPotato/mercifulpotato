I don’t love the optics of this FB ad, but it is a fact that it’s going to:<p>1. Make targeted advertising significantly more expensive, which affects small businesses<p>2. Potentially cause those businesses to advertise less, which hurts apps that rely on that ad revenue<p>3. Give users more privacy control over cross-app tracking<p>All the coverage of this is 100% focused on #3 while assuming 1 and 2 are free or worth burning to the ground.')
