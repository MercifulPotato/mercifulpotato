Is that still not the case?<p>I am willing to donate to Mozilla in spite of their mismanagement given that we are creeping ever closer to another browser monopoly. Ignoring bad financial decisions, Firefox is a good product and I&#x27;ve been using it exclusively on PC since Quantum came out. I feel that people here hold Mozilla to some impossibly high standards and turn it into outrage porn.
