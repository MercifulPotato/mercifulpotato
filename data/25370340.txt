When you point your finger at something there&#x27;s usually three more pointing straight back at you.<p>Hillary said the election was fraudulent from day one all the way up to current election.<p>Or how on October 26, 2020, PBS (hardly a right-wing or conservative news agency), aired a documentary [2] on the problems with the Dominion voting machines showing how you could just copy the QR codes and they could be re-scanned and count as a legitimate vote, no major hacking needed here. Here&#x27;s an excerpt:\n-<p>&quot;J. Alex Halderman:<p>By analyzing the structure of the Q.R. codes, I have been able to learn that there&#x27;s nothing that stops an attacker from just duplicating one, and the duplicate would count the same as the original bar code.<p>Miles Oâ€™Brien:<p>And in late September, another concern came to light. During testing, election workers found half the names of the 21 candidates for Senate intermittently disappeared from screens during the review phase.<p>Dominion sent out a last-minute software patch.<p>J. Alex Halderman:<p>I&#x27;m worried that the Georgia system is the technical equivalent to the 737 MAX. They have just made a last-minute software change that might well have unintended consequences and cause even more severe problems on Election Day.&quot;<p>For me, it&#x27;s the individual states changing their own election laws via unconstitutional methods right before the election. I think that is widespread fraud without a doubt, and those votes need to be audited or discounted.<p>[1]  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forbes.com&#x2F;2009&#x2F;08&#x2F;27&#x2F;ted-kennedy-soviet-union-ronald-reagan-opinions-columnists-peter-robinson.html?sh=4b04b69c359a" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forbes.com&#x2F;2009&#x2F;08&#x2F;27&#x2F;ted-kennedy-soviet-union-r...</a><p>[2]  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pbs.org&#x2F;newshour&#x2F;show&#x2F;will-georgias-new-voting-machines-solve-election-problems-or-make-them-worse" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pbs.org&#x2F;newshour&#x2F;show&#x2F;will-georgias-new-voting-m...</a>')
