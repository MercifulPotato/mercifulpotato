Item(by='schwartzworld', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607510265, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25345735, text='&gt; Why are so many people upset by this?<p>I can&#x27;t even imagine why my response sounded &quot;upset&quot;.<p>&gt; someone who isn’t being thrifty and researching every little thing out with spreadsheets.<p>No, I don&#x27;t think spreadsheets are required. I probably wouldn&#x27;t spend $600 on something that doesn&#x27;t seem like it usually costs that much without reading a couple of reputable reviews first, or maybe checking to see if the features I want exist in a popular cheaper brand. OP isn&#x27;t doing this because OP isn&#x27;t buying the headphones to fulfill any need, but because they &quot;trust apple&quot;. It&#x27;s bizarre and hard to understand for anybody who isn&#x27;t used to thinking of $600 as pocket change, I guess.<p>&gt; I’ll probably get these for the same reason as the parent; I vaguely want some air pods but I haven’t got around to it and I prefer this form factor.<p>This was the part that confused me. OP has AirPods and AirPods pro and claims that he loves both. The part I don&#x27;t get is blindly dropping $600 to buy something that doesn&#x27;t even solve a problem for you. Apple puts it out, OP buys because it&#x27;s an apple product.<p>&gt; I trust apple not to sell useless knockoff rubbish in a shiny box. My relationship with them is no more complex than that.<p>This is the part that DOES upset me.<p>You think Apple never made useless rubbish? As we speak I&#x27;m typing this on a piece of shit 2019 MB Pro issued by my job. It sucks. Bad design (no ports, no magsafe, no escape key).')
