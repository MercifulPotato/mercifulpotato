In exchange for this anonymizing service you take a 1% cut of each transaction, then spend it on a ride yourself at the end of the day. The 1% cut is priced into the operator&#x27;s ticket prices so they still make enough profit, and is practically invisible to the rider, but if the service did not exist, then the tickets could be sold 1% cheaper. This is the model, whether or not you call it &quot;taking&quot; the 1% or &quot;adding on&quot; the 1% is inconsequential.')
