Yes, government regulation would be nice.  But it&#x27;s a little unfair to accuse the OP of trying to reinvent government by proposing that consumers organize outside of government.<p>People organize to engage in collective action outside of governments all the time. In addition to labor unions, consider civil society nonprofits.  It&#x27;s not bizarre or (as another comment suggested) some kind of tech-bro magical thinking to say &quot;hey, the government isn&#x27;t regulating this group of people, let&#x27;s organize to get some collective power going.&quot;')
