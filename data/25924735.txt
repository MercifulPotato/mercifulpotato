Very good points.<p>But here&#x27;s my response to you: You&#x27;re paying them $6 per month. That&#x27;s not enough money for them to do better than what they&#x27;re doing now. They literally can&#x27;t afford to do better, given their paltry income stream. (Just my guess, I have no insider info about them).<p><i>If they keep doing what they’re doing now, I absolutely expect to see a massive data breach and&#x2F;or data loss event at some point</i><p>I guess that&#x27;s a chance they&#x27;re prepared to take, though they probably haven&#x27;t thought about it in such stark terms. I&#x27;m sure their development practices will improve, maybe in time to prevent a massive breach or loss.')
