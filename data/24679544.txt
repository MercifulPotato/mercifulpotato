Item(by='jancsika', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601823825, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24679304, text='&gt; We frequently support such research by providing access to datasets, free of cost, in a way that does not affect access for other users.<p>This is a bit misleading. They are talking about large datasets here. But in a later paragraph they describe their central fear-- that the downloader was trying to acquire the <i>entire</i> data set. And-- according to JSTOR-- while they feared the entire dataset was being downloaded, the access pattern had changed so that it was no longer interrupting regular JSTOR access at MIT. So disruption to service was clearly not the issue at that point.<p>It seems reasonable to conclude from this, and from their subsequent actions, that their definition for &quot;large datasets&quot; does <i>not</i> include &quot;the entire dataset.&quot;<p>As the documentary points out, there was precedent for Swartz downloading entire datasets from other databases for legitimate research purposes prior to this event. Is there evidence that JSTOR allowed other researchers to run automated analyses on the <i>entire dataset</i> through their free service? If not, they should have stated explicitly somewhere in their statement that they believe it is not legitimate research to run analyses on their entire dataset.')
