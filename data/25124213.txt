I have accepted that it&#x27;s what we use now, so I use it.  But...<p>Git is the bad boyfriend of the developer community.  If anything bad happens it was your fault.  If you ask it to do something and it does something else, it was your fault, and also you are stupid.  If you ever make a mistake, you will be punished for it with a long drawn out cycle of embarrassment.  No matter what happens, it was not git&#x27;s fault, it was your fault.<p>Good software is not like that.  Good software is the opposite of all of that.  Git is the industry standard, and I have just accepted that we aren&#x27;t going to get anything better, but whereas it might  make sense for the Linux kernel dev community,  it is not good software, and I suspect that it&#x27;s not just the UI that&#x27;s the problem.<p>Lots of non-devs also have the problem of wanting to have multiple people edit the same document, track changes, and occasionally merge them.  I would never recommend that they use git, and I see no evidence that it is ever spreading beyond the dev community in any significant way.  There&#x27;s a good reason for that.')
