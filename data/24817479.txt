This way, you can organize the folders in the order that is important for you to see the emails as they arrive.<p>- „Clear&quot; means, that it just clears those emails from what you are seeing there (emails are still stored in folders) so there is less clutter.<p>Would you pay a monthly subscription fee of $5-10 for a service like this?\nIf not, please tell me why.')
