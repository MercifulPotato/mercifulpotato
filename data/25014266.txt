A society that isn&#x27;t somewhat elastic has no hopes of overcoming unprecedented challenges; it&#x27;s bound to fall apart. And even though China&#x27;s social credit system seems hopelessly Orwellian, I&#x27;m confident that its architects are aware that faulty design might inadvertently render China fragile.<p>Tanner Greer at The Scholar&#x27;s Stage has written about Xi Jinping&#x27;s apparent belief in the &quot;tides of history&quot;. It&#x27;s a very Taoistic notion. History flows and develops and all we can do is try to swim along with its currents. The only other option is to get crushed. So there&#x27;s not really much hope in trying to control it. At least that seems to be Jinping&#x27;s philosophical position.<p>Deng Xioping started the trend with &quot;pragmatic experiments&quot; to test solutions on a small scale before implementing them wholesale. Stability is the goal. And if that means letting go of the reins, that&#x27;s just what they&#x27;re going to have to do. Robustness requires flexibility, and you don&#x27;t get that with simple-minded rigidity.<p>I&#x27;m also a bit surprised the author of this essay chose to invent a new term--horizontal totalitarianism--to describe how social groups protect their worldviews. It&#x27;s just ... a very mundane and obvious thing. The exact same phenomenon occurs at an individual level; cognitive dissonance results when our beliefs are in direct conflict. We tend to reject threats to our worldviews with the tenacity we defend ourselves against physical harm; it&#x27;s more powerful at a group level, but it&#x27;s the same thing.<p>When people spend time together, they become more similar. Is that &quot;horizontal totalitarianism&quot;? Or is that just a very obvious observation of human behavior?')
