Teach kids critical thinking and scientific literacy and media bias. Seems more important ever to teach kids that they shouldn&#x27;t believe everything the see at face value. Easier said than done I suppose<p>No education is perfect.  Even if those things are taught (which I&#x27;m pretty sure they are already at some level), there will still be loads of people that:<p>1) didn&#x27;t pay attention in school, or didn&#x27;t absorb the lessons;<p>2) don&#x27;t have the ability to apply the lessons;<p>3) forgot the lessons (esp. if they previously spent a lot of time in a sane media environment where the lessons were less necessary);<p>4) found it too much trouble to apply the lessons consistently, and let their guard down;<p>5) found the emotional content of the conspiracy was just too tempting; or<p>6) encountered a evolved conspiracy theory that found a way around their (years old) lessons.')
