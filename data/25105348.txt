It seems it’s 100% free of formulas, supporting my claim you need very little math)<p>Newer books probably exist (this book is almost 25 years old), but I don’t think that matters much. The details have changed (schedulers and allocators can get a lot more convoluted on modern systems with non uniform CPUs, hyper threading, etc., for example) and there’s some new stuff, for example in virtualization&#x2F;hypervisors, but the core concepts haven’t changed, and that’s what learning how operating systems work book should start with.<p>And yes, it only discusses UNIXes, so it ignores Windows, VMS and the like, but you have to start somewhere, and that book isn’t a bad start.')
