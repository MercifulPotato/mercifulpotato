Somebody described the apocalypse novels of John Wyndham (Day of the Triffids etc) as &quot;cosy catastrophe&quot;, and that very much applies here. The laser focus on technological detail-hoarding while having blinders on to any consideration of the politics of the situation, or what might be called &quot;material conditions&quot;.<p>Historically few societies collapsed without external pressure. Societies do not collapse, they <i>are collapsed</i>. And the force that&#x27;s doing the collapsing is the thing you need to worry about.<p>It also can take a very long time to wane; while Rome may have split from the Roman Empire in 395, the eastern successor Holy Roman Empire lasted until 1806. And the microstates provide even weirder examples, like the Maltese feudal knights with a WW2 air force!')
