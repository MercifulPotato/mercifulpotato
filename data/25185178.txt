Roman coins and medieval artefacts have all been found in or around the monument but <i>it is unknown if the monument was in continuous use throughout British prehistory and beyond</i>, or exactly how it would have been used. Notable is the massive Iron Age hillfort known as Vespasian&#x27;s Camp (despite its name, not a Roman site) built alongside the Avenue near the Avon. A decapitated seventh-century Saxon man was excavated from Stonehenge in 1923. The site was known to scholars during the Middle Ages and since then it has been studied and adopted by numerous groups”<p>So, it seems there may have been a thousand or so years it wasn’t in use. I think that puts the “still” part into doubt.')
