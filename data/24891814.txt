Item(by='twblalock', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603674408, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24891113, text='&gt; The sound insulation between flats on a converted office building must be nil.<p>A lot of the older buildings in SF just have 2x4 walls separating the apartments, with fiberglass insulation. It&#x27;s not very good at insulating sound either.<p>If the office conversions are done properly they will be better at sound insulation than much of the existing housing stock in SF.<p>The real question is, why bother renting in SF when any of the surrounding cities are cheaper? Most of the reasons to live in SF (restaurants, nightlife, cultural events) are shut down indefinitely, and commute distance isn&#x27;t relevant if you are working from home. Renters can get a lot more for their money in the East Bay or the Peninsula.')
