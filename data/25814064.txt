The app itself is very well done, but the rooms&#x2F;conversations are rarely interesting. There’s a lot of:<p>- random tech related discussions (cryptocurrency shilling; daily tech recaps)<p>- random life&#x2F;dating topics like “are you okay with your man cheating”<p>- money chasing rooms that feel scam&#x2F;spam-y (“entrepreneurs only $$$”, “how much do you want to be a millionaire”, etc)<p>Maybe it’s just my personality but the above, despite not being interesting to me, is also just not well suited for audio — who has time to listen to this for hours?<p>That said, I have seen glimpses of something more unique and compelling. Two of the more interesting rooms I have seen are:<p>- there was an article recently about a journalist who fell in love and started dating infamous pharma-bro Martin Shkreli. She was getting dunked on all day in twitter and showed up that night in Clubhouse and answered questions and explained the story from her own perspective<p>- Chesa, the SF DA that all of SF tech twitter seems to hate, was on a few nights ago debating some of these well known tech people about the crime situation in SF<p>Both of those were timely topics where you could instantly form a room&#x2F;discussion and have a more respectful conversation and dive deeper into what happened than you could on Twitter.<p>It will be interesting to see how the platform evolves as it continues to open up.')
