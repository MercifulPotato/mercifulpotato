Let me try again: Twitter was built on an open source foundation, changed the way people communicate forever, and created a huge amount of liquid value. Without open source things like Twitter probably would not have come into existence. Twitter has in turn contributed a lot of important open source software back into the community. Elasticsearch or redis, by contrast, enabled many of these cool new things to exist, but by themselves those excellent software components changed very few lives. If you made redis and tossed it out in the world with a ta da! very few people would care. I always felt that open source was an explicit recognition that we care about and attach value to the big ideas that change the world, and that by making the building blocks freely available we caused more of those big ideas to come to fruition. Now that the big ideas are perhaps a little harder to find we seem to want to attach a price tag to the parts again.')
