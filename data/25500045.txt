The average dev just looks at red&#x2F;green, logs, and emails but only interacts with the code--maybe they manually run a job. So you&#x27;re asking them to now author and modify things in Jenkins and I&#x27;m not even sure accounts and permissions were set up. So that&#x27;s why the dev group isn&#x27;t enthusiastic. Then you have sysadmins who otherwise have zero interest in Jenkins and aren&#x27;t familiar with it at all.<p>Jenkins is a very capable app, but it&#x27;s not &quot;light&quot; or approachable. Introducing it to new groups of people for an off-label purpose is a tough sell. If you&#x27;re already heavily using Jenkins and that same group of people need it for periodic task scheduling it&#x27;s an obvious choice.')
