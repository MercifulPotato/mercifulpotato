People have posted benchmarks of the A11&#x2F; A12&#x2F; A13 versus Intel for a while so this has been pretty obvious. It&#x27;s just surfacing because suddenly we have a desktop CPU with desktop software like compilers and other things where it&#x27;s more obvious outside of benchmark tools.<p>Apple is just jumping onto their existing ARM track, once they migrate their product line, which has surpassed Intel. Once they&#x27;ve migrated all their lines to ARM, the performance gains will be more like they have been on the iPhone&#x2F; iPad over the past few years. Mostly 20-30%&#x2F; year.')
