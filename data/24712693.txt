This country was founded by immigrants after all, and certainly more recent immigrants can bring in new innovations that can improve our current flawed institutions. Perhaps the next generation of labor unions can do better. To imagine that there is a &quot;context of America&quot; that is fixed and unchanging is to both deny the many cultural contributions that immigrants have brought to this country, and to deny that this country&#x27;s context is perpetually changing.')
