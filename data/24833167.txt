That&#x27;s called &quot;sterilizing&quot; immunity. Many vaccines simply prevent you from getting sick, but you can still catch and spread the disease. Where COVID-19 vaccines will fall on that range (it&#x27;s not a clear binary) isn&#x27;t yet known, and will likely depend on the type of vaccine. This is why the relatively dangerous (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.who.int&#x2F;csr&#x2F;don&#x2F;01-september-2020-polio-sudan&#x2F;en&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.who.int&#x2F;csr&#x2F;don&#x2F;01-september-2020-polio-sudan&#x2F;en...</a>) live-Polio vaccine is still being used in some areas: the safer options protect you, but don&#x27;t provide enough immunity to actually wipe out Polio entirely.<p>There&#x27;s also the issue that the fatality rate for the &lt;19 year age group is very low, about 0.003%(1), and even lower for the slightly older school aged crowd (approximately 0.001%(2), 1&#x2F;10,080 of the 85+ demographic). It&#x27;ll take time and large studies before we can actually prove that a vaccine is safer than COVID-19 for that age group. Note how a previous H1N1 vaccine turned out to cause serious narcolepsy in a minority of people: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;vaccinesafety&#x2F;concerns&#x2F;history&#x2F;narcolepsy-flu.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;vaccinesafety&#x2F;concerns&#x2F;history&#x2F;narcoleps...</a> There&#x27;s also the problem that you need enough people in the test to be exposed to COVID-19 naturally: vaccines can in some circumstances make infections <i>worse</i> - an issue that has made developing the closely related SARS vaccine hard - and you need large studies to detect that in cases like young people where the disease isn&#x27;t very deadly to begin with.<p>A safer option would be to provide vaccinations for adults working in schools, starting with those most at risk, and working down to least at risk as safety evidence builds up.<p>1) <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;coronavirus&#x2F;2019-ncov&#x2F;hcp&#x2F;planning-scenarios.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;coronavirus&#x2F;2019-ncov&#x2F;hcp&#x2F;planning-scena...</a>\n2) <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;coronavirus&#x2F;2019-ncov&#x2F;covid-data&#x2F;investigations-discovery&#x2F;hospitalization-death-by-age.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;coronavirus&#x2F;2019-ncov&#x2F;covid-data&#x2F;investi...</a>')
