I&#x27;m 6&#x27;, and I can only reach the tools that miraculously didn&#x27;t roll more than a foot from the side. All day, it&#x27;s constant climbing up on the tire or bumper. Sometimes something is close enough to reach by jumping and belly-flopping over the side. Give me an old Toyota mini pickup any day.<p>Misguided people will tell us that it&#x27;s all about 4WD, but you see the same phenomenon in 2WD trucks and besides it didn&#x27;t <i>used</i> to take so much clearance to add another differential under the engine and engines are smaller now anyway. The real reason is to sell pickups to people who don&#x27;t need pickups. If they worked for a living they&#x27;d get annoyed just like we are. They should have been sold lift kits instead.')
