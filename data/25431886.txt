Item(by='johncena33', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608050270, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25431369, text='&gt; Twitter on the other hand is just pure toxic garbage which seems made to intentionally divide people and incite hatred and eventually violence.<p>That&#x27;s also my impression. I mostly use FB for my neighborhood, hiking, biking, bird watching or any kind of nature related groups. It&#x27;s been mostly pleasant experience for me. I think you can use FB without lowering yourself in all that outrage and drama. It&#x27;s absolutely doable.<p>Twitter, OTOH, is a cesspool. I feel the whole platform was designed to congregate the worst of humanity and to bring out the worst in any decent person. It&#x27;s almost impossible to use Twitter without causing emotional harm to yourself or the others. I find it interesting that FB gets so much hate from media, but Twitter seems to be a media-darling.')
