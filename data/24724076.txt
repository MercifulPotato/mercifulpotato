I can see how that can make it confusing. I initially had the rows take up only as much space as the words, but ran into problems further down with positioning the common Show More button where one stream would run longer than the other because I currently load a fixed number of rows per stream. I then would have to detect how many rows are needed to fill up each stream and load the appropriate number. Got lazy and decided to skip the complexity for a weekend project!')
