It shocked me how much they smoke everywhere</i><p>This is history now. But I agree that it was very bad, it was part of Austria&#x27;s &quot;coffee house culture&quot; to have the stale smoke odour everywhere (furniture, curtains etc.). It was much worse in the 80&#x27;s and earlier though.<p>The sugar addiction is mainly due to the influence of bohemian cuisine and popular sweet snacks like &quot;Manner Schnitten&quot;.')
