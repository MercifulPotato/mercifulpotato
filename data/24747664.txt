A <i>lot</i> of the early &quot;high res&quot; displays got there by sacrificing video image quality.<p>That those monitors aren&#x27;t great for gaming is not surprising, it is also not surprising if that was the only monitor you&#x27;ve ever gamed on, when you saw gaming on a better image experience you would be impressed.<p>If you consider the amount of RAM and processing power you have to have <i>inside</i> the monitor at 4K resolution you start to understand why there is a thing like nVidia&#x27;s G-Sync technology. That is a lot of bits to throw around. Similarly, a monitor that processes the 4k video stream down to 1080p, and has 10 or even 12 bit dynamic range on the pixels with full motion emulation might give you a better looking display than a 4K display.<p>So many ways to optimize for particular markets.')
