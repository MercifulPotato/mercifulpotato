Security for those is also even more important, as you might want to restrict what entities you can attach to the entity you&#x27;re creating etc.<p>I guess the root of my question is how much business logic can you achieve with WunderGraph itself? It&#x27;s probably not something that&#x27;s necessary if I really think about it, if it just handles the authN and then passes tokens with claims nad user IDs to the data sources, Hasura&#x2F;Postgraphile et al can handle the row-specific authZ and business logic, and then WunderGraph can just be the BFF for each app client. I&#x27;d still definitely use it in that setup, as the generated clients and federation subscriptions would be a marked improvement over Apollo for me.')
