On the other hand, if the video is too ambitious, people will take it as a norm and will base their expectations on the video. If the real product doesn’t match the video afterward, they will probably be unsatisfied because the product is incomplete.<p>&gt; This thing happened to me when I had a call with a user during beta testing. She expected that the complete product should work as it was on the video.<p>On one hand, it&#x27;s nice to be able to gauge the interest of something before going ahead and building it, but it is borderline fraud if you show something that is not the real thing, and launch something that doesn&#x27;t work the same way. That&#x27;s just selling smoke and mirrors.')
