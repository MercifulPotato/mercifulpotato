After Vietnam, the US just didn&#x27;t do &quot;War&quot; in a classical sense, with only a few and short-lived exceptions.<p>Our all volunteer force does war, but it&#x27;s now known as &quot;targeted killing,&quot; &quot;combat advisory,&quot; and other buzzwords. This is because if we want to actually <i>do</i> war, we have to ask Congress, the American public, etc, and actually face down the moral questions inherent to that process. The last few times we actually had to do that it was plainly disastrous.<p>As you say, this method of doing video game wars has a way of making smaller, more automated &quot;enforcement actions&quot; a more or less permanent state of affairs. I believe the start of this was Vietnam. As a result, strange things happen. I remember the public&#x27;s reaction to ISIS -- it was pretty much complete bewilderment. &quot;Why the hell do these guys hate us so much?&quot;')
