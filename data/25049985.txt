Anecdotally, none of the 20 or so people I know who&#x27;ve gotten COVID and lost their taste&#x2F;smell didn&#x27;t recover their taste&#x2F;smell within 2-7 days. The percentage of people who don&#x27;t recover taste&#x2F;smell seem to be an extremely tiny minority. Using the term &quot;lots of&quot; implies it is commonplace and is extremely disingenuous unless you have some data to justify that level of frequency.')
