Item(by='glogla', descendants=None, kids=[25756290], score=None, time=1610489866, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25754384, text='&quot;Criminalizing unpopular speech&quot; is a peculiar way to answer to &quot;some speech might be harmful&quot;.<p>Is sharing someone else&#x27;s private information, publishing outright lies about safety of vaccines, or claiming some ethnicities or nationalities are subhuman and should be murdered right now &quot;unpopular speech&quot;?<p>I mean, I sure as hell hope it is unpopular!<p>But it is much more than just &quot;unpopular speech&quot;. Framing it like &quot;criminalizing unpopular speech&quot; makes it sound like someone wants to criminalize saying &quot;I think the Twilight series were genuinely good movies.&quot; but we&#x27;re talking about people saying &quot;All those &lt;insert slur&gt; should be killed.&quot;<p>And yet, you are right that in some cases this happens - for example when some US states decided to solve problem of people complaining about animal cruelty by making filming on farms illegal. That&#x27;s a complete bullshit and it is harmful to the society.<p>But people who incite violence and Antivaxxers who actively hurt people by spreading diseases? I don&#x27;t think so.')
