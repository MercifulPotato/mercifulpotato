People on H1B are few and hired to delegate across time zones. It&#x27;s hard without someone in the US connecting the bridge. This pandemic made it clear.<p>It&#x27;s a possibility that this new policy has very little implication on the overall budget of projects.. unless the companies are financially strong enough to hire local employees at a high salary. When compared to an employee salary in a developing economy, local salaries look very high!<p>Smaller and mid-sized non-tech companies are hurt during this pandemic. These IT consulting companies work mostly with non-tech companies. Fiscal policy this year has failed to &quot;really&quot; provide loans or stimulus to small struggling companies. They all want tech and that means more work will go to these IT companies that can do at a lower cost.<p>International trade is done on the mutual-benefits equation. Historically the unwritten understanding is that India allows US companies to operate in its local market in return partly for labor market access to its people through a work visa. That these workers are not creating value is a myth looking at the financials of these IT consulting firms. Getting a grocery purchase order database implemented correctly has far more immediate influence than the work of a futuristic researcher.<p>Overall this new policy looks like an election stunt to appease a certain electoral audience given its timing and lackluster fiscal policy.<p>That&#x27;s called election hacking.<p>Every economy specializes, influences international trade to that end. It&#x27;s cheaper to manufacture in China, buy corn from the US, write computer programs in India. I feel just so sick to read comments here calling these companies bodyshops, sweatshops, cheap labor.. whatever word degrading in the context.<p>The right question is perhaps: how to help create locally employed IT consulting companies that can compete with Indian IT consulting companies... and the answer is more than bad-mouthing or volatile short-term regulations. Is it even in the country&#x27;s interest to spend resources to become a leader in IT consulting?')
