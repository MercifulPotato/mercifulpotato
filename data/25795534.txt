The licensing was expensive (order of six figures) and was really only necessary for LDAP integration.  Features like timelion were cool, but definitely not worth the price tag.<p>I migrated to an AWS-managed solution to for two reasons: 1) to alleviate the burden of managing a cluster, 2) get away from the onerous costs associated with licensing.  Even thought it was more expensive to run a managed cluster, since, at the time, AWS limited the disk space per node.  The cost savings was significant enough to warrant migration.<p>I realize that Elastic.co offers their own managed solution.  But the version on AWS was an easier sell to management due to known costs and not having to deal with sales people.<p>I think a lot of OSS is having difficulty transitioning to a cloud-first model.  The people making choices on tech stacks want to spend less time dealing with infrastructure and more time developing stuff.  And this model of charging high licensing fees for &quot;enterprise&quot; features feels antiquated, and provides a large attack service for companies like AWS.  What enterprise engineers really want are AMIs, or better yet, fully managed cloud interfaces, to bring up and manage OSS deployments.  Something that lets us focus on the products we sell; not the ones we buy.<p>I believe that we need to rethink how OSS is delivered and how to make money from it.  &quot;Enterprise&quot; support looks a lot different not than it did when Redhat was founded, yet the OSS business model remains eerily similar.')
