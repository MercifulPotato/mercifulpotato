It&#x27;s hard to communicate to people this need for coworking and co-presence. I&#x27;ve tried over the years to ask for always-on remote presence tools -- always-on video or audio. Some people seem to think of these as micromanage-y employer-driven tech, but it truly helps me stay motivated and reduces anxiety&#x2F;depression. Like I don&#x27;t want anyone&#x27;s explicit help or project management (though check-ins on one another are nice imho), but just your conscious human presence. I&#x27;m incredibly distraction-prone, but working in service of the humans around me is what helps keeps me in check.<p>If you&#x27;re also energized by support tickets, I&#x27;d venture a guess that The Helper is a high type for you too, if you were to do the Enneagram personality test :) <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.enneagraminstitute.com&#x2F;type-2" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.enneagraminstitute.com&#x2F;type-2</a>')
