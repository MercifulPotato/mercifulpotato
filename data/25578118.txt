Item(by='geoffeg', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609298880, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25569619, text='A few things I&#x27;ve been considering for the last few years. These are just brainstorming thoughts, so I definitely haven&#x27;t thought these ideas through.\n* Why do editors allow us to write invalid code? Most editors know the syntax of the language, many embed (or connect to) the language runtime. If the editor knows a file is going to be invalid, why allow it to be saved (allow the user to force the save, of course).\n* Why are editors still showing us entire files instead of functions? I usually edit code by looking at functions and how they relate to other functions. Why not show a function at a time and allow you to bring up multiple functions at a time to edit, regardless of which file it&#x27;s in?<p>Light Table (<a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;lighttable.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;lighttable.com&#x2F;</a>) started down the path of what I was thinking, especially with the continual&#x2F;inline code evaluation.<p>Once again, these are primarily just thoughts I&#x27;ve been considering. I haven&#x27;t found a good outlet for discussing my ideas, everyone I discuss them with seems to respond that &quot;that&#x27;s the way things are&quot; or &quot;that sounds complicated&quot;. I&#x27;ve been considering writing a little editor proof of concept to explore some of these thoughts.')
