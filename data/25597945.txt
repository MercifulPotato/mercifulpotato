Item(by='eesmith', descendants=None, kids=[25598453], score=None, time=1609453977, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25597353, text='&gt; Science is better served when such papers are published<p>Your argument is so broad that you will insist that flat-earth, young-earth creationists (&quot;YEC&quot;s), and other crack-pot pseudosciences be accepted as if they were serious and reasonable.<p>Where should a YEC get to publish their papers? If the paper isn&#x27;t accepted (because it&#x27;s contrary to all evidence and has no strong evidence to support it), do you call that decision &quot;censorship&quot;? In 100 years do you expect that we might discover the YECs are right?<p>And yes, people are &quot;afraid&quot; now to do YEC studies because of the effects of being laughed at for crackpot science and denied funding.<p>Thing is, when YECs manage to get something published (sometimes by subterfuge), yes, there are articles debunking them. But <i>that doesn&#x27;t matter</i> because YECs use the publication itself as evidence that their ideas are accepted as scientific. Their goal is to be treated as an equal (&quot;teach the controversy&quot;), not do good science, and their real audience isn&#x27;t the scientific readership.<p>We see that as well with &quot;bell curve arguments about some races being less intellectually capable than others&quot;, where the goal is not to be intellectually honest (See Shaun&#x27;s video essay at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=UBc7qBS1Ujo" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=UBc7qBS1Ujo</a> which goes deep into some of the dishonesty) but to provide a veneer of scientific-ness to justify racist policy decisions.<p>Thing is, we <i>do</i> allow contrary views to be published. But <i>they have to be supported by evidence</i>. And the evidence that (for example) &quot;women can&#x27;t do science&quot; <i>isn&#x27;t there</i>.')
