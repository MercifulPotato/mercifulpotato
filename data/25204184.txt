Item(by='redelbee', descendants=None, kids=[25204628, 25204525], score=None, time=1606260004, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25203534, text='This is neat and makes me want to take a router to my existing standing desk to organize cables in a similar fashion.<p>That said I think a focus on the entire desk might be a difficult sell. I’m not going to replace my existing desk with this. I’m not even sure if I would go for this if I was in the market for a desk unless I could customize it in some way (or at least choose from multiple configurations depending on my needs). It looks like that’s included in your future planning, so congrats.<p>You know what I would buy immediately? A well-designed standing&#x2F;convertible desk that makes a modern design statement. I don’t like the extremely utilitarian look of all the standing desk options I’ve seen. Give me the 2020 version of the Steelcase (or numerous other manufacturers) tanker desk and I will buy in a heartbeat. Those tankers are utilitarian and stylish. I would probably own one already if they didn’t weigh half a ton.')
