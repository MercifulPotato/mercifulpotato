Item(by='godelski', descendants=None, kids=[25492681], score=None, time=1608531598, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25492449, text='I appreciate the defense but you probably shouldn&#x27;t argue with them. I&#x27;m guessing they are trolling or egocentric (not a meaningful difference). I mean they are supposing that one cannot be both a scientist and a philosopher at the same time, which illustrates quite a naive viewpoint of what science actually is (there&#x27;s a reason physics was called natural philosophy). Such a notion is a bit ludicrous and so I didn&#x27;t even want to give it merit by acknowledging the insanity of it.<p>And I mean come on, they said &quot;machine learning is just bio-mimicry big whoop&quot; and I responded &quot;yeah, that&#x27;s kinda the point&quot;[0] because clearly they don&#x27;t understand the bio-inspiration of ML and its history, which is a bit obtuse considering we call them &quot;neural networks.&quot; And that&#x27;s without even looking at things like dropout (inspired by sex), genetic programming (sex again), or exploration&#x2F;exploitation strategies (which are directly related to play). Just let them ride their imaginary high horse. But I do have to give them props for the strangest insult I&#x27;ve gotten all year.<p>[0] It would be very naive to actually say that ML is bio-mimicry. It has a lot of bio-inspiration but does things vastly differently than what biology actually does. But one cannot ignore the inspiration despite the implementation being vastly different.')
