I think your objection is with flash card systems and I donâ€™t disagree with your assessment.<p>I think of Spaced Repetition more generally. A paper based Zettelkasten system can be enhanced with a paper based review scheduling system; say 43 folders as described by David Allen in <i>Getting Things Done</i> with a simple SuperMemo algorithm for interval spacing.<p>When we gain good recall of Zettelkasten structure&#x2F;content I suspect that we inadvertently mimic Spaced Repetition.
