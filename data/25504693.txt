The impression was that the US was now at war, and then I watched the TV and saw the second tower getting struck. I could hear jets getting scrambled over DC since I lived (and now live again) in the DC area. It was wild.<p>EDIT: Later, I worked at Goldman Sachs and when I did a project in Asset Management, my working station was on the 33th floor overlooking where the Freedom Tower now stands, and I could see the outlines of the Twin Towers. Super eerie.')
