As soon as you start being an infrastructure service provider that means you HAVE to offer an LTSB branch of your OS, and Apple does not want to do that (and macOS has stagnated a lot since Apple devoted most of their OS engineering efforts to iOS). Apple doesn&#x27;t offer a &quot;real&quot; server OS SKU at all (the &quot;macOS Server&quot; app package is for SOHO management, not for use as a high-availability application server OS).<p>...which means that Apple would have to provide an offering using Linux or BSD - such as a &quot;naked&quot; Darwin distro - but again, Apple does not want to have to support that, and I&#x27;m sure devs don&#x27;t want to see the IaaS OS scene fragment further, and Darwin is far, far removed from being yet another Linux distro.<p>Amazon offers ARM cloud systems - why should Apple risk their profitability by competing in an arena that doesn&#x27;t pose any risk to their bottom-line? And what do they have to gain?')
