If you complete a series like the OA, you have a decently regarded show in your catalog forever, and your large catalog can attract people even if they don&#x27;t immediately watch any one particular show. The current approach may or may not create more big hits in the short run (it doesn&#x27;t seem to have a ton of success on that front so far). In the long run, though, it&#x27;s going to lead to a smaller number of evergreen shows in the Netflix catalog.')
