Especially  since,  by the time we&#x27;re optimising heavily,  it generally assumes something was amiss in your original coding or expectations of the system anyway,  so your memorised numbers of what performance should be are often shown to be wrong in the first place, and your real world measurements will tell you the numbers that are relevant to your particular use case.')
