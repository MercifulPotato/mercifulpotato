That Robespierre was not like &quot;good guy&quot; or that French Revolution is actually completely complicated event with many fighting parties was completely unsaid.<p>There was French Revolution and then was the freedom and happiness, basically.<p>&gt; is there a good aristocracy<p>I think that feudalism is fundamentally bad. But, I think that answer to this question is yes, there are non-evil aristocrats. Aristocracy is class you get born into, set of duties and privileges. Aristocracy holds power and have interests opposed to those who live under them. The image where all individuals belonging to that group are basically ugly and evil is not correct. It is not like all the the tortured and executed aristocrats deserved that.<p>And then there is question of huge amount of non-aristocratic victims of revolution which went completely unmentioned in our version of history.')
