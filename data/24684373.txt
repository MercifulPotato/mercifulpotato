The car has a ton of sensors recording all kinds of data, and they have a rig that can use that data to essentially put the car into the physical condition at any millisecond of a previous race, i.e. wheel and tire position, precise suspension loads, etc.. so they can physically examine the car&#x2F;tires&#x2F;etc.. at any moment in reply of the whole race.  Extremely cool stuff!')
