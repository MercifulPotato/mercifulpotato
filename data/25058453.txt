These machines will sell mostly to everyday folks who just use a handful of common apps - I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if Safari is the #1 app used on these machines.  That gives Apple a start to this transition, without the reputational hit that might have occurred if they sold a bunch of machines to power users right away.  We&#x27;ll whine a little bit that the machines weren&#x27;t what we wanted, and then we&#x27;ll just wait for the M1X machines.  But that&#x27;s better than if we all bought M1X MacBook Pros yesterday and then were disappointed when a couple of crucial apps didn&#x27;t work yet.  This &quot;flattens the curve&quot; of application incompatibility reports if you will.')
