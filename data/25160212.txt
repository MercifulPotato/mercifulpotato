Item(by='joshuaissac', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605878764, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25159207, text='I agree with the author on adding ligatures where they are not needed, but one of the comments used in their justification is not quite right:<p>&gt; Unicode [...] identifies each character uniquely. This way, software programs donâ€™t have to worry that things like the fi ligature might be stashed in some special place in the font. Instead, Unicode designates a unique name and number for each character, known as a code point. If you have an fi ligature in your font, you identify it with its designated Unicode code point, which is 0xFB01.<p>This is true for the Roman script, but for many other scripts, Unicode does not provide dedicated code points for common ligatures. They would instead have to be denoted by two characters with a zero-width joiner in the middle (much like emojis).')
