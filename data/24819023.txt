It is still a good ressource though, but it&#x27;s worthwhile to read comments.<p>1 - I&#x27;m actually surprised about that, it&#x27;s working much better on Linux than when i had windows where it was really often a &quot;crossing fingers experience&quot;. Granted, i haven&#x27;t used windows for years, so i hope it&#x27;s in a better state now.\n2 - i had some suttering when i was using the llvm backend for shaders (i have an amd gpu). Since i switched to ACO (which is the default in mesa now) i just have one games with suttering, Heavy Rain.\n3 - The only crashing game i had was C&amp;C, it seems it was more an actual bug of the game, it was fixed after the game was updated, not proton.\n4 - don&#x27;t use discord so can&#x27;t comment there.<p>I&#x27;ve finished quite a few games using proton&#x2F;wine and what you describe is definitely not a generality at all (appart from discord which i don&#x27;t use, so can&#x27;t comment).')
