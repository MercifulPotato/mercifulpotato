Item(by='skinnyhippo', descendants=3, kids=[25858964, 25858384], score=2, time=1611234084, title='Ask HN: How to shift left from an ops career?', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='As a seasoned technologist with more than a decade working professionally in various roles, from tech support to linux sys admin, networking etc, couple of years back I switched to a domain I wanted to work in for a while (sre&#x2F;infra&#x2F;devops). The start was hard, a lot of it was new to me (ansible, terraform, etc.) I had to study during the evenings&#x2F;weekends to keep from drowing at day job.<p>At this point it is obvious that my software engineering&#x2F;dev skills need love. I can comfortably write scripts (python&#x2F;bash) that log&#x2F;process data or say call an api, do some processing, post to another api etc. Anything beyond basic functional programming (100~200 loc scripts) where there is a ton being done with classes&#x2F;decorators&#x2F;libraries starts becoming overwhelming. Reading someone else&#x27;s code is just daunting. I&#x27;ve tried courses on various sites but feel they only teach you loops, conditionals, basic data types or a framework but not the process of creating great software.<p>I recognize that I need practice, lots of it. My day job barely involves any day to day coding (unless you count terraform). How do I as a technologist become a better software engineer? I am currently writing a CRUD backend (FastAPI&#x2F;peewee&#x2F;sqlite) for a practice personal project and realize how much there is for me to learn in terms of modeling data, schemas, translating SQL to code etc. It gets frustating at times.<p>What would you advice me to scale my software engineering skills, build good habits, do things the right way and be proud of putting my name on a piece of code. My goal isn&#x27;t to be a day job software engineer but be better at what I am doing as I really enjoy the devops world. Since most of my other hobbies are on hold due to covid, I can comfortably spare 10 hours a week for the next 6~12 months in the pursuit of this goal.<p>Books, courses, PhD, OSS contributions???')
