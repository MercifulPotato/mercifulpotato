That’s the magic! Whether you think this is good or bad is for debate, but there are apps in every country where you can buy and hold bitcoin (even countries like Nigeria and Venezuela) and it doesn’t take that many people who value it globally to make BTC shoot up in price. If even 1 out of 1000 people on earth desired bitcoin, its value would go up and sustain it. So it doesn’t matter if 999 people dislike it - bitcoin (and crypto) is a niche that can grow much larger without much additional enthusiasm. And the fact it’s worth so much blows people’s minds, making it like a global phenomenon that markets itself every time it goes up.<p>No one makes you buy bitcoin! If you don’t like it, just ignore it. I could list many more arguments here as to why different sorts of people value it, from libertarians to drug dealers to hedge funds to people in countries that have terrible fiat currencies and corrupt central banks, but ultimately it’s a variation of the government not having control.<p>One final thought is that the term “currency” confuses a lot of people. Whether it can actually be used like a dollar is moot - it’s an asset that can be used sometimes like a currency, but being a true currency is not required for utility and value. It’s a misnomer.')
