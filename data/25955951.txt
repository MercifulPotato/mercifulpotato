Item(by='jozvolskyef', descendants=None, kids=[25956006], score=None, time=1611916467, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25955665, text='I set up a revolut account for currency exchange in 2018 and finally moved to use them as my primary bank in 2020. Never had any significant issues. Recently I was setting up a Revolut Business account and I didn&#x27;t get a notification email requesting additional evidence. Me not getting an email is something they could improve, but the need for a thorough identity verification is understandable given their global ambitions.<p>Edit: I&#x27;d like to add that revolut was very helpful after most of my valuables were stolen in 2019. While my other bank took three weeks to deliver a new debit card, a virtual card issued by revolut worked immediately via NFC.')
