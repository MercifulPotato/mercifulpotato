Item(by='epc', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606693990, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25248335, text='I go to <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;timeswire" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;timeswire</a>, skim the top 10-20 article blurbs and open 5-7 in tabs.  I never read every article in the paper. I skim news (not just NYT: WSJ, FT, Guardian, some local papers) twice a day.  Most news articles are written in inverted funnel format so I read the first couple of paragraphs and decide whether or not to read the rest of the article.')
