What I don&#x27;t get: if tailwind provides all the preprocessor parts, why do people need to put the class definitions as part of the HTML?<p>I would completely get behind tailwind if it was only the SASS part. Give me a bunch of mixins and consistent variable naming, which I could just `@import` into a sass file where I get the definitions for UI elements, widgets, etc... the whole &quot;Design system&quot; if that is the word kids use these days.<p>All of that can (and <i>should</i> if you actually paid attention at the CSS Zen Garden) stay outside of the HTML. So why when I go to any introduction to Tailwind it still shows all that <i>&lt;div class=&quot;size-foo color-blah rounded-baz&quot;&gt;</i> code, I get major WTFs on my head and then I just go back to my simple SASS-based workflow.<p>What I&#x27;d like to see in the next generation of CSS frameworks would be for it to be able to take a completely classless HTML document (like CSS Zen Garden, modernized to HTML5?) and have it look like 3 or 4 different design systems <i>without touching the HTML</i>. Or for extra points, take a web application like webapp (web version of winamp) and show how you can make completely different skins just be redefining the base types and the color palette.')
