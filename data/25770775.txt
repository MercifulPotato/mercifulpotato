Item(by='LudwigNagasena', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610589034, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25769926, text='&gt; Maybe my naivete but it seems that online discussions are much less nuanced compared to face to face discussions we had when growing up.<p>How often did you talk with complete strangers about politics when you were growing up? Are you now having more intense discussion with your relatives? Do you think it is can be attributed to Facebook?<p>&gt; Do you have any recommendation on how to lessen this gap? I live in a major metropolis. But I keep getting a feeling that such a widening chasm can not be good for the society.<p>Uniform education with officially supported views on main topics will bridge the gap and, also anti free speech laws. Neither European countries nor China have such divergence of opinions. All of them police speech and ban certain viewpoints. Of course people from different stratas of society will always have different opinions: small business owners, industrial workers, intelligentsia, government workers, non-working people all have different interests. But common national viewpoints keep the fabric of society intact.')
