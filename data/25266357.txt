What does crafting in mechanical engineering look like? In physics? In computer science? What is it specifically that you want to be able to craft? Whatever it is, it might even incorporate elements of one, two, or all three of the subjects you mentioned.<p>The first carpenters didn&#x27;t say, &quot;I&#x27;d like to become a master of carpentry&quot;, no, they probably said something more like &quot;I want to build a workbench&quot;. Ok, how do you learn to build a workbench? By building workbenches. Then you build a cabinet. Then you build a house. You do this for years - now you&#x27;re a master.<p>You want to make a house? Go apprentice with the carpenter. You want to make a wind farm? Go apprentice with the mechanical engineer. You want to make money in finance as a quant? Go apprentice with the physicist.')
