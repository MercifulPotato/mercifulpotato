Ideally what I want is something that would do the following; allow the creation of a new FAT-32 image file of a specified length given a target directory.<p>The program (or programs&#x2F;scripts) must be command line driven and run under both Windows and Linux (so they can be integrated into our build system).<p>The use case is the following; the creation of a single binary image containing some firmware and a (per-unit) custom FAT-32 partition, both of which would effectively concatenated together.<p>Does anyone have any ideas?
