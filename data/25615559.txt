But it appears they can&#x27;t.<p>I think the point is they literally <i>can&#x27;t</i> improve Facebook&#x27;s behavior because their behavior <i>is</i> their business. They don&#x27;t have any products that can function without their panopticon and Skinner boxes.<p>It&#x27;s not that they can&#x27;t <i>compete</i> by changing their behavior but cease to be a viable business that can even operate.')
