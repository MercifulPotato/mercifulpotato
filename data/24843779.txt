Item(by='mauvehaus', descendants=None, kids=[24843970, 24843803], score=None, time=1603240507, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24843444, text='Typical residential service in the US is 240v single phase. The transformer on the pole is putting out 240v, but there&#x27;s a center tap on the transformer that&#x27;s bonded to ground. That&#x27;s your neutral. The other two legs are essentially +120v and -120v relative to ground&#x2F;neutral. Your dryer hooks up to both legs and sees the full 240v. Don&#x27;t ask me how grounding works for 240v appliances. I have no idea.<p>I am not an electrician or EE. I just spent a bunch of time looking into this when I got my 240v table saw and had to hook it up to something.<p>As proof that I&#x27;m not totally bullshitting you: until recently our house had a 120v outlet on a 240v breaker for a baseboard radiator. The electrician was here to fix an unrelated issue, and rejiggered things in the panel to hook it up to a 120v breaker.<p>As far as I understand it (not very) there is no such thing as two-phase power.')
