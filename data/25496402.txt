Removing them will hurt about about a generation of students from the very low to the upper middle class set until the academic&lt;&gt;employment market adjusts. What do I mean?<p>A simple, pragmatic fact is degree from a name-school, vs. a no-name school, is a differentiator to a student who knows what they&#x27;re doing. This is especially true with grad schools where it&#x27;s professionally-focused on the outcome. NYU Law vs. CUNY Law. UMass Dartmouth CS vs. BU CS. You&#x27;re buying a network and a door opener with the latter. One resume gets you an informational interview, a priv&#x27;d coop&#x2F;internship, an alumni network and so on, and the other has an uphill battle. For many underpriv&#x27;d students, that network-buy is life changing. I wish it wasn&#x27;t the case, but pretending that it isn&#x27;t is damaging. This is just the way of things at the moment.<p>By getting rid of fed-sub&#x27;d loans, you:\n- take away motive-neutral funding route for your cheap but no-name undergrad -&gt; good grad school -&gt; good new career \n- open only profit-motive funding routes from private loan companies, which.... this never works out well for consumers. \n- open this priv&#x27;d route of good schools to increasingly only the elite.<p>I&#x27;d agree with the point that a cheap state school for undergrad, a &quot;known&quot; school for grad school funded by however one can get it funded makes more financial&lt;&gt;career sense, but that nuance didn&#x27;t exist in your argument.')
