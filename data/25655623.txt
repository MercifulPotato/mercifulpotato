Everyone tries that first, and it didn&#x27;t worked. You&#x27;re stuck with the fiber AP in a corner of your home, and you&#x27;re not going to place your WiFi AP as your dinner table&#x27;s center piece. And reinstalling APs is far more expensive than adding a repeater.<p>I mean, are you aware that a WiFi repeater nowadays goes for less than 20$? You order it, get it immediately delivered to your home, plug it in, press a button. Bam. Problem solved. No recabling, no technician, no appointment, no wasted afternoon. nothing. And you don&#x27;t have to go through the WiFi seance session whenever you move your laptop. Just plug in the repeater and you&#x27;re done.')
