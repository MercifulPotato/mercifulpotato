You have small, untraceable actors launching both ad-hoc and privateer-style attacks on large national and corporate entities.<p>Everything you suggested seems valid, and as you pointed out both the carrot and the stick are needed. The European powers enlarged their navies to absorb the surplus of unemployed sailors and used the enlarged navies to hunt the remaining pirates. British naval dominance (followed by American naval dominance) is what makes naval piracy comparatively rare today. I reckon a similar strategy would work digitally (put the best talent in golden handcuffs and hunt down the rest), but I&#x27;m not sure anyone has the resources, political will and the national interest right now.')
