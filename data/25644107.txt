Others are lucky to have a hut or some such structure.<p>Not lucky, in fact it is the norm for them to have a dwelling. Adobe&#x2F;mud or some other local construction technique.<p>&gt; In the developing world (and heck, in Southern Europe and the Balkans too, as recently as the 60s-70s) farmers used to live, whole family (extended one at that) in ~ 500 sq ft houses...
