Until recently, I did. Mainly because of the ease of local organization for political causes I prefer. I&#x27;ve seen many leftist groups get banned. Many leftist users thrown into &quot;Facebook Jail&quot; routinely. Often over the most trivial of reasons. No to mention how the algorithms de-prioritize lefty and liberal sources in favor of conservative ones.<p>It&#x27;s darkly funny to me at this point how the &quot;CENSORSHIP!!&quot; crowd has completely ignored the routine purges of leftist voices on Facebook. Sure, the centrist liberal and the slightly left of center voices have survived. But get even a little further to the left and it&#x27;s a crap shoot in terms of their long term survival on the platform.<p>Meanwhile, conservative circles are thriving on Facebook. Conservative sources are among the most popular on the site. I honestly don&#x27;t know how much more you want from Facebook when they go out of their way to make conservative groups feel at home. Even to the point of adjusting their engine to point users to conservative pages, as has been widely reported.')
