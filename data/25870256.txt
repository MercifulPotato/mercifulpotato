They got a lot of free PR out of it with little risk, that&#x27;s why they did it.<p>As I said at the time, I wouldn&#x27;t want to litigate on either side of this case. The law is badly drafted, there&#x27;s little precedent, and I think it&#x27;s a genuine 50&#x2F;50. Any lawyer on both sides would advise you not to do so. I suspect the main reason is that the RIAA can now go back to Google and say they are in breach of contract for not preventing downloads on YouTube using technical protection measures, and push them to switch to Widevine on everything with any music in it.')
