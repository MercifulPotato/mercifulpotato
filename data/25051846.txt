A consistent, recognizable image can go a long way from transforming a faceless internet post into something closer to a person you recognize and would hesitate to harm. With enough time and exposure, usernames can work for this (everyone recognizes when tptacek, or moxie, or you post), but avatars supercharge it. People hate changes to the site UX, so maybe put it behind a profile option that&#x27;s defaulted to &#x27;off&#x27; - then, only people who care about seeing them do. Of course, this would increase the moderation burden - people using offensive avatars, etc, but I think it could help.<p>- Heads on pikes. A weekly&#x2F;monthly&#x2F;ongoing&#x2F;whatever roundup of notable bad actions which people have been moderated for. This should be limited to interesting and informative cases - not spam, piracy, CSAM, etc, but legitimate humans engaging in bad-faith actions, flame wars, etc. Having negative examples to avoid can help a community understand what is and isn&#x27;t appropriate in a more concrete way than a dry set of rules. And seeing people be punished for violating those rules in a public way can have a deterrent effect. Making these public works better than just downvotes, because downvotes ultimately end up hiding content.<p>- Exemplars on pedestals. The obvious counterpart to negative examples is positive examples. In a way, the upvote system already does something like this, but it&#x27;s not the same as officially-sanctioned recognition from the staff. A very simple approach might be to give you &#x2F; other staff members (maybe even high karma users&#x2F;yc founders) a button on each comment that highlights it as a positive example worth emulating - maybe changing the text color in css of the username&#x2F;time stamp to show that it&#x27;s been recognized.')
