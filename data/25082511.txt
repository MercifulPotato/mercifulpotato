People have all kinds of preferences for employment that go into determining a market-clearing wage.<p>e.g. it is probably the case that loading garbage onto a truck doesn&#x27;t require more skill&#x2F;specialization than driving a car for hire<p>However, the overwhelmingly vast amount of people prefer to do the job that they can do while sitting down, in an air-conditioned vehicle, vs. the one they have to do surrounded by stinking detritus, outside in all weathers.<p>Based on my own prejudices, driving a car for hire sits in a relative sweet-spot of low skill, low physical demand, low discomfort. I agree there are undoubtedly personal safety factors that you&#x27;re more exposed to than, say, flipping burgers at McDonalds.')
