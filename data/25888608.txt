The day&#x2F;night cycle was unforgiving.<p>I started it again a few weeks ago when 1.5 came out. This time I&#x27;m using mods. I usually avoid mods because it feels like cheating, it doesn&#x27;t feel like an accomplishment to succeed at an arbitrarily modified version of a game.<p>But since this game isn&#x27;t competitive, and mods make the difference between having a game to enjoy and skipping it altogether, I have no problem with mods. There&#x27;s one that lets you pause&#x2F;unpause the day so it can be as long as you want.')
