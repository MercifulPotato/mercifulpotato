Also it says that the victim got out of the car after a distraction, even though he was traveling in a bulletproof car with an armed escort.<p>This is a very rookie mistake for a senior official who was in enough of a threat to travel around with an escort of armed guards!<p>I &#x27;d be very hesitant to believe that story without independent confirmation from other sources.<p>P.S. Some twitter replies, on the original twitter thread [0] even questioned the validity of the source but I don&#x27;t know enough about it (Fars news) to evaluate those claims. Putting this out here for the HN crowd to weigh in.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;BarakRavid&#x2F;status&#x2F;1333080696282288128" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;BarakRavid&#x2F;status&#x2F;1333080696282288128</a>')
