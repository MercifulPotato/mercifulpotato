Best way I&#x27;ve found to do that is to hold very closely the tangible evidence that you are good at getting things done. Then interview a lot until you find something.<p>See, there&#x27;s a couple of things to remember. First, the biggest way to sell yourself in an interview is to demonstrate confidence. Not bluster, but gentle self-assured comfort in the face of being interviewed. The ability to answer questions you do know, and to say &quot;I don&#x27;t know. But I think I&#x27;d....&quot; or similar  in the face of things you don&#x27;t. Even if that&#x27;s to say &quot;I&#x27;d have to Google that&quot;.<p>Second, the actual interview...yeah, you might get turned down at a FAANG. But I&#x27;ve had plenty of interviews that were far less algorithmic. Far more concerned with whether i could speak intelligently about things I&#x27;d done previously. Even coding; I&#x27;ve had the algorithmic questions...I&#x27;ve also had really simple toy functions that were there just to make sure I could write some code, and formed all of 10-20 minutes of the hour long interview.<p>The way to get better for both of those is practice. Literal sitting in an interview practice. The more you interview the less you care about any given one, and the more likely you&#x27;ll stay calm and collected. That exudes confidence, makes you more likeable, and lets you put your best foot forward when it comes to any coding problems.')
