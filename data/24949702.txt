Your body says you&#x27;re actively dying but your conscious brain can - must - override it and let the pain flow freely. You observe it, rather than obstruct it.<p>I have been doing this my entire life to every injury I have ever had, from small to big. As soon as something started to hurt me I did that movement so much until the pain vanished. I never let my body rust.
