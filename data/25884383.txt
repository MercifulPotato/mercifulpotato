There are summer blends, winter blends, geographical blends within the seasonal changes, varying levels and types of oxygenates (not just ethanol) and when tanks are switched over a mixture of &quot;in between&quot;. The pump labeling is accurate for octane, and in some parts of the world, the maximum percentage of ethanol. It doesn&#x27;t tell you everything you need to know to make &quot;pump gas&quot; fit-for-purpose for aviation and it&#x27;s not just about octane and ethanol. We need to control a wider range of fuel properties for aviation. Your equipment, your life and the lives of your passengers depend on it. Let&#x27;s walk through exactly what Lycoming did in authorizing automotive gasoline - &quot;mogas&quot; - for our engines. It&#x27;s also suggested that you read Section B of the latest revision to Lycoming Service Instruction 1070 - and read it carefully.</i><p>* <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lycoming.com&#x2F;content&#x2F;unleaded-fuels-part-2" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lycoming.com&#x2F;content&#x2F;unleaded-fuels-part-2</a>')
