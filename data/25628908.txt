I have had two previous Mac Mini&#x27;s (and one is actually still operational 24&#x2F;7, despite being 12 years old). Such a brilliant little machine, and much better value than say an iMac as there are tons of good screens out there. I am wondering though whether it supports dual 4k screens at 60Hz. I don&#x27;t think HDMI can do that, so it would have to be DisplayPort.')
