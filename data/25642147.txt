You sign up for online banking. You use your GMail account as your e-mail address. You get banking statements in your e-mail, you can reset your password to the bank with that e-mail address, etc.<p>Now, a scammer is trying to access your e-mail account. What level of proof do you want them to have to offer Google to get ahold of that e-mail?<p>These tech companies are not asking for an &quot;unreasonable view&quot; into your life as long as people are using these products to interact with the real world. They are trying to strike a balance between convenience and security that meets real-world needs. And they are trying to set that balance point somewhere where it works reasonably for the majority of their non-technical users, not for the edge-cases and not for people who think LARPing as a 90&#x27;s cyberpunk novel is the most important usecase. So, yes, so long as the vast majority of GMail users are using their GMail account in a number of ways that intersect with the real-world financial system, they are going to want some way to verify your real-world identity if you lose the log-in credentials to your account.')
