Just as NYP is free to say whatever they want, Twitter is free to silence it <i>on their platform</i>. Freedom of speech and the first amendment is to restrain the <i>federal government</i> from prohibiting speech. That is the hill to die on, as it protects twitter&#x27;s right to do what it wants to do with its platform.<p>An orthogonal issue is social platform monopoly or oligopoly, and that we need more options and better competition.')
