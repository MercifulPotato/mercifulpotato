It happens on a snowy mountain with a cabin, if that will ring bells for anybody else.<p>His writing is fairly-near-future (10-30 years) and uncomfortable in much the same way that the show Silicon Valley can be uncomfortable (that is, it&#x27;s so close to the truth &#x2F; likely near-future that it hurts).<p>I swear I don&#x27;t know the guy, but this will be my... sixth recommendation of his books on HN.  I just love me some near-future peri-apocalyptic fiction.')
