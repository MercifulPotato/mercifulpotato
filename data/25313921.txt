She threatened to leave. If any of my team had an issue, and their response &#x27;Do X, Y, X or ill leave&#x27;, even if they are in the right, I would not align with them purely out of the fact that that is not the right behavior. You can still leave any company with out threats.<p>Also we have not seen the email to the brain group. I wonder how that compared to her exchange with Lecun and her threatening nature.<p>Lecun was not harmed? How did she contribute to a healthy debate there? Please also link me. Because all I saw were aggressive tones towards someone she disagreed with (even if she was in the right). Again, he behavior (not if she was right or not) is the problem here. You can be right, but still be an asshole.<p>Also, how do you know some people in her team didnt have problems with her? Do you have here perf reports? I believe her direct manager is not the only person that can fire her. She can be ok good terms with her direct manager and still behave unacceptably towards higher ups')
