I know in the case of Rust in particular there are other invariants, like that each 32-bit code point is guaranteed to have a valid value. (The compiler knows this and may use unset bits to stash enum state or something like that.) But maybe in other languages without such strict validity guarantees, it&#x27;s less of a big deal?')
