Item(by='david_shaw', descendants=None, kids=[25352633], score=None, time=1607462562, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25351349, text='This demonstrates two major points that many people not familiar with security may not understand:<p>The first is that anyone -- really, anyone -- can get hacked. I often joke with our CIO that security would be a lot easier if he just powered down our production infrastructure. Security is a game played in layers (often called &quot;defense in depth&quot;), but at the end of the day, it&#x27;s almost impossible to prevent a breach with any high degree of certainty.<p>The second is that bad actors (of wildly varying skill) are very active on the Internet. The threat of hackers used to be curious teenagers trying to learn more about computer systems; it didn&#x27;t take long for that to devolve into criminal activity and &quot;hacktivism.&quot; Now, the intelligence services of major nations regularly attack public <i>and private</i> organizations across the Internet.<p>It&#x27;s the job of contemporary security teams to defend against any and all threats -- but many (if not all) private organizations are ill equipped to defend against a well-organized intelligence agency in an attack such as this.<p>I didn&#x27;t see any what the attack vector used against FireEye might have been, but those same attackers are now very well &quot;armed&quot; with FireEye&#x27;s red team arsenal. It&#x27;s going to be an interesting future for security teams as we learn what and whom these adversaries will attack next.')
