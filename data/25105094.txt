The fact that a couple tech unicorns managed to survive during the beginning of a major technology boom says absolutely nothing about the probability of any other startup surviving. That&#x27;s like me winning the lottery on a Thursday and then saying &quot;Always buy your lottery tickets on Thursdays!&quot;<p>And didn&#x27;t Bill Gates come from a very wealthy, very well-connected family that could easily support him for the rest of his life if Microsoft failed? If I remember correctly, his mother was on the board of IBM and got Microsoft its first major contract for DOS.')
