But it is revealing that you think there is, and in particular <i>what</i> you think that premise is.<p>We never say that the premise of monarchy “rests upon they being able to consume and digest information on their own”; we might think that despot rule is cruel, but we don’t tend to assume that despots in general will lack some kind of faculty which will make them unfit to rule, for better or for worse.  Yet in the case of democracy, some people (like yourself) think of it as letting their teenage son drive the car to the store once in a while; they better show that they are competent or else <i>I</i> will revoke that privilege.<p>There is no premise for monarchy: the strong do what they can and the weak tolerate what they must.  Whatever democracy we have depends on how well organized the general population is against elite political factions, not whether they pass or fail your imagined voter-competency test.')
