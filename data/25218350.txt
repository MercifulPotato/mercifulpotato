Why exactly is stardust a cool thing, and not a dead meaningless dreadful thing?), and that &quot;good habits&quot; is a meaningful thing to pursue. Those become your deities. There is no difference except for which words are used.<p>The stardust itself doesn&#x27;t give you any meaning. It is you that fill those words with meaning.
