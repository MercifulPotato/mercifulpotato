But can you imagine others in your situation not learning the lessons you did, or learning to emulate the toxic behavior, or becoming withdrawn or callous or misanthropic, or otherwise developing bad coping methods?<p>It&#x27;s very common for people who admit that school sucked, to then defend it by saying &quot;it taught me to deal with it&quot;.  I say, if you really wanted to teach that thing, you could probably come up with something way more safe, time-efficient, and pleasant.  I mean, how many weeks would it take for someone to teach a course on &quot;Common personality problems and sources of conflict in the workplace&quot;, or something, that would cover 80% of what you learned plus some things you didn&#x27;t experience?  Most of the time, when people claim school is good for a particular thing, you can quickly see that it&#x27;s nowhere near optimized for that thing.')
