Children from broken families often don&#x27;t believe in long term relationships or starting family and come up with reasoning like overpopulation and actually doing good for mankind. General insecurities. Afraid of generally any commitment. Emotional intelligence on a low level.<p>There are more extreme cases - wife works currently as doctor in prison, and most folks there didn&#x27;t have a good (or any) fatherly model. Women have their own &#x27;daddy issues&#x27; side to it, but most above applies too (experienced first hand in one relationship, it was pure nightmare although she was smart and professionally successful).')
