I periodically tried DDG for years and always switched back but about a year ago I didn’t. I still use Google a few times a week but it’s increasingly for more obscure technical things and DDG is often winning those due to not having removed their advanced search operators.<p>Barring C-level change at Google I’m expecting the gap to disappear in a year or two.')
