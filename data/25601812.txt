In short, Dawkinsian &quot;memes&quot; are a very weakened version, mostly based on rote mimicking and copying. His meme was actually more strongly defined in the prior literature that he borrowed the term from and diluted.<p>The Leiden hypothesis leans on a harder version, in which memes are quite literally a new strata of life and our minds are co-evolved host organisms that straddle two layers -- a cyborg of biological and semiotic organisms. Our minds might be better conceived as akin to the fertile replication machinery of the biological systems below (ie. DNA polymerase)  -- Where the linear packets of information are remixed and recombined after being delivered from the internal and external environment. And if there&#x27;s some truth there, then it prompts lots of questions (e.g., about what is the most appropriate unit of life at the cultural&#x2F;linguistic level. Because DNA polymerase is not what we normally consider &quot;alive&quot; -- we consider the aggregate cell alive. etc. etc)')
