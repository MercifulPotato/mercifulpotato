Quite a few children ended up in the hospital. It’s impossible to attribute any specific case to the vaccine, but the numbers are fairly compelling.<p>As far as I could tell, all documented affected children are alive and well, but that doesn’t rule out children who weren’t noticed by researchers, and I’d consider being hospitalized to be a fairly severe side effect.<p>So, yes, you need to test vaccines, even for COVID.<p>(Consider the UK’s dubious Oxford vaccine campaign.  The data is muddled because AstraZenica screwed up, but the UK could easily end up in a situation in which the virus still circulates in a large population with weak vaccine protection, resulting in selective pressure on the virus to mutate to escape the vaccine’s protection. This would be bad news indeed.)')
