So i think you got that a bit inaccurate.<p>I appreciate you spent time looking at my profile, I&#x27;m grateful you would want to look. But I think you&#x27;ve got that a bit inaccurate...I use feel mostly to express my own feelings, but where I&#x27;m  empathizing with others, it&#x27;s not speculative for me, I&#x27;m confident in that and fine doing it. If you&#x27;ve got a problem with that, it&#x27;s your issue not mine. Please don&#x27;t tell me what words you &quot;think i should&quot;  use or how you &quot;think i should&quot; do. It assumes you know me and what I&#x27;m doing better than me, which is trying to talk down to someone else. If you need to try to talk down to someone to feel better, i get if you feel that way, but please don&#x27;t expect me to encourage your need for that. But even tho i don&#x27;t encourage it, i can still help you...I&#x27;ve put plenty of comments here that you can put down from your main account if you have one, if you need to do that.<p>Anyway, thanks for letting know how you feel about it.... if you want to know how i feel about it, i think you should try empathizing with people more, even tho you&#x27;re only interacting over text. In my experiences it pays to be attentive to the emotions of others. I get if you feel that&#x27;s a waste of your time, i feel a very sad for you if you think you&#x27;re wasting your time on HN today... But if so, you can always do something else you enjoy, so things can still be good for you today. I feel happy to think this is possible for you.<p>I just hope to share this thing and brighten people&#x27;s day as bit by it. I feel sad to think my work is part of an experience they didn&#x27;t enjoy, but i can&#x27;t control how they feel about it, i just express myself, like everyone express themselves. I feel sad for you if didn&#x27;t enjoy your experience of this show.')
