Even if they were lucky, as we were, and their planet had available great reserves of fossil fuels, they could not burn them. They cannot invent fire. Without fire, they have no way to invent metallurgy. Or glassworks. Or plastics.<p>What are the odds of having enough water for life to spark without having so much of it that it blankets the surface? Anything evolving on worlds with little land seem unlikely to ever escape their world.<p>Life could be commonplace, but if most worlds it evolves on are 99% water, we would never see it or hear it. The universe would be silent.<p>It may be our luck in simply being terrestrial rather than aquatic that separates us from our apparently absent galactic cohabitants.<p>Being in a position to be capable of taking advantage of burnable trees, and later coals and oils may be beyond rare in the universe.')
