In the early days (of my use, back on my first HN account) voting seemed mostly to be done to move a comment to it&#x27;s &quot;proper place&quot;.<p>Nowadays very good comments get greyed to non-readability. I find myself so often vouching for things I disagree with because comments that add well structured, logical, or interesting thoughts get voted out of view because they go against the group norms.')
