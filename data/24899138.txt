We host WireGuard servers which assign a stable public IPv4 and IPv6 on your device&#x27;s WireGuard tunnel interface.<p>As far as your device is concerned, it&#x27;s like its tunnel interface is a publicly addressable connection. Because it is! Just with one extra encrypted hop at the end.<p>Nothing to install besides WireGuard itself. WireGuard&#x27;s biggest papercut (Dynamic DNS) is solved because we provide you a connection to a server with a static IP.<p>No promotional emails. No spam. Just a simple service for a specific, niche need.<p>Hope to post about its launch here soon. (logan@hoppy.network for questions!)')
