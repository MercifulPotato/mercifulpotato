Tried it with several different printers including a custom built one, and tried it using a variety of extruders and hotheads. Not worth the time or money.<p>Their support is completely unhelpful (I ended up reverse engineering the octoprint python plugin) and while its pretty piece of hardware, it is largely a very expensive paper weight as another commenter mentioned. Several design flaws make it very frustrating to find the right settings for material combinations since it clogs all the time, forget doing true multimaterial (not just multicolor) printing unless you make a binding layer (TPU) or chose compatible plastics since most stick together worse than PET, and the closed loop feedback mechanism is far from good enough to have even 50% success rate. I managed to get a few decent prints from the contraption but it required babying the 3d printer even more than before. If you have wild humidity or temperature swings (such as when doing a long 10-20 hour print), you can forget about any sort of reliability. Oh and it is <i>slow</i> - best I&#x27;ve gotten on the 2S is 40mm&#x2F;s (one of the printers I tried it on maxes out at 200-300 mm&#x2F;s, though few materials can support that speed).<p>That said, without that closed loop feedback, the method described in the paper simply will not work on nontrivial prints. If I&#x27;m understanding it correctly, it&#x27;s just doing the same thing as the Palette except not in real time.')
