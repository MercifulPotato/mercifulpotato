All land is owned by someone and there are still tragedy of the commons scenarios.<p>&gt; The town commons where people grazed their livestock was literally owned by the government.<p>That&#x27;s not really true; the pre-enclosure commons simply wasn&#x27;t owned in the sense we&#x27;d understand it today, just as Native American land was administered in ways we wouldn&#x27;t recognise as ownership. Treating land as akin to chattel is a relatively recent development.')
