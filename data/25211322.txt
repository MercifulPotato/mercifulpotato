Newsmax is the other one I have been hearing about lately.<p>I&#x27;m not American. I really don&#x27;t need any of these. I do understand the extreme bias Wikipedia has shifted toward. It&#x27;s not that I can believe in Wikipedia&#x27;s stance on this OAN but rather I see is that they do have a clearly biased page against OAN. Their attack on them may be correct but it shows the attack.<p>&gt;They both do appear to be buying into the president’s election fraud story, if that’s what you are looking for.<p>Every election has fraud. What&#x27;s important is to be completely transparent about the entire process. Admit the truth and show how much fraud there was, that people were charged, and if the results are skewed. In a place like IOWA or California, there&#x27;s no big concern to worry about fraud. The win will be 1 sided.<p>In a place like Michigan where it doesn&#x27;t smell right. The importance of transparency is tantamount to the process. What did they do? They threw out watchers and cardboarded the windows. That&#x27;s literally the opposite of transparency.<p>Ultimately at the end of the day. Trump is done, but trust by the republicans in the election system has been eroded. Having MSNBC repeat that there was NO FRAUD isn&#x27;t proving anything.<p>The political divide in the USA was virtually all Democrat sided. This has increased the political divide by moving the Republicans.')
