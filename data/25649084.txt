Israel could de-escalate its tensions with its neighbors (including Iran) at any time.  It just needs to start treating its neighbors with respect.<p>Unfortunately, peace in the Middle-East would shift political power in all countries involved, shift government spending, reduce military aid from superpowers [1], and reduce the importance of the countries to the superpowers.  A lot of power and money is trying to prevent that from happening.<p>You don&#x27;t need to play along with those powerful people.  They don&#x27;t want to help you.  Lasting peace would help you and your descendants much more than continuing the current situation.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.btselem.org" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.btselem.org</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;explorer.usaid.gov" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;explorer.usaid.gov</a>')
