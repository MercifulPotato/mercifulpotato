It doesn&#x27;t play nice with newer macOS, due to Apple&#x27;s locks on the OS<p>I’ve been using LaTeX from &#x2F;opt&#x2F;local with zero integration issue, even on Big Sur. What are the issues you’re alluding to?<p>Otherwise, I agree with your take in general, except that I do everything you do in a Linux VM directly in macOS. I develop and run my codes on a Linux workstation and an iMac, and going back and forth improves the codes a lot. Performance and usability issues are spotted much earlier.<p>I much prefer Macports’ approach than Homebrew’s. It is nicely self-contained in &#x2F;opt&#x2F;local, does not break when a system library is updated, and the file system layout is much saner. Just update your environment in zshrc and you get all the benefits whilst not changing anything for all the stuff that you don’t run in a terminal.')
