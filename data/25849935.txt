At its core lies unjustified extrapolation that the ratio of average lifespan to typical interstellar distance - a pure accident of Earthly biology - somehow extends to the whole universe.<p>The key quantity on which the argument hinges is<p><pre><code>    T * c &#x2F; D\n</code></pre>\nwhere T is the average lifespan of the intelligent being in question, c is the speed of light and D is a typical separation between stars in a region of interest.<p>In our stellar neighborhood there are about 0.004 stars per cubic light year [1], so if we choose to measure D as the reciprocal of the cubic root of stellar density then D is about 6.3 light years which is of the same order of magnitude as the distance to Proxima Centauri (~4.2 ly). This quantity varies somewhat, e.g. global clusters have about 0.4 stars per cubic parsec [2] which is more than 0.01 stars per cubic light year for D of 4.4 ly.<p>In case of humans, T is about 79 years. We don&#x27;t know anything about any alien lifeforms, but even among lifeforms on Earth T varies significantly. For example, Bowhead whales can live more than 200 years [3]. Traveling 4 ly at 5% of the speed of light is a possibility for such creatures. Moreover, entities with artificial intelligence could live (function?) significantly longer. Possibly forever.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Stellar_density" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Stellar_density</a><p>[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Globular_cluster" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Globular_cluster</a><p>[3]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Bowhead_whale" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Bowhead_whale</a>')
