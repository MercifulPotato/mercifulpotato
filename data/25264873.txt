Debugging them requires a stack trace and, optionally, some context related to the check itself. If the program dumps this info on crash, the fix can typically be made in less time it takes to retrieve&#x2F;receive the coredump and start looking at it. If it can&#x27;t be fixed this way, then it&#x27;s to the coredump we go.<p>On the other hand if the code is prone to segfaulting on a whim, requiring dissecting its state to trace the cause down, then, yeah, it&#x27;s a coredump case too. But a code like that shouldn&#x27;t be running in production to begin with.<p>So that&#x27;s, roughly, what the F is.')
