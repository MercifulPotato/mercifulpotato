As I mentioned, for lookdev and small scenes, GPUs do make sense currently (if you&#x27;re willing the pay the penalty of getting code to work on both CPU and GPU, and GPU dev is not exactly trivial in terms of debugging &#x2F; building compared to CPU dev).<p>But until GPUs exist with &gt; 64 GB RAM, for rendering large scale scenes, it&#x27;s just not worth it given the extra burdens (increased development costs, heterogeneous sets of machines in the farm, extra debugging, support), so for high-end scale, we&#x27;re likely 3&#x2F;4 years away yet.')
