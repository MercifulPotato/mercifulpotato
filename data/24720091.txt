Rust was the hardest lang I have learned by a long shot. The first 2 months was kind of miserable (more because I try to build a interpreter that hit some of the hardest stuff on rust, and not knowing how deal with them).<p>In retrospective, I make the life harder:<p>* Thinking like in the other langs I have learned (with exception of my first 2) is enough to just read fast some tutorial and start coding... I relent and pick a book to learn it right.<p>* Start worrying so much about performance, when never before I bothered much (what! this can ALLOCATE!). Now I clone like madman!<p>* Try to fit the OO mentality to Rust. Even in F# I don&#x27;t fully commit to POCO objects and functions as I do in Rust now. Also, the lacks of polymorphism is what hurt me sometimes (ie: is harder in rust)<p>But now? Rust feel ABSURDLY productive. The thing I notice is how much I refactor stuff now, (even more than in F# that also was a up in this regard).<p>The &quot;punishment&quot; parts is only in my toy interpreter and very small now. For my main project ( a ERP&#x2F;ecommerce app rewrite from F#) Is great!.')
