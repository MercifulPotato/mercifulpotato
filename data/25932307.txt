I had some anxiety the first time or two I used a supercharger-- &quot;what if it doesn&#x27;t work?&quot; -- but so far, that&#x27;s been completely unfounded. When it &#x27;fails&#x27;, you get a free charge! I once found a supercharger that said &quot;limited service&quot; which concerned me. All it actually meant was, it charged at 75kW instead of 150. And my charge was free.')
