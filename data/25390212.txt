I was hoping you&#x27;d take it as positive and encouraging, that&#x27;s certainly how it&#x27;s intended.<p>There&#x27;s a lot in this world that takes time to work on, and time to come up to speed with. If you have seventeen lifetimes then you can do a lot, but otherwise you need to make choices.  There&#x27;s a lot you can appreciate from the sidelines, and agree is amazing, without necessarily understanding it all.<p>But other things you will want to get stuck into and get your hands dirty with, and it takes time and effort.<p>Smart isn&#x27;t where it&#x27;s at ... persistence and resilience are the critical components, combined with a desire to make progress.  Absolutely you can look at something and choose not to engage with it, but if you&#x27;re interested,have a go!  Be methodical, be persistent, read around, ask questions, and go for it.<p>By the way ...
