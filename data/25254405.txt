Having overly-verbose errors by default will make people just swallow everything at some point or another.<p>That particular example was triggered, IIRC, by a configuration file containing a malformed IP address, which was interpreted as a hostname, which resolved into an NXDOMAIN, which caused a magic connect-socket-to-dns-name-or-ip-address call to fail with a generic message when that socket was lazy-connected in an unrelated code path.')
