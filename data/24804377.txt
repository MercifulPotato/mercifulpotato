You think we can here in this thread all agree to what it means for an algorithm or content-removal practice to be &quot;politically neutral&quot;?<p>If so, please go ahead! But I seriously doubt it. This is a thing political philosophers argue about in journals to this day, that lawyers argue about in SCOTUS cases to this day, and that has been litigated to death in thousands of HN threads over the years.<p>The question of what &quot;politically neutral&quot; means is perhaps the MOST political question there is. The delineation of political speech from non-political speech defines the playing field.<p>And even setting aside genuine disagreement, politics does not operate on good faith. It operates on power. In practice, the bill does not outline specific criteria. So &quot;politically neutral&quot; will mean whatever the FTC wants it to mean. Which means it will mean whatever the appointees of the FTC chair want it to mean.<p>Josh Hawley, of course, knows and understands how power works. He would not be proposing this bill if the big tech companies were right-biased. Democrats also understand how power works. So, in this counter-factual world of right-biased social media, it would be Democrats clamoring for federal intervention and Hawley decrying the &quot;Democrat attack on the most successful American companies&quot;. Do you really believe otherwise?')
