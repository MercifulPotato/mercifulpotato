Even most actual engineers who are &quot;software engineers&quot; don&#x27;t do anything remotely engineering-y.<p>Programmer or coder etc to me sound too mechanical, as if literally (badabish) writing code is all I do, which isn&#x27;t true.<p>So software developer feels more accurate to me.<p>But at the end of the day I&#x27;ll take whatever title will pay the most for the most enjoyable work.')
