Although the myth is so pervasive among HN circles, it&#x27;s almost like an old wive&#x27;s tale and extremely hard to combat at this point. It&#x27;s also just a very incorrect generalization.<p>Anyone who&#x27;s had more than a rudimentary brush with economics should have no trouble understanding why that is.<p>To give a few reasons why that statement is usually either outright false or  a gross oversimplification to the point of being useless:<p>1. Whether something is zero-sum or not depends on the period of time you&#x27;re looking at. Always. When you say something is or isn&#x27;t zero-sum, you need to specify what time period you&#x27;re referring to. Good place to start is here.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.economicshelp.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;glossary&#x2F;short-run-long-run-very-long-run&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.economicshelp.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;glossary&#x2F;short-run-long-r...</a><p>In this particular case, I&#x27;d consider the COVID-19 lockdowns to still be short-run. And it isn&#x27;t particularly evident if the wealth during this time has increased, is zero-sum or negative-sum<p>2. Many things that traditionally generate or store wealth for the people are indeed zero-sum. Desirable land within a certain zip-code, for example. Or in an area with high economic activity, e.g. downtown of a city. These things are both explicitly zero-sum (although it doesn&#x27;t directly transfer 1:1 as wealth). Their <i>valuation</i> may grow in the long-run, which, if sold, and transferred to other economic activities by their owners, would make the wealth a net gain.<p>3. Market Cap&#x2F;Valuation is not wealth. When sellers&#x2F;buyers are large enough, the price of a stock does not directly transform into the same amount of wealth. You can&#x27;t take AMZN and sell off all of its stock at its current price.<p>4. Pertaining to the current situation, it isn&#x27;t really clear if companies that are hiring more and generating more wealth right now is compensating for the country-wide loss of jobs from the pandemic. Not even economists can predict with good accuracy whether this is going to result in a net wealth gain when all is said and done. However, this <i>is</i> evidence of a wealth transfer, because the surplus labor generated by extra AMZN workers goes directly to its largest shareholders, e.g. Bezos.<p>(Note, that you can have a positive-sum wealth generation and a wealth transfer at the same time)<p>&gt; Then there was also the whole CARES act this year<p>5. Printing money does not generate wealth.')
