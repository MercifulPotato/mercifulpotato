Item(by='Rzor', descendants=None, kids=[25241368], score=None, time=1606597493, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25239947, text='From their FAQ:\n&gt;Why use Please instead of Bazel, Buck or Pants?<p>&gt;All four of these systems are quite closely related in the scheme of things, being inspired by (or in Bazel&#x27;s case, a direct open sourcing of) Google&#x27;s Blaze.<p>&gt;Several of us had worked at Google and used Blaze extensively there; we were excited about it being open sourced as Bazel but by then we were already using Please internally. It&#x27;s a great system but we have slightly different goals, specifically we&#x27;re aiming Please at being lighter weight and pushing the boundaries of what can be done within the BUILD language. Since Please is written in Go there&#x27;s no runtime dependency on the JVM.<p>&gt;We actually used Buck for some months internally before deciding to write Please and before it was capable of building our repo. We preferred it to other options available, but again we&#x27;re focused on different goals; Please is easier to extend to new languages, has a bunch of features that we specifically wanted (e.g. test sandboxing) and has a stronger focus on BUILD language correctness. Conversely we have much less support for mobile development.<p>&gt;We&#x27;re least familiar with Pants; one of our developers briefly tried it and while we liked many aspects we didn&#x27;t think it was the ideal fit for us at the time.')
