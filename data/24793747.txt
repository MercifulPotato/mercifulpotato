Another example is Youtube.  It used to to be free to watch videos; now there are multiple ads being shown.  It&#x27;s only a matter of time before it becomes exactly like cable tv, where you have ~3-5 minute ad breaks per 15 minutes AND a monthly payment.  We&#x27;re in the middle step, where you can pay Youtube Red OR watch multiple short&#x2F;skippable ads.  I&#x27;ll give it 10 years before the internet becomes exactly like cable in the early 2000s.')
