Because in most languages, environments are magic: they&#x27;re an exceptional thing that you work with in a special way, you&#x27;re not expected to <i>understand</i> them, just <i>use</i> them.<p>In Lua, an environment is... just a table! You can set an environment, read from it directly, <i>assign it a metatable</i>, and so on.<p>So this is great for a beginner, once he gets past the hurdle. Just like `table.field` returns `nil` if there&#x27;s no field field, `field` itself returns nil if there&#x27;s no `_G.field`. <i>Because</i> _G.field and field itself are the same thing.')
