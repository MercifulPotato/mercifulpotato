I see lots of stuff shared on Facebook that I just can&#x27;t believe people are into, but they are really into it. Good for them for finding enjoyment in it. If I don&#x27;t want to see that content, I can mute the person to clean up <i>my</i> feed.<p>If the content doesn&#x27;t violate any rules and people want to read it, then it has a place. If it does violate rules, then communicate those clearly. Given that, I think that this is most likely not an issue of rules violation but of Facebook not wanting the content on their platform (and not wanting to actually justify that).')
