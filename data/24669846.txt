Android doesn&#x27;t really have any competitors - Amazon, Samsung, they have zero legal access to the apps on the Google Play store unless they go through Android. As such, if they refuse to allow <i>competitors</i> to force them to compete, they have a responsibility to compete despite the lack of competition and if they refuse to do that it&#x27;s the government&#x27;s job to beat them until they comply.<p>Again: the problem here isn&#x27;t &quot;freedom&quot;, it&#x27;s competition. Your next product probably doesn&#x27;t have a major captive sub-market.<p>But let&#x27;s address the &quot; freedom&quot; argument: what I call Hobson&#x27;s Choice capitalism. &quot;If you don&#x27;t like it, you&#x27;re free to rewrite the OS from scratch, then convince every single app on the app store to switch over while <i>starting</i> with no hardware support and no app support. This is a Hobson&#x27;s Choice - it&#x27;s not about making an improvement on Android, it&#x27;s about making a unilateral improvement on <i>the entire universe</i> just to push Android forward. It&#x27;s absurd and not a real choice.<p>But more importantly, if you consider Hobson&#x27;s Choice capitalism to be capitalism, then technically the government is equivalent to a private corporation as long as you can forfeit your citizenship and move to Somalia to be free of your country&#x27;s obligations on you. This basically contradicts the standard definition of the free market, but that&#x27;s the point - everyone rejects the Hobson&#x27;s choice out of hand, because it&#x27;s just so absurdly irrelevant to competition.<p>So let&#x27;s talk about competition: would Google rather take a lower cut, or <i>legally</i> permit Amazon and Tizen to access Google Play apps from their non-Android OSes?<p>Because right now, they&#x27;re not competing. They&#x27;re just sitting on their chicken-egg problem based laurels.<p>As for Epic: I sort of agree with your pejorative - copyright is <i>intended</i> to provide funding, but the right it <i>actually</i> grants is the right to deny a copy. Some companies simply sit on copyright they never actually intend to monetize, and others keep hold of it <i>far</i> longer than they need to make a healthy profit proportionate to its success. The notion that all copyright needs the exact sake period is also absurd, as some industries are much more fast-moving than others. I think we need to take a long, hard look at copyright monopolies, starting with the absurd &quot;lifetime plus 70 years&quot; duration.')
