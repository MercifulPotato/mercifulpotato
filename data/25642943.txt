RAII, proper strings and arrays data structures with bounds checking and reference parameters instead of pointers were already available.<p>From the 5 surviving Ada vendors, there is a free option, so anyone that cares about security with the issues that C brings into C++, can also have a look at it.<p>In fact, GenodeOS, seL4 and NVidia Autonomous Vehicle project are all using Ada&#x2F;SPARK to some extent, as they considered investing into Ada a better option than adopting Rust, given its history in production.')
