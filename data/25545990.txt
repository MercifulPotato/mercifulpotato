Have a look at the British Tesla Driver Youtube channel, some of his videos are eye opening. Basically the car is in full autopilot mode, approaches an intersection, correctly slows down, waits for its turn, starts moving.....and in the middle of the turn goes BEEP BEEP BEEP and disengages entirely because the road markings aren&#x27;t there and it wasn&#x27;t entirely sure where to go. And now of course you&#x27;re in a moving vehicle that&#x27;s heading for a collision with someone else and requires IMMEDIATE attention to continue. One could(and I&#x27;m sure will) argue that the system &quot;shouldn&#x27;t be used this way&quot;. But that&#x27;s a moot point, if the system is there and lets you do this, then people will use it this way.<p>&quot;How long before the tech exists to address this issue?&quot; I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s a problem with tech as such. We have fantastic cameras, yet famously Google&#x27;s best image recognition algorithm just couple years ago would reply, with 100% confidence, that a sofa in a zebra print is in fact a Zebra, after all the stripes are there, it has 4 legs.....it must be a zebra.<p>So in my(personal) opinion, self driving will face the same challanges image recognition has faced - we will rapidly get 90% of it right, then the last 10% will be a massive pain to get right for decades if ever.')
