For instance the WHO clearly says:<p>&quot;Current evidence suggests that the main way the virus spreads is by respiratory droplets among people who are in close contact with each other.&quot;<p>It probably can happen. But contact tracing hasn&#x27;t found much evidence for it: the majority of infections can be explained by close contact from an infected person.<p>Re: masks, surgical masks and cloth mask far from 100% effective against small particles, with filtering efficiencies of 50% or less common <i>though the fabric</i>. Filtration is even less when you take into account air that bypasses the mask (the reason why your glasses fog up is because of air that isn&#x27;t being filtered).<p>Also, very large numbers of people use them incorrectly, eg by leaving the nose uncovered, and leaving gaps. I don&#x27;t think this is a matter of education: people know what correct wear is, and don&#x27;t do it because it&#x27;s much easier to breath if you defeat the mask&#x27;s filtration.<p>Most people aren&#x27;t wearing masks around family and friends anyway.')
