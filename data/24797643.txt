It started off OK but quickly ran into trouble after the hardware started scaling up (particularly the thermocouples)<p>I had an esp8266 sitting around, so I flashed it with tasmota, configured it to run four thermocouples, and then tied it back to the raspberry pi via MQTT message bus.  It&#x27;s absolutely fantastic.  I put a second one together to run a small portable load cell setup for measuring output rate of the process and pipe all of those measurements through MQTT as well.  Plan is to create a flash&#x2F;configure pipeline so i can swap out the ESP boards and&#x2F;or easily tack more on over time.  Ultimately would like to get all of the hardware off of the PI and have spare ESP8266 boards around so i have a bit of redundancy.<p>Tons of capability for the money and the process of getting Tasmota up and running with a standard sensor couldn&#x27;t have been easier.  Lots of fun!!!')
