Each of your examples is an example of <i>implicit</i> agreement, not explicit, because of the context provided. That&#x27;s what context does ... it allows you to make an inference about how people are feeling or thinking about a certain topic when they don&#x27;t explicitly say so. Your inference may be right, but it may also be wrong.<p>If in your parent comment you had accused Coinbase&#x2F;Armstrong of <i>implicitly</i> supporting the status quo (as you define it) I would&#x27;ve said &quot;yeah, sure, if I squint hard enough and wash it through the &#x27;silence is violence&#x27; filters I can see how you&#x27;d think that&quot;.<p>Another troubling thing I want to point out here is your comment is part of an accelerating trend where people, particularly from but not limited to those on the left, consistently attribute maximum malice of intent to peoples&#x27; comments (said and unsaid) or their actions. That is, imo, one of the reasons these environments are so toxic, because people are immediately put on the defensive.')
