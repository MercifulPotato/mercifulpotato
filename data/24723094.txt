These kids are being taught that their needs are basically unimportant compared to the teacher&#x27;s needs, that their feelings are unimportant compared to the teacher&#x27;s feelings, that they are a burden on their teacher&#x27;s time and energy, and that they shouldn&#x27;t even ask questions when they don&#x27;t understand something.<p>There are several educators in my immediate family, and several friends as well. I guarantee you every single one of them would be HORRIFIED by this amount of selfishness and lack of self-control this teacher is demonstrating.<p>This teacher needs to be, if not fired, put on leave and recommended a mental health evaluation. In their current state they are unable to satisfactorily educate and&#x2F;or care for small children.<p>I suspect you don&#x27;t have kids.')
