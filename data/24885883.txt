Item(by='hnthwaccount', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603629838, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24885616, text='This looks like a standard “Discrete Mathematics” course, or an “Introduction to Proofs” type course, where the style is definition-theorem-proof. If linear algebra were to be introduced in this class, then it would likely be at a theoretical level where linear algebra would be introduced through definition-theorem-proofs, starting with proving trivial things like (−1)v=−v.<p>It would probably take an entire semester to get to more advanced topics in linear algebra. This is typically its own course and isn’t the computational version.<p>Despite the book’s title this course is more geared towards getting students ready for Algorithms and other CS theory level courses.')
