If I remember correctly, when it still ran it stopped in Berlin around 4:30 AM; not a fun time to get up. I did use it to go to Dresden though; got out at 7, had breakfast, then a train to Leipzig. Excellent way to travel.<p>Although since you mention using the Internet and also the Eurostar, you probably meant the day train, which is fine but the 6 hours to Berlin take a chunk out of your day. (I once took the one at 5 AM, but that turned out to be too early for me and I can&#x27;t sleep in a chair.)')
