For example, if RDRAND were defined in terms of &#x2F;dev&#x2F;xrandom, say by just flipping its bits, then doing<p>(secret bits) xor (bits from &#x2F;dev&#x2F;xrandom) xor (bits from RDRAND)<p>is very weak encryption.  But of course, there is no reason to believe RDRAND is dependent on any of the usual random sources.')
