If I prepared early enough, I probably would have been studying there already. I also wish the program could be accelerated, like at WGU. 2-3 years seems far compared to 3 months.<p>Given that we both finished the program in 3 months, I suspect that we have similar skill-level and study habits. Do you find courses at OMSCS to be as difficult as others claim? How much time do you study in a given week?<p>I didn&#x27;t receive any scholarship at WGU. I didn&#x27;t know they were so easy to get. How much was it, $500&#x2F;term?<p>Email me, I&#x27;d like to stay in touch.')
