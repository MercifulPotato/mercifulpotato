You deepen the commitment and the connection to the project. This is just a win-win-win for any company. I&#x27;ve seen it continuously result in boosted productivity, quality, and overall mood&#x2F;energy in the office.<p>Contrast that with the usual approach of hiring anybody and everybody rapidly, and then pulling in outside execs that bring in their own VPs and decimate the existing culture.

They will just jump ship at that point and get a promotion elsewhere.')
