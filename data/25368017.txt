Stores adjust their purchases based on what sells, so if Safeway starts promoting their own cereal then they will start buying less of yours.</i><p>You do know that the companies that make the name brand cereals...also make the store brand cereals...<p>It&#x27;s about market fit. Price sensitive customers would generally not buy name brand because it&#x27;s too expensive, and the brands don&#x27;t won&#x27;t lower-priced products to &quot;sully&quot; the image of the brand. Hence, they sell white label (aka store brand) products to retail stores that are generally lower quality and thus cheaper.<p><i>Supermarkets frequently charge slotting fees to appear on their shelves.</i><p>Yes, some do. For <i>new</i> products that they wouldn&#x27;t otherwise stock on the shelves, because it&#x27;s in lieu of the anticipated lost revenue from saleable products that would otherwise have gone on the shelves. Note that slotting fees are used alongside consignment arrangements.<p><i>Supermarkets often have contracts where they can return stock to suppliers if it is defective or not selling well and do not always own their stock. </i><p>Yes, but they&#x27;ve <i>still paid</i> for those products in the first place (in the legal&#x2F;accounting sense). Refunds come in the form of discounts or credits on future invoices.')
