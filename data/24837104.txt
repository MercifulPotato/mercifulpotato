Item(by='Izkata', descendants=None, kids=[24837585], score=None, time=1603200971, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24834636, text='So in this example:<p><pre><code>  loop 1..10 &#x27;x [\n      if? even? x -&gt; print [x &quot;is even&quot;]\n      else        -&gt; print [x &quot;is odd&quot;]\n  ]\n</code></pre>\nI can&#x27;t find any reference for what the arrow is doing.  It looks like a lambda in the first part (x -&gt; print [x &quot;is even&quot;]), except that would mean that&#x27;s getting passed to &quot;even?&quot; instead of &quot;x&quot;.  But that doesn&#x27;t make sense for the second one, so is the arrow part of &quot;if?&quot;&#x2F;&quot;else&quot; or is it an alternate way of wrapping the print in a block?  Or something else?')
