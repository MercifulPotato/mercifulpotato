For those I use native ES modules heavily for internal code, and use very few external dependencies and import them as global scripts like a heretic. Heck I often don&#x27;t even use npm for node projects anymore.<p>For my latest project I&#x27;m even trying to make the entire interactive UI without any JS. I&#x27;ve sadly <i>never</i> done this.<p>The sense of relief getting out of &quot;modern&quot; JS has been palpable. No more build steps. No endless dependabot PRs. No painful dependency updates. Just good clean fun development.<p>There are tradeoffs. vdom frameworks really can add a lot of productivity vs hand-coding dom updates. But if I really need it I can use something like Mithril which still doesn&#x27;t require a build step.')
