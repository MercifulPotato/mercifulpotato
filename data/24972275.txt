That&#x27;s rather perverse.<p>For one recent and on-going example, look at the San Francisco Van Ness BRT project.  This project merely adds dedicated bus lanes and center median boarding&#x2F;unloading.  Along with that work, there&#x27;s some utility relocation, and sidewalk improvements.<p>This route is entirely along an existing major thoroughfare in heavily-urbanized San Francisco.  The entire route is already entirely paved.  Anyone can look at this and conclude there is no risk to the environment from this project.  Yet the CEQA process for this project took ten years to complete.<p>The project would improve public transit, reduce traffic, reduce pollution.  It&#x27;s really ironic that laws meant to protect the environment are what held up this project for a decade.<p>There needs to be a way to short-circuit laws like CEQA for certain categories of projects, like transit in heavily-urbanized areas.')
