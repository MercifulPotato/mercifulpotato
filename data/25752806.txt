They could simply hook up their own computer to the internet and run their site if they wished. No one has some natural right to be able to use a convenient service like AWS. And if AWS refuses to do business with you, there are hundreds of other hosting companies that you can choose from.<p>Ultimately, if not one of the hundreds of hosting companies out there wants to work with you, that should be a very strong indication that the community is not something we want. But if you really really want this community anyways, just hook up your computer to an internet connection and host the site yourself.')
