The big ones it seems are:<p>- Inflexibility in when people may vote; The types of jobs people have access to has a racial bias.  Black people tend to have jobs where they literally aren&#x27;t allowed to leave during they which means they can&#x27;t stop by the polling location during off hours.  This can make polling places deal with larger peaks in predominantly black areas.<p>- Partisan resource allocation; predominantly black regions tend to lean democrat and so in republican areas they may receive fewer resources to deal with voting.<p>- Voter ID laws; These also have a racial lean and can clog up regions where they are enacted.  Minorities also tend to have a more difficult time gaining access to IDs for voting and so people may have to come back multiple times or be turned away.<p>- State voting laws;  Regions vary with who has access to early voting, vote by mail, etc.  These tend to have a racial bias as well.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nber.org&#x2F;papers&#x2F;w26487?sy=487" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nber.org&#x2F;papers&#x2F;w26487?sy=487</a>')
