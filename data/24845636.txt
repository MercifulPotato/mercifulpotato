Metrics do not scale.<p>Software development is a balancing act of visible results, technical debt, available workforce etc etc. Life (cells and above) is not perfect but it matches environment.<p>&gt; no strong motivation to become more disciplined<p>Bug on production bug is much better motivation to write tests than some discipline. Write code so other people want to work with or search another place.<p>&gt; either torpedo your whole idea or turn it into not doing the thing (see OOP, Agile, Functional Programming)<p>A lot of languages are not OOP by Alan Kay, Agile and SCRUM subverted. That is marketing, when benefits is in the badge not in the substance. Those who chased idea do well.')
