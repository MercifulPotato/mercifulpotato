You might take a look at the following study, and see if it rings true to the school you did experience, or to what you&#x27;ve heard from others you&#x27;ve met:<p>&quot;The considerable majority of [the subjects: young people with 160+ IQs in Australia] who have [skipped 2 or more grades in K-12] report high degrees of life satisfaction, have taken research degrees at leading universities, have professional careers, and report facilitative social and love relationships. Young people of equal abilities who accelerated by only 1 year or who have not been permitted acceleration have tended to enter less academically rigorous college courses, report lower levels of life satisfaction, and in many cases, experience significant difficulties with socialization. Several did not graduate from college or high school.&quot;  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;files.eric.ed.gov&#x2F;fulltext&#x2F;EJ746290.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;files.eric.ed.gov&#x2F;fulltext&#x2F;EJ746290.pdf</a><p>I don&#x27;t know if you&#x27;re at the 160+ level, but SAT scores are something of a proxy for IQ, and the severity of the social and academic frustration due to mismatch with age-peers can be judged directly.')
