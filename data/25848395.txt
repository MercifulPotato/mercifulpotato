I&#x27;m in the process of selling about 300 retro console games mostly because when I play an old game I&#x27;m likely to emulate it on my phone than hook up the real thing. I&#x27;ll miss having my collection, it&#x27;s nice just to go through it from time to time. I took detailed photographs before selling, those will have to do now.')
