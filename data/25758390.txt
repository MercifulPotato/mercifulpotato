It says they banned anyone posting left-leaning content.<p>It says this:<p>&gt; Judging from the posts announcing that they&#x27;ve been booted, at least some of the banned Parler users seem to have signed up for the service precisely to test the limits of the app&#x27;s so-called &quot;freedom of speech&quot; policy.<p>I read this to mean that people showed up to purposely troll hard enough to get banned so they could claim they got banned, and then they were. Your claim was that they don&#x27;t &quot;regularly ban people for violating their TOS with inappropriate content.&quot;<p>&gt; So, at the same time, and for the first time in the six election cycles they&#x27;ve gone through, every single cloud provider came to the same conclusion and course of action without any outside pressure in a way that provides more evidence for antitrust behavior.<p>Even if there was outside pressure, you&#x27;re still speculating that it was from law enforcement rather than the political branches.<p>How are you even sure this is the first time this has happened? Certainly it&#x27;s the most high profile, but tech companies have been quietly disappearing &quot;undesirables&quot; for years.<p>&gt; There is no timeline or even universe where Parler is competition for Facebook, Google, Apple or Amazon.<p>Not if they get ground into dust by competitors just as they&#x27;re hitting the exponential growth stage.')
