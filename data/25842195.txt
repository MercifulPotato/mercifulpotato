Every major version of Angular holds back the version of it&#x27;s dependencies, such as Typescript.<p>When I came onboard this project, I came into a situation where the client simply did not upgrade their libraries &amp; nodejs version for a few years. When it came time to catch up with the latest version of Angular, the experience was painful. Three major version updates later, (version 9.x to 10.x), the Angular upgrade became unbearable &amp; I moved the project over to Svelte &amp; a pnpm monorepo. Now all dependencies are up to date, the architecture is improved, &amp; page size reduced. It took a few months to hammer out all of the edge cases due to the complexity of the app but release is imminent.')
