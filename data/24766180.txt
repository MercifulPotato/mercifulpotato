You&#x27;re imagining that people who are employed for Apple are special, but they of course are just ordinary programmers.<p>Your point about SSD controllers is embarrassingly incorrect; there exist many hackers of SSD controllers, including OpenSSD [0], an entire open-source community of folks working on the problem.<p>Please stop apologizing for Apple&#x27;s walled gardens.
