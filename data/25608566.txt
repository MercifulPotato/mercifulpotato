That is what one should aim for.<p>The world chews up and spits out good kids. I vowed early on that I wouldn&#x27;t let anyone shit on me again and it really shaped my early life, not necessarily for the better. I overshot assertive by a decent margin.<p>Fortunately, I eventually settled into a healthy middle ground. I do wonder if there is a method of preparing &quot;good kids&quot; for the world of shit they are about to encounter in a manner that is a net benefit to them (ie. Not scarred or jaded by it). Not that I&#x27;m ever having kids.')
