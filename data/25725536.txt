However that&#x27;s just for the collection so you still need to file and pay the VAT yourself.<p>I am still in the beginning, so at the moment I just charge the Finnish VAT regardless of the country the customer is based in (I live in Finland) and pay that VAT to Finland only.<p>Once I reach 10K in yearly EU sales I am supposed to either register an office in each country where I do business to file and pay taxes there, which is crazy at a tiny scale like mine, or register for VAT &quot;MOSS&quot; which allows me to collect tax in the different rates depending on the countries, but still only pay the collected tax to Finland.<p>But what if they decline my MOSS registration for some reason? Then I am screwed I guess.<p>But generally speaking I hate to deal with tax and I would very much prefer Paddle handled all of that for me.')
