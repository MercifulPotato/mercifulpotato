The only surprise as an outsider is really the size some markets turn out to be, not the decision to go into the market nor the solution settled upon.<p>This suggests to me many&#x2F;most are started by people looking for a relatively conventional experience, just with a bit more appetite for risk. None of the attributes for these positions are required in much greater degree than elsewhere in tech - curiosity, resistance to being told what to think, or fastidiousness to truth. Perhaps it&#x27;s a testament to YC&#x27;s success that the choice to found a startup is more accessible to &#x27;conventional thinkers&#x27; these days. No value judgment - we should let a thousand flowers bloom! - but the conflation of startups to the above attributes of &#x27;independent thinkers&#x27; is perhaps overblown.')
