I get surprised when my fellow colleagues tell me than even with their high TC they don&#x27;t get to save and live paycheck to paycheck. It&#x27;s not a better lifestyle but just lack of financial education. American Capitalism and peer pressure is what it is.<p>I agree that h1b abusing employers have to be stopped and we need to raise the bar for h1b&#x27;s but lets not make this a discussion about forcing a unhealthy lifestyle on immigrants.')
