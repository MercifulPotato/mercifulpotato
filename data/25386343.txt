Nothing but article contents should be let through, no &quot;related stories&quot;, no GDPR pop ups, and no &quot;we don&#x27;t seve European users here&quot; error pages. I would be happy if I could force my browser to display everything as AMP, whenever there was an AMP version available. Kind of like the default reader view in Safari.')
