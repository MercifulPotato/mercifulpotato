These days the &quot;declarative pipelines&quot; style seems to be the first class citizen, but most of the documentation still shows the old way. I can&#x27;t take the code in this example and compare it trivially to my pipelines because the exact same logic is represented in a completely different format. I wish they would just deprecate one or the other.')
