You&#x27;re familiar with markup if you&#x27;ve ever used a hilighter for instance. To make it an API just have something parse that markup according to some well-defined set of rules and to do _stuff_.<p>I can write a parser that accepts a single API call as it were:<p><pre><code>  &lt;p data-do-a-thing&gt;Smith&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;\n</code></pre>\nNow I can feed that into the parser and in this API of mine a `p` tag with attribute `data-do-a-thing` renders the contents of the tag prefixed with `Hello, ` giving `Hello, Smith`.
