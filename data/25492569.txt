Find out what isn&#x27;t documented and document it. Research issues and get the back-story and architectural decisions. Help people understand each other. Draw out details that might be gumming up someone&#x27;s attempts to start working on an issue. Help manage and coordinate the work. Discover if old problems are no longer a problem. Find ways to sell something when you are at loggerheads with someone, or find alternate solutions.<p>This is the kind of stuff that gets business projects done in half the time with twice the quality. Nobody has time to do it, but actually it takes almost no technical skill to do; somebody just needs to be hired to do it.')
