A lot of expats and remote workers(including myself) use it to get paid and avoid currency changing. Or you can get cards which do the same thing (e.g. I have a Curve card is linked to my other bank cards). It depends which country you live in, these options are fairly straighforward in the EU. There are a few services which these cards don&#x27;t work with, like pay-at-pump gas stations, but I&#x27;ve yet to find somewhere online it doesn&#x27;t work. May be overkill for a one-off payment though.')
