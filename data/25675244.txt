That&#x27;s quite untrue. 5.25 floppies immediately vanished from the market when 3.5 became available. That was a long time ago. So you have the entire lifetime of 3.5 disks elapsing after the demise of 5.25. We&#x27;re now roughly 20 years after the demise of the 3.5 disk so both demand for and availability of the older 5.25 is very low.')
