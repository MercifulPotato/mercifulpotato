If their current software works sufficiently on the sites they care about, then they have no need to upgrade. If the sites themselves are enabling this behavior, by bending over backwards to work on with old browsers, then they are part of the “problem”.<p>I don’t like automatic updates and generally keep them disabled. Software upgrades tend to reduce functionality and instead force unnecessary UX redesigns on users, so I’d rather avoid them. I <i>wish</i> developers had the [EDIT: incentive] to release security patches independently from functionality changes, but few do that anymore, sadly.')
