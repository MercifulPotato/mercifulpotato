Item(by='Psychlist', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609906656, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25653317, text='&gt; Extra compensation or time off is usually a bad idea for on-call responsibilities, because it puts the wrong incentives in place.<p>I sort of agree, because yes &quot;just throw a little money at it&quot; is the wrong response. But more money is definitely part of the answer, because unless you negotiated that amount of overtime when you signed up you&#x27;re not being paid appropriately for your work.<p>&gt; think of what engineering work you can do in order to improve the on-call experience<p>This is key. During your incident response review for each incident it&#x27;s important to also keep a summary of overall incidents so you can use statistics to properly prioritise your engineering effort.<p>It sounds as though none of that sentence applies to the OP, and none of it ever can. Which means the advice to get out is about all that&#x27;s left.<p>In my current job I get a token on call allowance (~2 hours pay a week), and it&#x27;s expected that I will respond to problems, fix&#x2F;restart&#x2F;hack the immediate situation into something that works; then come in during normal work hours and analyse the fault, come up with a plan to stop it happening again; and implement the plan. Note that only the immediate fix is &quot;after hours&quot;. Some of the fixes are significant - we&#x27;re re-writing chunks of C++ code in Rust because there are weird memory issues{tm} in the C++ code (because of course there are). Other fixes are trivial, an assert fires and we say &quot;oh, that can actually happen&quot; and code accordingly.<p>Right now the on call allowance feels like money for nothing, because we have had two alerts in the last three months but they&#x27;re paying that allowance to 3 people every week. The boss says &quot;you&#x27;re doing very well, keep it up&quot; because in his view no problems is a good thing :)')
