The next step will be to use those funds to create a private AI research lab, converting money into ML skill and completing the loop. My long term goal is to do AI research.\nSo far, we invested around 50k of our own money and achieved a return of more than 30x (x not %) in 6 months.\nI started two years ago, 2 team members joined 6 months ago and 1 more one month ago. We are about to incorporate the company.<p>Our short term goal (1-2 years) is to make our algorithms more scalable and diversify our trading strategies. Today we are looking for the following:<p>- A data engineer. We use python&#x2F;numpy&#x2F;pandas, node&#x2F;javascript&#x2F;typescript and AWS.<p>- A &quot;CFO&quot;. We are looking for someone who can take responsibility for corporate, fiscal and legal matters. Ideally very familiar with corporate and tax laws in Europe, bonus points for also being able to write code.<p>- ML engineers, but it&#x27;s not the highest priority right now<p>Compensation: 1 to 10% equity, and a personal trading account. We will offer salaries once we are incorporated. As a warning, our trading strategies are very unconventional and risky, so we are looking for people who tolerate risk very well. There is a slight (~5%) chance that the location changes from Budapest to another city in eastern Europe or maybe Dublin or Singapore.<p>To apply, please send an email to b.crouzier@gmail.com with a word about yourself.')
