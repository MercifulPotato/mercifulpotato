The one drawback is that I&#x27;m a heavy user of Hasura, which means that I&#x27;m a heavy user of Docker which doesn&#x27;t run locally.<p>The fix is that I changed my start script (spins up Hasura, create-react-app server, serverless local, ngrok, etc) to just SSH into an AWS box and run Hasura there.  With ngrok paid this is very easy and is basically transparent to me at this point.<p>Happy to share code if you&#x27;re interested.')
