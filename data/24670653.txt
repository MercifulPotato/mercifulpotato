Then you edited your comment.<p>You ran into a bug in some web software. It happens. Sounds like it was already fixed.<p>Meanwhile, the above blog post is a pretty amazing technical breakdown that is extremely detailed and well constructed. To reduce the entire company down to &quot;a joke&quot; because you ran into a bug once is just rude and dismissive. You might even agree because you changed your comment, although you still found a way to insult the blog post and the author.<p>And no, I don&#x27;t work for Hellosign. I&#x27;m just a software engineer with some empathy for the hard work that has clearly gone into this. This is great knowledge sharing. Time and place.')
