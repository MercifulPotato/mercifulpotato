[0] Also worth viewing is this talk by Clay Shirkey on technology tools for Government [1].<p>Ultimately, I don&#x27;t see law being automated. As others have pointed out, most cases that go to court are all about interpretation and establishment of the circumstances (did events X, Y and Z happen), interpretation of the law (does law F mean that event X was illegal, and is event Y a mitigator or irrelevant?) and, more elusively, impact (how serious was X?).<p>What this doesn&#x27;t mean, though, is that there aren&#x27;t tools that can&#x27;t be used in the creation and management of law. If we have a simple dependency tree of documents and sources, we can trigger a review of downstream documents if a document is changed. We can statically check some aspects of the document, like a Legal IDE that would present itself more like an advanced spellcheck. Meta rules can ensure consistency, add in support for in-line reading (include a definition next to a paragraph even though it is defined elsewhere).<p>Probably the closes thing you&#x27;ll get to an &#x27;automated&#x27; system would be for the &#x27;process&#x27; that is currently done by administrators to be partly or fully automated. When charges are brought, a court date is automatically booked. When a judgement is made, a court report is generated, prison alerted etc etc.<p>Basically, everything that people in tech think should be automated, shouldn&#x27;t be, and all the things technology people think shouldn&#x27;t exist should be automated.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ricardian_contract" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ricardian_contract</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=CEN4XNth61o" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=CEN4XNth61o</a>')
