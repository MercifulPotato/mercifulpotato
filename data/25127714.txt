What if in the process to encourage people to wear seatbelts, drivers who did that then felt entitled to drive even faster thus resulting in even worse accidents and more frequent ones at that. Of course, no driver would actually think like that.<p>While I wear my mask, I do wonder about its overall effectiveness especially if in total we all engage in riskier behavior that we wouldn&#x27;t have otherwise if we simply lived with the basic fear that you have to stay away from everyone.<p>Masks &quot;help&quot;, but maybe they &quot;help&quot; most by thinking of them as not a help at all. It&#x27;s a tough paradox to encode into public health messaging.')
