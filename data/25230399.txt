Until then you&#x27;ve made an investment vehicle, not money.<p>&gt; The tech darlings of today—Apple, Google, Twitter, etc. were also quite volatile as they grew.<p>Survivorship bias. Pointing to a handful of random successful companies and trying to draw conclusions is literally meaningless.<p>&gt; As you may know, the mantra in the bitcoin community is to HODL—hold on for dear life, not to time the market. For long term investors, the ups and downs don&#x27;t matter.<p>Yeah, this isn&#x27;t something you actually say about money. Honestly, it would be a kind of cultish thing to say about an investment too. I don&#x27;t need a mantra for how I invest in my 401k, why does Bitcoin need one?<p>&gt; A publicly traded company that puts its treasury of $425 million into Bitcoin isn&#x27;t speculating<p>That&#x27;s the literal definition of speculation, a risky one at that.')
