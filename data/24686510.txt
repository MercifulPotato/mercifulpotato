And they will infect 1000s in the surrounding community in the same timeframe.<p>(To anyone tempted to point out the published R isn&#x27;t that high, local R is highly dependent on situation and who mixes with whom.  In a confined workspace, especially with people moving around, it&#x27;s higher than in the general population.  This is why it&#x27;s useful to teach clustering in addition to exponential growth.)')
