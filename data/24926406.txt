The cited violations had nothing to do with &quot;social justice&quot;, just with being (allegedly) &quot;negative&quot; and &quot;insulting.&quot;<p>It sounds like the whole situation was handled poorly, but clearly it is within the role of a conference organizer to reject overly negative or outright insulting talks. I don&#x27;t know the details of this case and it sounds like communication with the talk author was extraordinarily poor, but I&#x27;m not sure how this reflects on the notion of a code of conduct in general or the &quot;social justice&quot; movement in particular.')
