I don&#x27;t want to have to parse legalese as part of my role as an engineer. I don&#x27;t want companies to have to hire more lawyers to verify they can use software I wrote. I want them to be able to just use it, then contribute back after they&#x27;ve experienced using it. I don&#x27;t want a restrictive license may prevent them from ever even trying my software in the first place. I want culture and norms that encourage the company to contribute to the project, not laws.')
