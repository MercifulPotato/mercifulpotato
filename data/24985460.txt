I was referring to code comments, not messages.  I am on some projects where others are really strict about &quot;no superfluous comments&quot;.  Yet... the thing that&#x27;s helped most when looking at 5-10 year old code is someone&#x27;s multi-line comment about what decision led to something (sometimes with decision maker names, dates, etc) and some reasoning.  None of that is remotely discoverable in things like confluence (at least in any project I&#x27;ve worked on in the last 10 years or so).')
