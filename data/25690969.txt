There are many reasons time may skew &gt;128ms beyond &quot;network congestion.&quot;<p>I&#x27;ve dealt with datacenters getting a bad ntp config push, for example, or a bad firewall ruleset which blocks NTP. Fixing the config may inadvertantly step time.<p>There&#x27;s a whole host of systems issues, sometimes involving VMs and sometimes bare metal which can cause this type of problem. The most simple of which is ntpd not running properly for a while, but this can also happen when systems get overloaded - extreme swapping and the like.<p>ntpd&#x27;s behavior of non-monotonic time adjustments was brought to my attention after a developer uncovered database corruption, caused by a database which (correctly) assumed that time should be monotonically adjusted while the database server was running. I believe it mis-ordered a transaction log or something along those lines.<p>There are other, better ntpd implementations like chrony which can be configured to never step time. If time needs to be stepped, applications should be stopped and the machine should be removed from service first.')
