I&#x27;m not sure that narrowing degree qualifications is a win; high-skill immigration is a significant boon to America&#x27;s economy, and I think ability to do the work, and American company willingness to pay above-rate salaries (legally mandated now to 95th percentile for the highest-skill work) ought to be enough signal, and having a particular degree is not as useful a measure at that point. I know plenty of people who are incredibly qualified in terms of industry experience who don&#x27;t have advanced degrees.<p>I&#x27;ve been pretty impressed with Taiwan&#x27;s Gold Card work visa program, where you either need certain educational achievement qualifications, or need to be a highly-paid employee in specific fields — but not both. And it&#x27;s not tied to a specific employer, which I think helps negotiation (and thus also helps domestic workers, by raising labor prices). I wish America&#x27;s immigration program worked more like that — specific quibbles about what exactly the rate should be aside; Taiwan&#x27;s is certainly too low to use for the US — since I think encouraging high-skill immigration would help much more than it would hurt: high-skill immigrants tend to generate more jobs, and also tend to pay more in taxes than the services they receive, meaning it&#x27;s a win-win where immigrants can get the jobs they want in the country they want to be in and Americans end up with more jobs available and more government services per (American) tax dollar spent.')
