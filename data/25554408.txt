Under my current local rules (not Portugal) this would require to be a certified pilot (theory + practical exam, although if you do this commercially it is a must anyway) and a risk assessment submitted to Civil Aviation Agency.<p>P.S. I believe the first shot of the video wouldn&#x27;t fall under any regulation as it is not using airspace.')
