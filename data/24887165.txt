Case history is incredibly valuable for physicians and personally I would likely opt for them to retain it if I&#x27;m going through any kind of chronic illness.  My wife went through a very severe illness that lasted over two years.  We saw numerous hospitals and doctors over that span and the ability to have the hospitals exchange her data completely and accurately was instrumental in ensuring timely and accurate review of her case.  Sure I could have done that with some kind of data checkout&#x2F;checkin mechanism but I wasn&#x27;t in the best state of mind to be able to implement all of the resiliency mechanisms required to take appropriate care of that information.')
