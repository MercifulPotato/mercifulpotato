Many of us want to do right by our users, and be as privacy focused as we are capable given our constraints.<p>When push comes to shove, Google _isn&#x27;t_ a collection of people - it&#x27;s a legal entity with the sole purpose of turning an ever-increasing profit.<p>The best way to ensure privacy is to not track users across the web. Hence, if Google was interested in privacy, that&#x27;s what Google would do - not add extra &quot;anonymized&quot; tracking features.')
