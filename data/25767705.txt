You will always be surprised, and you&#x27;ll be surprised in production because &quot;the thing&quot; you developed against sqlite doesn&#x27;t work in postgres.<p>I used to do this and stopped when I noticed that sqlite and postgres treat booleans differently; postgres accepts &#x27;t&#x27; as true, but SQLite stores a literal &#x27;t&#x27; in the boolean-typed field.  This means you get different results when you read things back out.  All in all, not a rabbit hole you want to go down.<p>Personally, I just create a new database for each test against a postgres server on localhost.  The startup time is nearly zero, and the accuracy compared to production is nearly 100%.')
