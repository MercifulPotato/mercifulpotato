Rarely did the differences in both sides of my family translate into some kind of enlightened synthesis of values. At worst it fostered tensions over what culture was superior. At best they just naturalized in one direction save the ethnic food. Your mileage may vary by culture: my grandmother and mother didn&#x27;t get along but the former still was an otaku.<p>So in the academic sense sure you can say this is a good thing but now you&#x27;re scapegoating the emotional integrity of families or the people within them for these conflicts. As far as the &quot;diversity of thought&quot; these experiences taught me... I resolve these conflicts by trying to seek concepts that are not tied to any culture or dissolve cultural distinctions, and draw power from that. That&#x27;s a form of convergence, not divergence. I know some other multiethnic kids that just pick and choose whether they are e.g. German or Chinese when they are either both or neither.')
