Yellow journalism, hearsay and rumors dominated common conversation.<p>He observed that with the internet we&#x27;re returning to what was this &quot;normal&quot; state with anybody being able to post something and gain widespread recognition, the difference of course being the rate at which this non-objective information travels and the better ability to weaponize it.<p>I think, after looking into it a bit more, I agree with him and that our period of fairly objective news and political information and the general consensus that brought was the anomaly. This raises the question then how do we as society re-learn to cope with that and filter out non objective information because clearly we&#x27;re not doing so well with it now.<p>So, I don&#x27;t think so much as it will die out as much as I think we need to develop abilities to separate wheat from chaff, stronger societal bullshit filters because truth will have a weaker signal.')
