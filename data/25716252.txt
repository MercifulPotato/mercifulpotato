I sold all the stocks in February and parked it in GLD which was great. Got back into stocks in the summer, so was a good twelve months. One thing, time in the market beats timing the market, I just got “lucky“ because things were obvious getting worse early in the year, the decisions weren’t difficult. As for a possible crash, I’ll  park some cash maybe in BND and wait for opportunities.')
