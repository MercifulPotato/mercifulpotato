One situation is floating-point constants, where &#x27;e&#x27; is a delimiter indicating the exponent. However, if an Ã© occurs in the middle of such a constant, whether as a single code point or a combined character, that is an error. The &#x27;e&#x27; must be followed by an optional sign and one or more decimal digits.<p>The ISO C library string handling stuff is for systems programming, not for scanners and parsers for natural written language.')
