They&#x27;re not uncommon, and they&#x27;re not anything like the &quot;abuse&quot; somebody might describe in a manual labor job.  Some of these stories sound like these women are essentially being raped, over and over, for profit, and then their abuse is being viewed by millions of people on the internet every day.<p>It&#x27;s not cute, and there is a reason why the founder of this company would want to hide his name.  He is trafficking in what is often times videos of the worst moments of some women&#x27;s lives.<p>Read the stories that Mia Khalifa has put out, or Stoya, or girlsdoporn, or &quot;exploited college girls&quot;, or watch the documentary &quot;hot girls wanted&quot;.  This stuff is <i>horrible</i>, and &quot;mindgeek&quot; appears to have absolutely no sympathy whatsoever for the toll that their exploitation of these women takes on them.')
