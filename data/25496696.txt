I agree it would be better overall if people didn&#x27;t have to go thru it. But for a single person to decide to sit it out, they&#x27;re shutting themselves out of a lot of high paying jobs that only recruit college graduates. You can be successful as a high school graduate, but it&#x27;s a lot easier to get your foot in the door of a lot of places if you went to the hiring manager&#x27;s favorite college.')
