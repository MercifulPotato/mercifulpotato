My Home got bricked by an update last month and was going to just forgo replacing it because I am getting tired of Google&#x27;s diminishing support of their products and the privacy concerns.<p>My only concern is Siri is easily the worst assistant when compared to Google or Amazon. I just hope it is good enough to handle my music and timer requests.')
