Joyful programming, for me, is programming where I can feel confident and peaceful knowing that every possible contingency of a given piece of code has been either accounted-for or prevented. Knowing that I&#x27;m not going to be blindsided by anything, being able to narrow my focus to the problem at hand instead of being overwhelmed with the infinite number of things that could go wrong.<p>I wonder what causes such a divergence in mindset')
