Law has to be rendered at a sufficiently general level in order than it can encompass every relevant case. This, the argument goes, means written law cannot properly deal with context. Many of us realise that, sometimes, the context in which a crime is committed bears upon how just or unjust it is, even if that fact is not accommodated in law.<p>Anyway, one enduring argument for mercy is that can be exercised on those rare occasions where there is some overwhelming contextual argument for why the general law should be overridden, e.g., the Greek play Antigone is effectively built around just such a case.<p>Not that this argument has anything to do with Trump&#x27;s unashamed cronyism and self-aggrandisement. But my point is that mercy isn&#x27;t <i>just</i> an excuse for base corruption.')
