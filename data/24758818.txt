Importantly, they auto-retract so that they are worn in the proper position.<p>When you put on 5-point belts, you have to 4 times as many latches to operate, and you have to adjust all 5 belts -- and in the proper order.  If you tighten the belts in the wrong order, they won&#x27;t protect you properly.  It is not intuitive -- I have a car with 5-points and the passengers who manage to figure out how to latch them almost universally tighten the belts wrong.')
