Is the problem that the American government just isn&#x27;t big enough?<p>People are generally doing that in areas where people are allowed.  Also the government has a stupendously large amount of land that it didn&#x27;t pay for and a low budget for keeping anyone out.<p>It&#x27;s different if this is land you&#x27;re purchasing in the modern age.  If you&#x27;re buying a million acres for over a hundred million dollars, then that&#x27;s about 150 miles of border to patrol.  If you hire 150 people for that, at above-median wages, that&#x27;s 3 million a year.  Add some overhead, some expense for equipment and buildings, it&#x27;s affordable enough compared to the purchase price.  If that&#x27;s too expensive then go up to 10 million acres, which triples the land area per mile of border.  Or 100 million acres.')
