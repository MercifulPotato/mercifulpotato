I&#x27;m honestly baffled when I see commercials for Dollar Shave Club and they talk how they deliver shaving products, including razors, to you each month.<p>When I started to shave around age 17, I got one of these Gillette 5-blade razors, and it came with two replacement heads in the same box. When those were worn out, I bought a 10-pack of replacement heads. I&#x27;m now 31 years old and I&#x27;m now halfway through that same 10-pack.')
