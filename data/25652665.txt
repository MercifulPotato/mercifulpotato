Some devices only transmit occasionally.  Not everyone is blasting their frequency 24&#x2F;7.<p>It reminds me of when I worked for a company that had a bunch of super-cool switch 56 linking various radio stations in our network.  We&#x27;d use them for moving audio around, doing interviews, sports remotes, etc...<p>But we also had a problem with them constantly failing.  I was told by our engineer that this was because whenever another company called up Bell Atlantic to get one installed, some tech would listen in to the pairs (presumably with a scope), and when he found one that was silent, that was the one he used for the new company.  Often, it was one of ours, so when we would try to use the link the next morning, it wouldn&#x27;t work.<p>It still &quot;belonged&quot; to us, but because we weren&#x27;t using it 24&#x2F;7, someone thought it should be reallocated.  Not cool.')
