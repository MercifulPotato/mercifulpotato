This year there will be the first real tests run with no one in the cab. &quot;By 2024,TuSimple plans to achieve Level 4 autonomy, meaning that its trucks will be able to operate without a human driver under limited conditions that may include time of day, weather, or premapped routes.&quot;<p>Somehow I&#x27;ve managed to miss that trucks are better for this stuff not just because of the type of driving they do, but also because they&#x27;re trucks! Being bigger gives them some advantages.<p>&quot;Trucks are also a better platform for autonomy, with their large size providing more power for computers and an improved field of view for sensors, which can be mounted higher off the ground.&quot;')
