The notion of space-time is entirely a construction of relativity; and the two theories have yet to be unified.<p>Collapsing the wave function doesn&#x27;t bring a system into the domain of relativity. That happens at a fuzzy point where a system become massive enough for relativistic effects to become significant.<p>In thoery, we would probably expect to see some relativistic effects in entangled systems; but predicting what those effects are requires a theory of quantum gravity.<p>There is semiclassical gravity; which essentially says that the quantum fields described quantum mechanics occurs in the curved spacetime of relativity. This is (by design) just an approximation of the still unknown theory of quantum gravity; and we don&#x27;t have good experimental evidence telling us how accurate of an approximation it is.')
