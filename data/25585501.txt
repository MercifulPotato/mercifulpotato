But my ideal solution will be something like:<p>- Get rid of insurance companies for EVERY visit to the doc&#x2F;hospital. Make prices transparent and available OTC for anyone to compare between various practices. It is kinda like car insurance if you think about it. I can bet that if we had to involve insurance companies for things like oil change, premiums would skyrocket and not to mention the overhead of the middleman. Let people pay cash for general stuff. For those who can&#x27;t pay at all, see below.<p>- Govt. should insure everyone for catastrophic illnesses to start with. This is where we all pool in a bit from our taxes for the greater good. I however do think that we should limit this to serious illnesses like cancer etc.<p>- Based on level of income, Govt. should also insure&#x2F;subsidize poor&#x2F;low income groups for general visits, procedures etc etc. May be a small CoPay type stuff. But no major bill. High income folks don&#x27;t get this Govt. Benefit (kinda like Food stamps ?).<p>- Did I already say get rid of middlemen Insurance Companies for basic stuff ? Ok good.<p>- Private insurance should still exist but let them compete in a real free market. If someone wants to buy private insurance as additional supplement, no problem. Just don&#x27;t force me to use an insurance company just because I want to go talk to a doctor for 30 mins.<p>- Get rid of all the crap like In network, out network, Deductible blah blah. Keep it simple. Get rid of filing an insurance claim for EVEEEERY thing. I got to a doc, I can pay Cash. I am done. Boom. No need for crazy billing systems and figuring out who will send me a bill.<p>Lets do this ?')
