Being a mathematician LISP just feels natural and the ugliest, most horrible and hard to read language by far is java (IMO, of course). But that&#x27;s just probably because all my life I&#x27;ve been thinking about functions and not objects.<p>If your background is OOP and look at some LISP there&#x27;s no surprise if it looks unreadable, even more so if you have no real motivation to understand it.')
