The 4k is my primary work monitor - i want crisp text. The 1080p is actually a gaming monitor (plus 244hz), since my card can&#x27;t push 4k for gaming at 244hz hah.<p>Could i have two 4ks? Yes, but originally this setup was used by my macbook pro, and i wasn&#x27;t confident it could push two 4ks. Futhermore my 1080p gaming monitor would have to go somewhere, and i&#x27;d like to not have two different desk setups.<p>My setup these days is to scale everything x2 (in KDE or XFCE, currently i&#x27;m on XFCE), and then scale my 1080p _down_ via xrandr (as i&#x27;m not on Wayland).<p>Sidenote, Mac handles these two monitors _perfectly_. I complain a lot about Mac, hence me being on Linux at the moment - but these monitor scaling issues were <i>entirely</i> gone in OSX. I never noticed a single scaling issue. Where as on Windows there are lots of quirks, and Linux i could barely get it to work.<p>Hopefully Wayland makes this experience better.<p>*(Sidenote: i&#x27;m on XFCE atm because KDE on NixOS felt a bit sluggish. Maybe it was just the animations, hard to say. XFCE felt a bit snappier. GNOME was a laggy mess, hah. KDE and XFCE were both good though, XFCE was just a bit better for me on unmeasured performance feel)')
