We were driving up the freeway to go see the show and had 4 of us in our buddy&#x27;s Mom&#x27;s Datsun Station wagon he borrowed from her. We were smoking weed to get ready for the concert and had the windows rolled down part way to try to keep from reeking out the car.  An ember flew into the back of the wagon and we didn&#x27;t notice it but the car just kept getting more and more smoky so we kept rolling the windows down more and more which just fanned the flames. The next thing you know the car was in flames in the back. We pulled over and stood by the side of the freeway and watched our buddy&#x27;s Mom&#x27;s car burn up.<p>The cops and fire department came and put it out eventually. The Cop asked us where we were going and if we needed a ride or to call someone. We told him we were going to see Black Sabbath and Van Halen and he said oh wow, you can&#x27;t miss that I will drive you there. Our buddy said OK he could call his Mom when we got there and arrange rides for after the show.<p>When we got there our high was blown so we toked out more. When I got in there and the show started, I will never forget Eddie sliding out on the stage on his knees hammering out Eruption.  I don&#x27;t know if it was the weed or the music or both but I swear I had an out of body experience. I had never heard it like that, live was just a whole &#x27;nother level.')
