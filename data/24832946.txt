I do actually find that joke to be funny, but it hides potential discussion of real differences behind a pithy comment.<p>Being jailed for criticizing your president is much much worse than suffering social backlash for supporting a president that your chosen community has judged to be bad.<p>Depriving someone of their freedom through legal force is not the same thing as people getting mad at you on the internet (even if that anger causes you to get fired).<p>&gt; <i>The modern USA culture of contempt for leadership</i><p>Give me leaders who aren&#x27;t contemptuous and then we&#x27;ll talk.  They do exist, on both sides of the aisle, even though they sometimes seem to be in short supply these days.')
