That said, I am not sure whether regulatory approvals should take 5-15 years, when it seems like everyone&#x27;s happy working through a coronavirus vaccine in less than 1 year.<p>My point about pharmaceuticals was more about the problem of having the Patent and Trademark Office trying to compensate for costs imposed by the Food and Drug Administration. I think the FDA is imposing costs, and if these are causing problems, the FDA should be held responsible for finding a solution; this would also have the effect of incentivizing the agency to balance costs and benefits more carefully.')
