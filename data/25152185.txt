It works really well (except in Incognito)!<p>If you go to this[0] link, you&#x27;ll see a bunch of nodes in a graph. Each one represents an AWS Lambda that will be deployed (and an API endpoint). The edges between are &quot;microservice&quot; calls between Lambdas that get configured with the deploy too.<p>That&#x27;s all coming from a Git repo here[1].<p>And if you edit the project by adding more blocks, it will actually push a commit to Git (if you&#x27;re signed up and auth&#x27;d GitHub). Each block is just a folder, and the &quot;project&quot; is a YAML file. We have a bi-directional &quot;compiler&quot; that lifts&#x2F;drops the project in either direction.<p>This library made it super easy to ship this. We tried using the server first and it was a huge pain. We just had to setup a GitHub proxy to make this work. It&#x27;s stateless now (your browser does the work) :)<p>0: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.refinery.io&#x2F;import?q=pq4rsai019bm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.refinery.io&#x2F;import?q=pq4rsai019bm</a><p>1: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;freeqaz&#x2F;gensim-refinery" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;freeqaz&#x2F;gensim-refinery</a>')
