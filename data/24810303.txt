It doesn&#x27;t grow your career, either. Your work life is a big part of your daily life and it should be fun, challenging to some degree, and rewarding.<p>For me, &quot;rewarding&quot; means financial compensation, learning new things, and being appreciated by my peers and those above me.<p>Currently, I work as a senior software engineer for Apple. I make a low 6-figure salary while working 100% remote (also before COVID-19). The assigned work is groundbreaking, secretive, uses new tech, and it&#x27;s going to be used by millions of people around the world.<p>Then I got the offer a few weeks ago to work for a local bank, setting up their new platform. Even newer technologies and more responsibilities as a competency lead. The salary will increase by 60%.<p>Imagine making 120k a year and jumping to 192k a year, just by signing a piece of paper. I&#x27;ve worked for Apple for about 2 years now, and I&#x27;m having a great time. But there&#x27;s no way they&#x27;ll increase my salary like that.<p>What I have learned over the years is that if I make this switch and don&#x27;t burn bridges behind me, I should stay in close contact with my current colleagues, and work to learn all I can at the new job.<p>Two or three years from now, I might apply at Apple again. For a higher-level job. Right now I&#x27;m a senior software engineer, but in 3 years with 3 years of enterprise leadership experience, I&#x27;d apply for a leadership role. I will use my connections and insider-knowledge to have a more personal connection to them.<p>That can be a quicker, but certainly more lucrative, way of promoting inside a company. And I&#x27;ve done that before at a different company.<p>I was a medior developer at CompanyA, moved to CompanyB where I became a senior developer for 2 years, then moved back to CompanyA as a senior developer.<p>Usually I would have gotten the usual +5% salary increase if I had stayed at CompanyA. But by making a little detour I increased my salary by 30% to 40% with each jump.<p>Loyalty is worth nothing, except to your employer. That just means you&#x27;re an asset that is going to become worth increasingly more as time goes by, because your potential market value skyrockets while you remain working for the annual +5%. And every once in a while you&#x27;ll get the +7% because you&#x27;re so special. And that one year business is bad, so you&#x27;ll only get +2%.')
