I had tried Epoccam and it was buggy, and broke between releases of Zoom or didnâ€™t work in Slack calls. Screwing around with OBS was time consuming and pinned my fans.<p>Reincubate Camo has been a pleasure to use over the last 3 months, and has never let me down. Having good image quality on video calls is on par with wearing a clean shirt or showering before in person meetings. You can get by without it, but you make a much better impression if you step your game up a little bit.<p>One big plus of Camo is that it will also patch software like Slack so that it works with virtual cameras at all.')
