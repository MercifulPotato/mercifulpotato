I picked Linux Mint, and found it quite easy to install and maintain on my AMD desktop. All the drivers were already there.<p>The only difficulty I had was installing Docker, but an hour later I had that and my other required programs installed and I was able to be productive.<p>It took me less than three hours to make a USB stick, install, and get my programs needed for me to code again.<p>That said, I had also tried Ubuntu and found it a not-so-great experience. I had to look for a few different drivers and learn how to install them from the command line. After that it was fine, but I didn’t like the UI and didn’t really want to spend the time learning how to tweak  it to my liking.<p>So I think the right distro really matters in the case of making Linux attractive to common users. IMO Cinnamon&#x2F; Mint is the one for that.')
