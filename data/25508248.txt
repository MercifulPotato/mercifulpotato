It&#x27;s a much better experience if you disable JavaScript&#x2F;Hotwire and fall back to the server-side-rendering instead of the hybrid mess they push down. I&#x27;m very disappointed that this hasn&#x27;t been improved. (I sent feedback about this while they were still in their invite-only phase.)<p>We were also promised custom domain support by the end of the year, and we don&#x27;t have a timeline or even pricing yet. (That&#x27;s obviously backend and unrelated to this announcement.) I don&#x27;t want to go back to Google, but the lack of improvement isn&#x27;t giving me a lot of confidence as a HEY customer, so I&#x27;m considering alternatives.')
