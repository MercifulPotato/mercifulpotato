But as you mentioned, they were still contractually beholden to larger powers, and when push came to shove, they acted entirely within their own self interest. They lied to our face to gain business. Not only that, but they continue to lie to the media (not making it clear that this was a liquidity issue). Sure, in retrospect, it&#x27;s evident that it was heading this way all along, but just because a fraud is perpetuated out in the open doesn&#x27;t make it any less of a fraud.')
