England R value is about 1.3 at last count.<p>1.3*(1-38%) = 0.806<p>So hopefully that&#x27;s enough.<p>I&#x27;m a cynic and pessimistic so I worry that:<p>London is likely higher (more workers, denser, people use public transport).<p>Keeping nurseries open and some pupils in schools will reduce the 38%.<p>The spike from christmas&#x2F;new year will ruin things.<p>I guess the optimist would say:<p>1.3m people vaccinated (especially in high risk groups) means the hospitalisation rate should go down.')
