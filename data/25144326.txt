My conclusion is that it doesn&#x27;t. I might as well stick with quaternions and try to grok them better. (It is sort of neat that quaternions are a special case of something else, but not actually helpful.)<p>In particular, there is nothing about how to actually do calculations on a computer, with the excuse that you will usually use a library for this. This isn&#x27;t helpful to me because I&#x27;m doing embedded programming, and also because I don&#x27;t feel like I really understand math unless I know how to do calculations well enough to write a library myself.<p>All this coordinate-free manipulation of symbols leaves me feeling like I didn&#x27;t really get anywhere. I was hoping for a more intuitive understanding.<p>Does anyone have recommendations that are more oriented towards doing calculations?')
