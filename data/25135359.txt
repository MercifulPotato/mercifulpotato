I would think he didn&#x27;t suffer a COL adjustment. The most valued engineers have little to worry about and always have&#x2F;will. There is rarely resistance to their interests. Everyone else is expendable. Your expendability increases porortionally to the problems you create versus solve.<p>This reminds me a little of the 2008 recession where a lot of analysts at investment banks that were making a lot of money without much experience were fired and those jobs didn&#x27;t return after the economic recovery. I believe that brought about increased algorithmic trading. It&#x27;s tough to find sympathetic people to this issue.<p>I imagine displaced tech workers, now living in lower COL areas will have trouble finding sympathetic ears as well. I would certainly prefer to be the employer versus the employee in this contest.')
