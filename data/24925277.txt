My prime requisite is to deliver actual value, not dubious internal metrics.<p>One of our jobs as programmers, leads, or architects is to determine, of many strategies to solve a problem, which are (or may be) appropriate for the current context. Testing is done the same way; and parameters for testing are decided by the QA department. Any strategy that claims to be universally applicable (like anything labelled &quot;clean&quot; or &quot;correct&quot; or &quot;best practices&quot;) is likely at least partially bullshit. Every problem is different, and every requirement requires special care to ensure what&#x27;s being done is appropriate for achieving both long and short term goals within time allotted.<p>It&#x27;s a given that the business already pushes as hard as they can on deadlines. If I have to cut effective quality assurance, or make compromises on what will and won&#x27;t be done a maintainable or performance oriented manner to fit in meta-work that really doesn&#x27;t matter; I&#x27;m going to pick a fight.<p>The development team has a finite bullshit budget, and the business has generally spent our bullshit budget before we get to your correctness bullshit.<p>The very notion of universal &quot;software correctness&quot; within a system of sufficient complexity is reductive and borderline offensive.')
