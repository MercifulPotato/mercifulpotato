This structure is very strong, very uncommon and interacts in a non-trivial way with the other\nmain component of Streebog.<p>&gt; In light of these results, we urge security professionals to avoid these algorithms.<p>It&#x27;s like this: imagine some government released plans for super-secure safe, and for some reason, deep in those plans, there is an instruction to make an 1&#x2F;4&quot; hole in the door, at the specific exact position. There is no justification or explanation for this hole, just a mention that it must be present or the safe is not going to be certified.<p>So people wonder why it was placed on the plan. If there were a good reason, why not tell it? Perhaps NSA&#x2F;FSB has some new method to crack safes, and this hole is needed for it? Better be careful, and avoid using that specific safe model.')
