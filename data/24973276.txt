Item(by='hinkley', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604350806, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24972438, text='I say &quot;no way&quot;, but it deserves a clarification. There is no way to do it <i>at scale</i>.<p>There is forest succession, and there is secondary forest succession. If a hurricane, ice storm, 2 year drought, or the shock wave of a volcano wipes out all of the trees in an area, you get what is called a secondary succession. Much of the soil and all of the wood is still there, so a shorter path that goes from forest clearing to mature forest species can be taken instead.  Logging destroys the process, and you go back to prairie, which is a longer route.<p>If you&#x27;re restoring an acre? You can ship in enough wood chips to approximate the food chain around a dead tree, kickstarting a secondary succession. It&#x27;s a trick Permaculturists are using to build soil far faster than your science book says, but they only do it by diverting a waste stream from thousands of neighbors. You&#x27;d never find enough material to replant the forest between you and the next town.<p>But you could build an island, and when that&#x27;s done build another, and let them grow toward each other and toward the next town (who does the same) and you might have something better than a million hectares of doug fir in forty years, ready to burn down again.')
