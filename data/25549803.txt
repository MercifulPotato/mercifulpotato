I want a game that rewards experience, that permits further study, that has meaning to its replayability.<p>I agree with you and disagree with the article on this point. I think a truly good game must have an explicit, adjustable factor of randomness or odds so you can match different levels of players and play for fun. It&#x27;s hard to balance, but that&#x27;s the point of game design: rules simple enough to be accessible, but that at the same time can combine in infinite ways giving each game depth, and have the opportunity to match players of different levels without that being overwhelming.')
