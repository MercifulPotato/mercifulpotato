Problem is (as shown by the Solarwind hack) even code you should be able to trust can be backdoored. However: if that is the attack vector, spectre and its&#x27; offspring are not your real concern: there are much more efficient and effective ways to compromise your machine if a blob of binary ends of being backdoored.')
