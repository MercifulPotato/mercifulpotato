It&#x27;s pretending to care and expecting to get pats on the head for it while actually being a burden to someone whose life is already overburdened.<p>It&#x27;s the opposite of actually caring about a person. It&#x27;s caring about them making you feel good about going through superficial &quot;caring&quot; motions while doing absolutely no good and lots of terrible harm when it is added up over time for the person with a chronic condition whom absolutely everyone wants pats on the head from for pretending to care while doing not a damn thing to actually make their life better in some meaningful way.<p>If people care, they do what actually helps you rather than insisting you make them feel good for superficial bullshit that only adds to your suffering.')
