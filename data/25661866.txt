Perhaps more like trying to buy a position in society, an entry to a respectable white-collar career.<p>That would be why (in this theory of mine) it hasn&#x27;t been disrupted by technology. The ability to impart knowledge to lots of people, in a way which was once only possible by gathering them in a room with a teacher, has indeed become cheap. But, as you say, this has not placed pressure on college tuition, as would happen in a more normal industry, which was actually selling what it says it&#x27;s selling.')
