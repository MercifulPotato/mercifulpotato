At least that had JTAG, even if the cable did cost $70.<p>I have tried:<p>* Espressobin: While Marvell&#x27;s hardware is pretty good, they&#x27;ve had trouble with the v7 board, resulting in the small community being somewhat bifurcated. I still don&#x27;t think it runs a mainline kernel properly. At least the PCIe slot is standards-compliant. u-boot+ATF will always be a 2018 (?) Marvell fork, no one&#x27;s ever going to update that.<p>* Firefly RK3399. Lol. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lkml.org&#x2F;lkml&#x2F;2020&#x2F;4&#x2F;6&#x2F;320" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lkml.org&#x2F;lkml&#x2F;2020&#x2F;4&#x2F;6&#x2F;320</a>. Although, if you can get ARM Trusted Firmware working it&#x27;s a reasonably competent board.<p>* Vocore2. Support is reasonably helpful but insists that I use GCC 3.4.2 to compile the bootloader. Remember to back up the wifi calibration data - you can&#x27;t ever get it back if you erase it. You will need to break out the magnet wire if you want to unbrick it. Shame, it&#x27;s a nice little MIPS board.<p>* Anything Libreboard - use this, they&#x27;ve put a stunning amount of work in to get things upstreamed.<p>When I want to just work on something not on a PC, I keep coming back to the Pi. The Pi 4 is competent with an SSD attached over USB 3, and the Pi 0W is great for very simple tasks that need Linux. I wish it were better, I wish Broadcom was more open, but the Pi has the biggest community I&#x27;ve seen in any &quot;hobbyist&quot; ARM space.')
