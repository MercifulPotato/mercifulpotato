But maybe it&#x27;s just my personal preference that you can find your large country ranch just a few miles from the suburbia and the city. That city might be the most Texan culturally - that and I can&#x27;t stand the shit planning in Houston. Most property that I spoke of is pretty cheap too, with all the creature comforts and benefits of living in a major US&#x2F;global city.<p>Edit:- bdcravens summed it up nice. The DFW area is like 5 cities joined together, each having their own unique city centre and sprawl.<p>Austin might be capturing most of the cultural import and export in all of Texas, but I like the way Dallas has evolved, without changing its innate Texan characteristics as much as Austin. SV people might find it distasteful, but I think it&#x27;s a matter of personal preferences, and maybe I like it because I find it very distinct compared to what I&#x27;m used to (Central or Zone 2 London homes with a tiny garden).<p>That being said, I like Austin way more than the Bay area.')
