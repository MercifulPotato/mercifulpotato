Make no mistake, Tesla&#x27;s leadership consciously chose to let quality slide in order to meet the delivery volumes because the latter is what pumps stock prices. And they did this knowing it could (and did) very well lead to direct loss of life.<p>This is what would worry me as a potential customer. That the manufacturer selling me their product considers such disasters acceptable in order to ship a few more units. It&#x27;s not that often lately than manufacturers are willing to do this (think GM ignition key scandal, rather than VW pollution cheating).')
