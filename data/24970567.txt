You may not be familiar with the math, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it doesn&#x27;t exist. If you can model something well enough to understand it, then you can model it mathematically. There really isn&#x27;t any domain of knowledge that math is unsuitable for, excepting if you don&#x27;t know any relevant math to do.')
