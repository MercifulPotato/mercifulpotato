Roughly summarizing, either you put the source code onto the same medium that contains the object code, which is what xyzzy_plugh is alluding to, or you can put it onto a web server and accompany the object form with a written offer that it&#x27;s on that web server. See section &quot;6 Conveying Non-Source Forms&quot; of the GPL.<p>The GPL only requires you to make the source code accessible to those people who also get the binary from you, not everyone, but most entities just allow downloads for anybody. It&#x27;s more expensive to implement checking than it&#x27;s to just allow downloads for everyone. xyzzy_plugh is splitting hairs here.')
