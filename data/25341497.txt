It seems like they&#x27;re held to the lowest.</i><p>That&#x27;s a bit harsh. Standards (and holding to them) varies considerably by jurisdiction (and sometimes by precinct).<p>And before anyone accuses me of making a &quot;Not All Police&quot; argument or anything similar, I&#x27;ll point out that, generally speaking, poor enforcement of such standards (and harsher responses by officers) seem to be associated with communities that are poorer or have more minorities.<p>There are also issues with &#x27;problem officers&#x27; getting shuffled off to departments in other cities or states without adequate record keeping or sufficient scrutiny, which can result in them tending to collect or concentrate in certain places (and predictably, that makes it more likely that such officers will have like-minded colleagues that are willing to cover for them).<p>This is definitely a &quot;wicked problem&quot;.')
