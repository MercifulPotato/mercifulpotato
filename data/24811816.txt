And it would seem like one would need to be keenly aware of that in order to climb that ladder.<p>I say this as somebody rather uninterested in their social status (what&#x27;s the point of it?), who went from relative poverty to relative wealth and saw no difference in how much I care about either money or status. So, very much interested in understanding how this works for others. What am I missing?')
