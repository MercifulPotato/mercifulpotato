We might be able to cobble together a survival elsewhere, but I doubt we could ever thrive.<p>People on Earth thrived in the Arctic, which is incredibly far from the savannas of Africa, and did this with the technology of 10,000 years ago. Saying that people with the technology of 1000 years from now can&#x27;t possibly thrive on an airless rock is a little pessimistic to me.<p>And that&#x27;s ignoring space habitats, which would plausibly be better tuned to our human needs than Earth is.')
