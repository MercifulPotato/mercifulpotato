I was never proud of it per se, but proud of how far I&#x27;ve gotten without one (20 years as a dev, 9 years at Google). But always felt a sense of impostor syndrome and now I feel it even more pronounced as I&#x27;ve started to look for work elsewhere and wondering if I&#x27;m at a profound disadvantage: middle-aged, spent a bunch of time out of the mainstream industry inside Google using non-&quot;standard&quot; tech stacks, no CS degree, and the industry has shifted to interviewing standards that prioritize new grads (&quot;skill&quot; testing algorithm&#x2F;data structure questions that are far easier for people with recent CS class exposure, etc.)<p>And yeah, management track involves a lot more politics and organizational stuff than I really want to take on, at least within Google. I could see going mgmt track at a smaller company, but without recent experience they wouldn&#x27;t hire me on that path.')
