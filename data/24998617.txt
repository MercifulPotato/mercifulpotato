This kind of thing - if it evolves a little more on the ugliness side - might eventually fit the bill.  (To clarify: i have no care about the ugly aspect, but the same annoying clients who would benefit from this paradigm are the same ones who criticize apps because they&#x27;re not &quot;pretty enough&quot;...So, there&#x27;s that to consider.)')
