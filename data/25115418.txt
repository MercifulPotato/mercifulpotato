I&#x27;m down 43 since the start of lockdown, and I&#x27;d like to lose a few more.  So I know what a pain in the ass it is.  I&#x27;m also not under any illusion that my own choices aren&#x27;t huge factors in the weight gain to begin with.  But man, the way food is constructed today is practically criminal.  You can get fat off apples now.  The amount of sugar in everything is absurd.<p>Yes, people still put that in their mouth and therefore bear some responsibility, but I think it&#x27;s fair to say that the industry tries to obfuscate it so people can&#x27;t really understand what they&#x27;re eating.  How many different ingredient names are there for sugar?  A dozen?<p>I do firmly believe relying on willpower is a unlikely strategy to win.  Something like 95% of all people who try it that way gain it all back in less than 5 years.  Habit is my best weapon.  But finding foods that aren&#x27;t constructed from terrible ingredients is super important, because I don&#x27;t make all my meals from scratch.<p>Good luck, in any case.')
