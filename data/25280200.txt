It&#x27;s not a ray-tracer.  It works by taking line segments expressed as vectors in 3d space, and multiplying them through transformation matrices.  But there are no rasters; it outputs to a vector display.<p>I admit, that&#x27;s a rare example (though not unique; there&#x27;s a reason wire-frames, as a display mode, came into existence).  But I think it&#x27;s absurd to say that the rasterizer is the heart of the polygon-transforming approach; the heart is the transformation matrix.')
