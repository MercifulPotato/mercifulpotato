Yes it is true that they dramatically improved the state of their product which helped them substantially and that some of the novel delivery mechanisms are mainly PR hype, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s fair to disregard all the work they have done at all levels to simplify the delivery process.<p>Delivery from Dominoes is a seamless, reliable process. It is extremely easy to place orders however you want to place them; you can track the product through the stages of production and delivery in a highly granular way and be confident about when it will arrive; deliveries are fast, usually under 30 minutes; the product that is delivered always hits a certain level of quality in my experience; and you need basically zero interaction with a human to get it done.<p>Contrast this with food delivery services like Doordash which take FOREVER (eg &gt; 1 hour and frequently much longer than that); have unreliable tracking mechanisms and ETAs; result in food that usually arrives cold; are extremely expensive; always require interaction with a human; frequently result in mistakes; and have a dispute resolution process which basically involves Doordash et al saying not my problem or sorry but we don&#x27;t give refunds, here&#x27;s a 15% off coupon for your next order.')
