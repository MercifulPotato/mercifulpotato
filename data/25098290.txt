Wisteria comes to mind; it&#x27;s not as obvious until it&#x27;s in bloom. Other honorable mentions: Chinese privet, Asian Bittersweet, elaeagnus, and English Ivy. All of the aforementioned grow in my yard and their aggressive growth is unbelievable (especially elaeagnus... It&#x27;s a shrub that can climb like a vine!).')
