There clearly is room for improvement, and some level of concern is warranted, but it isn&#x27;t as much of a big deal as it seems, because surely at the higher level objects are remembered. To draw an analogy with human cognition, humans also aren&#x27;t consciously aware of all the objects in their field of view all the time, but that doesn&#x27;t mean they forget their existence.')
