Also WhatsApp for communicating with family in other countries, and my work computer has FaceTime. I can&#x27;t imagine what your app would bring that isn&#x27;t covered by one of these.<p>Which is not to say that you shouldn&#x27;t just build it anyway. Much like slack and zoom, your real customers probably aren&#x27;t people like me, but companies that want to adopt the technology to fill the office-culture-sized whole in all our hearts. And much like those apps, even if people like me don&#x27;t like the experience, it&#x27;s startups start adopting it, people use it')
