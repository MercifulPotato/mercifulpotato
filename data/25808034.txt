A lot of cloud workloads are not CPU bound. More often they&#x27;re IO bound.<p>Amazon&#x27;s Graviton2 and Ampere&#x27;s Altra are tackling that IO bound space. They have dozens of single thread cores, lots of memory channels, and lots of PCI Express lanes (64 and 128 respectively IIRC). They&#x27;re not slouches in CPU power but their IO is really impressive.<p>Having high power and high bandwidth chips at a fraction of the power of Xeons is a win for cloud providers. They can either get higher density in the same power&#x2F;cooling envelope or reduce their power&#x2F;cooling requirements for the same capacity. At cloud provider scale power is a major cost driver.')
