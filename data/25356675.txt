I can pair them with my TV but they don&#x27;t support volume control over Bluetooth so I can&#x27;t change their volume, they don&#x27;t have an interface for it on the device.<p>Meanwhile my Sony WH1000-XM3s work perfectly with my TV, including volume control, and work perfectly with everything else including my Apple devices.<p>I don&#x27;t have &quot;connectivity issues&quot; and battery life is 10hrs more than AirPods Max. They even included a stereo cable in the box to connect to the standard 3.5mm jack built-in to the headset, and they also came with a proper case to protect them when they&#x27;re in my rucksack. All for Â£330 less than AirPods Max.<p>It&#x27;s amazing that people think AirPods Max will be the first ever good set of on-ear wireless headphones.')
