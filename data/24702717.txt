She&#x27;s 40 and before this incredibly active, working out a few days a week, running our house and looking after the kids plus involved in loads of other activities and groups. Since she got ill it can take all her energy to get downstairs to sit on the sofa - with her heart rate peaking at over 180 just walking to get a drink. Her old resting heart rate was around 62.<p>Similar medical responses have been seen with other viruses before. I understand why people want to disbelieve&#x2F;find alternative ideas, but it is medically understood that viruses can cause serious responses like this. The question is why covid appears to cause more long cases than other viruses (SARS excepted).<p>That all said, I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if long covid sufferers END UP with anxiety and depression had 6 months plus of an unknown pathway through a new illness.')
