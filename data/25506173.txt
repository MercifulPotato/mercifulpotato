It&#x27;s cheap and produces a decent image.<p>However, the raw video can sometimes be a bit unflattering.<p>I would recommend using OBS as an intermediary between the webcam and other applications like Zoom or Skype. OBS has a virtual camera feature so that the output looks like just another webcam.<p>The reason you would do this is because OBS has powerful video filters you can overlay on top of the video feed, so that you can apply color correction and alter the brightness before sending it out. Even small changes can have a large impact on the quality of the video image quality.<p>I found this much more preferable to messing around with Logitech&#x27;s unwieldy software.')
