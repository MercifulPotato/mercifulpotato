It does seem like quite an important thing to be in the standard library given the kind of things Python is used for. It&#x27;s amazing how few developers actually understand timezones.<p>I found the Pendulum library [0] very intuitive when it comes to working with time. It makes it easy to do the right thing. For example, if you call `pendulum.now` it gives you a timestamp including your local timezone information. In other words, it preserves &quot;the time on the clock on the wall&quot;, which is lost if you do what so many people do and just take UTC timestamps.<p><pre><code>   pendulum.now()\n   # DateTime(2020, 5, 28, 13, 32, 1, 303100, tzinfo=Timezone(&#x27;Europe&#x2F;London&#x27;))\n</code></pre>\nDoing this in the standard library, or with pytz, is very unintuitive and often done incorrectly in practice.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pendulum.eustace.io&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pendulum.eustace.io&#x2F;</a>')
