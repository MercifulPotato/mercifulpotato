Liquidations usually involve shareholders pulling the plug. If the shareholders want the company to keep going but the government doesn’t, when you liquidate the assets, the old shareholders will simply re-purchase them and re-hire the same (or a similar) team. Not a lot done except hosing creditors and enriching lawyers.<p>Okay, so you ban former shareholders from buying. Who is most likely to be able to do the fire sale diligence? A competitor. Now you have a policy that promotes industrial concentration.<p>Fine, ban competitors. At this point, few deeply knowledgeable about the assets can bid. In most cases, a deep discount bid will take the cake. So a wealthy person will get assets at a discount from pension plans and individual investors.<p>Applying concepts like a “death penalty” to legal fictions is emotionally satisfying but economically dubious. I am actually surprised it hasn’t been suggested as a solution by large-company lobbyists. It creates lots of legal work. A back door for wiping out debts. And it enriches wealthy clients while sidestepping real consequences.')
