I&#x27;ve read the the free kindle sample now, which is already a couple hours of reading. I found the introduction and and overview very difficult to get through, even to the point of falling asleep. But the &quot;first interlude&quot; and &quot;stage one&quot; captured my attention better.<p>Although a bit verbose and repetitive at times, I liked the exploration of the concepts of attention and peripheral awareness. I may give the &quot;stage one&quot; instructions a try, and buy the rest of the book if it goes well.')
