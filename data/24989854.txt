But you&#x27;re right that every declared map is a just a pointer.<p>With respect to your second point, I see what you mean but I still don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a negative of Go. You can pass in copied values without having to have a deep_copy() primitive (loop map values and copy to new map, dereferencing a pointer, etc.). Like other parts of Go, if you want to make your data immutable there is no syntactic sugar. You have to explicitly write it out.')
