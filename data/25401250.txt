Item(by='jancsika', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607804020, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25400662, text='&gt; The first reply I got was something about the drama with some dude named Phil.<p>At least for Windows, can&#x27;t you just quickly compare the ethical universes? I&#x27;m assuming that Phil didn&#x27;t embrace-extend-extinguish other distros, Phil didn&#x27;t secretly change Skype to break the encryption for LE, and Phil didn&#x27;t upgrade the distro to do constant, inescapable telemetry and update arbitrarily downloading Gigs of data such that it interrupted a user&#x27;s live broadcast.<p>In other words, if your decision is between Phil&#x27;s distro and Windows, Phil&#x27;s distro wins so it&#x27;s the end of the story. And if the HN trolls you&#x27;re responding to aren&#x27;t claiming a 1:1 feature correspondence with &quot;ethical&quot; distro vs. Manjaro, who cares?')
