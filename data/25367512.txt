I&#x27;m arguing that developers don&#x27;t want to pay for any infrastructure improvements needed to keep services operating in the same manner with more people. Like everyone else, they&#x27;re self interested and will act in ways that maximize their own interests, even if it externalizes certain costs to the surrounding community. I suspect it&#x27;s also more expensive per person to upgrade existing infrastructure compared to building it new.<p>In terms of who should improve infrastructure, it doesn&#x27;t really matter who does it, but I think either local government or the developer should be required to do it and not be allowed to let things slide. I focus on the developer because they&#x27;re the first in the process, but it doesn&#x27;t matter if instead the city requires the developer to build in the infrastructure improvement costs and does it themselves. The only position I have is that it should get done.')
