They are staying involved with IndyCar which is not hybrid at the moment.<p>The real reason for them pulling out is probably the economic downturn and expected losses Honda will generate. Getting out of a expensive project like F1 makes sense although I am struggling to understand why they can&#x27;t continue on, engines will be almost &quot;frozen&quot; in the next few years.<p>One explanation I have is that Honda was funding Red Bull, just like they were paying McLaren to use their engines. Giving away money to Red Bull just so that you can spend more money to produce the engines doesn&#x27;t make sense commercially. To be clear, I am speculating about this as I do not know the details of Honda-Red Bull contract.')
