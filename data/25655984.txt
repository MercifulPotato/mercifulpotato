I tried it with this small dialogue, and then edited together two voices in Reaper from the downloads:<p>Bob: “Hello, John.”<p>John: “Oh, hello there, Bob.”<p>Bob: “Yes, hello. It&#x27;s what I said. Why do you keep repeating what I say, John?”<p>John: “I didn&#x27;t repeat you! I merely said hello, you dimwit!”<p>Bob: “There you go, being condescending again. Fuck you!”<p>John: “What? You&#x27;re the one who started it!”<p>Try it yourself, or write something different. Either way, good fun!')
