Solving one doesn&#x27;t solve the other.<p>I disagree. If incarcerating people weren&#x27;t an effective method of both denying people you don&#x27;t like a vote <i>and</i> stealing their voting power for the people in your state that you aren&#x27;t excluding through incarceration, there&#x27;d be a lot less incentive for mass incarceration.<p>Of course, that&#x27;s an argument for making voting for the incarcerated the first focus, since it naturally makes it easier to solve the other problem.')
