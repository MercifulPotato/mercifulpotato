Item(by='conanbatt', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604258301, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24934981, text='&gt; Yeah though when it collapses, i.e. due to foreign policy, local government will likely end up with the costs tearing down abandoned houses and a drop in real estate tax even on everything, I believe they call that phenomenon &quot;Detroit&quot;.<p>That&#x27;s an idea of what could happen, but it is not what is happening. Of course it would be better if the properties bought by foreigners were rented out, and the incentives to do so are very strong already (making rent money!), but even if they aren&#x27;t, the worst case scenario is an eventual reposession of the property meaning again that Canada is one house-worth richer!')
