But I don&#x27;t on what technology exactly should I focus on and where to start?<p><i>Is it true that today most of iOS Jobs Opportunities are mainly for MVVM and RxSwift devs?<p></i>I know basics of SwiftUI - it&#x27;s awesome but does anyone even use that in real products? Basing on my experience most of companies still bases on old UIKit. Should I start my new product in SwiftUI today?<p>*I got through concepts of RXSwift and even started to understand basics, but It looks like RxSwift would be dead soon because of Combine and SwiftUI. RxCocoa is great idea but it&#x27;s a really heavy lib based on &quot;old&quot; UIKit.<p>Any advices what should I do? Maybe someone could share me couple of GitProjects which would shows how app are be made in 2020?\nThanks')
