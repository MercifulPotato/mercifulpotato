Item(by='himinlomax', descendants=None, kids=[25159596, 25160191, 25159513], score=None, time=1605871392, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25159351, text='&gt; That is a fine argument as long as your game actually is historically accurate<p>See, that makes some sense if you&#x27;re doing high fantasy and shit that&#x27;s set in a wholly fictional world.<p>But just because some parts of a game are not realistic does not mean you should just forget about even trying. It makes no sense.<p>&gt; If your samurai game includes werewolves and machine guns you don&#x27;t get to turn around say you didn&#x27;t add something because it wouldn&#x27;t be historically accurate<p>You&#x27;re treating this as if it was an excuse for some sin. If I want to make a werewolf story in Belle Ã‰poque Paris, there could be some historically accurate black African representation, but if the setting is the middle Ages it would be just stupid and lazy -- UNLESS there is some effort to bring some lore into it.<p>And that&#x27;s the main problem I have here. Suspension of disbelief and all that. Just adding $tokenblack012 and $eastasian499 to a setting where they don&#x27;t implicitly belong is just lazy pandering.')
