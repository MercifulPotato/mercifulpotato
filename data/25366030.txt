They were all clearly gay, which isn&#x27;t unusual in Marfa.  I started talking with them and it turned out that one of them, who was black, had just bought a ranch a half hour north of Marfa outside the town of Fort Davis.  Fort Davis also has a bit of a touristy feel with its exaggerated &quot;old western town&quot; look and because it&#x27;s right outside Fort Davis State Park, but culturally it&#x27;s no Marfa.<p>The fact that an openly gay black man felt comfortable buying farmland in a small Texas town was pretty awesome.  I have a hard time believing that would&#x27;ve happened even 10 years ago. In fact, he might be the first.<p>I hope he still likes it there.')
