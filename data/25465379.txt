Lockdowns have failed.<p>Remember Sweden was supposed to see 25x hospital overflow and 100,000+ excess deaths according to the models. Instead they have seen a basically normal year in which excess deaths might come in to about 2,000 to 3,000 by the time December is counted.<p>Meanwhile, lockdowns were meant to just last a few weeks to help ride out a temporary exceedance of hospital capacity. 9 months later people are still locked down with no end in sight, considering that many vaccines don&#x27;t attempt to halt transmission. Meanwhile there are no correlations visible between severity of lockdown and healthcare outcomes. None. It is a 100% and total failure as a policy.<p>The media and international establishment types have been pumping out anti-Swedish propaganda for a long time now. You have to double check it carefully to notice it&#x27;s false. For example, ICU capacity is extremely flexible. Sweden more than doubled it via a variety of mostly administrative means in the first wave and never ran out, even though in the first wave there were more hospitalisations than in the second. The occupancy figures that get thrown around are thus frequently meaningless because the denominator can change so fast. As for &quot;thinking of requesting private nurses to help&quot;, is that meant to indicate a crisis?  Why should anyone turn their lives upside down to avoid hospital managers having to do such trivial and basic things?<p>Meanwhile, lockdowns caused a significant fraction (nearly half) of all excess death in the UK in the first wave, and there&#x27;s significant evidence that COVID is being significantly over-classified even on death certificates in the second wave. The economic destruction will undermine healthcare spending for years or even decades to come. The destruction of confidence in public health officials and &#x27;scientists&#x27; is even more severe. It&#x27;s a catastrophic policy that Sweden correctly ignored, and their reward is a basically normal year:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.statista.com&#x2F;statistics&#x2F;525353&#x2F;sweden-number-of-deaths&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.statista.com&#x2F;statistics&#x2F;525353&#x2F;sweden-number-of-...</a>')
