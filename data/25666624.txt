Item(by='mikedilger', descendants=None, kids=[25667025, 25667014], score=None, time=1609987172, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25665316, text='We must be able to discuss and even support things that are currently illegal, including discussion of acts of violence (but not carrying them out, just talking about them), to explore whether or not existing laws might need changes. So this cannot be the boundary between allowed and disallowed speech.<p>In this particular case, I would quickly argue &quot;Hell no, storming the US Capital is illegal for good cause, and I will never condone such acts of violence.&quot;  But I would allow the discussion.  We have to allow the discussion.  Because if you draw a line here, then you will be censored when you argue for things like marijuana legalisation and gay marraige while they are still illegal as McCarthyites will censor you based on inciting people to break the law.<p>This is why &#x27;incitement&#x27; has such a high bar.<p>I could be wrong. Maybe &quot;praise and support for &#x2F;storming&#x2F;&quot; is incitement to violence. I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;m not a judge that has to make that call. So long as the line isn&#x27;t drawn on the wrong side of the points I argued above.')
