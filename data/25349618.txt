The point of your speakers&#x2F;headphones being as flat as possible isn&#x27;t because it&#x27;s the inherently best experience for everyone, it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s the most <i>flexible</i> experience. You can take a good set of flat headphone and ram the bass through the roof - it&#x27;ll still sound great. You can&#x27;t really do the reverse. You can try to equalize a bass-heavy headphone into something more neutral, but the result is worse overall, and a lot more finicky as a user.')
