And also that you didn&#x27;t know about it for years?<p>On the flip side of the coin, there are plenty of open source authors who release their work into the wild and refuse to support or even engage with downstream packagers because they see any other distribution or use of their work as Not Their Problem. And they&#x27;re not really wrong, building a supportive community around a useful project is totally optional after all.<p>Between the constant stream of version bumps, security updates, patching, bug triaging, and user support, distribution maintenance seems to be the most thankless job in the open source world.')
