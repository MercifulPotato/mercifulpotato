Item(by='falcolas', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605210627, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25073230, text='Adding information - warnings - would help:<p>- Distracted drivers, bringing their attention back to the hazards on the road.<p>- Fatigued drivers, by alerting them to a hazard they missed.<p>- Drunk... yeah, probably won&#x27;t help much here. Hopefully we can get to the point where you can&#x27;t start such cars while impaired by alcohol.<p>- Speeding - again, improving knowledge of hazards, such as corners they can&#x27;t navigate at the current speed, or vehicles which are at drastically slower&#x2F;faster speeds.<p>Don&#x27;t be quick to dismiss how technology can augment humans. Anything a car can learn to eventually handle on its own, it can notify a human about on a much faster time scale (as in it won&#x27;t be the perpetual 3 years away, it could be now, since we don&#x27;t have to perfect the reaction, just the detection).<p>And, perhaps most importantly for you, this doesn&#x27;t preclude the development and deployment of fully automatic driving systems when they&#x27;re actually at level 4&#x2F;5. In the mean time, we can make a meaningful and broad drop in the vehicle accident statistics.<p>EDIT: Since this may not be clear - I expect this information and these warnings to be coming 4-5 seconds before an incident would occur, giving the driver classes you&#x27;ve pointed out sufficient time to react.')
