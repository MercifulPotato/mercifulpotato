Item(by='jraph', descendants=None, kids=[24857972], score=None, time=1603371149, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24857223, text='&gt; Why is this getting downvoted? He&#x27;s right. Refute his points instead of downvoting him.<p>&gt;&gt; I think the only reason people enjoy it is the fact that they have not gotten a chance to really spend time in a good tiling window manager on X11&#x2F;GNU&#x2F;Linux<p>I don&#x27;t like Windows, but its UI is not that bad, come on.<p>Moreover, I use GNU&#x2F;Linux full time but I don&#x27;t use a tiling manager. My windows are fullscreen most of the time, and the rest of the time the features that allow putting windows on the corners or the sides (with the keyboard or the mouse) are more than enough. Tiling window managers are not for everyone.<p>I didn&#x27;t downvote but to me the message shows a lack of observation on how people use computers.<p>The update manager that popups a notification or a dialog box or reboots in the middle of a presentation or a movie or something and, to add insult to injury, the system taking its time to apply the updates during the next startup? <i>that</i> could be embarrassing.<p>Convenient UX features from the Linux world lacking on Windows are a thing (selection &#x2F; middle click paste?), but Windows UI seems excellent. It&#x27;s just <i>less</i> excellent than Plasma obviously, but it&#x27;s nothing short of bad or embarrasing.')
