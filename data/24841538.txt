He has been going back, visiting family, friends and random people and interviewed them, and it is frankly heartbreaking to witness the struggle the the &#x27;average joe&#x27; has to endure.<p>I&#x27;m living well below the poverty line here in Norway, but it is nothing compared to being poor in America. I do not need to worry about health care or expensive insurance. Me and my partner own an old but nice house with a big garden in a semi-rural community (15min from the nearest city), and can afford all the basic necessities by being frugal. In America, we would have lived in constant fear of becoming ill, seeing a doctor or going to the hospital. The idea that you have no real safety net to help you in tough times is terrifying. I can only begin to imagine the stress that goes with it.<p>I have great sympathy for regular people who are struggling, that voted for Trump. They have long been ignored, neglected and forgotten, and I am sure many voted for him either in desperation or to defy the system they rightly feel have left them behind. People in Norway couldn&#x27;t imagine how the American people could vote for such an obvious  clown and a demagogue, but we have not seen the extent of the suffering and hardship before recently. We see the Hollywood version of your culture for the most part, and are shocked when we find out that American women actually have to pay the hospital when giving birth (&quot;wtf, it isn&#x27;t covered by paying taxes?&quot;).<p>I really hope that it gets better, but am afraid it has to get worse first.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tv.nrk.no&#x2F;serie&#x2F;uxa-thomas-seltzers-amerika" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tv.nrk.no&#x2F;serie&#x2F;uxa-thomas-seltzers-amerika</a> (Norwegian language, but many segments are in English)')
