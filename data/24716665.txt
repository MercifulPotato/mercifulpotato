It makes this high  pitched sound you cringe at, right?.<p>Someone is doing that slowly, and the chalk is tiny, so the sound is not super loud, and can be covered by music, people talking etc.<p>But that person keeps scratching all the time. A little bit. Every second of every minute, of every quiet moment at home, in the mountains, in your electric supposedly-quiet car, of your every mindfulness meditation practice. For years.<p>So can you &quot;tune out&quot;? Maybe if you dull your senses and have laser focused attention for most of the day. But it keeps coming back. And again, and again. It can be confusing, annoying, funny, or just be there. Your reactions vary, as you learn to adjust to it (if you try to).<p>But &quot;tune out&quot; suggests once it&#x27;s done, it&#x27;s gone.<p>This is never gone, it&#x27;s the opposite of gone - it&#x27;s there even if I stop breathing!<p>(1) Actual nature of the sound varies between people.')
