Apple hasn&#x27;t made any computing breakthroughs.<p>They got a lot of gains by going super-wide to extract obvious parallel performance. They are now at the point where adding more units costs more than it offers (at present). Their fundamental advantage over x86 is that aarch64 is less quirky, so implementing good ideas takes less time.<p>Their only &quot;easy&quot; dial left is ramping clocks, but that&#x27;s linear power scaling, so it doesn&#x27;t matter too much for their portable electronics. I&#x27;d guess they&#x27;ll be focusing a lot more on data locality and caching. It&#x27;s probably 5-10% gains every couple years from here on out.')
