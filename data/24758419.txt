Side projects are often shallow and its better to use new tech in real job instead of side projects.<p>I feel most of us would disagree with that. All new jobs in my career were result of learning something new on side projects. Recruiters show that as passion for learning. Many jobs don&#x27;t allow for much exploration and you don&#x27;t have leverage to call shots. It&#x27;s usually uphill battle to even introduce any significant changes in large stable products. Also, side projects shouldn&#x27;t be just for goal of finding new jobs and making recruiters happy anyway. It should be for passion for creating things, realizing ideas.')
