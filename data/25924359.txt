I looked for those using the search feature and just tabulated what was most commonly recommended.  That ended up being the Steelcase Leap, which is the one I got (or rather, the Leap V2).<p>Most importantly, I bought from a reputable place that did free returns.<p>Not much to it, really.  The price tag is what really made it hard for me to pull the trigger.  But after the fact I can say that, while this chair may or may not be &quot;perfect&quot;, it&#x27;s 10x better than the cheap one it replaced.  So yeah, worth every penny.')
