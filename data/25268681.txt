We enable our customers to manage their business in a more efficient way by solving their problem of software and data fragmentation. The average medium-sized company today uses over 100 different applications and 200 devices, and keeping all of those up and running in sync requires constant attention and manual work. We believe there is a better way.<p>Technically, we i) consolidate a number of core business systems that every modern company today requires into a singular workbench for all departments and ii) manage all other third party applications and devices seamlessly used by our customers via our baked-in integration layer. Ultimately, we are building a new generation of business software that is native to the API economy and making use of its full value. We are currently operating in stealth mode and are freshly funded by Lakestar and Village Global, the venture firm backed by some of the worldâ€™s most successful entrepreneurs including Jeff Bezos, Eric Schmidt and Mark Zuckerberg.<p>What we are still lacking are a few talented fullstack Javascript engineers to complement our core team. Depending on experience, there are are several fullstack engineer positions and a tech lead role available, all of which come with at least 1% of equity. For the right person, we will even offer a cofounder position with the adequate amount of equity.<p>You can find more information under <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.getrubik.com&#x2F;careers" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.getrubik.com&#x2F;careers</a> but feel free to get in touch with me directly (chris@getrubik.com).')
