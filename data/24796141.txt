It is causing an intelligence crisis in the country because anyone can register a $20 domain, throw a WordPress blog on it, post some fake partisan smut and have it go viral.<p>You have freedom of speech. You don&#x27;t have freedom to build a cult out of gullible people. Back in the 1990s when we were kids the only people on the internet were people smart enough to be there. Misinformation didn&#x27;t have the reach it does now because the surfing public was mostly techie people with above average intelligence.<p>The bar has been dropped and now everyone is on the internet. There&#x27;s &quot;proof&quot; of every concept on the internet. And no central repository for truth that everyone trusts.<p>There&#x27;s a difference between being pro-speech and being anti-weaponization-of-falsehoods.<p>And then there&#x27;s the issue of Facebook spending billions of dollars on code and infrastructure. How would you like it if you developed a social network, discovered that terrorists were using it as part of their deception campaign, and then have the government FORCE you to participate in the terrorist plot that you, your shareholders, and your engineers don&#x27;t agree with? How is that fair to Facebook, who invested their resources into developing the entire platform? Maybe before the GOP wants to use disinformation campaigns they should have thought about developing their own distribution network beforehand? I mean you can&#x27;t seriously be mad at Facebook for being good at capitalism, can you?')
