It&#x27;s kind of what I thought Minecraft might have (should have) developed into but it never really had the sort of accessible development tools that Roblox has. To the best of my knowledge there&#x27;s still no official visual development toolset of that sort. A real missed opportunity. Seeing what modders had been doing with it for years should have lit a fire under Microsoft on that front. Heck I thought that was the whole reason they bought Minecraft.')
