Item(by='TheRealDunkirk', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609249533, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25566512, text='&gt; I think they exist, but they don&#x27;t appeal to younger people.<p>I live in the mid-west, where these organizations were very common. I&#x27;m ~50 years old, and I don&#x27;t know ANYONE who&#x27;s in one of them, and every one of them around the area that I drive by is in disrepair. I expect them to disappear with the boomer generation.<p>Another feature of my location are all the small &quot;mainline&quot; churches (Presbyterian, Methodist, et. al.), who hover around 30-50 people, and have no members younger than 60. There&#x27;s a business opportunity coming to buy up a lot of prime real estate when these churches fold in another 10 years.<p>I think a huge problem with finding &quot;community&quot; now is the utter isolation caused by social media and access to the thinnest slice of the news you want to tolerate. It has created a culture where people are only tolerant to their SPECIFIC view of the world, and it&#x27;s just really hard to find people who think EXACTLY like you.')
