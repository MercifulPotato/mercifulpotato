Those limitations might be impassable. Or it might be possible that there is a higher physics where things like the speed of light are bypassed. Like discovering that quantum entanglement is based on some mechanism that can be manipulated to communicate faster than light, or one can skip over distances through higher dimensions, or we decode the source code of the automata that creates the universe and it&#x27;s immediately replaced by one even more bizarre. There are some theories that this has already happened :)<p>The point is it&#x27;s arrogant to say what&#x27;s impossible for all time, because nearly everything we do today was impossible a short thousand years ago.')
