If you could save 90% by such optimizations, you&#x27;re at a very early stage of your application. Otherwise, this would&#x27;ve been spotted earlier. But in a larger system, these things can be around for some time but it&#x27;s unlikely that fixing them brings an overall performance boost of 90%. More like 3% here, 5% there and so on.<p>Edit: And I agree: I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised to find a SELECT * and a call to size() in a moderately sized system.')
