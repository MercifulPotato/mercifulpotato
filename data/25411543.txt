Compare:<p>(I ate all the chocolate candies) and (I ate all the waffles)<p>I ate everything that was (chocolate candy and waffles).<p>In the first example, the intersection is in the set of things that happened. In the second, it is in the set of things.<p>It&#x27;s merely a convention that &quot;I ate all the chocolates and waffles&quot; means the first of these while &quot;I ate all the chocolate waffles&quot; means the second.<p>This is similar to how even if <i></i> means &quot;power&quot; unambiguously, 2 <i></i> 3 <i></i> 5 doesn&#x27;t mean one thing until you put parentheses in (explicitly or by convention).')
