I did that about 10-15 times before I realized if I want to travel or get out of the city it&#x27;s going to get expensive pretty quickly. I ended up buying one soon after. Having access to a car all of a sudden entirely changed how I spent my weekends. I wasn&#x27;t dependent on friends. What the OP describes is also very true. When I have to plan ahead and rent a car and deal with taking and dropping it off I avoided it as much as I can. This was with a zipcar membership and a whole bunch of rental cars two blocks from where I lived.')
