The hurdle for the new agency rule is to demonstrate that this is not a violation of civil rights under the American&#x27;s with Disabilities Act. For the past thirty years (almost) that&#x27;s tended to be a high bar. How high? Well emotional support animals were flying because the airline industry didn&#x27;t want to test it in court.<p>The agency rule gives the airlines additional cover. But an agency rule doesn&#x27;t usually trump federal statute and the ADA doesn&#x27;t explicitly delegate interpretation to ordinary federal agencies. Just the DoJ and the DoJ can be challenged in the Federal courts.<p>It might be over, but I wouldn&#x27;t go all in betting on it. YMMV.')
