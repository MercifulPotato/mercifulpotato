Still, I don&#x27;t think that is enough to be against it.<p>I live in an apartment and charging an EV would cost way more than gas. Even the cost of having a charging pole would be more expensive per month than I pay for gas (charging not included and likely also expensive). And, as you mentioned, be way more inconvenient in some situations.<p>But can&#x27;t it still be worth it? It is just one, very minor, out of countless sacrifices we will undoubtedly have to make.<p>Why fight this one?')
