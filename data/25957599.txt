Like house-odds gambling (which, has negative &quot;fundamental value&quot;), people still do it.<p>Now, as for whether there are enough of these crazy types to actually push the price of GME up this much - i&#x27;m skeptical. I suspect that it&#x27;s a battle between different hedge funds who first caught on to this small group of crazies on wsb, and saw an opportunity.')
