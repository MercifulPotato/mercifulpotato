Item(by='nkurz', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604007057, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24935264, text='&gt; This was a calculated move to paint all the protesters as rioters<p>I don&#x27;t think this is true.  Quoting from his piece:<p>&quot;Some elites have excused this orgy of violence in the spirit of radical chic, calling it an understandable response to the wrongful death of George Floyd. Those excuses are built on a revolting moral equivalence of rioters and looters to peaceful, law-abiding protesters. A majority who seek to protest peacefully shouldnâ€™t be confused with bands of miscreants.&quot;<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;06&#x2F;03&#x2F;opinion&#x2F;tom-cotton-protests-military.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;06&#x2F;03&#x2F;opinion&#x2F;tom-cotton-protes...</a><p>He clearly says in plain words that the majority are law-abiding protestors.  I suppose you could argue that the piece actually means something other than the plain words that it uses, and you could certainly argue that he&#x27;s drawing the line between protestors and rioters in the wrong place, but at no point does the op-ed make the claim that all protestors are rioters.')
