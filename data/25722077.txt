Perhaps it could even be argued that in the 90s MS had even less control than FB or Apple or Google in that MS (at least in the 90s) did not limit what you could install the way &quot;app stores&quot; today do.<p>That said, Microsoft has never had the kind of overall control and influence that FAANGS do today in that they really did not collect &quot;telemetry&quot; nor maintain tracking on everything you did (at least as far as the 90s goes).<p>I want to be clear that I&#x27;m not saying they would not have if they had realized the value of knowing every last thing about you the way that some companies do today. Just that they did not, and today&#x27;s &quot;giants&quot; clearly have more influence and control over individuals than MS ever did.')
