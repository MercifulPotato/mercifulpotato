It is a turn off - I can&#x27;t commit upfront to that amount of time to something entirely unknown to me.<p>Especially since in a lot of series I&#x27;ve watched, they often lose their way and 99 times out 100 the last 2 or 3 seasons inevitably decay into a &quot;will-they-wont-they&quot; thing about two characters falling in love or whatever, and the rest of the cast and whatever made the series good originally is mostly ignored. Then they&#x27;re cancelled. So e.g. Lost, US Office, that 70s show and many more all went on <i>way</i> too long while dancing around with romance between two characters etc etc while ignoring what made the first season or two appealing.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I love binge watching something good and I am disappointed when I run out of episodes or whatever, but it is good for people to know when to end a show and leave people with good memories, rather than turning it into a death march where people are relieved to just have finished the show.<p>Give me 8 to 10 <i>good</i> episodes per season, and please don&#x27;t string it out for 7, 8, 9 seasons when there is only enough ideas for 2 or maybe rarely 3 seasons&#x27;s worth of episodes.')
