The way I read between the lines, most sounded like there was money coming from somewhere, but it wasn’t the business they were play-acting while on vacation. That, or it just wasn’t going as well as they thought. Setting up camp chairs outside a McDonald’s? I’d rather stay home. Turning a Tesla into a camper? You’ve done this before, right? No? Good luck with all of the new problems you discover.<p>From my POV, it read as folks with money and privilege discovering that money and privilege can’t smooth over every problem. It’s not unusual for the NYT, and if you think it is, read the weekend section where a couple “just starting out” has a budget of $2MM, and which 900 sq. ft. condo should they buy with that pittance?')
