How do you expect the author to &quot;make search powerful&quot;? This system is clearly in the context of a desktop&#x2F;NAS filesystem, so they&#x27;re stuck with whatever search systems exist.

You don&#x27;t need to know what a plain ID means, because the only reason to use it is in context.<p>&gt; What if categories do overlap?<p>There&#x27;s nothing to stop you from tagging things in addition to using this system, if you want.<p>&gt; dismisses search without giving any reason<p>Again, the author is not building their own document storage system.<p>&gt; Additional metadata<p>This system is trying to solve the problem of having to supply a bunch of information to find <i>a specific document</i>.<p>Overall, there are lots of anecdotes here about how this system is useful in some situations.
