I was in one of the first cohorts which were not forced to serve in the army.<p>Here, conscription was even considered a way to balance sex-related work opportunities, since it was a burden on men only, hence women who entered the workforce were a bit advantaged.<p>I agree that the experience can be good, but YMMV a lot: many of my friends were happy to serve and learned a lot, but many others were shocked and some never fully recovered. Such a life won&#x27;t fit everybody.<p>Also, it takes quite a lot of time in your life even when you would like to do something else. I think that a &quot;serve your country&quot; 6&#x2F;12 months period, to be done by everybody by the time you&#x27;re 25 or so, that you can plan, could be useful.')
