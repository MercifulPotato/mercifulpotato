But &quot;better&quot; is also better. I&#x27;m not trying to make things more complex, we need to simplify our message if we want to change opinions at this time.<p>I&#x27;m settling on &quot;brainwashed&quot; for now. &quot;Insane&quot; colloquially removes the sense of responsibility and even has a positive connotation at times.

We can use the word brainwashed to recognize that these individuals still deserve punishment, but also recognize that there&#x27;s a greater-source of influence we also must dismantle.<p>---------<p>The dude who has 10,000 edits on Wikipedia is &quot;insane&quot;. A runner who completes 4:40 mile run is &quot;insane&quot;. The mob who stormed the Capitol are BRAINWASHED.<p>&quot;Brainwashed&quot; fits better than &quot;insane&quot;.')
