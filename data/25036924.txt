It _is_ sort of ironic there are quite a few open source 3d printers but no open source 2d printers.<p>I really like the simplicity of the Creality Ender3. The controller board is an Arduino and it uses commodity stepper drivers and stepper motors. The complicated specialized parts are the hot-end, which has now been somewhat standardized.<p>Would an open source laser be out of reach? Maybe we could pick a cheap, readily-available toner cartridge and design a printer around it.')
