But once you have the space and equipment and you&#x27;re sure you can handle everything safely you still need to staff this and build up some institutional knowledge.&quot; If you&#x27;re thinking this far, you should ask why 65nm? Because it&#x27;s a process node you know a certain microprocessor was built on? It&#x27;s just a benchmark that&#x27;s useful for working out your sense of what it costs to do these from scratch?<p>The cheapest way to get the equipment would be buying out a fab that&#x27;s shutting down. When I was in undergrad, I got to play in a 5 micron (5000nm) fab on campus because the previous owner of all the equipment gifted it to the university instead of scrapping it. My gut sense is that there&#x27;s nothing at 65nm that&#x27;s unprofitable yet, so you&#x27;re not getting cheap stuff.<p>(a 6 micron node was commercialized in 1974, this university lab was opened in 1993. 65nm was commercialized in 2005. While Moore&#x27;s Law held, more or less, through much of 1974-2005, I think we can say that the difficulties and necessary capital investments increased super-linearly over that time. And 20 year old manufacturing tech seems much more useful now than it did in &#x27;93. The STM32 family of microcontrollers, a very strong line, is spread over the 132-40nm range of process nodes.)')
