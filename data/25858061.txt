What does it do? It encapsulates try&#x2F;finally blocks and only try&#x2F;finally. That is a weirdly specific thing to encapsulate. Why did they do that? Well, it turns out that making an anonymous block syntax that is compatible with Python’s grammar is hard, so you can’t have the equivalent of this JavaScript:<p><pre><code>    WithOpen(filename, f =&gt; {\n        &#x2F;&#x2F; block\n    })\n</code></pre>\nBecause blocks aren’t viable, problems have to be solved on a case-by-case basis, which is hard to do well and leaves gaps.')
