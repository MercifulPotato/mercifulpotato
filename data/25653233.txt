Our natural wake up times are mostly determined by the sun, so on average, a person who naturally wakes up at 10 am standard time on Saturday will just wake up at 11 am instead. You end up with exactly the same amount of daylight!<p>The way that we <i>experience</i> time isn&#x27;t something a law can change.')
