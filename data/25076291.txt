In many ways it&#x27;s great: no commute, I can still get work done during Zoom meetings, etc.<p>However I&#x27;ve also noticed I have a certain &quot;motivation gap&quot;. Once I engage in a task, I&#x27;m all there, no different than in the office, but it&#x27;s sometimes harder to take that first step.<p>Has anyone had a similar experience? If so, any tips to overcome this?<p>What about other pitfall of WFH?')
