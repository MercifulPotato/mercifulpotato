That number is 10 years old, so there is definitely a little room for error. But if the estimated total of <i>on street</i> parking spaces in NYC is at 3M, that puts metered parking at just 2-3% of the total <i>on street spaces</i> citywide.<p>If you were to double or triple that number(which is unlikely), that still means the vast majority of parking in NYC is absolutely free of charge. That 3M number also doesn&#x27;t take into account all of the &#x27;No standing&#x27;, &#x27;No parking&#x27;, sidewalks or bike lanes which have been repurposed into parking by people with parking placards, PBA cards, or whatever other miscellaneous artifacts allow drivers to leave their cars wherever they want with impunity[1].<p>What I find amazing is that people have an expectation of being able to bring a several thousand pound object that is bigger than many NYer&#x27;s kitchens, into one of the densest parts of the country that is served 24&#x2F;7 by public transit and for-hire vehicles, and store it for free. Even tourists with tiny suitcases have to pay to store their suitcase somewhere.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nyc.streetsblog.org&#x2F;2011&#x2F;03&#x2F;22&#x2F;new-york-has-81875-metered-parking-spaces-and-millions-of-free-ones&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nyc.streetsblog.org&#x2F;2011&#x2F;03&#x2F;22&#x2F;new-york-has-81875-me...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;placardabuse" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;placardabuse</a>')
