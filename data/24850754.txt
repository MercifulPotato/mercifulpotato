Item(by='qppo', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603305773, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24848907, text='Total anecdotes, but when I last did the interview gauntlet it included some game studios and I found the hiring pipeline was bisected for the engine&#x2F;dev tools and games themselves. I was looking at jobs on the former because of my experience, but they pretty consistently hire. The latter seems like a crap shoot where you have to get contacted by a recruiter right around the time the studio decides to throw bodies at a game.<p>I&#x27;ve had zero luck with blind applications, every interview I had came from headhunters who sought me out.')
