For instance, the creators asked scientists to estimate the efficiency of solar panels at the time, and computed the area needed for the space stations they drew. Truly incredible that they went to these lengths.<p>Nonetheless, it is very dated. Fusion power looks a lot worse today than it did back in 2003. The fusion-powered space Jovian exploration ship would be right at home in today&#x27;s sci-fi (just as much the future today as then), but He-3 as a reason to go into space as been eviscerated. People who still (unrealistically) hope for a fusion game-changer are more often touting proton-Boron, and He-3 doesn&#x27;t even fundamentally change problems of ignition conditions and radiation, it just mitigates it.<p>They also didn&#x27;t do much to predict radical reduction in launch costs. In the PlanetES world, it still felt very expensive to get into space. They didn&#x27;t go unless they had a corporate sponsor or were filthy rich. I don&#x27;t even remember anything that hinted at booster re-usability, which is now (astonishingly) reality.<p>There&#x27;s also the obvious fact that sending people to do trash pickup was always more Hollywood than reality. They knew that then.')
