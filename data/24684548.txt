And my god, the noise! It&#x27;s like the sky was being torn to shreds.  The sensory experience is&#x2F;was definitely a huge part of being a live spectator. I&#x27;ve been to a few other kinds of races, and nothing ever really came close to that. Just the raw power&#x2F;pure violence of those cars coming out of a turn with that ear splitting shriek is just phenomenal.<p>That being said, the booz fueled americana tailgate party weekend that is the indy 500 is pretty high up there in great times.  But the actual racing was waaaaaay super less entertaining.')
