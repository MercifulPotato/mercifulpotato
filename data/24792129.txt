The main issue for me is that I never delete <i>anything</i>, and so I have nearly 500GB of email, dating back over 20 years (sadly I&#x27;ve lost earlier email due to the cost of even local storage back in those days).  I don&#x27;t want to deal with the data in any way, sorting through it, splitting it up, etc.  I just want to dump it all into an email account and have it forever.  Many of the alternatives that offer good privacy top out at 20GB or so for their most expensive plan (or less).<p>Tutanota was the one service I found that let you add (IIRC) arbitrary amounts of storage to your plan, but I found their web interface to be kinda clunky, and let the account expire.  I keep wanting to look into this again, but never get around to it.')
