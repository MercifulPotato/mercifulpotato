Just open the box and find a awkard UI, terrible Menu interface, and generally poor experience.  Try any new TV, then try a new Roku.  I find the roku experience much better, and it&#x27;s got clients for anything you can name.  I use Netflix, Amazon prime, and youtube mostly, but there&#x27;s 100s of others.  Roku seems pretty good with keeping their devices up to date software wise for many years.  It&#x27;s also way cheaper to upgrade a roku than replacing a TV.')
