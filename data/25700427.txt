No! Data is simply data, and data is inherently dynamic&quot;<p>I think I disagree with this one. Yes data are inherently dynamic but every data usually have types associated with it. For me type is like rule. Eg u8 is a 8 bit unsigned int which is 0-255 is just a rule.<p>In English we have grammar which is rule or another type so to speak. a-zA-z etc doesn&#x27;t make meaning on its own but a combination of rules make it meaningful and beautiful.<p>Thank You.')
