What is and is not possible?<p>General rule: don&#x27;t give anyone data you care about keeping secret or private unless you have a clear understanding of their security procedures.<p>I assume any data I hand over to any organization is available to anyone else, particularly a mafia or government, unless extraordinary, auditable measures are taken: e2e encryption, open-source, 2fa, etc and the organization has an incentive to keep its clients data safe and&#x2F;or secret. I trust my personal bank to keep my data safe from the mafia, but I also trust that it will hand over data to law enforcement if warranted. I doubt the NSA has a dashboard that can just look up my spending habits but maybe? I&#x27;m not really worried about their looking at my grocery bills, personally, more the effect of unlimited surveillance on society as a whole')
