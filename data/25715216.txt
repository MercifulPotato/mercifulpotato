I&#x27;m on Parler and there a lot of intelligent conversations there that give you the other side, which is so hard to get otherwise (which is why I joined). Yes, I&#x27;m sure there are some crazies there, but there are many, many more by numbers on Twitter. Please join Parler and judge for yourself, don&#x27;t trust the media narrative.')
