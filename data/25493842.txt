Apple investigating? give me a break! i used to work at a Dell repair depot. Dell contracted out to make repair for their stuffs. Dell pay the contractor shit and that in turn make their contractor pay their employees shit. i work in the IT dept of repair depot so my salary isn&#x27;t like the front line workers. believe me when i said company like Apple, Dell, HP...etc. use contractor like Wistron is because they can pay as little as possible and pocket in as much as they can.<p>Apple doesn&#x27;t care about the working people.')
