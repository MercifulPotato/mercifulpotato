There is usually a definitive answer, and if not then the trade-offs are generally well-known. It&#x27;s rare to run into a problem that requires complex technical knowledge, and in those cases it&#x27;s fine to hire a consultant to help.<p>I&#x27;m totally on board with highlighting the importance of communication, team work, people skills (and I&#x27;ve seen how awful it is to work with people who lack these skills despite their technical expertise), etc. but this statement I simply cannot agree with.<p>Everyone&#x27;s experience is obviously different. Some people may work on problems where there are few legitimate technical challenges, or where they aren&#x27;t solving any problems that haven&#x27;t been solved before. That hasn&#x27;t been my experience in most of the jobs I&#x27;ve had so far. There were significant architectural and sometimes even algorithmic challenges to be solved, and not solving them properly would mean either bugs or unmaintainable software.<p>ITT we talk about the importance of communication, but good coding patterns and architecture (as well as the right level of documentation) are part of communicating to other developers.')
