Most of our climate problems have come from humans disrupting this.<p>If you take any functioning healthy ecosystem on earth, one generally less tampered with by humans, you&#x27;ll find from a microscopic, right up to a macroscopic level, the life in those ecosystems have adapted to function together.<p>If you want to see some good examples of this, check out some terrarium channels on youtube, there&#x27;s some really cool, perfectly balanced ones people have had going for years.<p>The reason why we have so many ecological problems around the world is that humans have been constantly disrupting this. We introduce invasive species that dominate the landscape, cause extinctions and extirpations of native species and change the fundamental balance of the ecosystem.<p>You&#x27;re right, life does push through, but personally, I prefer the native songbirds and shrubs that are local to my area than a landscape full of Japanese knotweed and starlings.<p>And so do most things, that first example likely has at least a dozen species of songbirds, a bunch of shrubs and herbacious plants. That second example has two species, maybe some rats or crows if your lucky.<p>The thing is, ecosystems don&#x27;t stand alone, they&#x27;re all connected and the collapse of one leads to the collapse of the neighbouring ones and so forth.<p>If you actually look through the published literature.on various ecosystems around the world, we have a very shallow level of knowledge. We don&#x27;t understand fully the complex connections between everything and the research that does keep coming out keeps showing how much we&#x27;ve vastly underestimated how much our actions have impacted things.<p>Even things like the ecosystems in our own body&#x27;s. The microscopic organisms that have been found to even play a part in things such as our decision making and moods.<p>The human body itself functions as an ecosystem, all our body systems, our cells, our organs, all function independently and cohesively to make everything that is you.<p>The earth itself functions the same way. The ecosystems, and all life, including humans, are the cells and organs that make up all life on Earth.<p>Altering life at a fundamental genetic level goes even further than how we alter ecosystems.<p>Humans really don&#x27;t understand the potential consequences to changes we make to the genetic code. We have a vague idea, but we really are.delving mostly blind into this. If we barely understand how life works on a macroscopic level, what makes us think we&#x27;re ready to change it at an even lower level?')
