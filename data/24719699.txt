Item(by='eternalban', descendants=None, kids=[24719769], score=None, time=1602169286, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24719563, text='&gt; infections&#x2F;recovered<p>This is a false binary state space.<p>The implication here is that having &quot;tested positive&quot; is equivalent to having an &quot;infection&quot;. An infection, by definition, is <i>an alteration</i> of the biological state of the entity with observable side-effects (symptoms). It is patently false to assert that &quot;testing positive&quot; for this virus is 100% indicative of an &quot;infection&quot;.<p>Further, &quot;100M infections&#x2F;recovered&quot; implies that this infection can lead to &quot;recovered&quot; implying that the other alternative to recovere is a terminal&#x2F;chronic condition. I guess this makes sense if we agree that many millions of &quot;infected&quot; immediately &quot;recover&quot; after testing positive, given that a substantial subset of those who &quot;test positive&quot; are &quot;asymptomatic&quot;, reasonably understood as not-ill, not-sick, not-infected. Thus insta &quot;recovery&quot;.<p>My overall point here is that the permitted vocabulary of speaking and reasoning about this phenomena is inexplicably illiterate. Whether this permitted simplistic vocabulary of discourse is by design or a symptomatic of the state of humanity, the inevitable consequence is a degradation of analysis and sub-optimal solutions.')
