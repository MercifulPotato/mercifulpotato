Item(by='fouc', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611103532, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25840548, text='&gt; I&#x27;ve read some pieces some years back that indicate that when first world countries (for lack of a better term) go to third world countries and insist that kids aren&#x27;t allowed to work, they actively interfere with survival for individuals in that place who are expected to work and do not have a social safety net. When we show up and impose our &quot;high standards&quot; to make us feel morally superior, we do so from a very privileged perspective and don&#x27;t think about how that interacts with reality on the ground.<p>This is an excellent point!<p>It does seem a bit strange for apple to insist companies only use employees that are a minimum of 16 years old.')
