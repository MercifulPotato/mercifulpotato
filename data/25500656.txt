Item(by='dragontamer', descendants=None, kids=[25501225], score=None, time=1608591119, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25500272, text='&gt; For coins with a 75% bias, you can represent the possible outcomes by &quot;HHHT&quot;<p>Your method seems to lack rigor.<p>Lets take a fair D4 (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Four-sided_die" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Four-sided_die</a>), and define &quot;Heads&quot; as 1, 2, 3, and &#x27;Tails&quot; and 4. This gives us a perfectly biased 75% Heads coin.<p>The possibilities are:<p>* Heads: 75% of the time (123)<p>* Tails: 25% of the time (4)<p>--------<p>With two &quot;flips&quot; of this D4, we&#x27;ve got:<p>* HH -- 56.25% (11, 12, 13, 21, 22, 23, 31, 32, 33)<p>* HT -- 18.75% -- Von Neuman Heads (14, 24, 34)<p>* TH -- 18.75% -- Von Neuman Tails (41, 42, 43)<p>* TT -- 6.25% (44)<p>---------<p>The Von Neuman Method throws away the TT and HH possibilities, leaving an 18.75% chance of heads and an 18.75% chance of tails. The HH and TT require a &quot;reroll&quot;. Thus, we&#x27;ve removed the bias of the dice.<p>In any case, by giving every state an equal chance and a specific name (11, 12, 13...), we have a more rigorous count of the possibilities. I don&#x27;t know where your method went wrong... but clearly something is off.')
