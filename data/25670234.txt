Aren&#x27;t those seperate sectors?<p>In the case of Washington, DC they are not. The mayor has a normal municipal police force and the president has control over the equivalent of the state-level force, which would usually be called for such an incident. The Capitol specifically also has another force, independent from the municipal police, which is federally controlled.<p>There are numerous reports Trump <i>explicitly refused</i> to allow the National Guard to respond; governors of two adjacent states mobilized their state forces instead, and eventually <i>Pence</i> also mobilized the DC guard, which it&#x27;s not really clear he had the authority to do (or if he does, also the authority to issue orders contravening Trump&#x27;s refusal).')
