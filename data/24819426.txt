I feel relatively informed but no longer feel as depressed as when I would check the front page of news sites every hour.<p>The other plus side to this is that the whiplash of rapidly developing news is never an issue. Previously the news headlines would speculate on new developments so frequently that you felt like you were always behind on what was current, but truthfully most news can wait 24 hours (and if it can&#x27;t it&#x27;s probably an emergency).')
