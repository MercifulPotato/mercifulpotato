Maybe because the dark background is too light? Or maybe the typeface? I can&#x27;t read each list with focus, because the next or previous list is grabbing my attention too. Let&#x27;s say I read list number 2 title, my eyes simply jump up and down reading number 1 and 3. Have you consider to darken the background?<p>Anyway, nice design!')
