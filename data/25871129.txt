I have a bit of mechanical experience with all the work that comes with those. Of course electric vehicles will be the next big thing.<p>I definitely would not work at a dealer or chain. Being part of a small company or your own would be great. Not moving up wouldn&#x27;t be a big deal in that kind of role.<p>On a side note, I&#x27;m confused why everyone is obsessed with moving up. Can&#x27;t people just be happy where they are? I really don&#x27;t see much difference in my company between the various levels, nor is it a very big promotion at 7%.')
