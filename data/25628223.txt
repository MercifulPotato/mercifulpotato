Sure, you learn it in school. Computer Science School. Not everyone is a computer scientist. Some people are political scientists, environmental scientists, mathematicians, statisticians, etc., all of whom have their own difficult four years of schooling, and simply don&#x27;t have the time to learn this complicated syntax without trading something else off. You don&#x27;t think its a big deal since you&#x27;ve already paid that price of time. Well, not everyone can afford to pay that time, and it&#x27;s a damn shame that in order to make full use of all a computer can do, you need to spend this time learning this sometimes remarkably clunky syntax before you can even begin to work on your real life problem. Imagine how much more technological and societal progress we would make if everyone could make computational models about their question at hand without having to spend years and thousands of dollars working with unrelated example data in undergrad, sometimes even using instructional languages that have no use outside of school. To me, that&#x27;s the world that <i>The Jetson&#x27;s</i> live in.')
