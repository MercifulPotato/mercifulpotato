Half of my most recent searches have been picked apart by Google, showing results for what I <i>didn’t</i> type and expecting me to click a small link to fix it.  And, instead of “ending” when there are no more relevant results, they’re including “similar” results as if they match, and seemingly intermixed with exact matches. That breaks search, and it’s getting harder and harder to rely on.')
