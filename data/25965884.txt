It&#x27;s clear that you&#x27;re still fighting the host environment at the end of the day, and that anything that provides a Linux-like interface is going to suffer from both Windows&#x27; lackluster performance <i>and</i> the overhead of virtualization&#x2F;translation&#x2F;emulation&#x2F;whatever approach your layer-of-choice uses. Is it familiarity, presence of other (non-development) applications, or something else?<p>Edit: I should say that I haven&#x27;t <i>used</i> Windows since 2012 or so, but I have developed for it (mostly drivers and filesystem work) since then by running VMs. Ironically, my best experience developing for Windows has been entirely on Linux and macOS.')
