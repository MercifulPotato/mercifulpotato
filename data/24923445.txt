Savage says, collectivism and autonomy are not mutually exclusive. I&#x27;m not sure most Americans know that though. If Americans self identify as individualists and believe that means being anti-collectivism then isn&#x27;t individualism, or at least the ideas of individualist thinkers, partly to blame for our cultural bias against collectivism? Maybe I should&#x27;ve said it&#x27;s America&#x27;s culture of toxic individualism rather than run of the mill individualism.')
