HaveIBeenPwned unfortunately doesn&#x27;t show if just your email or your email as well as address has been leaked, so I decided to set this up. I wish Ledger would just set this up for their customers, but apparently that is far too difficult for them. So here you all go, I wish you the best :&#x2F;<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.didledgerfuck.me&#x2F;')
