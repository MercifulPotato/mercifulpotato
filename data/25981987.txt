There&#x27;s no end-cycle in progress so many of the decommissioned turbine blades are moved to the landfill. I bet there&#x27;s something incredibly strong and lightweight materials can be used for but so far many are trash.<p>We used to burn wood and mine for coal, then drilled for oil, then fracking for gas, and now mining lithium. The environmental problems are still there but the consumer side sounds &quot;greener&quot; with each iteration. Personally, I find the idea of replacing all cars with electric cars to be backwards. Why when you can use this as a turning point to reduce dependence on personal vehicles and pursue alternatives?')
