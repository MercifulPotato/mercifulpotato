The FF created a system of government that acts as a society consciousness. Allowing for passion (the House) but having frontal lobe mechanisms (the Senate guards against the mob mentality).<p>The recent insurrection happened specifically because of the laziness&#x2F;apathy&#x2F;intentional (take your pick, I&#x27;m certain one is true) of the Congress. It was their job to protect DC and with a rally on the same day nonetheless, yet the law enforcement was gravely lacking. Also the DC mayor and even the POTUS, yet none took the responsibility.<p>As for Parler, they acted like little children. Whining and not doing much. They attack a hornet&#x27;s nest then cry when they get stung. They should&#x27;ve been prepared instead of telling Tucker Carlson&#x27;s audience their entire system of weaknesses.<p>Peter Kolmisoppi, one of The Pirate Bay co-founders, criticized their behavior as well [1]. (Not being prepared, whining, etc)<p>Society is starkly divided between the rural and urban elites. There will always be bad eggs. BLM&#x2F;Qanon are equally screwed up. But the kicker is two major things. We need better discourse and more civic engagement. No change will happen without our engagement (for either side).<p>Ultimately, I welcome the fourth turning.<p>[1] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;brokep&#x2F;status&#x2F;1348224123592437760" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;brokep&#x2F;status&#x2F;1348224123592437760</a>')
