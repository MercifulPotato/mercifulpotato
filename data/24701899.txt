Seems like the monopolistic largesse outweighs the competition factor, at least for tech work.<p>The economics are different in other ways too: a big company hires someone who’s good at CS fundamentals and gives them time to learn whatever stack, while a small one needs someone with experience in exactly the right version of a framework. A big company can hire people for long term R&amp;D while a small one needs features right now.<p>It may be best for the economy that the spoils of monopoly be redistributed, but we are partly the beneficiaries of them.')
