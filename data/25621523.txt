Only recently became unhappy with it, when they decided to make that move. Note also, that it was a silent move for the casual OSM visitor. There was no big sign saying: &quot;Hey, we switched to fastly! This means your requests will go through their servers. Just wanted to give you a heads up for you privacy conscious people.&quot; No justification, no asking for donations for running their own instead. I&#x27;ve supported multiple other projects, which I feel are important for the public and would have considered it for OSM to stay at OSM and not outsource stuff to fastly.<p>Now I cannot, with a clean conscience, recommend it to people any longer. What will my answer be to anyone, who asks me: &quot;Well, if you are not using Google maps, what map service are _you_ using?&quot; Now I cannot answer OSM, because then it will be: &quot;But they are also allowing big companies to track their users! You are a hypocrite!&quot;<p>Basically I need something better now, in order to stay consistent and not become a hypocrite. Perhaps I will use my months ago updated maps.me on my phone instead. However, with maps.me issues of late, I will need to switch that eventually as well.<p>Remember: Ignorants and uninformed people are not to be optimized for, if we want any quality standards to survive on the WWW. To keep standards, one cannot always go for the lowest common denominator.')
