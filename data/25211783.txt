Why require customers to file a claim for what are obvious outages? Instead, AWS should automatically apply credits to those accounts that have paid for guaranteed uptime without requiring this whole silly claims process.<p>The mechanism can be really simple. If AWS themselves posts an outage to their status page and&#x2F;or some third-party service posts an outage then credits are immediately applied to the services where there are outages for those that paid for high level uptime guarantees without requiring any claims process. It can easily be done if they want to do it that way.<p>Of course from a <i>business</i> perspective I understand why they&#x27;re doing it the way that they are. If they can make customers jump through hoops, then only those who really care will follow through. Meanwhile the uptime guarantee can continue as an empty promise.')
