Separation between church and state (and wealth and mass media and journalism and politics)<p>Civil marriage and some wills should be replaced with a property and next of kin registered document. This way, any number and type of people can formally-declare what they want to do with property and health, financial, and total power of attorney. Insurance companies and other service products can then determine who is eligible to share benefits based on if someone is listed as a partner or beneficiary, or not. No more titles, relations, or mandates about who is what or how into two boxes: just beneficiaries and partners.<p>A couple have a kid? No problem.<p>Two women want to get hitched? Easy.<p>Three dudes want to live polyamorously and be &quot;married?&quot; Cool. (Obviously, can&#x27;t let 30 people in a commune share the benefits of one worker.)<p>A dude and a trans girl? Fine.<p>The same document solves some problems of inheritance too when it can obviate the need for executors in simple estates.<p>Telling people who they can love, share their lives with, and depend on goes against individual freedoms.')
