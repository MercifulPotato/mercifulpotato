Item(by='AnthonyMouse', descendants=None, kids=[25175860], score=None, time=1606009369, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25173282, text='But now you&#x27;re making a statement which is too general.<p>There is no benefit to discouraging use of highways at night, or uncongested suburban&#x2F;rural roads. The  thing you really want to prevent is congestion.<p>And even that is not inherently best solved through punitive fees. If you can reduce congestion by e.g. building more housing near where people work so they don&#x27;t have to commute as far, that&#x27;s preferable to levying fees the drivers can&#x27;t avoid because a viable alternative to a long commute isn&#x27;t actually available.<p>Sometimes turning a four lane road into a six lane road really does resolve the congestion, even accounting for the increase in use that comes from the reduction in congestion. And then you don&#x27;t gain anything by discouraging use there.<p>The number of cases where you <i>actually</i> want to discourage use is very small, to the point that they may not even really exist, given that most uses are productive (and already have to overcome the inherent cost in fuel and time). The best case for it would be something like Manhattan during rush hour, but even there you might be better off to use the carrot instead of the stick and e.g. stop charging fees for use of the subway.')
