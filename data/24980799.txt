So you need to pin to a git commit hash which is much easier to get wrong and also easier to abuse for social engineering. And that&#x27;s assuming you trust git commit hashes, if not you need to fork actions just to make sure the public code you reviewed doesn&#x27;t get changed without new reviewes .')
