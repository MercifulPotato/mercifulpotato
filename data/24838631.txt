Generally what&#x27;s an up and down depends on the person as well e.g. some consider being on the browser with the tiny usage share and hitting compatibility issues a good thing (&quot;it helps the web&quot;) and others consider it bad (&quot;I just want it to work&quot;). Same thing with performance, performs how well for which sites in which use case on which system. In general, with the exception of &quot;the browser doesn&#x27;t have hardware acceleration for the platform I use&quot;, performance is probably imperceptibly different for &gt;95% of users but each tail will be very adamant that their tail is the better performing one (and it may be for their use case).<p>For me personally the biggest current difference remains HDR support, which FF lacks and Safari&#x2F;Chrome are continuing to grow. FF still has a big ways to go to achieve HDR so I think this one will be around for a while unfortunately. Now of course many are going to think &quot;I don&#x27;t give a shit about HDR&quot; in which case refer to the first paragraph.<p>The biggest difference that finally got fixed was for the longest time Chrome had much higher quality pitch correction on sped up content e.g. YouTube 2x. It was noticeably worse at 2x and I couldn&#x27;t even understand the content at 3x on Firefox but it sounded great in Chrome. This forced a lot of my usage over to Chrome until it was fixed.<p>On the Chrome side the biggest drawbacks are lack of extensions on mobile and lack of containers. I don&#x27;t use containers as a privacy tool but more as a multiple profile tool without having to worry about which profile a window was launched in but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s the main real world use case happening. Lack of extensions on mobile is obvious.')
