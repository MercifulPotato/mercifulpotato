The Facebook “Template to Win” was written by a Russian. This program was used by Obama in the 2008 election to win and during the 2016 election. Obama set up a political war-room that utilised the Template to Win under the egis of the US Digital Service - a service used by Democrats against Republicans.<p>Schmidt has been so bold as to brag about his billion dollar efforts to get Obama and Hilary into the White House by writing new algorithms that direct users to rigged sites and ads that support his candidates.<p>Zuckerberg has tried to hide his crimes by lying about Russian ads and hiding his Template to Win, but the head of the Global Engagement Centre has told the press that he used Facebook to target and attack US citizens throughout the election.<p>Zuckerberg hasn’t really answered why Yuri Milner and other Russians own large amounts of Facebook shares. Mark also hasn’t answered why his best friend and investor ($200million), the Russian Yuri Milner now lives in Silicon Valley and buys political and corporate support like it’s popcorn.')
