Item(by='WarOnPrivacy', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602293956, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24733881, text='&gt;Reuters doesn&#x27;t &#x27;accept&#x27; the allegations, it&#x27;s merely reporting on them:<p>What does that even mean? They clearly accepted the allegations into their reporting. You can evidence this for yourself by reading the article.<p>Legislatures are not independent bodies; 5-eyes member legislatures in particular.  They are self-interested, self-serving, political entities with long histories of deceiving the public - especially regarding matters spun as national security - in order to advance their own interests.<p>This self-serving body, Parliament, self-published their allegations. Their message was readily available to the public. Zero news orgs were required to complete that task.<p>That done, Reuters opted to insert itself into the process, to the end of amplifying UK Govs&#x27; narrative. Assuming Reuters has at least minimal competency, they are painflly aware that MPs frequently lie and mislead the public about national security matters - often by parroting carefully crafted IC&#x2F;LEO messages.<p>Given the source&#x27;s nearly unbroken history of lying and misleading the public, choosing to &quot;merely report&quot; without any effort to protect the public from a high likelyhood of false information doesn&#x27;t even rise to the level of neglect.<p>Willful collusion might be a better description - which, btw, is the same misdeed that Parliament is accusing Huawei of.')
