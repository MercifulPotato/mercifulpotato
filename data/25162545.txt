Item(by='kilburn', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605892709, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25160168, text='&gt; What I particularly like about Typescript is that I can use as much or as little of it as I deem necessary. E.g. I start off a prototype using the `any` type a lot, and only in future iterations, I start tightening the definitions as the requirements for the project become clearer. So far the overhead has been quite minimal.<p>I started working this way and it was fine, that&#x27;s how I always worked anyway. Then I started leaning towards working the types first and the code later, and I&#x27;ve found it works better and better for me.<p>Much of today&#x27;s programming is &quot;stitching pieces together&quot;: pieces from the libraries you are using, from external services you use, from your platform&#x27;s APIs, and then creating the few extra pieces that are unique to your puzzle.<p>When you code first, you are directly painting pieces while trying to picture how the final puzzle will look like in your head.<p>When you type first, you are just cutting the shapes of the missing pieces and already assembling the puzzle. Once this is done, you are left with a full picture that has some blank spots, and it becomes much easier to just paint those in.')
