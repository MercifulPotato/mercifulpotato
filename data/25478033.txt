We&#x27;ve grown beyond storing a bunch of texts files in a SVN respository, every major source control system also has a way to document your project.<p>If you choose to keep your documentation inside of your source control, the rise of Markdown viewers that support navigating links can help you achieve the same benefits by just linking to docs&#x2F;project-overview.md in the top of your README.')
