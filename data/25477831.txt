We did a roadtrip with an old car and a tent just after college, 3 weeks, 8000km, 11 countries. Beyond amazing there’s so much to see that you don’t get by plane.<p>USA is huge by comparison. Did a long roadtrip a few years ago, 3300km, and we barely made it from SF to the Grand Canyon and back.<p>Trains and roadtrips beat planes when you wanna see the country.<p>One day I wanna do all of USA on my motorcycle. That would be grand.')
