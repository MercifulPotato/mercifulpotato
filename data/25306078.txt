However:<p>- either &quot;allegory&quot; is meant to be a very strict one-to-one map, like Gandalf is really Jesus but has a different name in this story. Then the quote is irrelevant to almost discussion because nobody is trying to make such a point.<p>- or &quot;allegory&#x27; is meant to be some loose inspiration, like the War of the Ring drawing from Tolkien&#x27;s experiences in the Great War, the role of providence being similar in Catholic theology &amp; in the legendarium, or more controversially the description of evil men or women being a product of its times. If such is the meaning of allegory, and Tolkien denied using it, then he is wrong.<p>I think Tolkien meant meaning 1. In either case it is irrelevant to most claims of some connection between a real word thing and a legendarium thing.')
