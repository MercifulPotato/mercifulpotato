The team took advantage of similarly extraordinary conditions and pulled it off with incredible style in a dory.<p>Interwoven with that story are the stories of the commercial river trips that got caught in the perilous conditions and the struggle to save Glen Canyon Dam from catastrophic failure.<p>Edited to add: I don&#x27;t want to oversell this or anything, but I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s on my list of candidates for greatest story ever told with the likes of Miracle in the Andes and Touching the Void.')
