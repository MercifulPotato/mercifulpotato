Is the actual act of typing really a significant amount of your time? What about time spent reading and debugging code, which actively benefit from clear error tracing? If typing really is a significant part of your time, how would you feel if your editor autofilled `if err != nil { return err }` for you? What if the language added a `try` operator a la Rust (e.g., whenever you type `?`, it expands into `if err != nil { return err }` code behind the scenes)?')
