I think I have grown to be quite understanding to why one would favour one or the other programming language over time, can see why some favour Haskell, some Java, some C, some TCL, some Python.<p>For Go I guess I can comprehend the statements of praise by Go-users, but I have a hard time with really understanding it. I fail to see the appeal.<p>This comment is not meant as an offense to Go-lovers out there, to the contrary, pick the languages and stacks you like. Its more about myself; me wondering at my own lack of understanding.')
