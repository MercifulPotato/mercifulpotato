Not only has this never been the case, it is also strictly impossible to report news with zero bias, because the world is a messy place with a lot of concurrent things happening and media has to weave a mostly linear story from that. There&#x27;s no algorithmic way to do that.<p>Imagine a large protest. Most people protest peacefully. A small group of protestors riot. The police are there too. Mostly they just watch, but some of them engage with protestors who they suspect of rioting, and some of those cops use arguably excessive violence.<p>You&#x27;re making the TV news bulletin, you have footage of all of these sub-events. You have to decide how much time to allocate to each of the sub-events. You have a big responsibility, because the amount of attention you pay to each of them may influence public opinion. Do you focus on the peaceful protest? Or on the rioting? Or on the police violence? What&#x27;s the &quot;objectively&quot; right amount of time to spend on each of these sub-events?')
