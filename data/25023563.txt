RSA encryption standards are hard to implement correctly. Frequently they contain padding oracles. There are safe ways to do RSA people don&#x27;t do in standards.<p>ECC eschews all that complexity. Writing a safe ECC implementation especially for Edwards or Montgomery curves is pretty simple.<p>PGP is mortebund and has a lot of cruft.<p>RSA does some things that are really cool like accumulators, Pallier, etc. But if you are doing them you are doing black magic.')
