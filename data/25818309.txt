Nobody ever “owes” me a beer. If I buy them one that’s the end of it. We are always “even”.<p>I am the same, with the addition that if someone says something like &quot;your shout I think?&quot; they might be having trouble so I will usually go along with it. Better to potentially help a friend in need than be petty.<p>It goes along with a mindset that I have always had, which is that it shows more strength to give than it does to take. I think most decent people have that internalized in various ways.')
