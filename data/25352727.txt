The fundamental issue isn&#x27;t power law distributions either, it&#x27;s the fact that £200 won&#x27;t even pay for a new guitar.<p>It&#x27;s not hard to imagine that the distribution of earnings in other fields is lopsided too, but even average-earning teachers, corporate lawyers and secretaries make a wage they can get by on. Music as a whole might just undervalued.<p>Music is also very unequal. I haven&#x27;t heard of teachers earning less than £200 a year, nor of teachers earning as much as say, Taylor Swift. The parameters of these two earning distributions are widely different.<p>It&#x27;s interesting, since Music is and has always been very valuable in every culture since time immemorial. Is it undervalued because the post-industral world just tends to undervalue creative work in general? Is it not really that undervalued, and we just get that impression because such as small part of the industry captures such an insane percentage of profits? Could be both to be honest.')
