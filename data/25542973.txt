There&#x27;s never going to be a situation where you can address every potential source of slowdowns, and make everything 100% efficient all of the time. Given that, in any somewhat realistic environment, you&#x27;re going to need to prioritize where to spend your focus on making things more efficient.<p>It&#x27;s certainly possible that the answer is that the language you&#x27;re using is fundamentally too slow - I personally have almost never experienced that - almost always I can get more out of a time investment by focusing on improving DB performance, or some problem with delivery, caching or optimizing bundles.<p>You should look at your personal situation and use real data to decide where to focus, but you always have to focus. &quot;Make everything 100% efficient at all times&quot; is completely unrealistic.')
