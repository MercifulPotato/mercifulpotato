But it was just a hobby server for a group of friends to use and we&#x27;ve given up since.<p>I just remember being forced to install docker and edit a docker-compose.yml, and then configs would show up in other parts of the system that were not the directory I was in.<p>Then finally I got the server and people could join but they couldn&#x27;t see the others.
