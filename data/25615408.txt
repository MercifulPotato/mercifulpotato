I created a script that takes in a Seek TIFF and outputs an 8-bit greyscale integer TIFF:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;dheera&#x2F;iceland-thermal&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;scripts&#x2F;seek2gray" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;dheera&#x2F;iceland-thermal&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;script...</a><p>I then panoramically stitched those 8-bit TIFFs together (some with the help of hugin, and some manually with GIMP) and distortion-corrected them as best as I could to a black-and-white visible light image. I also created an artistically-chosen color map for each image. For the final output image, hue and saturation are fully based on thermal data, and lightness is a combination of thermal and visible data. Scripts to generate the final output images, along with the panoramically pre-stitched data, and the color maps I used:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;dheera&#x2F;iceland-thermal" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;dheera&#x2F;iceland-thermal</a><p>Also, my Instagram, which is mostly astrophotography of late, but I did post thermal images there before and I may do so in the future again if I can find another good set of interesting thermal subjects to do this in!<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;instagram.com&#x2F;dheeranet&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;instagram.com&#x2F;dheeranet&#x2F;</a>')
