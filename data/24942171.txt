For example<p>Policy proposal:<p>Maximize the amount of people that can see a given post &#x2F; news article. People would have to resubmit in substantially their own words any information they glean that should be passed on beyond that limit. E.g. someone posts a news article that reaches 10,000 people. The 10,001st gets an error saying it has already reached maximum views.<p>One of the initial 10,000 couldnâ€™t just copy paste what they saw, but would have to generate unique content to reinitiate an information node that would also have a 10,000 view maximum.<p>This would not be great for national news sites, but it would reinvigorate local news, because that would be the only way for the information to spread.<p>Decentralization is key.')
