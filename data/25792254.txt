Servo is new, which is where Mozilla are picking their changes to Gecko&#x2F;Quantum from. These false blanket statements aren&#x27;t convincing me to use Vivaldi at all. Sure it has it&#x27;s fair share of issues, but it &quot;works&quot; to a degree and maybe it&#x27;ll chug along enough to finally be used by 2022.<p>Currently I&#x27;m using Ungoogled Chromium [1] on Windows and Bromite [2] on Android, but the latter will eventually be replaced with the former when I end up building Ungoogled Chromium TriChrome (it&#x27;s a build mechanism for Android 10 and above to have a shared library package, as well as a WebView and browser package separately for Android).<p>Ungoogled Chromium is great because it accomplishes all that Vivaldi does, except syncing, all the while keeping the nice UI of Chrome. I&#x27;m not a fan of syncing, so that doesn&#x27;t matter to me.<p>I used to use Firefox on desktop (prior to and after the Quantum update) but WebGPU was just way to slow for me and I switched to a Chromium-based application.<p>[1] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Eloston&#x2F;ungoogled-chromium" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Eloston&#x2F;ungoogled-chromium</a><p>[2] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bromite.org" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bromite.org</a>')
