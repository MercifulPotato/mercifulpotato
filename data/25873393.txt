They simply provide a spec to conform to. ISA&#x27;s say little to nothing about the hardware implementation itself. That&#x27;s the real value and something that every firm that has CPU IP guards.<p>And sadly China isn&#x27;t lacking in stolen valuable CPU IP. The Chinese branch of ARM went rogue last year. I think its a safe assumption that any sensitive information they may have had is no in the hands of the CCP and will be used to its full potential.')
