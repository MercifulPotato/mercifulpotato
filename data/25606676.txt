When you put plusses in Google Search those are actually pre-percent encoded spaces, which is why it treats them as spaces. Of course, if you chuck it into a percent encoding script <i>again</i> it treats them as literal spaces since presumably the input isn&#x27;t already percent encoded (just as it&#x27;d encode the % in other encoded characters).<p>At least that&#x27;s if I recall correctly and it wouldn&#x27;t surprise me if other servers do handle things in zany ways.')
