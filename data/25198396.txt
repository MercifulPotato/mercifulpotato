Item(by='bmelton', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606225977, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25196348, text='A few years back, we had a snowstorm that knocked out power for 7 days. Knocking out power for 7 days meant our electric well pump didn&#x27;t work. Our electric well pump not working meant that we didn&#x27;t have water. We were snowed in with about 6 feet of snow, so roads weren&#x27;t passable, so I couldn&#x27;t go and get water, or food, or charcoal to cook the food with.<p>My neighbor had supplies and was generous enough to share them with me. While we wouldn&#x27;t obviously wouldn&#x27;t have died without access to the rest of the world for 3 or four days, it would have been <i>very</i> uncomfortable to endure without any food or water, and that&#x27;s relative to the discomfort we already had without heat, wherein we literally spent large swaths of the day under every blanket we had, huddled together for heat we also didn&#x27;t have without electricity.<p>The next house I bought had a fireplace. We stock wood to be prepared for the unlikely catastrophe of having to endure prolonged absence of electricity.<p>We put fire-specific extinguishers in our kitchen, our garage, and our basement to protect against the unlikely catastrophe of fire.<p>We keep 10 gallons of water in the basement to protect against the unlikely catastrophe of losing electricity, and the usage of our well pump.<p>We keep first aid kits with bandages and neosporin in the bathrooms of our house to protect against knife cuts, or puncture wounds, or glass breaks that draw blood.<p>We keep a few days worth of canned goods to protect against food shortage.<p>We keep charcoal to protect against the inability to use our stove, and I have fire-making equipment (ferro rods, a high carbon knife, flints, emergency matches, birthday candles, charcloth) for use while camping or backpacking, but I always maintain an abundance -- just in case.<p>Many people do much of the above: Almost everyone has a fire extinguisher, or a first aid kit, some canned goods. The government recommends these things, in fact, and there&#x27;s a run on things like these (and generators, and foodstuffs) before every natural emergency. Many people also maintain gardens for sustainability.<p>Whether or not those things make people &quot;feel safe&quot; is not even in the same category, but I&#x27;d argue that it makes many people feel safe to know that they have their own food and water and heat should the system demand it. You&#x27;re arbitrarily drawing a line at guns and shaming people for wanting to protect against unlikely catastrophes it may defend against.')
