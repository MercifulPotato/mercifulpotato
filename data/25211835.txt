That is just a very small part of how the far left are trying to stop freedom of speech.  How many in-person talks at universities have been shut down in the past 4 years?  When people disagree, they call whoever it is a Nazi and get it cancelled.<p>Today if you post something that is pro-gun, or god-forbid, you support one of Trump&#x27;s foreign policies publicly, your account on Twitter or IG will get attacked and shut down.  Most informational gun accounts on youtube won&#x27;t show up in searches anymore.  I&#x27;m not even talking about the tacticool losers posting dangerous videos.  These are the people trying to educate others on usage and safety. Because a small part of the country abhor guns, but they also happen to control Youtube, Twitter, Instagram, they shadow-ban and move along with their day.<p>If flagging false information was the primary usage of censorship, there wouldn&#x27;t be so much uproar around it.')
