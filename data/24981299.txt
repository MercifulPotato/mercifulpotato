I could be mistaken on this, however, the resume template used by your service (&quot;The Rezi Format&quot;) appears to be generated with LaTeX using the moderncv package banking template. Do you allow your users to download the tex source code after using this service?<p>2. If your service does use LaTeX behind the scenes, where was the original tex source code for &quot;The Rezi Format&quot; template acquired?<p>3. A resume will typically contain a lot of high value user data. What steps does your service take to keep this data secure from you, your employees, or any future buyers?<p>Thanks for taking the time to answer these questions.')
