You publicly disclose how your invention works, and in return you get a limited monopoly on its production.<p>You donâ€™t need a patent system to incentivize research, people and companies can just treat new inventions as trade secrets and never tell anyone how they work. Plenty of tech companies already do this. Google has not filed patents disclosing exactly how their search system works, for example.<p>The U.S. military has an additional tool to protect knowledge: classification. Again, there is no patent on public file for a functioning hydrogen fusion bomb.<p>So why would the Navy file a patent on something? It is plausible that their goal in doing so was to disclose its existence.')
