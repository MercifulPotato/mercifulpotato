Her <i>peers</i> (which is more how I would generally define &quot;coworker&quot;) appear to be backing her in this conflict, and blaming management as well.<p>A number of posters (mostly using throwaway accounts) are interpreting this as a group of fair and reasonable managers being beset by the most toxic team that ever toxied in the history of toxicity. I submit that the facts in evidence permit the opposite hypothesis: That it is Google that has difficulties living up to ethical standards of conduct, and that it is the management of the ethical AI team that is not living up to their professional responsibilities.<p>For all the posturing about Social Justice Warriors run amok, the idea that Google has some &#x27;splaining to do about its conduct is not exactly confined to left wing circles, as evidenced e.g. by yesterday&#x27;s lawsuit filed by Texas et al. And I suspect it&#x27;s exactly this increased scrutiny that is leading to these ham-handed and probably counterproductive attempts to first hire &quot;ethical AI&quot; teams and then try to silence their output.')
