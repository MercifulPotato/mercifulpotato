If you have curl in a container but your app only uses it during the startup process, the fact that it has an issue with, say, FTP almost certainly has no effect on you. OTOH, if youâ€™re using something like libjpeg your Go code needs to be recompiled either way and you might have to manually backport a patch just like a Linux distribution will.')
