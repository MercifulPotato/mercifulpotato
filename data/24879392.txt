The real vector space defined over the rationals is infinite-dimensional; it can&#x27;t have a finite basis. I think any basis of R over Q would have to be not only infinite, but uncountably so.<p>Do you mean that any given vector of the space can be represented using a linear combination of a finite <i>subset</i> of the basis elements with rational scalar coefficients?')
