Item(by='908B64B197', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607720830, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25390633, text='&gt; There are people in FAANG the dont even have any post secondary making &gt; 500k a year as &quot;Software Engineers&quot;. How this works without total chaos is that each company has a rigorous testing procedure for candidates.<p>That&#x27;s what I expect from a credible credentialing organization, to be able to tell me that person X meets a minimum bar. Right now they get a bad press because, especially in the medical field, it&#x27;s more about gate keeping and lobbying than actually enforcing standards and protecting the public.<p>I would argue that surely someone making that type of money at a world class organization like Google would have no problem passing any engineering exam.')
