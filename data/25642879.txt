I was on about the money because I thought it was the most tangible outcome. The way I see it the general population has a 0.0006&#x2F;day chance of catching the virus, so you have to take that into account. Assuming you are in the half of the population that believes in the virus and wants a vaccine, the rate is probably half that because you are thaking even the smallest common sense precautions. If we use 0.0003&#x2F;day, the 0.2% death rate, and a 50 day delay of treatment, I get that this Waco individual may have indirectly led to 0.01% of a human death, which I think is still very much an overestimate.<p>On an intellectual level, the weird part I react to is that we donâ€™t have a criminal justice system set up to punish probabilistic future harms from actions. What does it mean to have potentially killed 1% of a person someday?<p>On an emotional level, the weird part for me is how quickly people on each side of this are to dehumanize others and seek harsh and violent retribution. People have become so agitated, worn down, and stayed that way for so long, I think they have lost a lot of perspective, and for lack of a better word, touch with reality.<p>People who pull guns on others when asked to wear masks, and people who believe individuals should be imprisoned for meeting a consenting lover or friend indoors.
