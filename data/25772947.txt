It&#x27;s not cruel or anything, but there are some pretty easy changes to it that could have made it an explanation instead of an argument.<p>As for the original point: I suspect every developer has encountered a bug in their code that couldn&#x27;t possibly be caused by something, but ultimately was. Getting all the information requested up front in a regularly structured way, even when we think it&#x27;s irrelevant, can make tracking these problems much easier.')
