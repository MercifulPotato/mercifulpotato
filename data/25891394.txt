There doesn&#x27;t seem to be a real &quot;right way&quot; to manage dependencies, and getting a project running seems to often start with figuring out how the author decided to encapsulate or virtualize the environment their project is running in, since changing your system python for one project can break another.<p>I know it&#x27;s an older language, so many lessons have been learned, but after working with Rust, or even NPM it seems amazing that developers tolerate this situation.')
