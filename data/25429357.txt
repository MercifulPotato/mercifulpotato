Java already has private and public as modifiers. The only meaningful difference is that interfaces prevent you from using private. That&#x27;s such a shallow benefit. If you have the discipline to create interfaces you also have the discipline to use the right modifiers. The reality is that all those interfaces will just mirror the class and cause extra friction even though polymorphism is never needed.')
