Truth is most recipe book writers haven&#x27;t actually done the prep work from zero from their recipes and are basically just guessing.<p>It&#x27;s the same with the these TV shows where they cook a meal in 20 minutes. If you walk into a kitchen where an assistant has line up all the ingredients pre measured and prepped in separate bowels, pre-heated two ovens and all the pans they know you&#x27;ll need, and made sure there are two large pots of boiling water already on the stoves then prehaps you can make the meal in 20 minutes on your 3rd or 4th try.  Otherwise there is no chance.')
