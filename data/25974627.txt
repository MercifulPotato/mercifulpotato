People who grew up with the internet are only now coming into positions of power. A majority of American Internet users grew up in a very different era, and their experiences and expectations may not be reasonable in the current era. Furthermore they have been passing an understanding of media from the 70â€™s onto future generations.\nI suspect that it will take quite a lot of time for society at large to adjust.<p>For example, many kids are taught in school that Wikipedia is not reliable since anyone can edit it, whereas corporate publications are more trustworthy since they are written by experts whose reputation is at stake. Wikipedia is not always reliable but it is verifiable&#x2F;auditable and this is a criteria of trustworthiness that is not widely appreciated for digital literacy.')
