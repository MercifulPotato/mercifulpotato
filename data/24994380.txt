Huge loss and I hope they get the site back eventually.<p>I did find one article I was looking for on the Internet Archive if anyone is interested, although the above is a much better link on just the legalization aspect (this one is mostly about one of the illegal drug trafficers affected).  I think BB had another article on the legalization but I can&#x27;t find a link to that one.  As one might expect, the comments on BB tend to be more extreme than many sites in various ways.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20200811192412&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.borderlandbeat.com&#x2F;2017&#x2F;09&#x2F;lola-la-chata-grandmother-of-mexican.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20200811192412&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.border...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20190801143825&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.borderlandbeat.com&#x2F;2017&#x2F;10&#x2F;lola-la-chata-grandmother-of-mexican.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20190801143825&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.border...</a>')
