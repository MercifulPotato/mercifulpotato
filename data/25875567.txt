You suggest grouping by population density, which certainly makes sense for grouping together certain political interests (like zoning). And yet by doing that, you&#x27;ve essentially maximally fragmented people by gender, which is another attribute that makes sense for grouping together certain political interests.<p>That&#x27;s an extreme example of course, and I&#x27;m not suggesting to instead create single-gender districts, but I hope it illustrates my point.')
